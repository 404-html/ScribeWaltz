<v Speaker 1>I was speaking with Jonathan Patios this morning cause he's staying in the same</v>

2
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.420
<v Speaker 1>airbnb is my wife and I,</v>

3
00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:18.421
<v Speaker 1>and he suggested that I talk to you about my experiences with media over the</v>

4
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.201
<v Speaker 1>last year.</v>

5
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:20.621
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

6
00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>well that's a,</v>

7
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:23.800
<v Speaker 1>that's something I know about.</v>

8
00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:27.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's always good when you're talking to people to talk to some talk about</v>

9
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:28.840
<v Speaker 1>something that you know about.</v>

10
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a really good tip for public speaking,</v>

11
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:32.141
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:32.974
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

13
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.120
<v Speaker 1>well it's really true.</v>

14
00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 1>You have to remember that you should know about three times as much about the</v>

15
00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:38.284
<v Speaker 1>topic as,</v>

16
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>as you need to talk about the topic and then you have places you can go and you</v>

17
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:43.181
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

18
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:46.330
<v Speaker 1>you can wander round a little bit and be a little spontaneous.</v>

19
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's really useful.</v>

20
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.700
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

21
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.840
<v Speaker 1>but then I also thought that makes sense because nobody knows anything about the</v>

22
00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Speaker 1>situation with regards to the media now.</v>

23
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>And so we're all feeling our way.</v>

24
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And so because the technological transformations are so rapid and you know</v>

25
00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.720
<v Speaker 1>they're going to come one after the other in the next 10 years,</v>

26
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we can even imagine what's coming down the pipes and we're all</v>

27
00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>struggling to keep up.</v>

28
00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:10.451
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

29
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know how much of the current state of more radical political</v>

30
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>polarization is actually a secondary consequence of technological</v>

31
00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:19.660
<v Speaker 1>transformations that we don't understand.</v>

32
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Because I was thinking today about,</v>

33
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 1>about Facebook and about Twitter and about youtube and about the idea that</v>

35
00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>people are in an echo chamber.</v>

36
00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not really sure that's the right metaphor.</v>

37
00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I think we might be in an amplifier rather than an echo chamber.</v>

38
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:37.220
<v Speaker 1>and I've thought for a long time that when I'm,</v>

40
00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>when I'm thinking about the effect of the individual,</v>

41
00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:43.250
<v Speaker 1>I read something that Solzhenitsyn said at one point and I think he was citing</v>

42
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:43.780
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

43
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 1>an ancient Christian theologian who defined the universe has a place that's</v>

44
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.690
<v Speaker 1>whose circumference was nowhere and who's centered was everywhere.</v>

45
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked that idea.</v>

46
00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:54.290
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

47
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.730
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's actually relatively true from a technical perspective,</v>

48
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 1>like from a physical perspective,</v>

49
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:04.321
<v Speaker 1>but social needs and pointed out that each of us was to be regarded as a center</v>

50
00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>of the cosmos.</v>

51
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And that we have the power that's associated with that.</v>

52
00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:10.810
<v Speaker 1>And I've thought about that a lot because there's something about it that's,</v>

53
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 1>that's it's either obviously true or it's true enough so that we all acted out</v>

54
00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:19.540
<v Speaker 1>when we interact with each other because we treat each other like conscious</v>

55
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>beings who have a destiny in him,</v>

56
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.060
<v Speaker 1>who have choices and who make choices that are important and who make choices</v>

57
00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 1>that can be good or bad or even good and evil.</v>

58
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 1>We all act like that.</v>

59
00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:29.431
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

60
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:30.400
<v Speaker 1>we act that out.</v>

61
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking that you can think of network models in that way.</v>

62
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

63
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

64
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 1>you can think of human beings as like 9 billion dots in a row and there's no</v>

65
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:42.100
<v Speaker 1>connections between the dots.</v>

66
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:45.580
<v Speaker 1>And then you're sort of like a dust mote in the wind and who the hell cares what</v>

67
00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:46.510
<v Speaker 1>you think anyways,</v>

68
00:02:46.511 --> 00:02:48.400
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have any impact on things.</v>

69
00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Or you can recognize that you're at the center of a network system and that you</v>

70
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:53.111
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

71
00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 1>you know a thousand people or you will in your lifetime or perhaps more than a</v>

72
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.491
<v Speaker 1>thousand people,</v>

73
00:02:57.491 --> 00:02:58.900
<v Speaker 1>and then they know a thousand.</v>

74
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>So you're separated by one person from 1,000,002 people from a billion.</v>

75
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's a much better way to think.</v>

76
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>And we are seriously networked together and we're networked together more now</v>

77
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>than we ever have been.</v>

78
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:16.291
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that that might mean is that the choices you make are</v>

79
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>amplified and distributed not only far faster than they ever have been,</v>

80
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>but with far more impact.</v>
