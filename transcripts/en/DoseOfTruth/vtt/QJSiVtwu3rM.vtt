1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>More representations of God the father.</v>

2
00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I liked these representations.</v>

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.030
<v Speaker 1>I liked the triangle idea.</v>

4
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know why God is wearing a triangular hat.</v>

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a strange fashion choice,</v>

6
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's associated with the idea of the pyramid and I think that's</v>

7
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>associated with the idea of the hierarchy of authority and I think that's why</v>

8
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians put their pharaohs inside pyramids.</v>

9
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I know there's more to it than that,</v>

10
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>but I think some of that has to do with the notion of this hierarchical</v>

11
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>structure and you see this now that's speculative obviously,</v>

12
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to make too much of it,</v>

13
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:30.984
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

14
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>but I can't help but think that there's something to that.</v>

15
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>See that's on the back of the American dollar bill.</v>

16
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>I like that a lot.</v>

17
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.980
<v Speaker 1>That's like the eye of horus from the Egyptians.</v>

18
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea here is something like at the top of the hierarchy is something</v>

19
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>that is no longer part of the hierarchy.</v>

20
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.141
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

21
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>So if you move up the hierarchy enough,</v>

22
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that you develop the ability as a consequence of moving up that</v>

23
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy to be detached enough from the hierarchy so you're no longer really</v>

24
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>part of it and so that you can move in all sorts of different hierarchies.</v>

25
00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.641
<v Speaker 1>And the thing,</v>

26
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>the idea here is that the thing that you're really developing the capacity to</v>

27
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:03.804
<v Speaker 1>pay attention,</v>

28
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>and I would say from a,</v>

29
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>from a mythological perspective,</v>

30
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that seems to compete with the idea of the spoken word as the,</v>

31
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>as the source of the extraction of habitable order from chaos is the eye is the</v>

32
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>capacity to pay attention.</v>

33
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 1>So Marduk,</v>

34
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.141
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

35
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamian Creator,</v>

36
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>God who,</v>

37
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.940
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

38
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>who emerged in the hierarchy of Mesopotamian gods and came out at the top right?</v>

39
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>He was the victor of the gods.</v>

40
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>He had eyes all the way around his head and he could speak magic words and I</v>

41
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>really liked that.</v>

42
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that idea.</v>

43
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>And the Egyptians develop that idea too because they're god.</v>

44
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Horus was the eye.</v>

45
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows the eye of horus,</v>

46
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>that that that image is so compelling that we still know about.</v>

47
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has seen the eye of horus with a really open pupil and what the</v>

48
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:55.971
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians learned was that the open I was what revivified the dead's society.</v>

49
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>That's so smart.</v>

50
00:01:57.541 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do if your life isn't in order?</v>

51
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.211
<v Speaker 1>Bloody well,</v>

52
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>pay attention not isn't the same as thinking.</v>

53
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a different process.</v>

54
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Paying attention thinking is like the imposition of structure in some sense.</v>

55
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm over simplifying,</v>

56
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>but paying attention to something like watching for what you don't know and so</v>

57
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that I often recommend to my clinical clients if they're</v>

58
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>having trouble with a family member is number one,</v>

59
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.843
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>

60
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell them anything about yourself.</v>

61
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Just and I don't mean in a rude way,</v>

62
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.360
<v Speaker 1>it's just like no more personal information.</v>

63
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.373
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

64
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>watch them like a hawk and listen.</v>

65
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that long enough,</v>

66
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>they will tell you exactly what they're up to and they will also tell you who</v>

67
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>they think you are and then you'll be shocked because they think you're</v>

68
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:41.290
<v Speaker 1>something generally speaking,</v>

69
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:44.280
<v Speaker 1>that's not like what you are at all and when they tell you,</v>

70
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>it's like a revelation to both of you,</v>

71
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>but attention is an unbelievably powerful force and you see this in</v>

72
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy to because a lot of what you do and in any repairative</v>

73
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 1>relationship is really pay attention to the other person.</v>

74
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention and listen and that would not believe what people will tell you or</v>

75
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>reveal to you if you watch them as if you want to know instead of watching them</v>

76
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>so that you'll have your prejudices reinforced.</v>

77
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>That's usually how people interact.</v>

78
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

79
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>I want to keep thinking about you the way I'm thinking about you and so I'm</v>

80
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>going to filter out anything that disproves my theory.</v>

81
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm talking about at all.</v>

82
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm going to watch you and figure out what you're up to.</v>

83
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Not in a rude way.</v>

84
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:25.061
<v Speaker 1>None of that.</v>

85
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:30.061
<v Speaker 1>I just want to see what's there and that'll be good for you probably and also be</v>

86
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:31.294
<v Speaker 1>good for me.</v>

87
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>And so well,</v>

88
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>so that's the idea that,</v>

89
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>climbing up a hierarchy of authority can give you vision and that vision can</v>

91
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>transcend the actual hierarchy.</v>

92
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.270
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's also,</v>

93
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that's also the,</v>

94
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:44.794
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>that's the metaphysical space that an artist occupies because artists really</v>

96
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>aren't in a hierarchy there outside of higher.</v>

97
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

98
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>you've watched the lion king,</v>

99
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.003
<v Speaker 1>most of you.</v>

100
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

101
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.613
<v Speaker 1>That's zoo,</v>

102
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>you know the little bird,</v>

103
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the eye of the king as the same thing there.</v>

104
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

105
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.031
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

106
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>that's echoed in this idea as well.</v>

107
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.023
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

108
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

109
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

110
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:05.914
<v Speaker 1>that's some more,</v>

111
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>more ideas of hierarchy.</v>

112
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:09.521
<v Speaker 1>Same idea.</v>

113
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:10.440
<v Speaker 1>This is right.</v>

114
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Gold,</v>

115
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.001
<v Speaker 1>silver,</v>

116
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>bronze.</v>

117
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Why gold gold as the sun gold is pure,</v>

118
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

119
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is that the thing that's at the top of the hierarchy is</v>

120
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>incorruptible because gold doesn't mix with anything else,</v>

121
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:24.011
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

122
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>It's this sort of metal that doesn't ever become corrupted.</v>

123
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a noble metal.</v>

124
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't become corrupted.</v>

125
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>And so it shines like the sun and it's associated with whatsoever at the top of</v>

126
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy and the goal,</v>

127
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 1>the gold medal is a disc like the sun,</v>

128
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>and it's awarded to those people who've,</v>

129
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>who've occupied the top position and who are manifestations of the ideal.</v>

130
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.060
<v Speaker 1>And here,</v>

131
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

132
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.440
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

133
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a quick story.</v>

134
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you're watching an Olympic contest.</v>

135
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I found this happens to me very often with gymnastics because of a gymnast.</v>

136
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>So absolutely unbelievable.</v>

137
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

138
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.031
<v Speaker 1>so you go,</v>

139
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:57.810
<v Speaker 1>you watch a gymnastic performance and uh,</v>

140
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.870
<v Speaker 1>the person's out there bouncing around like,</v>

141
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 1>you can't even imagine doing it.</v>

143
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>There are so perfect at it.</v>

144
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 1>So you see this person,</v>

145
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 1>they're going through this routine,</v>

146
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 1>they're just absolutely spectacular and flawless added.</v>

147
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

148
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>at the end they stop and everybody claps and they're all excited to see what a</v>

149
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 1>human being can do.</v>

150
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we're in the audience watching because we want to see what a</v>

151
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>human being can do.</v>

152
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>And the judges go like nine point eight,</v>

153
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>nine point eight,</v>

154
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.211
<v Speaker 1>nine point eight.</v>

155
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:22.991
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's thrilled.</v>

156
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>And then the next contestant comes out and it's like,</v>

157
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

158
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>they're just basically screwed,</v>

159
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:27.401
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

160
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like this person came out there and was perfect.</v>

161
00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:30.700
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to top that?</v>

162
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.940
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting question because this is a representation of what you do</v>

163
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 1>to top perfection itself and you can do it.</v>

164
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 1>And here's how you do it.</v>

165
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 1>And you know this even though you don't know you know it.</v>

166
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>So let's say the next contestant comes out and they're kind of shaky because</v>

167
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:47.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

168
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.191
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

169
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 1>the bar has been raised high.</v>

170
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.720
<v Speaker 1>So what they do is they put themselves right on the edge of chaos and you can</v>

171
00:05:55.571 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>tell by watching them that they are one bloody fraction of a second from</v>

172
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.123
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

173
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>There are pushing themselves farther than they've ever gone in the direction of</v>

174
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:05.204
<v Speaker 1>their perfection.</v>

175
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>And everyone in the room is so tense,</v>

176
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>they can hardly stand it,</v>

177
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:08.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

178
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>You could hear a pin drop and that person is flipping around and they're just,</v>

179
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>it's just right on the edge of catastrophe.</v>

180
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.140
<v Speaker 1>And at the end they go like this,</v>

181
00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

182
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>And there's that gesture that the triumph that goes along with that,</v>

183
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>and everybody rises in one instance and just collapse like mad.</v>

184
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.291
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

185
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:24.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

186
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:25.041
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

187
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:25.874
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

188
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.470
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing when you're doing that?</v>

189
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.311
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

190
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>You can't even help it.</v>

191
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>It grabs you right in the core of your being and you stand up and it's an act of</v>

192
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 1>worship.</v>

193
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.481
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

194
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:40.481
<v Speaker 1>And you saw someone go beyond their perfection into the domain of chaos and</v>

195
00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:44.900
<v Speaker 1>establish order right in front of your eyes and you're so thrilled about that.</v>

196
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>You know you're happy to be alive and everyone's celebrating it all at the same</v>

197
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

198
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's an absolutely amazing thing.</v>

199
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's what.</v>

200
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

201
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's what this represents.</v>

202
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that's what this represents.</v>

203
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're trying to get at that because that's at the pinnacle of</v>

204
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:00.411
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy,</v>

205
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

206
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Not only are you doing what you should be doing,</v>

207
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>but you're doing it in a way that increases the probability that you'll do it</v>

208
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 1>better the next time you do it.</v>

209
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say,</v>

210
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 1>here's another thing to think about along the same lines,</v>

211
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 1>and I know we haven't gotten to Adam and eve.</v>

212
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.653
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

213
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.870
<v Speaker 1>you tell your kids to play fair,</v>

214
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.591
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

215
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:22.480
<v Speaker 1>You say it's not him.</v>

216
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not whether or not you win.</v>

217
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 1>It's how you play the game.</v>

218
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 1>And you say that you don't really know what you mean.</v>

219
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>You feel kind of stupid saying it even though you know it's true and your kid</v>

220
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>looks at you like there's something wrong with you because he doesn't know what</v>

221
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:33.770
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about either,</v>

222
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 1>but you know it's true.</v>

223
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>And so here's why it's true.</v>

224
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Life isn't a game.</v>

225
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a set of games.</v>

226
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And the rule is never sacrificed victory across the set of games for victory in</v>

227
00:07:48.231 --> 00:07:49.064
<v Speaker 1>one game.</v>

228
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

229
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it means to play properly.</v>

230
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.720
<v Speaker 1>You want to play so that people keep inviting you to play because that's how you</v>

231
00:07:56.721 --> 00:07:57.554
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>

232
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

233
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.180
<v Speaker 1>You win by being invited to play the largest possible array of games.</v>

234
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.510
<v Speaker 1>And the way you do that is by manifesting the fact that you can play in a</v>

235
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 1>reciprocal manner every time you play.</v>

236
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Even if there's victory at stake and that's what makes you successful across</v>

237
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 1>time and we all know that and we even tell our kids that,</v>

238
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know that we know it.</v>

239
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 1>And so we're not adapting ourselves to the game and victory in the game.</v>

240
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 1>We're adapting ourselves to the metagame and victory across the set of all</v>

241
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 1>possible games.</v>

242
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's what that.</v>

243
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:27.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

244
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what,</v>

245
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.241
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

246
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what this is aiming at to that.</v>

247
00:08:31.251 --> 00:08:33.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the same idea that there's,</v>

248
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 1>that there's a transit,</v>

249
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:38.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a mode of being that transcends the particularities of this,</v>

250
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.280
<v Speaker 1>of the localized contest.</v>

251
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the other way to think about it.</v>

252
00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:46.601
<v Speaker 1>And to act morally is not to win today's contest at the expense of the rest of</v>

253
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:49.340
<v Speaker 1>possible contests.</v>

254
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.451
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

255
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that as something that's arbitrary.</v>

256
00:08:52.161 --> 00:08:53.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not relativistic.</v>

257
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>There's an absolute moral is an absolute moral stance there.</v>

258
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 1>And everyone recognizes it.</v>

259
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.283
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

260
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 1>and I also think it's the key to success.</v>

261
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say it's very much akin in a strange way,</v>

262
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:06.511
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

263
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:06.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

264
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

265
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 1>the person who is the master at being invited to play the largest possible</v>

266
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>

267
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>number of games is also the same person I haven't quite figured out.</v>

268
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.450
<v Speaker 1>The precise relationship between these two is also the same person that goes out</v>

269
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:26.451
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly to conquer the unknown before it presents itself as the enemy at</v>

270
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:27.270
<v Speaker 1>the door.</v>

271
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 1>They're the same thing.</v>

272
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't,</v>

273
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I can't have him figured.</v>

274
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Well why that is exactly.</v>

275
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

276
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.590
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

277
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll figure it out eventually.</v>

278
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:35.191
<v Speaker 1>And when I do,</v>

279
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you if you're interested.</v>

280
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>

281
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:41.970
<v Speaker 1>So here's some other no ideas of,</v>

282
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

283
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 1>of God as,</v>

284
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

285
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 1>as hierarchical authority figures.</v>

286
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 1>So strip the religious preconceptions off what you observe and just look at what</v>

287
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:50.971
<v Speaker 1>you see.</v>

288
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Well look,</v>

289
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.680
<v Speaker 1>there's primate looking upward at dominant figure that that's what you see</v>

290
00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:57.271
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

291
00:09:57.271 --> 00:09:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

292
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 1>if it's very interestingly symbolically represented because you have God the</v>

293
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>father there with the cross.</v>

294
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.010
<v Speaker 1>And I think what that means as far as I can tell,</v>

295
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a recognition there in the image that the person who's most</v>

296
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:12.240
<v Speaker 1>dominant is the one who's or the most has the most authority,</v>

297
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 1>is the one who's voluntarily accepted the suffering.</v>

298
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 1>That's part of being.</v>

299
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's what that picture represents.</v>

300
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:23.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like the authority holds that says this is what you have to accept and</v>

301
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:24.031
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

302
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:24.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

303
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:24.980
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

304
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.110
<v Speaker 1>that trend fix the viewer because of the.</v>

305
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Because of the fact that it's true.</v>

306
00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:29.851
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

307
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:30.001
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

308
00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:30.601
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>

309
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:30.841
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

310
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 1>well think about it this way.</v>

311
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you like brave people are cowards?</v>

312
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

313
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:35.431
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

314
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:36.690
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty straightforward.</v>

315
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.700
<v Speaker 1>And what's the ultimate act of bravery?</v>

316
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 1>It's to come to terms with the fact that you're mortal unlimited and to live</v>

317
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly regardless.</v>

318
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:45.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

319
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's at the core of what's of what's admirable and why would we</v>

320
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.660
<v Speaker 1>presume that that's not the case.</v>

321
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.400
<v Speaker 1>We act as if that's the case.</v>

322
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:55.890
<v Speaker 1>It's what everyone dreams and wishes that they could.</v>

323
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.933
<v Speaker 1>They could do.</v>

324
00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

325
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.210
<v Speaker 1>assuming that you know,</v>

326
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 1>you've dispensed with the idea that you're going to be a mortal.</v>

327
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.030
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that might be worth wishing for two or or perhaps not immortal is a</v>

328
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:07.080
<v Speaker 1>very long time,</v>

329
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 1>but you certainly want this and that image says,</v>

330
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 1>well this is what you should be and you know,</v>

331
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 1>we've got that same opening into the sky going on in that image that I showed</v>

332
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:17.191
<v Speaker 1>you before.</v>

333
00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is a transcendent truth that constantly read manifests itself</v>

334
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:25.470
<v Speaker 1>across time and space and young would say it's built into your psyche that</v>

335
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:26.100
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>

336
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:26.581
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

337
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:29.310
<v Speaker 1>there are elements of it that are culturally constructed.</v>

338
00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't necessarily have to be the cross,</v>

339
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 1>although the cross is a very old symbol.</v>

340
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It's far older than than it's used in,</v>

341
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:37.950
<v Speaker 1>in Christianity and it's been used in many,</v>

342
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:40.770
<v Speaker 1>many religious representations,</v>

343
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.100
<v Speaker 1>but that Echo is the sole echoes with that,</v>

344
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:44.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.583
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

346
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:47.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

347
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.560
<v Speaker 1>and then there's Moses up there on the,</v>

348
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.890
<v Speaker 1>on the mountain receiving the,</v>

349
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

350
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:53.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

351
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 1>the law and so we'll talk a lot more about that when we get the exodus.</v>

352
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.320
<v Speaker 1>But if.</v>

353
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

354
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

355
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:02.883
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

356
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 1>If we get to exodus,</v>

357
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

358
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Well look,</v>

359
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.660
<v Speaker 1>where does it happen?</v>

360
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

361
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.573
<v Speaker 1>on a mountain,</v>

362
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 1>well that's a pyramid.</v>

363
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:11.890
<v Speaker 1>That's op,</v>

364
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.221
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

365
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 1>That's optics up.</v>

366
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:13.440
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

367
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 1>it's up in the stratosphere,</v>

368
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:15.790
<v Speaker 1>it's up in the sky where,</v>

369
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.500
<v Speaker 1>where you'll look upward.</v>

370
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

371
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.020
<v Speaker 1>and then so what's happening to Moses?</v>

372
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:20.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

373
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:20.411
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

374
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:23.080
<v Speaker 1>here's a bit of a clue as far as I can tell.</v>

375
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I figured this out partly again by reading jumped piaget because one of the</v>

376
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 1>things that Piaget said about kids was that they first learned to play a game,</v>

377
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know what the rules are.</v>

378
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that if you have a bunch of kids together,</v>

379
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>they can play a game.</v>

380
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.290
<v Speaker 1>But if you take one of the kids out of the game when they're young,</v>

381
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:40.380
<v Speaker 1>say six and you say what the rules are,</v>

382
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.260
<v Speaker 1>what are the rules?</v>

383
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 1>They can only sort of give you a representation.</v>

384
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 1>So you take 60 year old one and he'll tell you some of the rules and six year</v>

385
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 1>old to will tell you different rules.</v>

386
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

387
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

388
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.910
<v Speaker 1>six year old three will tell you different rules,</v>

389
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 1>but if you put them all together they can play.</v>

390
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 1>So they have the knowledge embodied either individually or in the group.</v>

391
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.420
<v Speaker 1>The knowledge is there to be extracted,</v>

392
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 1>well then they get a little older,</v>

393
00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:07.380
<v Speaker 1>they can extract the rules and then they started to play by the rules and then</v>

394
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Piaget's last step was,</v>

395
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:09.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

396
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't just the kids play by the rules is that they learned that they can</v>

397
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:15.040
<v Speaker 1>make the rules and he thought about that as moral progression.</v>

398
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.090
<v Speaker 1>First you can play,</v>

399
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.410
<v Speaker 1>then you can play by the rules.</v>

400
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Then you learn maybe because he didn't think everyone learned this,</v>

401
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.480
<v Speaker 1>that you're actually the master of the rules.</v>

402
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean the rules are arbitrary,</v>

403
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.370
<v Speaker 1>but it means that you can be the generator of the roof.</v>

404
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.150
<v Speaker 1>That's assuming that you knew how to play the game and he thought about that as</v>

405
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:33.700
<v Speaker 1>a moral moral progression and then I thought,</v>

406
00:13:33.701 --> 00:13:37.270
<v Speaker 1>well that's exactly what happened to Moses and the story of exodus because Moses</v>

407
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:41.710
<v Speaker 1>is out there leading all those Israelites around and like they don't have a law.</v>

408
00:13:41.711 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a law giver.</v>

409
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.270
<v Speaker 1>They have a tradition and they're all like crabby because,</v>

410
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 1>well they're in the desert.</v>

411
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:49.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're in a tyranny,</v>

412
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:50.350
<v Speaker 1>but now they're in a desert.</v>

413
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:51.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's no improvement,</v>

414
00:13:51.921 --> 00:13:52.380
<v Speaker 1>so they're,</v>

415
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.480
<v Speaker 1>they're really getting pretty bitchy about it and so they're worshiping false</v>

416
00:13:55.481 --> 00:14:00.480
<v Speaker 1>idols and having one catastrophe after another and they get Moses to judge their</v>

417
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.310
<v Speaker 1>conflicts and so he does that for God only knows how long forever crabby</v>

418
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Israelites come to Moses and bitch at them.</v>

419
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:08.801
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

420
00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:09.011
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

421
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:09.761
<v Speaker 1>he did this,</v>

422
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:14.761
<v Speaker 1>and she did that and and so then he has to figure out how to make peace and he</v>

423
00:14:15.101 --> 00:14:16.780
<v Speaker 1>does that so long that one of his,</v>

424
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's his father in law,</v>

425
00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:20.680
<v Speaker 1>tells him he has to stop doing it because he's going to exhaust himself.</v>

426
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:21.101
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

427
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:21.521
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>

428
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:21.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

429
00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:22.474
<v Speaker 1>what's happening?</v>

430
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.943
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

431
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.750
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not assuming that this is a like a literal historical story.</v>

432
00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:29.291
<v Speaker 1>I think again,</v>

433
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:31.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a condensation well,</v>

434
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 1>any group has a set of customers just like a wolf pack does,</v>

435
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.330
<v Speaker 1>and so then the customers are being manifest in someone who's a genius is</v>

436
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 1>watching and thinking,</v>

437
00:14:41.231 --> 00:14:41.561
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

438
00:14:41.561 --> 00:14:44.350
<v Speaker 1>well what's the rule in this situation?</v>

439
00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:45.760
<v Speaker 1>What's the rule of this situation?</v>

440
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:47.110
<v Speaker 1>What's the rule in this situation?</v>

441
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 1>And then in his imagination,</v>

442
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.910
<v Speaker 1>the rules turn into a hierarchy and then he goes up on the mountain and he goes</v>

443
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:54.080
<v Speaker 1>back and he thinks,</v>

444
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.010
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

445
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 1>here's the rules that we've been living by all this time.</v>

446
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's the revelation of the commandments.</v>

447
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:00.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

448
00:15:00.881 --> 00:15:01.221
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

449
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:01.341
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

450
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:02.171
<v Speaker 1>how else could it be?</v>

451
00:15:02.171 --> 00:15:05.060
<v Speaker 1>I think the rules came first and obeying them came second.</v>

452
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.880
<v Speaker 1>So I know the rules come first,</v>

453
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.260
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

454
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.610
<v Speaker 1>The actions come first.</v>

455
00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:10.710
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

456
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.720
<v Speaker 1>the obeying them comes first and then you figure out what everybody's up to and</v>

457
00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:14.931
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

458
00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:15.321
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

459
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 1>this is what you've been up to all along.</v>

460
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:17.480
<v Speaker 1>And everybody goes,</v>

461
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.313
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

462
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 1>that seems to make sense.</v>

463
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.721
<v Speaker 1>And if it didn't,</v>

464
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Speaker 1>who would follow them?</v>

465
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.720
<v Speaker 1>No one was going to follow them.</v>

466
00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Speaker 1>If they don't match what's already there,</v>

467
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 1>you just think about that as unjust.</v>

468
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:28.783
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

469
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.020
<v Speaker 1>that's portrayed here as a cataclysmic human event.</v>

470
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

471
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

472
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.000
<v Speaker 1>we've been chimpanzees and we've been in this hierarchy of authority for so</v>

473
00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:38.241
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

474
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:39.530
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea what we were doing.</v>

475
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.483
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden,</v>

476
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.533
<v Speaker 1>poof.</v>

477
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 1>It burst into revelatory consciousness.</v>

478
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 1>And we could say,</v>

479
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.090
<v Speaker 1>here is the law,</v>

480
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:47.811
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>

481
00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:47.991
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

482
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 1>is it given by God?</v>

483
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

484
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

485
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.190
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by God.</v>

486
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 1>We could start with that presupposition,</v>

487
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like it just came out of nowhere.</v>

488
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:56.720
<v Speaker 1>It took,</v>

489
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.270
<v Speaker 1>and this is something else Nicha observed.</v>

490
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 1>So interestingly,</v>

491
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:00.801
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

492
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:05.801
<v Speaker 1>you know that a moral revelation was the consequence of a tremendously long</v>

493
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:11.471
<v Speaker 1>process of initial construction and then formulation thousands and thousands and</v>

494
00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:17.381
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years of custom of building custom before you get the</v>

495
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:20.600
<v Speaker 1>revelation of the articulated law.</v>

496
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's a description of the pattern that works and let's say,</v>

497
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:24.021
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

498
00:16:24.021 --> 00:16:25.400
<v Speaker 1>what's the pattern that works?</v>

499
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:30.320
<v Speaker 1>It's the game that you can play with everybody else day after day with no</v>

500
00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:31.400
<v Speaker 1>degeneration.</v>

501
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing piaget figured out that so brilliant and that's his</v>

502
00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:36.800
<v Speaker 1>idea of the equilibrated state.</v>

503
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

504
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 1>it's an extension of a manual counts idea about the universal maximum right act</v>

505
00:16:42.111 --> 00:16:45.680
<v Speaker 1>in a way so that each action could become a universal rule.</v>

506
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.430
<v Speaker 1>That was con,</v>

507
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.760
<v Speaker 1>fundamental moral maximun piaget put a twist on that.</v>

508
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:50.031
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

509
00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:50.181
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

510
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:50.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

511
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.770
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly yet.</v>

512
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:56.771
<v Speaker 1>It's act in such a way that it works for you now and next week and next month</v>

513
00:16:57.711 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 1>and next year and 10 years from now and so that,</v>

514
00:17:00.861 --> 00:17:01.071
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

515
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:02.060
<v Speaker 1>it's working for you.</v>

516
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:06.250
<v Speaker 1>It's also working for the people around you and for the broader society and,</v>

517
00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:06.551
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

518
00:17:06.551 --> 00:17:08.480
<v Speaker 1>and that's the equilla braided state,</v>

519
00:17:08.481 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 1>and you could think about that as an intimation of the Kingdom of the city,</v>

520
00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:13.250
<v Speaker 1>of God on earth.</v>

521
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:16.880
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and it's based on this idea that a morality has to be</v>

522
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:18.350
<v Speaker 1>iterable and you know,</v>

523
00:17:18.351 --> 00:17:19.184
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of,</v>

524
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:21.740
<v Speaker 1>there's been lots of simulations online already,</v>

525
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:22.820
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence,</v>

526
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 1>simulations of trading games,</v>

527
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:25.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

528
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

529
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.650
<v Speaker 1>the people who've been studying the emergence of moral behavior say an</v>

530
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligent systems have already caught onto the idea that one of the</v>

531
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:37.070
<v Speaker 1>crucial elements to the analysis of morality is interability.</v>

532
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.770
<v Speaker 1>You can't play a degenerating game because.</v>

533
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Because it degenerates,</v>

534
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.020
<v Speaker 1>like obviously you want to play a game that had leased,</v>

535
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:46.850
<v Speaker 1>remained stable across time,</v>

536
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.541
<v Speaker 1>and God,</v>

537
00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:49.100
<v Speaker 1>if you could really get your act together,</v>

538
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would slowly get better.</v>

539
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's what you'd hope for your family.</v>

540
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

541
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're always trying to do and less,</v>

542
00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 1>you're completely hell bent on revenge and destruction.</v>

543
00:17:59.191 --> 00:17:59.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

544
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.030
<v Speaker 1>is there a way that we can continue to play together that will make playing</v>

545
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 1>together even better the next day.</v>

546
00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.490
<v Speaker 2>But I will say something about it,</v>

547
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:07.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

548
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.040
<v Speaker 2>and I thought about this a lot,</v>

549
00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:12.360
<v Speaker 2>so there is evidence that Ashkenazi Jews,</v>

550
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:14.290
<v Speaker 2>so those are Jews of European heritage,</v>

551
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.980
<v Speaker 2>have iqs that are about 15 points higher than the population average.</v>

552
00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.570
<v Speaker 2>So that's a lot 15 points.</v>

553
00:18:19.571 --> 00:18:22.570
<v Speaker 2>It's about the average difference between the typical high school student and</v>

554
00:18:22.571 --> 00:18:24.100
<v Speaker 2>the typical state college student.</v>

555
00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.113
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>

556
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.250
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that means is,</v>

557
00:18:27.251 --> 00:18:30.820
<v Speaker 2>so imagine there's two distributions and that they overlap and that the Jewish</v>

558
00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:31.654
<v Speaker 2>one is,</v>

559
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:32.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

560
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.950
<v Speaker 2>is the mean is 1:15.</v>

561
00:18:35.951 --> 00:18:38.440
<v Speaker 2>So the whole distribution has shifted to the right.</v>

562
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.890
<v Speaker 2>What that means is that if you go up into the Higher Iq strata,</v>

563
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.791
<v Speaker 2>1:30,</v>

564
00:18:42.791 --> 00:18:44.800
<v Speaker 2>1:45 way the hell up there,</v>

565
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.090
<v Speaker 2>that Jewish people are overwhelmingly overrepresented at the high end of the ICU</v>

566
00:18:49.091 --> 00:18:49.924
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>

567
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Now the price they pay for that is some increased propensity for neurological</v>

568
00:18:54.221 --> 00:18:57.940
<v Speaker 2>diseases that seems to be associated in some sense with that heightened Iq.</v>

569
00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

570
00:18:58.810 --> 00:18:59.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

571
00:18:59.051 --> 00:19:00.780
<v Speaker 2>the science on this isn't settled but,</v>

572
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:01.810
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

573
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.420
<v Speaker 2>it's reasonably solid,</v>

574
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

575
00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.810
<v Speaker 2>given the standards of such things.</v>

576
00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:08.321
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

577
00:19:08.321 --> 00:19:13.270
<v Speaker 2>so Jews are going to be our over represented at the high end of cognitively</v>

578
00:19:13.271 --> 00:19:14.530
<v Speaker 2>complex disciplines.</v>

579
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:15.880
<v Speaker 2>So then I would say,</v>

580
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.200
<v Speaker 2>and that's the case,</v>

581
00:19:17.201 --> 00:19:20.890
<v Speaker 2>like they're way overrepresented among like outstanding scientists and among</v>

582
00:19:20.891 --> 00:19:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Nobel Prize winners and and so forth.</v>

583
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.750
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

584
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.840
<v Speaker 2>people look and they think,</v>

585
00:19:25.841 --> 00:19:30.100
<v Speaker 2>well why are there a disproportionate number of Jewish people in positions of</v>

586
00:19:30.101 --> 00:19:30.491
<v Speaker 2>authority?</v>

587
00:19:30.491 --> 00:19:30.791
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>

588
00:19:30.791 --> 00:19:31.001
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

589
00:19:31.001 --> 00:19:32.560
<v Speaker 2>it must be a conspiracy.</v>

590
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:33.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

591
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.590
<v Speaker 2>it must be systemic in some sense.</v>

592
00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:35.891
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

593
00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:36.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

594
00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:40.690
<v Speaker 2>it can be simply accounted for by that relatively large ICU differential.</v>

595
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Now the next criticism would be,</v>

596
00:19:43.151 --> 00:19:43.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

597
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.060
<v Speaker 2>don't the Jews tend to lean left?</v>

598
00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.410
<v Speaker 2>Well first you might say,</v>

599
00:19:47.411 --> 00:19:47.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

600
00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

601
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.260
<v Speaker 2>given what happened in Nazi Germany to the degree that that was right wing as we</v>

602
00:19:53.261 --> 00:19:54.100
<v Speaker 2>discussed earlier,</v>

603
00:19:54.101 --> 00:19:56.050
<v Speaker 2>that's the nationalism and ethnocentrism.</v>

604
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.360
<v Speaker 2>It's hardly surprising that they might,</v>

605
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:59.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

606
00:19:59.021 --> 00:20:02.710
<v Speaker 2>in this historical period of time tend to move towards the left,</v>

607
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.300
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly than that,</v>

608
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Iq is associated with trait,</v>

609
00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.650
<v Speaker 2>openness and trade.</v>

610
00:20:08.651 --> 00:20:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Openness is a strong predictor predictor of political liberalism.</v>

611
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:13.563
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

612
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.150
<v Speaker 2>and it's the strongest predictor of political liberalism.</v>

613
00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

614
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

615
00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:19.840
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult.</v>

616
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I have to say about that.</v>

617
00:20:21.551 --> 00:20:23.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like in the other thing I would say is,</v>

618
00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:24.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.290
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's a population as sub population of people who are much</v>

620
00:20:29.291 --> 00:20:30.490
<v Speaker 2>smarter than average,</v>

621
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.600
<v Speaker 2>not on average,</v>

622
00:20:31.601 --> 00:20:32.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

623
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.870
<v Speaker 2>On average,</v>

624
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I've got to get that straight on average is actually of great benefit to the</v>

625
00:20:37.271 --> 00:20:40.390
<v Speaker 2>rest of us because why do you want fewer geniuses?</v>

626
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Fewer people with Iq of 145 or 160.</v>

627
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.090
<v Speaker 2>That's and you know,</v>

628
00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.840
<v Speaker 2>and it's no conspiracy that puts people who are smarter,</v>

629
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.680
<v Speaker 2>higher up in competence hierarchies because I accused the best predictor of</v>

630
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 2>movement up in a complex con competence hierarchy.</v>

631
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.120
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>

632
00:20:58.121 --> 00:20:59.680
<v Speaker 2>I've addressed the Jewish question.</v>

633
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:04.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a confusion between ethnicity and and ICU as far as I'm</v>

634
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:05.620
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

635
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 2>So I'll probably get like painted six different shades of black for that answer,</v>

636
00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:10.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

637
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about a long time.</v>

638
00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:13.900
<v Speaker 2>It's the best that I can manage.</v>
