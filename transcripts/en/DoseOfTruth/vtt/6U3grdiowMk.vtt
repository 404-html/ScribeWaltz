1
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>So don't want to be a person is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of no return.</v>

2
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we look at what's happening in the</v>

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.560
<v Speaker 1>US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're at the point of no</v>

4
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.480
<v Speaker 1>return.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that things are more</v>

5
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>fractious than they were in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>

6
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were plenty of riots in the 19</v>

7
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:25.820
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of racial tension,</v>

8
00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of social upheaval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think we're at that.</v>

9
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think that the level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>social upheaval that we're experiencing</v>

10
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>right now is at that level of magnitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it is higher than it's been</v>

11
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:42.671
<v Speaker 1>at any point since the 19 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the problem is is that the</v>

12
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>postmodern radical types have got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stranglehold on the administrative level</v>

13
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:54.830
<v Speaker 1>of many institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what they're going to find</v>

14
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:58.280
<v Speaker 1>is that the rug is going to be pulled</v>
<v Speaker 1>out from underneath them in ways they</v>

15
00:00:58.281 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 1>don't expect.</v>

16
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the press has become,</v>

17
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>let's say more ideologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented,</v>

18
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.930
<v Speaker 1>the CBC is a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

19
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I used to like the CVC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

20
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I was treated more unprofessionally by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CBC,</v>

21
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I would say this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then by any other media organization</v>

22
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.830
<v Speaker 1>that I've been in contact with anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world which is saying something</v>

23
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>and multiple times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just once.</v>

24
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.540
<v Speaker 1>And I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not complaining about that,</v>

25
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm just pointing it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's going to happen is that as</v>

26
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>the media becomes more ideologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed,</v>

27
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.280
<v Speaker 1>it's going to become irrelevant faster</v>
<v Speaker 1>and faster.</v>

28
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>And I think the same thing's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen with the education system,</v>

29
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:45.530
<v Speaker 1>the public education system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even the universities,</v>

30
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>the harder they push in the ideological</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

31
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 1>the faster technological transformation</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll pull the rug out from underneath</v>

32
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that could happen.</v>

33
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

34
00:01:57.201 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the classic news media,</v>

35
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dad for anyone under 40,</v>

36
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.730
<v Speaker 1>certainly for anyone under 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

37
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.770
<v Speaker 1>And so that actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Well then you can just see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you pay any attention to youtube</v>

39
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:16.430
<v Speaker 1>where you have the rise of people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan who gets a one point $8,</v>

40
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.140
<v Speaker 1>million downloads a year and use these</v>
<v Speaker 1>long format interviews of three hours</v>

41
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>where you can go into things in depth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not.</v>

42
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm less worried than I was a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say because what I've seen</v>

43
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:35.441
<v Speaker 1>happening is that there are many ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>that systems can be pulled out from</v>

44
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:40.910
<v Speaker 1>underneath the people who are attempting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to manipulate them and I think that</v>

45
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:45.911
<v Speaker 1>there's a diverse enough range of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there who are smart enough and fast</v>

46
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:53.081
<v Speaker 1>enough on their feet so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the institutions that have become</v>

47
00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:54.860
<v Speaker 1>corrupt will just die.</v>

48
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.870
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

49
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that we're not in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some rocky times.</v>

50
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>We are the shake out in the public</v>
<v Speaker 1>education system is going to be</v>

51
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>seriously ugly over the next five years</v>
<v Speaker 1>when as parents and teachers</v>

52
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>increasingly wake up to the degree that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they ideological domination has</v>

53
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what worries me is all the hr</v>

54
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>departments and the direction that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're leaning,</v>

55
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:22.820
<v Speaker 1>and even at our event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people have brought their syllabus</v>

56
00:03:22.821 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>as in just show me they read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always studying and I was reading them.</v>

57
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:29.610
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these syllabuses are pages long A.</v>

58
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I remember mine were only like a page</v>
<v Speaker 1>long or two and it was just all sorts of</v>

59
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:39.121
<v Speaker 1>things like queer theory and radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>black feminist theory and this and that,</v>

60
00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>and when they graduate they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be teachers.</v>

61
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the problem with those sorts of</v>

62
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>approaches is that they're actually not</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for anything and so I think that if</v>

63
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>you're marketing education that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>educate,</v>

64
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.490
<v Speaker 1>that people will stop buying it a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster than you think the universities</v>

65
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>are still running on there previously</v>
<v Speaker 1>established reputation,</v>

66
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>but they're making so many mistakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now that I think they're right</v>

67
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for painful transition.</v>

68
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's already speculation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US that thousands of universities</v>

69
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.450
<v Speaker 1>and colleges are going to go bankrupt</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the next 10 years.</v>

70
00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
