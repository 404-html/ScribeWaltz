1
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.350
Yeah.

2
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.210
[inaudible] says,

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.720
what's up with all these struggles?

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.250
He says,

5
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.940
I've never seen such synchronicity,

6
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.051
man.

7
00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:16.640
I don't know what to say about that.

8
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.950
I had some frog synchronicity occurrences earlier this year that just about made

9
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:22.491
me saint.

10
00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:24.110
So I don't know.

11
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.543
I have,

12
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.460
I have no idea what to make of it.

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.533
Um,

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.433
you know why

15
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.370
it leaves me speechless that that's all I can say about that.

16
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.031
You know,

17
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:37.920
I do,

18
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.650
you'll need,

19
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.850
Carl Young had some strange ideas and one of them was synchronicity and all the

20
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:45.820
fact that things could line up in a way that seemed meaningful.

21
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:46.930
And you know,

22
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.840
much as I don't understand how that occurs,

23
00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.130
I've experienced it many,

24
00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:53.410
many times and then very convincing ways.

25
00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:54.160
And so it's,

26
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.520
it's one of the things that leads me to think that the world isn't structured

27
00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:58.570
the way that we think it is.

28
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.450
I think it's structured more like a symphony where,

29
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.260
where,

30
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.560
and there are times when dis different parts of the world,

31
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.540
different parts of being can come into harmony spontaneously and all pointed the

32
00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:13.270
same direction and why that happens,

33
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.530
I have no idea.

34
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.980
All right.

35
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.600
I don't understand it at all.
