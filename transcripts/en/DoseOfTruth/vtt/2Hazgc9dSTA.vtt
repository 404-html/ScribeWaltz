00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>How could I overcome my fear of driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>on freeways?</v>

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you could do,</v>

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>this is Ellis is do a fair bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagining driving on freeways and try to</v>

4
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>make the imagining as realistic as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>But then the other thing you can do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's again,</v>

6
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>it's graduated exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're afraid of driving,</v>

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>go drive with someone you trust in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>parking lot on Sunday morning when</v>

8
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>there's no one there and then drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the block and a street that isn't</v>

9
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>busy and then go to a slightly busier</v>
<v Speaker 1>street and then go to a slightly busier</v>

10
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:43.071
<v Speaker 1>street and then find a highway that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a just a two layer so that you know</v>

11
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>you could practice merging and that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

12
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>And you got to build a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say with 20 degrees of difficulty with</v>

13
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 1>the highest degree of difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe being more merging onto a busy</v>

14
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>four lane highway.</v>

15
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>And you could go at night and practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>merging onto the busy highway because it</v>

16
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>won't be busy at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say what you do is you break</v>

17
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>it down into small steps and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice each step until you're bored</v>

18
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>with the step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're bored with it,</v>

19
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>that means you're no longer anxious</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and don't quit.</v>

20
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like stick at it because it's really</v>

21
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>useful to overcome a fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you've identified a fear,</v>

22
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>then you've identified something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome that can definitely make you</v>

23
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

24
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>good luck with it and get professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like take a driving course if you need</v>

25
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>to as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and find someone to work with.</v>

26
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>It isn't going to make you nervous and</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to harass you,</v>

27
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>but don't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important to overcome a</v>

28
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucked out.</v>
