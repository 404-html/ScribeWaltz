00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Some of you might be familiar with the central Dallas symbol.</v>

2
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of dao and dao is a very strange word.</v>

3
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.400
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have an easily translatable single meaning.</v>

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>at least in English it means a variety of things that means the path of life.</v>

6
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:25.520
<v Speaker 1>So that would mean the,</v>

7
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>the path that you take as you move forward through life,</v>

8
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>but it would mean more also the proper path.</v>

9
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's that it's the proper path through life.</v>

10
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.210
<v Speaker 1>So the idea dow is a symbol of reality and one of the things that means is the</v>

11
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>path you take through life.</v>

12
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:44.501
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an implicit idea there that the fundamental reality of life is</v>

13
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.070
<v Speaker 1>the path you take through life.</v>

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not a materialist idea.</v>

15
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a different kind of idea.</v>

16
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.660
<v Speaker 1>It's the idea that life is a journey while we're mobile creatures and we're on a</v>

17
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>journey and know best way to conceptualize reality has as the place that you</v>

18
00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:59.060
<v Speaker 1>journey through.</v>

19
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

20
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>what are the elements?</v>

22
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.570
<v Speaker 1>What are the constituent elements of the place that you journey through?</v>

23
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's also part of Dow.</v>

24
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:09.650
<v Speaker 1>And The Dallas believed that that's the Yin and Yang,</v>

25
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>and Yin is the black serpent because those are two serpent's head to head that</v>

26
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>make up the totality of the world.</v>

27
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 1>And the black serpent is Yin and Yang is feminine.</v>

28
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Classically speaking,</v>

29
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:22.760
<v Speaker 1>from the Dallas perspective,</v>

30
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a symbolic representation.</v>

31
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that women are Yin and that men,</v>

32
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>men aren't.</v>

33
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.541
<v Speaker 1>It's not that.</v>

34
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:34.541
<v Speaker 1>It's an attempt to use sexual symbolism to represent a deeper underlying</v>

35
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

36
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And Yang is masculine in his dark and night.</v>

37
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>And there's a white.in the black serpent and there's a black.in the white</v>

38
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:45.231
<v Speaker 1>serpent.</v>

39
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>The white serpent is the daytime and masculinity,</v>

40
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 1>and it's the interplay between those two things that make up reality and one can</v>

41
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:54.470
<v Speaker 1>transform into the other at any moment.</v>

42
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the Taoist idea of reality.</v>

43
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>And so there's Yin and Yang and they make up the world.</v>

44
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>And the question is perhaps act question is,</v>

45
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.441
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

46
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>what exactly does that mean?</v>

47
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.270
<v Speaker 1>it actually means something.</v>

49
00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:12.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of abstraction and it's actually an incredibly helpful abstraction.</v>

50
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Once you understand the abstraction,</v>

51
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>it might be the most real abstraction there is.</v>

52
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to lay out a little bit,</v>

53
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.401
<v Speaker 1>a layout for you,</v>

54
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:24.890
<v Speaker 1>a little bit about what these two domains refer to,</v>

55
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to make a case that they're real and then I'm going to tell</v>

56
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 1>you what it means that they're real.</v>

57
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.060
<v Speaker 1>So you could think of Yin as chaos.</v>

58
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Now we need to know what chaos is now.</v>

59
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is what God made the world out of at the beginning of time.</v>

60
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.630
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that chaos is,</v>

61
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 1>is it's something like potential.</v>

62
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>And so you can imagine,</v>

63
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.550
<v Speaker 1>and this is not how we think as modern people because we tend to think in a</v>

64
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>materialist way,</v>

65
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.860
<v Speaker 1>but it is how we act.</v>

66
00:02:57.861 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>And as I said already,</v>

67
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.440
<v Speaker 1>you act as if you confront potential and you treat potential as if it's real.</v>

68
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And if your attitude towards it confers on you a certain moral obligation,</v>

69
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.500
<v Speaker 1>which is why you know what people mean when they say you're not living up to</v>

70
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:17.764
<v Speaker 1>your potential.</v>

71
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>No one ever says,</v>

72
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by potential?</v>

74
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Not unless they're being argumentative because you already know and very few</v>

75
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:28.054
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

76
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.301
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm fully living up to my potential.</v>

78
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.520
<v Speaker 1>So you admit to the reality that undergirds that the conception that makes that</v>

79
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>question of possibility immediately</v>

80
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>the potential is while potential is the future.</v>

81
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>

82
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>And we believe in the future.</v>

83
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>We believe that it exists even though it isn't here and it's not measurable.</v>

84
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

85
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>it only exists as a potential set of realizable possibilities.</v>

86
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>That's what the future is.</v>

87
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's really what we contend with.</v>

88
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>We don't really contend with the present precisely.</v>

89
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>We Orient Ourselves towards the future and the future comes at us from every</v>

90
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>direction and we,</v>

91
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.503
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

92
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>we decide as we encounter the future,</v>

93
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>which parts of it we're going to interact with and how we're going to construct</v>

94
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>the present and the past as a consequence of doing that.</v>

95
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>And so part of chaos is potential and that's the positive part.</v>

96
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're in a bind,</v>

97
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 1>what you look for is potential.</v>

98
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Is there another way of conceptualizing this?</v>

99
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Do I have a different way of,</v>

100
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 1>of acting?</v>

101
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Can I make another plan?</v>

102
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Is there something that I'm not taking into account that would make this</v>

103
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>terrible situation tolerable?</v>

104
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.540
<v Speaker 1>That's all an attempt to to call upon potential and to use it to transfigure a</v>

105
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>reality that's intolerable and maybe it's intolerable because of the way you're</v>

106
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing it.</v>

107
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not being naive about that.</v>

108
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I understand perfectly well that people can find themselves so badly cornered in</v>

109
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>life that they're basically done no matter what they do.</v>

110
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>People obviously develop fatal illnesses and they die and their businesses</v>

111
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:14.011
<v Speaker 1>collapse and genuinely terrible things can happen to you that aren't your fault,</v>

112
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 1>that you can't fix.</v>

113
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that you can just gerrymander the world by changing your</v>

114
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:20.411
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>

115
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:21.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not that straight forward,</v>

116
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.480
<v Speaker 1>but I am saying that you have a tremendous ability to transform the landscape of</v>

117
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>possibility that reveals itself in front of you and that when things are</v>

118
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

119
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>that's your best bet.</v>

120
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it will succeed.</v>

121
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>It just means you don't have a better option.</v>

122
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>And so chaos,</v>

123
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>that potential is also something that manifests itself in a terrible manner.</v>

124
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this,</v>

125
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>this is a good way of thinking about it.</v>

126
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you have an intimate relationship.</v>

127
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's say a marriage and the marriage predicated on trust and fidelity,</v>

128
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 1>which is a variant of trust.</v>

129
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.360
<v Speaker 1>And that the trust and fidelity is an axiom of your memories.</v>

130
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.081
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>

131
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:09.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

132
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

133
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

134
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

135
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>let's play it out.</v>

136
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you've been married for 10 years and then your wife tells you that she</v>

137
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>has had three affairs,</v>

138
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>each of them lasted three years and the last one has lasted five years and it's</v>

139
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>still ongoing.</v>

140
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you discover that,</v>

141
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.303
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

142
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 1>so then you might say,</v>

143
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

144
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>what happens then?</v>

145
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

146
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that everything you thought was wrong,</v>

147
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.221
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

148
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>And this is such an interesting thing because it actually means you had the past</v>

149
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>and you think the past is fixed.</v>

150
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 1>It's done with.</v>

151
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's the past.</v>

152
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>But all of a sudden you find out that one of the things that you thought about</v>

153
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:51.344
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>

154
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 1>and it happens to be a very important thing,</v>

155
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>wasn't true at all.</v>

156
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that whole path that you thought was what it was,</v>

157
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>wasn't what it was at all.</v>

158
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.700
<v Speaker 1>And so it transforms itself from an actuality into potential.</v>

159
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.550
<v Speaker 1>And most of that potential is negative unless you're relieved that your wife had</v>

160
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:13.604
<v Speaker 1>an affair.</v>

161
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

162
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 1>but that's an important consideration because you know,</v>

163
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:22.091
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine a situation where your marriage is dreadfully unhappy and you're</v>

164
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>just looking for an excuse to leave.</v>

165
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that that revelation,</v>

166
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 1>even though it would be shocking,</v>

167
00:07:28.191 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 1>would also come with a fair bit of relief.</v>

168
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:31.810
<v Speaker 1>And so this potent,</v>

169
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>the potential that manifests itself,</v>

170
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 1>even when it's unexpected,</v>

171
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't only necessarily manifest itself in a negative guys,</v>

172
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.840
<v Speaker 1>it can also free you,</v>

173
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:07:41.441 --> 00:07:41.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

175
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>and if your marriage was unhappy,</v>

176
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:44.840
<v Speaker 1>even if you wanted to cling to it,</v>

177
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.080
<v Speaker 1>if your marriage wasn't happy and the betrayal was revealed and you're divorced</v>

178
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:52.340
<v Speaker 1>and you set yourself up in two years,</v>

179
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>you might be in a better place than you were.</v>

180
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not a pathway I'm recommending,</v>

181
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

182
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that it's more complicated than it looks.</v>

183
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the introduction of chaos into order.</v>

184
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:03.591
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

185
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

186
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

187
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.300
<v Speaker 1>the oldest story we have is something like order is susceptible to disruption by</v>

188
00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 1>chaos and the human,</v>

189
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:17.350
<v Speaker 1>the d,</v>

190
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.590
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental demand that's made on the human being is to contend with the</v>

191
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 1>chaos that disrupts order.</v>

192
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Not to live in order and not to live in chaos,</v>

193
00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:29.660
<v Speaker 1>but to be able to contend with the chaos that disrupts order.</v>

194
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 1>And so when you encourage your children,</v>

195
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:32.444
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

196
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is encouraging them to become the masters of the chaos that</v>

197
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:39.650
<v Speaker 1>can disrupt order rather than Denisons of order,</v>

198
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.320
<v Speaker 1>which makes them tyrants or Denisons of chaos,</v>

199
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>which makes them nihilistic and hopeless.</v>

200
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 1>So you train your children,</v>

201
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>you encourage your children and yourself and your partner if you have any sense</v>

202
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>to be a master of emergent chaos and to be able to contend with.</v>

203
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.753
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

204
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.900
<v Speaker 1>so chaos has potential and it's this disruptive,</v>

205
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>it's the capacity of the infinite world to disrupt your finite considerations.</v>

206
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.250
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of looking at it.</v>

207
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Another way of looking at it is it's the serpent in the garden of Eden.</v>

208
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.220
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that that story is set up the way it is is because it's trying to</v>

209
00:09:18.221 --> 00:09:23.221
<v Speaker 1>represent that there's no place that's so bounded and secure,</v>

210
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 1>even if it's set up by God himself that doesn't have an agent of chaos inside</v>

211
00:09:30.131 --> 00:09:30.820
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

212
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.060
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same idea that the Dallas put forward with their,</v>

213
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.190
<v Speaker 1>with their symbolic representation.</v>

214
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just portrayed in a different manner.</v>

215
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.300
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

216
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.853
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

217
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.850
<v Speaker 1>what do you do in the garden given that there's a snake in it?</v>

218
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is something like you become the master of snakes and so,</v>

219
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.610
<v Speaker 1>and that's a deep idea.</v>

220
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the same idea as confronting the drag and then getting the treasure.</v>

221
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:03.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the same idea as going to the bottom of the ocean and rescue your father</v>

222
00:10:03.281 --> 00:10:04.540
<v Speaker 1>from the belly of the whale.</v>

223
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:09.700
<v Speaker 1>It's the same idea and that's an element in the greatest of stories in the</v>

224
00:10:09.701 --> 00:10:11.770
<v Speaker 1>greatest of stories is heroic,</v>

225
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.210
<v Speaker 1>heroic story.</v>

226
00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:16.540
<v Speaker 1>And the heroic story is to voluntarily confront the unknown when it manifests</v>

227
00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:20.770
<v Speaker 1>itself and together something of value as a consequence and to share it with the</v>

228
00:10:20.771 --> 00:10:21.604
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

229
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.420
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a story that's more emblematic of what it means to be human then</v>

230
00:10:25.421 --> 00:10:28.450
<v Speaker 1>that that that is us.</v>

231
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.190
<v Speaker 1>That's our best bet.</v>

232
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.533
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

233
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:32.411
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

234
00:10:32.411 --> 00:10:33.910
<v Speaker 1>so chaos.</v>

235
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is the catastrophe that will suddenly enter your life.</v>

236
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is the flood that's definitely coming.</v>

237
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is the ever present possibility of apocalypse in your personal life,</v>

238
00:10:46.571 --> 00:10:50.140
<v Speaker 1>in your familiar life and in this broader social life,</v>

239
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 1>chaos is the consequence of your finite fragility existing in a world that's</v>

240
00:10:56.051 --> 00:10:56.950
<v Speaker 1>beyond you.</v>

241
00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is potential.</v>

242
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is what lies before you.</v>

243
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is what you can call on when you need something to rescue yourself from</v>

244
00:11:05.591 --> 00:11:06.940
<v Speaker 1>malfunctioning order.</v>

245
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a permanent element of existence.</v>

246
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is what you don't know.</v>

247
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is what's outside the fire.</v>

248
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is what's outside the walls of your house.</v>

249
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is what's outside the walls of your town.</v>

250
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is what's outside of the borders of your country.</v>

251
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.870
<v Speaker 1>All of that is chaos and potential</v>

252
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.543
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

253
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Order is where you are when what you're doing is working in the manner that you</v>

254
00:11:39.051 --> 00:11:39.884
<v Speaker 1>intended.</v>

255
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

256
00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:42.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a very specific definition.</v>

257
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.050
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that you know what you're doing?</v>

258
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't because you don't know what you're doing because you don't know</v>

259
00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:48.740
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

260
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Everything you do is bounded by ignorance while you still have to operate in the</v>

261
00:11:52.761 --> 00:11:53.380
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

262
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.380
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is you make finite plans and the new execute plans and then</v>

263
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:01.170
<v Speaker 1>you execute strategies to,</v>

264
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.850
<v Speaker 1>to make those plans manifest themselves.</v>

265
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 1>And if the plan's manifest themselves the way that you desired,</v>

266
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 1>then you regard your knowledge as sufficient.</v>

267
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 1>That's your definition of truth.</v>

268
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And it's the only definition of truth that you can use because you don't have</v>

269
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:16.840
<v Speaker 1>everything at hand.</v>

270
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>And when you're aware what you're doing is working,</v>

271
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.420
<v Speaker 1>that's order and you might think,</v>

272
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:22.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

273
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I should just stay there because that's a comfortable place to be.</v>

274
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 1>And there's a certain amount of truth to that except for one thing.</v>

275
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.313
<v Speaker 1>If you've</v>

276
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>defined a domain of order and you stand in it and you wait,</v>

277
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 1>the disorder will enter all by itself because things aren't static.</v>

278
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Things change all the time.</v>

279
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:53.131
<v Speaker 1>And your attempt to bind yourself within a static structure is destined to fail</v>

280
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.530
<v Speaker 1>because everything around you is in flux.</v>

281
00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.750
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that you've parceled out as permanent will transform itself across</v>

282
00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:02.440
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

283
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example.</v>

284
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're a perfectly well adapted 11 year old and it's actually possible</v>

285
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 1>to meet 11 year old children are often very delightful cause they're like adult</v>

286
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:13.024
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

287
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.350
<v Speaker 1>they're not teenagers.</v>

288
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.320
<v Speaker 1>They're like as they're,</v>

289
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.500
<v Speaker 1>they're the most mature form of children and they can be really delightful</v>

290
00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:21.190
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

291
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>And then like three years later you hate them.</v>

292
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.603
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

293
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.430
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that of course,</v>

294
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they hit puberty,</v>

295
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 1>which is the emergence of chaos into the,</v>

296
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.500
<v Speaker 1>into the already developed childhood structured,</v>

297
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.050
<v Speaker 1>it's really the emergence of sexuality into a structure that didn't have to</v>

298
00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:41.650
<v Speaker 1>adapt to sexuality and maybe even the emergence of aggression to some degree,</v>

299
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 1>but mostly sexuality.</v>

300
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 1>If the child maintains only the 11 year old personality,</v>

301
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 1>by the time they're 16 they're no longer a delightful 11 year old.</v>

302
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 1>There are very immature 16 year old.</v>

303
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.980
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that I'm pointing that out is because just because something</v>

304
00:13:56.981 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 1>works for you now doesn't mean it's going to work for you five years from now.</v>

305
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 1>And so in order to remain stable,</v>

306
00:14:03.461 --> 00:14:05.080
<v Speaker 1>you can't be stagnant.</v>

307
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.430
<v Speaker 1>They're not the same thing.</v>

308
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Stability is a dynamic,</v>

309
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Nada,</v>

310
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.470
<v Speaker 1>not something static.</v>

311
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.290
<v Speaker 1>And so not only do you have to be where you are,</v>

312
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be going to where you're going and you have to be participating</v>

313
00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:19.510
<v Speaker 1>in both of those things actively.</v>

314
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 1>So it's stability plus transformation.</v>

315
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.450
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that manifests itself.</v>

316
00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're there because that manifests itself as meaningful.</v>

317
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.980
<v Speaker 1>That's actually the,</v>

318
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.540
<v Speaker 1>the instinct of meaning,</v>

319
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.800
<v Speaker 1>which is an instinct.</v>

320
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.300
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps the deepest instinct is precisely the instinct that tells you when</v>

321
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 1>where you are as sufficiently stable,</v>

322
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 1>but you're transforming yourself at a sufficient rate to keep up with everything</v>

323
00:14:43.661 --> 00:14:44.494
<v Speaker 1>that's changing.</v>

324
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And you know that because if you're at your job,</v>

325
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 1>you might say to yourself,</v>

326
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

327
00:14:49.331 --> 00:14:50.530
<v Speaker 1>my job is really secure,</v>

328
00:14:50.531 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's not very challenging.</v>

329
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

330
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.280
<v Speaker 1>well why do you care about that?</v>

331
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.460
<v Speaker 1>It's very secure and answer to that is,</v>

332
00:14:58.461 --> 00:14:58.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

333
00:14:58.671 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 1>if it's not challenging,</v>

334
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:00.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

335
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.580
<v Speaker 1>it's deadening in a sense,</v>

336
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:01.821
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

337
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 1>The spirit goes out of it.</v>

338
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.430
<v Speaker 1>If it's not challenging,</v>

339
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 1>you need to be challenged.</v>

340
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

341
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

342
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:08.391
<v Speaker 1>the answer is,</v>

343
00:15:08.391 --> 00:15:08.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

344
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.830
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow is coming and whoever you are now isn't enough for tomorrow.</v>

345
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.900
<v Speaker 1>And so today you also have to be preparing for tomorrow and next week and next</v>

346
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.080
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

347
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 1>And if your job isn't challenging than it isn't doing that for you,</v>

348
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.940
<v Speaker 1>and you find it deadening,</v>

349
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 1>not meaningful.</v>

350
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.370
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that it violates your most essential instinct.</v>

351
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:31.670
<v Speaker 1>And your most essential instinct is the instinct for meaning.</v>

352
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 1>And it signifies that.</v>

353
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.940
<v Speaker 1>It actually signifies that you have the balance between chaos and order right</v>

354
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.171
<v Speaker 1>deeply.</v>

355
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:40.004
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

356
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Which is why it's the most fundamental of instincts,</v>

357
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.440
<v Speaker 1>because chaos in order are the most real of things.</v>
