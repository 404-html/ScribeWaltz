00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you learned as a clinical psychologist contra the anti</v>

2
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:12.891
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrists let's say is that diagnosis is often a relief to people.</v>

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>You know there's a problem with being diagnosed because then you might be</v>

4
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>labeled and then the label can follow you for the rest of your life and once</v>

5
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>you're labeled as something,</v>

6
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>then strange things happen around you that is often reinforced that label.</v>

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you start acting it out more or you adopt it as an identity,</v>

8
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>but there's a flip side of that which is that the last thing that you ever want</v>

9
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>to hear when you go see a physician or psychologist is,</v>

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a case like yours before.</v>

12
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.271
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

13
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 1>That is not a relief man because if the messages,</v>

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anything like what you're telling me,</v>

15
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>the outcome is either going to be not so good for you or you're not going to get</v>

16
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>listened to it all.</v>

17
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.751
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

18
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Because you're such an anomaly that you're,</v>

19
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>you're actually in your existence is annoying to the integrated knowledge</v>

20
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>structure of the medical professional that you are attempting to receive advice</v>

21
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

22
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely the case because they didn't,</v>

24
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:07.824
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>if you can be put in a box,</v>

26
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>then the box tells the doctor what to do with you.</v>

27
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:14.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually a relief to the doctor,</v>

28
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>but also a relief to you.</v>

29
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:16.921
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

30
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:17.754
<v Speaker 1>Because you want to know,</v>

31
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.701
<v Speaker 1>so you come in,</v>

32
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:19.051
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

33
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:19.351
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

34
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't go out of my house much anymore.</v>

35
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid on elevators.</v>

36
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>I have heart palpitations and I sometimes they end up in the emergency room.</v>

37
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Increasingly my,</v>

38
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>interactions in the world are restricted.</v>

40
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>I find myself staying at home,</v>

41
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid I'm going to die of a heart attack.</v>

42
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>And the psychologist says,</v>

43
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 1>you have egg or a phobia.</v>

45
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like lots of people have that.</v>

46
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>And here's usually how it develops and here's the treatment course and you know,</v>

47
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>we can probably do something about that.</v>

48
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:47.304
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

49
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.923
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

50
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to die of a heart attack now probably.</v>

51
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a real relief.</v>

52
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>You're not crazy in a completely unique way and you're crazy in a way that might</v>

53
00:01:57.691 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>be treatable,</v>

54
00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.401
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

55
00:01:59.401 --> 00:01:59.731
<v Speaker 1>And it's so,</v>

56
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>it's such a relief because people come in there with a pile of snakes of</v>

57
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>indeterminate magnitude,</v>

58
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>and they walk out with one manageable snake,</v>

59
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's still a snake,</v>

60
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

61
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>one manageable snake beats a hydra right.</v>
