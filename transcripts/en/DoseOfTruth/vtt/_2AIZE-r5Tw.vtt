00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life for the last year has been so</v>

2
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>busy that I haven't had proper time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect on what's been happening.</v>

3
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>And even if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure I would be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it anyways because it isn't</v>

5
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>sure I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have a framework of</v>

6
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:27.381
<v Speaker 1>reference within which to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started working for this company</v>

7
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>called Television TV Ontario about 1516</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I had talked to a producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name was Waldeck Shimberg,</v>

9
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>he's emigrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polish Jew and a really smart guy.</v>

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>And he phoned me up at the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that distinguishes</v>

11
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>me to some degree from my colleagues is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'll talk to the press and that I'm</v>

12
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>actually not afraid of them or</v>
<v Speaker 1>distrustful love them.</v>

13
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of my colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all of them are like,</v>

14
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>they're critical of the press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly in an arrogant way and partly in</v>

15
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>a defensive way.</v>

16
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.471
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

17
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>they always get it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

18
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all there isn't that they and</v>

19
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>they don't always get it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

20
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

21
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>they'll also shy away from the press as</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're being intruded upon when the</v>

22
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>truth is generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that they're putting forward</v>

23
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>aren't of sufficient interest to draw</v>
<v Speaker 1>public attention anyways.</v>

24
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I talked to what EC for a long time</v>

25
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:23.680
<v Speaker 1>and he invited me to go on a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of shows and then uh,</v>

26
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>then I ended up on [inaudible] the</v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda,</v>

27
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>which is a pretty good public affairs</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

28
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:33.220
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say deep new shows left that</v>

29
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>that are on normal broadcast TV and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

30
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>they go into issues in some depth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they fragmented that up a bit</v>

31
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>in recent years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I became a fairly common guest on</v>

32
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>those shows and people seem to like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying,</v>

33
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>which always surprised me.</v>

34
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

35
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>but it was good because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be pretty damn horrible to put</v>

36
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>yourself out in the public eye and face</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary criticism for what you're doing.</v>

37
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be unbearable in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense unless you were very,</v>

38
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>very strongly constituted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

39
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>well that went on for awhile and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>deck was running this a series called</v>

40
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 1>big ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was actually quite prescient,</v>

41
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he had lecturers come to Toronto and,</v>

42
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>and he had all pretty much all the major</v>
<v Speaker 1>public intellectuals in the world over a</v>

43
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>period of about five years or six years</v>
<v Speaker 1>or so,</v>

44
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:27.891
<v Speaker 1>come and deliver bare bones lectures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort fundamentally need taped them</v>

45
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>and put them on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

47
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>that was sort of unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The production quality was well high but</v>

48
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 1>not overproduced weren't multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras and edits and,</v>

49
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>and intelligent commentary from people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the background.</v>

50
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>It was purely content driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>and it actually got pretty popular on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on iTunes and you can still find the</v>

52
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>lectures there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Tvo couldn't they,</v>

53
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

54
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pulled the show even though their</v>

55
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>primary mandate from the government was</v>
<v Speaker 1>to educate the public.</v>

56
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>And this was a very low budget show with</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high quality minds that people were</v>

57
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>actually watching and downloading a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>on iTunes.</v>

58
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't seem to take the non</v>

59
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.700
<v Speaker 1>standard media with any degree of</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriousness.</v>

60
00:03:13.701 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a common human attribute,</v>

61
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>which is that if you don't know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

62
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>you don't take it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

63
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:20.291
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

64
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>cause if you don't know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>it's just gray and fuzzy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

66
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>You have no differentiated knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy to oversimplify it.</v>
