00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 1>What happens when all people get together in a group.</v>

2
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:09.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>we talked about that last time when we talked about Kierkegaard idea that as</v>

4
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>soon as you get a bunch of people together,</v>

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>no matter how truthful they are,</v>

6
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>all as individuals,</v>

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>instantly the crowd is not a truthful thing.</v>

8
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.171
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

9
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:22.351
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

10
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:22.760
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

11
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.593
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>there are real reasons for that.</v>

13
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Real psychological reasons.</v>

14
00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>So there's the famous ash experiments,</v>

15
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>I hope that those are the right experiments.</v>

16
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>A S C h about Lyme lakes,</v>

17
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:33.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>so you draw two lines on the board and they're the same length and you get the</v>

19
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.453
<v Speaker 1>crowd to,</v>

20
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>collaborate with you and you ask some poor sucker who doesn't know about the</v>

22
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:43.044
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

23
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.071
<v Speaker 1>to play.</v>

25
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:44.641
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

26
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>you ask one person and they say no,</v>

27
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>those lines are different in length.</v>

28
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 1>And you ask another person,</v>

29
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.111
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

30
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:49.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

31
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

32
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>they're quite different in length.</v>

33
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Then another person says,</v>

34
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.531
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

35
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>this sure I can see the difference in length.</v>

36
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>And then you ask the poor pigeon,</v>

37
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>are they different in length?</v>

39
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.613
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

40
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.413
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

41
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>and you can understand why.</v>

43
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like if all those other people are saying it,</v>

44
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>there's either,</v>

45
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>there's either something wrong with all of them,</v>

46
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>which seems unlikely,</v>

47
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>or he's the victim of a conspiracy,</v>

48
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>which is a little on the paranoid side,</v>

49
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>but happens to actually be true in this case.</v>

50
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>or he's just not looking at it.</v>

52
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:20.731
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

53
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:21.391
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

54
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:21.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>the humble thing to thank is he's wrong.</v>

56
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.541
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

57
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:24.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>the fact that somebody might go along with the crowd,</v>

59
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.981
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

61
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

62
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>you can blame that on their,</v>

63
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>on their ability to be social and conventional,</v>

64
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>which in many ways is a huge advantage because if you are all antisocial and</v>

65
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>unconventional,</v>

66
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.943
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>there'd be a good chunk of you in jail and we certainly wouldn't be having this,</v>

69
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:45.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:45.871
<v Speaker 1>delightful,</v>

71
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>peaceful conversation that we're having.</v>

72
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:47.971
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

73
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:48.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to underestimate the utility of conventionality to too much of a</v>

75
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:53.664
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

76
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.051
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

77
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:55.884
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

78
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.110
<v Speaker 1>there's this funny story I read once.</v>

79
00:01:59.111 --> 00:01:59.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's true,</v>

80
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:00.784
<v Speaker 1>but it might be.</v>

81
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Whereas psychology class got together and decided they'd play a trick on the</v>

82
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:07.014
<v Speaker 1>professor.</v>

83
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>And the trick was that he would walk back and forth,</v>

84
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:10.431
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

85
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

86
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and the trick was that they wouldn't pay any attention to them at all if he was</v>

87
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>on the left side of the room.</v>

88
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:15.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

89
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>they talk a bit and look,</v>

90
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>look up.</v>

91
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And if he was on the right side of the room,</v>

92
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>then they'd really focus in and pay attention.</v>

93
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>And the story goes that by the,</v>

94
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>by several weeks of this little trick,</v>

96
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>they had them like lecturing right beside the door,</v>

97
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>and he wouldn't move from that spot.</v>

99
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason I'm telling you that is because it's pretty obvious that</v>

100
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>people can respond to the cues that a crowd is delivering.</v>

101
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.751
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

102
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>when a good speaker does that,</v>

103
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:38.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

104
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>So a good speaker does a variety of things and one is the never talks to the,</v>

105
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>to the crowd per se.</v>

106
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

107
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>when you pick out specific individuals and talk to them and they're sort of</v>

108
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>reflective of the crowd,</v>

109
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.690
<v Speaker 1>and then you can tell if everybody's understanding.</v>

110
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.591
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

111
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that a good speaker does is pay attention to the damn responses</v>

113
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>of the crowd.</v>

114
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

115
00:02:59.321 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

116
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>if a lecture is really a dialogue,</v>

117
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.140
<v Speaker 1>even though the audience is only emitting nonverbal,</v>

118
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>the nonverbal elements of the conversation,</v>

119
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>those nonverbal elements,</v>

120
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>those damn things are important.</v>

121
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>So you want to stay in touch with the nonverbal communication.</v>
