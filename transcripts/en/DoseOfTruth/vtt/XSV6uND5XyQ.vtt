00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Mr Dates it should I hide my anti spam anti feminism?</v>

2
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>I presume as I study university to become a nurse?</v>

3
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.973
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

4
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.043
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

5
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't make unnecessary enemies and you probably shouldn't mouth your</v>

6
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 1>opinion more than necessary.</v>

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>But I think you risk damaging your soul under certain circumstances when you</v>

8
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>don't say what you think.</v>

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>So I wouldn't hide it because I think it's dangerous to hide it.</v>

10
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>And you also won't find out,</v>

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>find the other people that you listened to.</v>

12
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>But I would say be prudent,</v>

13
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>don't falsify your opinions when you're writing.</v>

16
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a big mistake.</v>

17
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Don't falsify your opinions when you're speaking.</v>

18
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>You can always choose not to speak,</v>

19
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

20
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

21
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>but if you feel that you would be doing damage to your integrity,</v>

22
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>then you have to say what you have to say.</v>

23
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Do it carefully and,</v>

24
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>and prepare for the consequences,</v>

25
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>probably prepare beforehand,</v>

28
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

29
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>So I think the hiding is a bad idea,</v>

30
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:13.261
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

31
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>but don't make unnecessary enemies,</v>

32
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:15.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>cause there's just no utility in that.</v>

34
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>How important do you believe the American right?</v>

35
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Is the American right to bear arms and maintain malicious?</v>

36
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Is it equivalent to the right to free speech?</v>

37
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anything is equivalent to the right to free speech or the</v>

39
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for free speech.</v>

40
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>how important do I believe that that right is Jesus?</v>

42
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough question.</v>

43
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>my dad's a hunter.</v>

45
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>He has 200 rifles,</v>

46
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:42.571
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

47
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>They're all single shots because he believes in aiming carefully.</v>

48
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>the culture I come from,</v>

50
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>which is Northwestern Canada is a rural culture,</v>

51
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>a hunting culture of people take their guns seriously there and it is definitely</v>

52
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>part of their lifestyle.</v>

53
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Mean my dad is hunted his whole life and we ate wild meat almost all the time I</v>

54
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:02.244
<v Speaker 1>was growing up.</v>

55
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that the right to bear arms is one of the markers of a,</v>

57
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>of a free society.</v>

58
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's reasonable that only the police and the army should be</v>

59
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>allowed to be dangerous.</v>

60
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.983
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

62
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll just leave it at that.</v>

64
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

65
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 1>I feel obligated in some sense,</v>

66
00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:26.740
<v Speaker 1>to go farther,</v>

67
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to what happened in Las Vegas.</v>

68
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:30.364
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

69
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.333
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.530
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that mostly what happens after these mass shootings is that the</v>

71
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>event gets absolutely politicized and people take their standard positions and</v>

72
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.750
<v Speaker 1>there's no moving either side and that's too bad.</v>

73
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.771
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

74
00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:45.604
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

75
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's unfortunate to use an event like the Las Vegas event or the</v>

76
00:02:57.401 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Columbine shootings to make political.</v>

77
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's usually what happens.</v>

78
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm not going to do that.</v>

79
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an important,</v>

80
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

81
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the individual should be allowed or even encouraged to be</v>

82
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:09.821
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

83
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>but controlled,</v>

84
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

85
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>So along with that,</v>

86
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

87
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.230
<v Speaker 1>is a responsibility and,</v>

88
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>and I guess maybe from the NRA,</v>

89
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>there should be more discussion of responsibility.</v>

90
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

91
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>That seems to me to be reasonable.</v>

92
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
