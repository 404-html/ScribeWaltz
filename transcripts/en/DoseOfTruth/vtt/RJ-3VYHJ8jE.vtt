00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Thanks,</v>

2
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.890
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

3
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Thanks</v>

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>

5
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Thanks</v>

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>

7
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Thank</v>

8
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

9
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Where</v>

10
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 2>you're not attempting to actually communicate to</v>

11
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 2>super position in what's essentially a dominance hierarchy and using your verbal</v>

12
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 2>techniques in order to</v>

13
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.070
<v Speaker 2>give me some temporary from an intellectual perspective and I think there's a</v>

14
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 2>place for that sort of thing.</v>

15
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.083
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

16
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Although it pales in comparison to the utility of a genuine conversation,</v>

17
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

18
00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 2>and I was asked today or times</v>

19
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 2>correspondent part from you today and asking you</v>

20
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.650
<v Speaker 2>about conversational style.</v>

21
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.373
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

22
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.460
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've mentioned to her voice that I would have rather have</v>

23
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 2>the conversation with Kathy Newman be a genuine conversation,</v>

24
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 2>did not contest with a victory.</v>

25
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Even though I was fortunate enough in that circumstance I would say to come up</v>

26
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.720
<v Speaker 2>with that doesn't mean the way that when quest for the best I can have</v>

27
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 2>collateral effects.</v>

28
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.190
<v Speaker 2>You're just like having a reciprocal theater council.</v>

29
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 2>My car that were very positive,</v>

30
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 2>but it would've been a lot better.</v>

31
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 2>I would think it would have been a much better indicator of the health of our</v>

32
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

33
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 2>If we could have just had an intelligent discussion about what was the.</v>

34
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about extending something that resembled hand to hand combat,</v>

35
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

36
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 2>in a very modified form on television.</v>

37
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.230
<v Speaker 2>I think that one of the reasons that the neuron online media,</v>

38
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 2>our classroom incredible rapidity is because much of our public dialogue has</v>

39
00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 2>degenerated into dominance hierarchy conversation where one person up and gabby</v>

40
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 2>three eight perspective is correct.</v>

41
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.170
<v Speaker 2>You know the problem with demonstrating that your eight,</v>

42
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 2>your eight perspectives threat isn't what the hell you know.</v>

43
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

44
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.460
<v Speaker 2>we just don't run into anyone ever who sold wise,</v>

45
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 2>been deployed is absolutely everything they open could be,</v>

46
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

47
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.000
<v Speaker 2>it only takes seconds of self reflection.</v>

48
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I understand that there's a lot you don't know,</v>

49
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.760
<v Speaker 2>which is really cool because what you know is insufficient to provide me with</v>

50
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 2>everything you need.</v>

51
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 2>And so the fact that there's a lot more that you don't know,</v>

52
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 2>it was about the most helpful thing you can possibly imagine because there's</v>

53
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 2>always the possibility that you might learn something that you really need to</v>

54
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 2>know and there's always the possibility that the person that you're talking to,</v>

55
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 2>even if you disagree with them or maybe even because you disagree with them.</v>

56
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 2>My the key to something that you agree to meet John Hall.</v>

57
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:01.300
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

58
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.220
<v Speaker 2>I've learned this.</v>

59
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you a story about Carl Rogers.</v>

60
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I recommending books by women had one called on me.</v>

61
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:11.234
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

62
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.283
<v Speaker 2>Roger,</v>

63
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

64
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 2>handful of cameras.</v>

65
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:20.231
<v Speaker 2>So clinicians from the 20th century were pretty outstanding teachers in regular</v>

66
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:20.701
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

67
00:06:20.701 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 2>I to say is not the speed useful.</v>

68
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

69
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.760
<v Speaker 2>when these people usually put in 25,000,</v>

70
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.693
<v Speaker 2>30,000,</v>

71
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.780
<v Speaker 2>50,000 hours of intense conversation with people who were really in trouble most</v>

72
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:37.710
<v Speaker 2>of the time to go see a clinical psychologist,</v>

73
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 2>to be doing things that have gone astray in some ways that you can imagine.</v>

74
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Some of the conversations that you have with the psychotherapist are generally</v>

75
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:47.830
<v Speaker 2>extremely serious.</v>

76
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Have endless opportunity to engage in complex discussions with people who were</v>

77
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 2>trying to solve extraordinary difficult problems,</v>

78
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:00.810
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things I liked about Roger says he,</v>

79
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.190
<v Speaker 2>he sort of formalized the idea,</v>

80
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Freud,</v>

81
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Freud in some sense invented the idea that conversation could be curative,</v>

82
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 2>but he never really thought about,</v>

83
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.550
<v Speaker 2>but as the conversation itself being curative,</v>

84
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.050
<v Speaker 2>he thought about it as the revelation of secrets that were toxic.</v>

85
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

86
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:23.351
<v Speaker 2>So if you had an extremely negative experience sometime in your life,</v>

87
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 2>joy,</v>

88
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.710
<v Speaker 2>it would be useful for you from an emotional perspective to be able to express</v>

89
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:32.770
<v Speaker 2>that emotion at that women faculty curator.</v>

90
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 2>That actually seems to be wrong.</v>

91
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes great thinkers are growing and productive and interest in waves.</v>

92
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.390
<v Speaker 2>So Freud was right,</v>

93
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 2>that careful conversation that could be curative,</v>

94
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:44.850
<v Speaker 2>but he was wrong about the mechanisms.</v>

95
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.380
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't the expression of emotion that appears to be curative.</v>

96
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 2>It's the articulation of the situation and the analysis of it.</v>

97
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.980
<v Speaker 2>So then you understand why it happened so that you don't do it again or so that</v>

98
00:07:57.981 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't happen to you again.</v>

99
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.220
<v Speaker 2>National expert.</v>

100
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.210
<v Speaker 2>The purpose of memory.</v>

101
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.821
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

102
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:01.971
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

103
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of memories to remember the past and that's wrong,</v>

104
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.223
<v Speaker 2>the grinch,</v>

105
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.320
<v Speaker 2>if you don't do the same damn stupid thing over and over again so your mind</v>

106
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 2>isn't satisfied with his representation of the negative event until you've</v>

107
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.770
<v Speaker 2>analyzed of so you can find out why put in that situation,</v>

108
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 2>even if you're the anxiety,</v>

109
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.943
<v Speaker 2>your</v>

110
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:31.730
<v Speaker 2>or someone else,</v>

111
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 2>they want to know exactly why it happened and then they want you to come up with</v>

112
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 2>a strategy so it doesn't happen again,</v>

113
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 2>and so that's the real secret to the curator power of therapeutic conversation.</v>

114
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's worth doing just in your day to day life when you're</v>

115
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:49.640
<v Speaker 2>talking to people because if someone has something that's troublesome that they</v>

116
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 2>need to relate to you free of what they're trying to do is articulate out the</v>

117
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 2>causal sequence that led to negative consequences and to come up with a strategy</v>

118
00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 2>for avoiding that in the future.</v>

119
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Patient listening can really help them through that.</v>

120
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.121
<v Speaker 2>Generally,</v>

121
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 2>if you're a therapist,</v>

122
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 2>mostly what you do is listen.</v>

123
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 2>You know what you find,</v>

124
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:10.400
<v Speaker 2>and this is something brought yourself outlined quite carefully.</v>

125
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 2>You find that if you ask people,</v>

126
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 2>they will tell you what's wrong in their life.</v>

127
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.410
<v Speaker 2>They're figuring out what they don't want them.</v>

128
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 2>They'll think through and can think through solutions and your job is to listen</v>

129
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 2>so they can most people think by talking and maybe to ask questions of</v>

130
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 2>clarification.</v>

131
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 2>So of my clients are talking to me.</v>

132
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

133
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 2>and what I'll do is I sit and listen.</v>

134
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.800
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of a meditative state or not trying to impose a few point part of it</v>

135
00:09:39.801 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to write like,</v>

136
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what your throne will be as you know,</v>

137
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 2>but whatever it is,</v>

138
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:49.140
<v Speaker 2>it's not my problem they have and I don't necessarily know what the solution</v>

139
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 2>should be for you.</v>

140
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 2>And so I'd be very hesitant,</v>

141
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.830
<v Speaker 2>hesitant to even suggest that it might be because you know,</v>

142
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.780
<v Speaker 2>you're your own particular being.</v>

143
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Your solution isn't going to be.</v>

144
00:09:58.171 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 2>I get to public line.</v>

145
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:02.320
<v Speaker 2>And then if you asked just no,</v>

146
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I never questioned why people are anxious that just makes sense,</v>

147
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.560
<v Speaker 2>are anxious all the time and it's the same pain.</v>

148
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:12.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're in pain.</v>

149
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:13.630
<v Speaker 2>It's unsurprising.</v>

150
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like life is pain,</v>

151
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.320
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>

152
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 2>that's the real miracle.</v>

153
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 2>You should be on your piece about that because it's not gonna last very long.</v>

154
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.740
<v Speaker 2>So Roger's idea is this,</v>

155
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.650
<v Speaker 2>he said a couple of things.</v>

156
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing is if you're going to have a conversation,</v>

157
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:33.650
<v Speaker 2>you have to decide that you want things to be better rather than worse.</v>

158
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:34.720
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

159
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 2>that's hard because you know what it's like when you're angry with someone you</v>

160
00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 2>might be willing to take a couple of blows to the head if you could just punch</v>

161
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 2>them four or five times more and so you know you're willing to take a fair bit</v>

162
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:48.850
<v Speaker 2>of pain if you can inflict even more knots.</v>

163
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 2>And so that's something we probably want to see if you can overcome right at the</v>

164
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:52.930
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

165
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:53.251
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

166
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 2>well I get irritated at you and I can think of all the things I'd like to</v>

167
00:10:58.141 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 2>reflect some pain,</v>

168
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:04.221
<v Speaker 2>but maybe I can regulate itself like intelligent person work for the student to</v>

169
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.200
<v Speaker 2>be better.</v>

170
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 2>So that's the first thing you phone and I think that's part of the commitment of</v>

171
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.500
<v Speaker 2>marriage or a relationship or marriage in particular.</v>

172
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things that you sort of square onto Indians that you're actually</v>

173
00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:22.680
<v Speaker 2>going to try and make things better for each other.</v>

174
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.110
<v Speaker 2>And for yourselves as a cop that's.</v>

175
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.050
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

176
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.580
<v Speaker 2>we fall short of that because people aren't paying any stretch of the</v>

177
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.251
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>

178
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:32.671
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

179
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 2>But this is what you're hoping for her.</v>

180
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:35.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

181
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.740
<v Speaker 2>why else would you ever bought it with it?</v>

182
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

183
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.060
<v Speaker 2>it's just a hopeless costs right from the beginning.</v>

184
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 2>You're in before you got to Orient yourself to try to make things better.</v>

185
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.320
<v Speaker 2>Then the other person mastery pain because one of the things Roger says,</v>

186
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.720
<v Speaker 2>apart from the fact that you're going to get dr whatever the problems happened</v>

187
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

188
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 2>perhaps as the perpetrator,</v>

189
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 2>which is a big problem,</v>

190
00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 2>then you're gonna have to come down with yourself ethically and all of that,</v>

191
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:05.150
<v Speaker 2>which is unbelievably annoying and difficult because you will like what you find</v>

192
00:12:05.151 --> 00:12:06.000
<v Speaker 2>most of the time.</v>

193
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.090
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

194
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.290
<v Speaker 2>But you also have to be patient.</v>

195
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.060
<v Speaker 2>But the first one or three of sort of landscape of trouble and pain,</v>

196
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.250
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to do that badly and stupidly in they never take manner.</v>

197
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you want to help them with that.</v>

198
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.001
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

199
00:12:20.001 --> 00:12:23.650
<v Speaker 2>like you know what are the things that you might want to think too,</v>

200
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're the person who wins the arguments is that maybe you don't</v>

201
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:27.724
<v Speaker 2>want them to do so.</v>

202
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you want to to formulate the arguments even more powerfully so that you</v>

203
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.690
<v Speaker 2>configure that you can help them solve it so that you don't have to be the</v>

204
00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:41.530
<v Speaker 2>stupid winter all the time because it's not a good longterm solution.</v>

205
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.370
<v Speaker 2>So now it's a funny thing because you don't generally think or maybe it would be</v>

206
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 2>a good idea to help your opponent make even better arguments that they make.</v>

207
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.510
<v Speaker 2>But if you have to be married to them or if they're a close knit part of your</v>

208
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.410
<v Speaker 2>immediate community,</v>

209
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 2>that that's exactly what you want to do.</v>

210
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:56.710
<v Speaker 2>So Rogers would say,</v>

211
00:12:56.711 --> 00:12:56.891
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

212
00:12:56.891 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 2>you listen to the person and he asked questions of clarification.</v>

213
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:04.180
<v Speaker 2>You Orient Yourself so that you're willing to change if necessary,</v>

214
00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:07.900
<v Speaker 2>because Roger's also pointed out that one of the impediments to listening is</v>

215
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 2>courage because people will tell you things that will require change on your</v>

216
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 2>part that's destabilizing and unsettling and required to soul search if you</v>

217
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:16.481
<v Speaker 2>don't want that.</v>

218
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:21.481
<v Speaker 2>So it requires courage to to actually listen and it requires courage to try to</v>

219
00:13:21.771 --> 00:13:22.640
<v Speaker 2>make things better.</v>

220
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.940
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you have in place,</v>

221
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.750
<v Speaker 2>he asked questions and clarification and see.</v>

222
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:29.501
<v Speaker 2>One of the things,</v>

223
00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:29.801
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

224
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll refer to that Kathy Newman,</v>

225
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.400
<v Speaker 2>a interview.</v>

226
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.530
<v Speaker 2>What you kept saying to me was so new.</v>

227
00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 2>You're saying so what you're saying was,</v>

228
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 2>and then she would provide a summary of what I was hypothetically say,</v>

229
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 2>which had absolutely nothing to do with what I say.</v>

230
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 2>So I mean African striking the evidence to me very rapidly,</v>

231
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.330
<v Speaker 2>but I think to everyone who watched the interview as it progressed,</v>

232
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.610
<v Speaker 2>what you're supposed to do to say,</v>

233
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:54.941
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

234
00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:58.600
<v Speaker 2>well here's what I think you said and you don't want to be a smart ass about.</v>

235
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.780
<v Speaker 2>You don't want a strong man,</v>

236
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.910
<v Speaker 2>your opponent because then you're in the position of like trivial victor,</v>

237
00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:04.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 2>if I listened to you when you say something,</v>

239
00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:11.131
<v Speaker 2>even if it's not that love formulated and parody of and satirize it feeding back</v>

240
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:12.240
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

241
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's demonstration.</v>

242
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Maybe by momentary intellectual superiority,</v>

243
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:17.740
<v Speaker 2>but probably not,</v>

244
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's not helping with the damn conversation call.</v>

245
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:25.650
<v Speaker 2>What Roger was recommended was then you restate what the person said that to</v>

246
00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:30.741
<v Speaker 2>them in terms they agree with and so sometimes that means to do make your</v>

247
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:33.220
<v Speaker 2>argument for them better than they needed themselves.</v>

248
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.730
<v Speaker 2>That's actually an indication that you're really listening so the person lays</v>

249
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:37.900
<v Speaker 2>out their problem,</v>

250
00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:38.681
<v Speaker 2>whatever it happens to be,</v>

251
00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:39.041
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>

252
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:39.801
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

253
00:14:39.801 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>

254
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.600
<v Speaker 2>here's what you meant,</v>

255
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:49.260
<v Speaker 2>and the second rule for the Rogerian dynamic and conversation was the person who</v>

256
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.740
<v Speaker 2>has to agree with you summary,</v>

257
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 2>and so that's real stringent task,</v>

258
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:53.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

259
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Especially if someone is criticizing you.</v>

260
00:14:56.261 --> 00:14:56.571
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

261
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:56.841
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

262
00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:58.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm listening to the damn criticism.</v>

263
00:14:58.461 --> 00:14:58.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

264
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to just roll over and agree with it,</v>

265
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to listen to it,</v>

266
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.240
<v Speaker 2>so then you tell me what your problem is with me and I think,</v>

267
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:05.511
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

268
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>

269
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.340
<v Speaker 2>this is what you think the problem is and if you agree,</v>

270
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:10.701
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

271
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.870
<v Speaker 2>well then I was listening.</v>

272
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Well then what are the things Roger's pointed out?</v>

273
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.420
<v Speaker 2>They're not?</v>

274
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Which is true,</v>

275
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 2>but law actually like it's true.</v>

276
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 2>If you interact with someone and you're not acting like that's true,</v>

277
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.180
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be happy with you because if I interact with you like</v>

278
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 2>you're not valuable,</v>

279
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.660
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to have a very pleasant conversation.</v>

280
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.900
<v Speaker 2>It certainly not going to be the grounds for any continuing relationship,</v>

281
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.590
<v Speaker 2>so we definitely treat each other when we're treating each other like it works.</v>

282
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:40.490
<v Speaker 2>We treat each other like we have a spark of divinity within us and it's at the</v>

283
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:41.750
<v Speaker 2>core of our law,</v>

284
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.810
<v Speaker 2>so it's like all so always the possibility that it's true possible in what's the</v>

285
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:49.580
<v Speaker 2>alternative that we have no value whatsoever.</v>

286
00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:51.530
<v Speaker 2>No transcendent value whatsoever.</v>

287
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 2>At least we're conscious beings that confront reality and give it shape.</v>

288
00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.500
<v Speaker 2>That's something.</v>

289
00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.880
<v Speaker 2>It's not trivial</v>

290
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:05.910
<v Speaker 2>so well with speed.</v>

291
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.293
<v Speaker 2>Well birthday,</v>

292
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.320
<v Speaker 2>fake her up one day.</v>

293
00:16:10.321 --> 00:16:11.154
<v Speaker 2>Now you want.</v>

294
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 2>You want more misery.</v>

295
00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.340
<v Speaker 2>There's enough damage.</v>

296
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Misery as far as I can tell,</v>

297
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:17.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

298
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.880
<v Speaker 2>So maybe lead actually broadened my misery in the</v>

299
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.533
<v Speaker 2>evening.</v>

300
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:30.980
<v Speaker 2>The family bringing ecosystem is a visit that's back,</v>

301
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:36.020
<v Speaker 2>but evil is the breeding of misery into existence for the sake of the mission</v>

302
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.670
<v Speaker 2>and you don't get that.</v>

303
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Then you have thought about yourself very much at all,</v>

304
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.140
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

305
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Try and make it worse than they have to be delighted in the faculty naturally,</v>

306
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.410
<v Speaker 2>even if it's directed towards himself that time,</v>

307
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.400
<v Speaker 2>she might just start by doing that,</v>

308
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.450
<v Speaker 2>like just decided,</v>

309
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.293
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

310
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to purposely make things worse.</v>

311
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.710
<v Speaker 2>How would that be?</v>

312
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.053
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

313
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.500
<v Speaker 2>you can run it as an experiment.</v>

314
00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:03.921
<v Speaker 2>You might think,</v>

315
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:04.041
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

316
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:05.870
<v Speaker 2>what if you turned down for three or four years,</v>

317
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 2>so I cannot really do anything that makes things worse.</v>

318
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

319
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.313
<v Speaker 2>how much better would it be?</v>

320
00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:15.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's just kind of didn't really do nothing.</v>

321
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.960
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that good motto,</v>

322
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.891
<v Speaker 2>do no evil,</v>

323
00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:20.460
<v Speaker 2>and they dropped that back.</v>

324
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I noticed</v>

325
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.890
<v Speaker 2>finger on what you want,</v>

326
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.570
<v Speaker 2>so here's something to want.</v>

327
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:37.300
<v Speaker 2>There's this philosopher named Emmanuel,</v>

328
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.270
<v Speaker 2>the end of this idea for like an epic,</v>

329
00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:42.230
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

330
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:47.530
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything that you would want to be expressed as a general universal</v>

331
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:48.614
<v Speaker 2>rule.</v>

332
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 2>So you're gonna make a decision.</v>

333
00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.091
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

334
00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:51.361
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

335
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 2>well this is the decision that everyone would make everywhere.</v>

336
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.620
<v Speaker 2>How would that work out?</v>

337
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.640
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of judging whether or not your decision is acceptable</v>

338
00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:02.853
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

339
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.660
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you want things to be good.</v>

340
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.460
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

341
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.291
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

342
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:11.990
<v Speaker 2>so let's think about what good means.</v>

343
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

344
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:15.700
<v Speaker 2>certainly it means an absence of stupid software.</v>

345
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.400
<v Speaker 2>We can all agree on that.</v>

346
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:19.300
<v Speaker 2>So less offering it would be good.</v>

347
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.850
<v Speaker 2>We can start fast like,</v>

348
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:21.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

349
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.740
<v Speaker 2>there's positive of goods that you can only vision and so we won't reciprocity</v>

350
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 2>in human history.</v>

351
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it's partly because there's so many items,</v>

352
00:18:30.081 --> 00:18:30.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

353
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:35.070
<v Speaker 2>The step of building that will be 9 million before population starts to decline.</v>

354
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Speaker 2>That'll happen about 30 years,</v>

355
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.550
<v Speaker 2>so we can probably manage that.</v>

356
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

357
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.010
<v Speaker 2>We've probably managed building.</v>

358
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:45.260
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look like we're going to overpopulate the planet and but also looks</v>

359
00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:47.160
<v Speaker 2>to me like we could have anything we wanted.</v>

360
00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.130
<v Speaker 2>No Gates,</v>

361
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:50.741
<v Speaker 2>Bill Gates,</v>

362
00:18:50.741 --> 00:18:51.121
<v Speaker 2>you fingers.</v>

363
00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:54.420
<v Speaker 2>You can get rid of the five most significant transmissible diseases in the next</v>

364
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:55.254
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>

365
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:59.880
<v Speaker 2>We have the rate of poverty in the world from the year 2000 2012.</v>

366
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.300
<v Speaker 2>We're hoping about 300,000 people a day with the power grid right now.</v>

367
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Like obesity is a bigger problem than starvation by a huge margin.</v>

368
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:07.920
<v Speaker 2>So I can.</v>

369
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.390
<v Speaker 2>There's the devil victory for you.</v>

370
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.350
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

371
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:22.710
<v Speaker 2>and of course there's a million insane genius silicon valley who are,</v>

372
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.920
<v Speaker 2>who are coming up things so fast that they can't even keep track.</v>

373
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.200
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have intelligent machines in no time flat.</v>

374
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.610
<v Speaker 2>So we've got to decide.</v>

375
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:36.511
<v Speaker 2>You might think,</v>

376
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:37.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

377
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.320
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's time for us collectively and I truly believe is the case to be the</v>

378
00:19:41.321 --> 00:19:43.650
<v Speaker 2>face of what we want</v>

379
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.970
<v Speaker 2>and why not?</v>

380
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:54.530
<v Speaker 2>We're all British know certain people are Richard and other people definitely</v>

381
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:59.920
<v Speaker 2>were Richard than in any human beings have ever been in the entire history of</v>

382
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:00.973
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

383
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:02.880
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>

384
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.720
<v Speaker 2>In front of us,</v>

385
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.290
<v Speaker 2>we can make of that what they wanted,</v>

386
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.130
<v Speaker 2>but we have to be discipled.</v>

387
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.840
<v Speaker 2>We'd have to sharpen yourself openness and determine whether we want to recreate</v>

388
00:20:12.841 --> 00:20:16.980
<v Speaker 2>the hell of the 20th century to do at the drop of a hat or whether we want to</v>

389
00:20:16.981 --> 00:20:21.480
<v Speaker 2>bring something new and remarkable being I would say the way we're going to do</v>

390
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:24.390
<v Speaker 2>that isn't really even by collective decision making,</v>

391
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:25.730
<v Speaker 2>perhaps not even by policy,</v>

392
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.080
<v Speaker 2>but by because no,</v>

393
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.320
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows what's coming.</v>

394
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

395
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Things are coming down so fast but don't know what it is.</v>

396
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like so what do you do when things are coming at you so fast that you can</v>

397
00:20:35.071 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 2>prepare and that's risk.</v>

398
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Get to get ready so that you can.</v>

399
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.370
<v Speaker 2>You can contend with whatever comes your way and you do that by straightening</v>

400
00:20:44.371 --> 00:20:46.870
<v Speaker 2>your cell phone and God only knows I was straight.</v>

401
00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:51.430
<v Speaker 2>We get and so and you don't have anything better to do than to try and trying to</v>

402
00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:55.090
<v Speaker 2>justify as the suffering of life and stops you from being bitter.</v>

403
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Speaker 2>So what's the downside to that?</v>

404
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Adopt the responsibility.</v>

405
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:03.281
<v Speaker 2>That's it,</v>

406
00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:04.410
<v Speaker 2>but the responsibilities,</v>

407
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.251
<v Speaker 2>the meaning in life,</v>

408
00:21:05.251 --> 00:21:05.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

409
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:05.861
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

410
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 2>that's not so bad.</v>

411
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Is it a responsibility or an opportunity?</v>

412
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a responsibility.</v>

413
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:12.660
<v Speaker 2>If someone forces and dawn,</v>

414
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

415
00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.810
<v Speaker 2>opportunity if you decide to do it voluntarily,</v>

416
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.903
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

417
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a nice place to stop.</v>

418
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
