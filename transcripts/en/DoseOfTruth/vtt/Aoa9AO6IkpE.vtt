1
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I said No.</v>

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Richard also asked,</v>

4
00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:12.940
<v Speaker 1>how can I talk about the resentments of my childhood in a way that benefits them</v>

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.590
<v Speaker 1>instead of giving them guilt?</v>

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can answer that question,</v>

7
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Richard,</v>

8
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

9
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not a question that's,</v>

10
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.610
<v Speaker 1>see what I would ask if you came to talk to me and you have that question.</v>

11
00:00:30.611 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I would say first of all,</v>

12
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:32.704
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

13
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>what resentments?</v>

14
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.651
<v Speaker 1>List them out,</v>

15
00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:37.484
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

16
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.383
<v Speaker 1>Write him down.</v>

17
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.793
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

18
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.311
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

19
00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:41.660
<v Speaker 1>you know what they are.</v>

20
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.523
<v Speaker 1>Because all of those,</v>

21
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>each of those resentments is going to be a different thing and the strategy</v>

22
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with each might vary as a consequence of the particularity of</v>

23
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:51.914
<v Speaker 1>the resentment.</v>

24
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.550
<v Speaker 1>So I would say you should start by writing them down like what's your problem</v>

25
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>exactly here.</v>

26
00:00:56.721 --> 00:01:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's all the things that I can think of that I'm angry about with regard to my</v>

27
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>

28
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Write that down and then see which ones are are still living.</v>

29
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.590
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out,</v>

30
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:09.891
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

31
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:11.600
<v Speaker 1>what do you want from your parents?</v>

32
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.261
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

33
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

34
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>do you want them to apologize?</v>

35
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you want them to understand what they did wrong?</v>

36
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to punish them?</v>

37
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to get,</v>

38
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:21.890
<v Speaker 1>let them get you,</v>

39
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 1>let them learn to know you better?</v>

40
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to change the way they're interacting with you now?</v>

41
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to learn your own lessons from your bad experience so that when</v>

42
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:35.241
<v Speaker 1>you're a parent,</v>

43
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't make the same mistake?</v>

44
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>You merely want to have a chance to express yourself like it's very difficult</v>

45
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:42.110
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

46
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>to answer your question because I don't know what your goal is,</v>

47
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>So we bet and,</v>

49
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>and I don't need to know.</v>

50
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:52.010
<v Speaker 1>You need to know what are the resentments so we can walk through the process we</v>

51
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:52.790
<v Speaker 1>already described.</v>

52
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Lay them out and comprehensively you might want to make a list of everything</v>

53
00:01:57.981 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 1>that you think you might conceivably be annoyed about with regards to your</v>

54
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>parents no matter how trivial,</v>

55
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.211
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause then that way you,</v>

57
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.020
<v Speaker 1>you scour your memory for four,</v>

58
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.883
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

59
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

60
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>four things that you're holding onto in a bitter way.</v>

61
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you have your justification.</v>

62
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:18.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting that you don't,</v>

63
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.710
<v Speaker 1>but you need to discover what baggage you're carrying.</v>

64
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:22.491
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to figure out,</v>

65
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>well what can I let go of and what's core?</v>

66
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:26.720
<v Speaker 1>And I would say what's really core is</v>

67
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.200
<v Speaker 1>if there are ways that your parents treated you that are still affecting you or</v>

68
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>that are affecting your relationships with them now those really need to be</v>

69
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:39.200
<v Speaker 1>dealt with because they're not done.</v>

70
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>They're not in the past,</v>

71
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>They're not even resentments of your job,</v>

73
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>but they're still part of your ongoing life.</v>

74
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.123
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

75
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.471
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

76
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:50.570
<v Speaker 1>so now you have all your resentments laid out.</v>

77
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would say,</v>

78
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:53.444
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

80
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.350
<v Speaker 1>look mom and dad,</v>

81
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 1>there's something I need to talk to you about that's been bothering me for a</v>

82
00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>long time and I pick one of the trivial things to begin with.</v>

83
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

84
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>here's a memory I have and don't get all high and mighty about it because you</v>

85
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:05.501
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

86
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>you might have misconstrued the situation as a child,</v>

87
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>it's highly probable.</v>

88
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>And they may have had their reasons and you may not even remember the situation,</v>

89
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.680
<v Speaker 1>let's say correctly or the way they remembered to say,</v>

90
00:03:15.681 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

91
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

92
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>here's something that happened when I was a kid in it.</v>

93
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>It still bothers me in,</v>

94
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>do you remember what happened?</v>

95
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>That's an open ended question.</v>

96
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what happened?</v>

97
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Why did this,</v>

98
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>why did this go this way?</v>

99
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>And then I would do an awful lot of listening,</v>

100
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>because you are trying to gather information and the more your parents can tell</v>

102
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>you about what happened in those situations,</v>

103
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I would say the better off you're likely to be.</v>

104
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's about all I can say about that.</v>

105
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>That's fairly delineated approach to general discussions about difficult things.</v>

106
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:48.191
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

107
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 1>But I would say don't be afraid of,</v>

108
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.100
<v Speaker 1>don't be more afraid of engaging in this process then you are afraid of not</v>

109
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>engaging in it.</v>

110
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Like every relationship you have is going to have problems in it.</v>

111
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

112
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:06.661
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to jump to a intense psychological discussion with every little</v>

113
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:07.864
<v Speaker 1>bump.</v>

114
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>But if there's something,</v>

115
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

116
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>medium to longterm permanence that's disturbing you,</v>

117
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>or a pattern that repeats itself at least three times,</v>

118
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.091
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

119
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>well then that might be something that's worthy of discussion or your discovery</v>

120
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>that you're very dissatisfied with the way the relationship is going,</v>

121
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>and you have to have the conflict necessary to sort that out.</v>

122
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to be conflict with you and the Co and the person that you're</v>

123
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:34.661
<v Speaker 1>talking to.</v>

124
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:39.661
<v Speaker 1>But the aim should be the establishment of something like fully informed,</v>

125
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>fully negotiated medium to longterm piece.</v>

126
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're aiming at.</v>

127
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 1>If you have any sense.</v>
