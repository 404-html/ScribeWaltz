1
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.001
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea in very deep idea and clinical psychology,</v>

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>a fundamental idea,</v>

4
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>which is that if someone's anxious about something,</v>

5
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you,</v>

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's getting in their way.</v>

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>You take what they're anxious about,</v>

8
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>define it cause that already d limits it,</v>

10
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:23.221
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the problems with being anxious about something as you won't</v>

12
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:26.754
<v Speaker 1>speak of it,</v>

13
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like Voldemort.</v>

14
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And then if you don't speak of it,</v>

15
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>it's way bigger than it should be.</v>

16
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you start talking about it,</v>

17
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>you cut it down to size.</v>

18
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.453
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

19
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.781
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

20
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>it's for a bunch of reasons.</v>

21
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:37.734
<v Speaker 1>It's because you're not as,</v>

22
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>you're not as afraid of as many things as you think and you're braver than you</v>

23
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:43.524
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

24
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>and more and more capable.</v>

25
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you're brave enough to start talking about what you're afraid of,</v>

26
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>then you see that there's more to you than you thought and that there's less to</v>

27
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>the problem than you thought.</v>

28
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>And then you can decompose it further into smaller problems and then you can</v>

29
00:00:57.431 --> 00:00:59.530
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to approach those smaller problems.</v>

30
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.693
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

31
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.060
<v Speaker 1>and then it doesn't seem to meet to be that you get less frightened.</v>

32
00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be that you get more courageous,</v>

33
00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:09.070
<v Speaker 1>which is way better than being less frightened because there's lots of things to</v>

34
00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:09.761
<v Speaker 1>be frightened about.</v>

35
00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:12.340
<v Speaker 1>So if you're courageous that that really does the trick.</v>

36
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is what happens if you like,</v>

37
00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you're a very socially inept and you don't know how to introduce</v>

38
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>yourself or to make any established the initial parts of relationship with</v>

39
00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:25.420
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>

40
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 1>And so then you start putting yourself in situations where you're required to do</v>

41
00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:30.340
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

42
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.510
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is,</v>

43
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.900
<v Speaker 1>how is it technically that you transform?</v>

44
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.561
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

45
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:35.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

46
00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>you learn well,</v>

47
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:39.010
<v Speaker 1>we want to be more specific about that.</v>

48
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean that you learn?</v>

49
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.021
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with someone who's particularly socially inept and you're</v>

51
00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:45.880
<v Speaker 1>doing psychotherapy with them,</v>

52
00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 1>you might teach them how to shake someone's hand properly and say their name and</v>

53
00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:51.400
<v Speaker 1>remember the other person's name.</v>

54
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.260
<v Speaker 1>So you just practice that with them so that they have the motoric routine down.</v>

55
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.990
<v Speaker 1>So that form of knowledge is built right into your body.</v>

56
00:01:58.991 --> 00:01:59.291
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

57
00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:00.400
<v Speaker 1>look at the person,</v>

58
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.720
<v Speaker 1>put out your hand,</v>

59
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.291
<v Speaker 1>shake it.</v>

60
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't not like a dead Halibut,</v>

61
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.030
<v Speaker 1>but you know with a reasonable grip,</v>

62
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.440
<v Speaker 1>say your name,</v>

63
00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 1>don't mumble it.</v>

64
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

65
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Speaker 1>look at them so that they can hear you.</v>

66
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.580
<v Speaker 1>And then when they say their name,</v>

67
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:13.540
<v Speaker 1>tried to remember it,</v>

68
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.570
<v Speaker 1>and that's men.</v>

69
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.600
<v Speaker 1>So you can practice that with people.</v>

70
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:18.970
<v Speaker 1>And so then they develop something that's motoric,</v>

71
00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:19.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It's embedded right in their body.</v>

73
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.053
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

74
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 1>and then you can say to them,</v>

75
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>well the other thing you can do is when you start a conversation is don't sit</v>

76
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.990
<v Speaker 1>there thinking about what you're going to say next.</v>

77
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Because then you won't be paying attention to the person and you'll make a fool</v>

78
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:38.450
<v Speaker 1>out of yourself because you'll manifest nonsequitors.</v>

79
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

80
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Because you'll get out of,</v>

81
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you're dancing and all you're paying attention to is where your</v>

82
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:43.634
<v Speaker 1>feet are,</v>

83
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to step on the other person all the time.</v>

84
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Speaker 1>So you want to pay attention to the other person and then whatever automatized</v>

85
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>social knowledge you have will come to the forefront.</v>

86
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's a good thing to know if you're socially anxious,</v>

87
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

88
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Speaker 1>If you're socially anxious,</v>

89
00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you should do is pay way more to the person you're talking to</v>

90
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>rather than less.</v>

91
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>And you should pay as little attention as possible to yourself.</v>

92
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>So if you feel yourself falling in because you're anxious,</v>

93
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>then what you do is you push your attention out and pay attention to the person</v>

94
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>because to the degree that you've been socialized,</v>

95
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.290
<v Speaker 1>then all your automatic responses will kick in.</v>

96
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.141
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

97
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:17.661
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

98
00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>so you go out into the social world and you learn to shake someone's hand and</v>

99
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>you learn how to listen to them and ask them questions because that's the next</v>

100
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:25.781
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

101
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Because people love,</v>

102
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you can't just ask them random questions,</v>

103
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:29.771
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

104
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>But if they start talking to you and you don't understand something about what</v>

105
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>they're saying or maybe something they said is interesting and you ask them a</v>

106
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

107
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty damn happy about that because it means you're actually paying</v>

108
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>attention to them and people actually love to be paid attention to because it</v>

109
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>hardly ever happens.</v>

110
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.691
<v Speaker 1>So they really,</v>

111
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:47.441
<v Speaker 1>really like it.</v>

112
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:48.274
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

113
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.581
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

114
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

115
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>so what's happening?</v>

116
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>

117
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>you're mastering the automated motor movements,</v>

118
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

119
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Where to point your eyes,</v>

120
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>where to put your hands,</v>

121
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>how to move your lips,</v>

122
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>like really embodied knowledge.</v>

123
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a special kind of memory and you're practicing that.</v>

124
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>And so that's building new skills for you.</v>

125
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>And then by listening to the person and watching yourself interact,</v>

126
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>you're also generating new,</v>

127
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 1>new abstract information that enables you to conceptualize the world in a</v>

128
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>

129
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>So if you go out to 10 you go out and talk to 10 different people or 50</v>

130
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>different people,</v>

131
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>then you get to listen to what those 50 people said.</v>

132
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>You get to watch how they're,</v>

133
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 1>how they express themselves and you gather a corpus of knowledge,</v>

134
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:33.611
<v Speaker 1>the changes,</v>

135
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 1>the way you perceive that broadens you as a social agent.</v>

136
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.361
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

137
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:38.830
<v Speaker 1>So that's two forms of knowledge.</v>

138
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>But then there's a third one which is really interesting,</v>

139
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 1>which is that you know,</v>

140
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of biological potential and it's hard to know what potentially</v>

141
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:47.861
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

142
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:52.861
<v Speaker 1>but part of it is that you're capable of generating proteins that you haven't</v>

143
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 1>been generating.</v>

144
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>So you should get right on that by the way.</v>

145
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.953
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

146
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>but what the way that works in part is that if you put yourself in a radically</v>

147
00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>new situation,</v>

148
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 1>then your brain that,</v>

149
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 1>that there are genetic switches that turn on because of the demands of the new</v>

150
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:08.854
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

151
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 1>that code for new proteins.</v>

152
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's as if you have latent software.</v>

153
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:18.790
<v Speaker 1>That would be one way of thinking about that will only be turned on if you go</v>

154
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>into the situation where that's necessary.</v>

155
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might think,</v>

156
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

157
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>

158
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>how much have you could be turned on if you went a whole bunch of different</v>

159
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:28.054
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

160
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really,</v>

161
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

162
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.620
<v Speaker 1>that's a profound question because one of the deep answers to how you should get</v>

163
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:40.681
<v Speaker 1>your life together is you should go a very large number of places and turn</v>

164
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>yourself on.</v>
