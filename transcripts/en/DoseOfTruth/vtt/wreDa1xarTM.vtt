1
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.490
<v Speaker 1>So this is what had to say about Socialists.</v>

2
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>It might be sad,</v>

3
00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:14.271
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

4
00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:19.271
<v Speaker 1>that even if the theoretical oriented book trained socialist is not a working</v>

5
00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:20.750
<v Speaker 1>man himself,</v>

6
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.810
<v Speaker 1>at least he has actually created by a love of the working class he's endeavoring</v>

7
00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:29.330
<v Speaker 1>to shed is bourgeois status and fight on the side of the proletariat.</v>

8
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that must be his motive,</v>

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.463
<v Speaker 1>but is it</v>

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I look at the socialist,</v>

11
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual tract writing type of socialist with his pullover because fuzzy</v>

12
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.800
<v Speaker 1>hair and his Marxist quotation and wonder what the devil is.</v>

13
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Motive really is.</v>

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>It's really difficult to believe that it's a love of anybody,</v>

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>especially if the working class from whom he is of all people,</v>

16
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker 1>the furthest removed.</v>

17
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that too many people calling them socialists revolution does not</v>

18
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>mean a movement of the masses with which they hope to associate themselves.</v>

19
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>It means instead of set of reforms which we the clever ones are going to impose</v>

20
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 1>on them the lower orders.</v>

21
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

22
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>it would be a mistake to regard the book train socialist as a bloodless</v>

23
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:17.661
<v Speaker 1>creature,</v>

24
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 1>entirely incapable of emotion,</v>

25
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>though seldom giving much evidence of affection for the exploited</v>

26
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>is perfectly capable of displaying hatred,</v>

27
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>sort of queer theoretical in vacuum.</v>

28
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:31.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

29
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>hatred against the explorers.</v>

30
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Hence the grand old social sport of denouncing the bourgeoisie.</v>

31
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>It is strange how easily almost any socialist writer can lash himself into</v>

32
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>frenzies of rage against the class too,</v>

33
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>which by birth or by adoption,</v>

34
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 1>he himself almost invariably belongs.</v>

35
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

36
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I worked for the NDP when I was a kid and I had privileged access to the</v>

37
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:02.510
<v Speaker 1>leadership for provincially and federally for reasons that I won't go into.</v>

38
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that</v>

39
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 1>many of them were honorable people who were really striving to give the working</v>

40
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:10.864
<v Speaker 1>class of voice.</v>

41
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that the working class needs a voice,</v>

42
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.170
<v Speaker 1>a political voice for obvious reasons.</v>

43
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.683
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I think the Democrats in the United States have made an absolutely dreadful</v>

45
00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:28.051
<v Speaker 1>abysmal mistake replacing their working class,</v>

46
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.450
<v Speaker 1>political ethos with identity politics.</v>

47
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.920
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about that.</v>

48
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.911
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

49
00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:34.744
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think the situation has changed that much.</v>

51
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that's happened in the United States is that</v>

52
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.630
<v Speaker 1>world stability and peace in some ways has been purchased at the expense of</v>

53
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.180
<v Speaker 1>North American working class wellbeing now because the Chinese have got rich</v>

54
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>compared to 30 years ago,</v>

55
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.071
<v Speaker 1>40 years ago,</v>

56
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>50 years ago,</v>

57
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

58
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>the Indians have gotten rich again,</v>

59
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>same comparison basis.</v>

60
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>There's more middle class people in India now than there are on the United</v>

61
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.020
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

62
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>the trade arrangements that have been in North America allowed for the rise of</v>

64
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>middle classes globally at the same time,</v>

65
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 1>they opened up the working class in North America to competition from those low</v>

66
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>wage sources.</v>

67
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's a good deal.</v>

68
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.631
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say,</v>

69
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

70
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's not such a bad thing that the Chinese aren't starving and it's not</v>

71
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>such a bad thing that the Indians aren't starving and that those societies are</v>

72
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>transforming themselves actually into communities that are quite wealthy.</v>

73
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like hooray for that.</v>

74
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolutely miraculous transformation.</v>

75
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>It's the most rapid growth of human wealth in the history of humanity.</v>

76
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>So we should be pretty happy about that,</v>

77
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>but we should also remember at least to some degree who's paid the price for it</v>

78
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>and so as far as I'm concerned,</v>

79
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>the working class needs a voice</v>

80
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.033
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

81
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.860
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious that they have one at the moment.</v>

82
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Having said that,</v>

83
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.080
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

84
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.080
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me at all</v>

85
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>that the people who purport to stand for the working class actually do so or</v>

86
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.630
<v Speaker 1>that if they do so that the reason they do so is because they're all</v>

87
00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and sympathetic and loving and kind and St.</v>

88
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm more convinced by Orwell's argument.</v>

89
00:04:31.311 --> 00:04:33.260
<v Speaker 1>So back to the NDP,</v>

90
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.410
<v Speaker 1>the people I met at the leadership level,</v>

91
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them I had a fair bit of admiration for,</v>

92
00:04:39.891 --> 00:04:43.610
<v Speaker 1>but as I worked with the party over about a five year period,</v>

93
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.350
<v Speaker 1>there's this contradiction that Cape kept emerging for me and that was that I</v>

94
00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:51.710
<v Speaker 1>didn't really like the low level party functionary activist types.</v>

95
00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Like they just weren't personally appealing to me.</v>

96
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.600
<v Speaker 1>They seem peevish and resentful.</v>

97
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.050
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time I was going to college,</v>

98
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I was about 17.</v>

99
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I got elected to the Senate on the College Board of Governors and at that time</v>

100
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Alberta was conservative politically,</v>

101
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.261
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:10.250
<v Speaker 1>It still is of course,</v>

103
00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 1>but they.</v>

104
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.730
<v Speaker 1>It was part of the progressive conservative</v>

105
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.580
<v Speaker 1>empire because they ruled Alberta forever and all the board of governor members</v>

106
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 1>were basically nominees,</v>

107
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

108
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 1>They were conservative nominees,</v>

109
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 1>so these were conservative people and I was an NDP member and I thought and I'd</v>

110
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:32.060
<v Speaker 1>worked for small businessman to who weren't NDP.</v>

111
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>They were.</v>

112
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 1>They were conserved.</v>

113
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.530
<v Speaker 1>It never figured that out,</v>

114
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you about that in a minute,</v>

115
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 1>but I had a bad case of cognitive dissonance because actually turned out that I</v>

116
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>admired the people on the board of governors and they were mostly.</v>

117
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 1>It was in grand prairie.</v>

118
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not a very big place and it's not very old.</v>

119
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>And so if you were reasonably successful in grand prairie,</v>

120
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you inherited your money from the aristocrat aristocracy</v>

121
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>was like zero because there wasn't one.</v>

122
00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

123
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 1>The whole damn town was 50 years old.</v>

124
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>So if you had any influencer or wealth,</v>

125
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>you are a small businessman,</v>

126
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>small to middle sized businessmen,</v>

127
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:07.874
<v Speaker 1>and you'd</v>

128
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 2>you knew what you were doing.</v>

129
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.520
<v Speaker 1>And I actually admired these people.</v>

130
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.031
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

131
00:06:13.031 --> 00:06:14.140
<v Speaker 1>well that's not very good.</v>

132
00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I mire them and I don't share their political views.</v>

133
00:06:17.141 --> 00:06:20.140
<v Speaker 1>And then there's these other people with whom I hypothetically share political</v>

134
00:06:20.141 --> 00:06:22.060
<v Speaker 1>views and I don't admire them at all.</v>

135
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.411
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

136
00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:25.180
<v Speaker 1>And then I read road to Wigan pier and I thought,</v>

137
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

138
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.483
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

139
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>They don't like the poor.</v>

140
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 1>They just hate the rich.</v>

141
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>

142
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same set of motivations.</v>

143
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say that you're a postmodernist and you privileged compassion for</v>

144
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>the oppressed.</v>

145
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.231
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>

146
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:45.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

147
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>what are you pushed to the margins?</v>

148
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

149
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing with all your hatred and resentment and you're evil.</v>

150
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't have any of that.</v>

151
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad theory.</v>

152
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a really bad theory.</v>

153
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:02.131
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

154
00:07:02.131 --> 00:07:02.880
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

155
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So you can say,</v>

156
00:07:03.751 --> 00:07:04.584
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

157
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.580
<v Speaker 1>you can say that,</v>

158
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.200
<v Speaker 1>but I don't buy it.</v>

159
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I still think that the people who stand to speak for the oppressed are in fact</v>

160
00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:13.860
<v Speaker 1>motivated by empathy and sympathy.</v>

161
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Their hearts are in the right place.</v>

162
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.171
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

163
00:07:16.171 --> 00:07:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't really buy that either because I don't really think generally speaking</v>

164
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>that it's a credible claim for someone to make that their heart is in the right</v>

165
00:07:25.441 --> 00:07:26.274
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

166
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Now you can ask that of yourself and if you think your heart is in the right</v>

167
00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:30.781
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

168
00:07:30.781 --> 00:07:32.580
<v Speaker 1>well more power to you.</v>

169
00:07:32.581 --> 00:07:32.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

170
00:07:32.941 --> 00:07:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

171
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't see the halo from here.</v>

172
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.373
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

173
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:46.230
<v Speaker 1>and so given that you're just as malevolent as your neighbor or maybe even more</v>

174
00:07:46.681 --> 00:07:51.681
<v Speaker 1>so and that that's actually pretty malevolent given the intrinsic nature of</v>

175
00:07:51.961 --> 00:07:52.860
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>

176
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but wonder what you're doing with all those traits that you're not</v>

177
00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.253
<v Speaker 1>admitting to,</v>

178
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 2>but you can.</v>

179
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 1>You could even object.</v>

180
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:03.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

181
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:04.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty pessimistic view of humankind.</v>

183
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not by the way,</v>

184
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 1>it's just not naive,</v>

185
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:10.161
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

186
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 1>you could object that and you can say no.</v>

187
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:13.214
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

188
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 1>the weight of moral authority is in fact on the left,</v>

189
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 1>even the radical left with those who identify with the oppressed and who are</v>

190
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>working to better their conditions.</v>

191
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.053
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

192
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.730
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

193
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.321
<v Speaker 1>So then let's say,</v>

194
00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:31.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

195
00:08:31.531 --> 00:08:36.531
<v Speaker 1>let's give those people some power and if they're actually motivated by</v>

196
00:08:36.781 --> 00:08:39.840
<v Speaker 1>compassion and empathy and desire for the working class,</v>

197
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.170
<v Speaker 1>if you give them power and you give their ideas power,</v>

198
00:08:43.171 --> 00:08:46.020
<v Speaker 1>then as those ideas unfold in real time,</v>

199
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find out like,</v>

200
00:08:47.371 --> 00:08:50.580
<v Speaker 1>did things get better for the working class,</v>

201
00:08:50.581 --> 00:08:51.414
<v Speaker 1>let's say?</v>

202
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Or did they get worse?</v>

203
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Because we could.</v>

204
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 1>We could consider that like an experiment.</v>

205
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 1>We could consider the outcome proof.</v>

206
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what else you would do.</v>

207
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how else you would.</v>

208
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>You would come to your decision because it's just theory until you see it</v>

209
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
