00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>There's the,</v>

2
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.110
<v Speaker 1>the chemical makeup of the classic psychedelics.</v>

3
00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:11.361
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

4
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>they all have the same fundamental structure.</v>

5
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 1>This is serotonin.</v>

6
00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:17.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the one of the major brain neurotransmitters.</v>

7
00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens with the psychedelics is that they,</v>

8
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>they altered the,</v>

9
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>they alter the brain function by altering the neurochemical utilization of</v>

10
00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:29.410
<v Speaker 1>serotonin.</v>

11
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>They changed the manner in which the serotonergic systems work.</v>

12
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.280
<v Speaker 1>And that is the serotonin system is very basic system may cause when you're an</v>

13
00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>embryo and your brain is developing,</v>

14
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:42.130
<v Speaker 1>it's the serotonin projections that basically orchestrate the development of</v>

15
00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:42.964
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>

16
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.780
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

17
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Speaker 1>and they're very archaic circuits,</v>

18
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:45.551
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

19
00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 1>very archaic circuits.</v>

20
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.973
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

21
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>and this is the paper,</v>

22
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I think I stole this from a silicide Ben Griffiths,</v>

23
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>who's been doing a lot of this research siliciden can occasion mystical type</v>

24
00:00:57.561 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual</v>

25
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>

26
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>So why,</v>

27
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

28
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:07.251
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

29
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Like so,</v>

30
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.470
<v Speaker 1>so here's a question for you.</v>

31
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 1>It is beyond dispute that human beings are capable of religious experience.</v>

32
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.523
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

33
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

34
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.593
<v Speaker 1>Exactly?</v>

35
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.591
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

36
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:20.450
<v Speaker 1>you can associate with psychosis,</v>

37
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.600
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't work is the theory doesn't hold a theory,</v>

38
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>doesn't hold water.</v>

39
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>

40
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.530
<v Speaker 1>So why is it there?</v>

41
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.483
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

42
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.211
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

43
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy thing to figure out.</v>

44
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Like I've been trying to figure,</v>

45
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm always trying to figure out a biological explanation for everything,</v>

46
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:35.371
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

47
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Because if you want to find something to stand on and you want to make sure that</v>

48
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>it can resist the challenge.</v>

49
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And so if I can find an explanation for something that's reductionistic and</v>

50
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>materialistic and biological,</v>

51
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going for that.</v>

52
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>But that's a tough one.</v>

53
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness is a tough one.</v>

54
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

55
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>the moral sense is a tough one.</v>

56
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>They're not easy things to crack.</v>

57
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>The Big Bang is a tough one.</v>

58
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.913
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

59
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

61
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:01.960
<v Speaker 1>a cynic might say that maybe.</v>

62
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when people are close to suicide,</v>

64
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>they'll have a mystical experience,</v>

65
00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:09.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.420
<v Speaker 1>and you maybe you say,</v>

67
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:10.601
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:14.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a last ditch attempt of your brain to delude you into thinking that your</v>

69
00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:16.450
<v Speaker 1>life has some significance.</v>

70
00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:17.200
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

71
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's a plausible theory,</v>

72
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.250
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it accounts for the generality of the phenomena,</v>

73
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.773
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

74
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 1>so I don't buy it.</v>
