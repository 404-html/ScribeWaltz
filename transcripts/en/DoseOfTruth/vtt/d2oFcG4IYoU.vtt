1
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.090
<v Speaker 1>What you've been writing and thinking about and people's reaction to it</v>

2
00:00:10.091 --> 00:00:11.980
<v Speaker 1>intersects with tonight's debate.</v>

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.520
<v Speaker 1>because you've been quite vocal on the topic of political correctness.</v>

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.940
<v Speaker 1>No fan of the radical left and it,</v>

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:20.351
<v Speaker 1>and people might say,</v>

8
00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:20.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

9
00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>does that mean you support the radical,</v>

10
00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:22.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.523
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

12
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.560
<v Speaker 1>just because you're no fan of the radical left doesn't mean you support the</v>

13
00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:26.891
<v Speaker 1>radical,</v>

14
00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:27.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>That's an absolutely a preposterous proposition.</v>

16
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.050
<v Speaker 1>But the universities,</v>

17
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:34.060
<v Speaker 1>especially the humanities and social sciences,</v>

18
00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:37.780
<v Speaker 1>are absolutely dominated by left wing thinking.</v>

19
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.720
<v Speaker 1>That's well documented by people like Jonathan Heit.</v>

20
00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not my imagination.</v>

21
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>And I find the doctrine that unites them to be unconscionably pernicious.</v>

22
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.750
<v Speaker 1>It's basically a collectivist doctrine.</v>

23
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.480
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that disturbs me about it,</v>

24
00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>but there's every reason to have a left wing.</v>

25
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>The reason you need a left wing is partly because being left wing is in part</v>

26
00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:04.954
<v Speaker 1>temperamental.</v>

27
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not going away.</v>

28
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 1>And also because when our society produces hierarchies,</v>

29
00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.840
<v Speaker 1>which will inevitably do,</v>

30
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.050
<v Speaker 1>people tend to stack up at the bottom of hierarchies.</v>

31
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 1>It's in the nature of hierarchies to produce that as an outcome.</v>

32
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:24.601
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that the people who are dispossessed in the hierarchical</v>

33
00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 1>arrangements need a voice and that's the left obviously,</v>

34
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 1>and and fair enough.</v>

35
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>But it's also obvious that just as the right can go too far,</v>

36
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>the left can go too far,</v>

37
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.540
<v Speaker 1>but when the left goes too far is something that's very ill defined.</v>

38
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And to me that's,</v>

39
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>that's not acceptable given that we know that the left can go too far and I</v>

40
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:54.271
<v Speaker 1>think they've certainly gone too far in the universities and the postmodern neo</v>

41
00:01:55.661 --> 00:02:00.661
<v Speaker 1>Marxists pastiche that makes up the radical left philosophy that's at the bottom</v>

42
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:05.590
<v Speaker 1>of the social sciences and humanities now is there's nothing about it that's</v>

43
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.090
<v Speaker 1>useful as far as I'm concerned,</v>

44
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 1>that has nothing to do with compassion,</v>

45
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with lack of my lack of,</v>

46
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.613
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

47
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Empathy.</v>

48
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.523
<v Speaker 1>precisely.</v>

50
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.660
<v Speaker 1>They're completely separate issues.</v>

51
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing that really bothers me about political correctness.</v>

52
00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:23.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

53
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 1>we have a hammer lock on empathy.</v>

55
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like a empathy is not enough.</v>

56
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not even close to enough.</v>

57
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And an excess of empathy can do terrible things.</v>

58
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>

59
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.281
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

60
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:35.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a hammerlock on empathy.</v>

61
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.360
<v Speaker 1>And to ally that with a philosophy that essentially assigns people to their</v>

62
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>identity via their group membership.</v>

63
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.180
<v Speaker 1>And then to read not only the current state of affairs,</v>

64
00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:50.980
<v Speaker 1>but history itself as a battleground between competing groups is,</v>

65
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's dangerous.</v>

66
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it's obvious that it's dangerous if you know anything about history,</v>

67
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>but one you're sure to hear tonight</v>

68
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 2>is this idea of privilege that certain people by virtue,</v>

69
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

70
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Uni,</v>

71
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.930
<v Speaker 2>by virtue of our,</v>

72
00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 2>our race,</v>

73
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 2>our class,</v>

74
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 2>our gender,</v>

75
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.220
<v Speaker 2>have enjoyed historically privilege in society and it's time that that privilege</v>

76
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 2>be shared more equitably across groups who've been historically disadvantaged.</v>

77
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.591
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:24.120
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example of the conflation of empathy with ideology.</v>

79
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like first of all,</v>

80
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.340
<v Speaker 1>the majority in any society has privilege.</v>

81
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole point of the society is to set up a system so that the bulk of</v>

82
00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:38.880
<v Speaker 1>the people in the system can do well while,</v>

83
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.580
<v Speaker 1>and then you have you built in protection for minorities.</v>

84
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.260
<v Speaker 1>So to conflate that with race is not acceptable.</v>

85
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.573
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of,</v>

86
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a toxic sleight of hand and it's extraordinarily dangerous.</v>

87
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.540
<v Speaker 1>So apart from that,</v>

88
00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:55.620
<v Speaker 1>it's an empty claim.</v>

89
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Some people have advantages that other people don't.</v>

90
00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously,</v>

91
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.250
<v Speaker 1>and if you take apart anyone into the multitude of categories that they can be</v>

92
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:06.360
<v Speaker 1>taken apart into,</v>

93
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.480
<v Speaker 1>what you'll find is that on some of those dimensions,</v>

94
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.460
<v Speaker 1>they're doing better than other people for rather arbitrary reasons sometimes.</v>

95
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.770
<v Speaker 1>And on other dimensions they're doing worse.</v>

96
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.820
<v Speaker 1>So it purple.</v>

97
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.800
<v Speaker 1>And then the next part of that is while historically speaking,</v>

98
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:23.101
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

99
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:23.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

100
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.040
<v Speaker 1>over what span of time do you mean?</v>

101
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:31.041
<v Speaker 1>Precisely so you mean because my ancestors 150 years ago were privileged</v>

102
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.200
<v Speaker 1>comparatively speaking,</v>

103
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:35.940
<v Speaker 1>that I should somehow pay for that now.</v>

104
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.260
<v Speaker 1>And Are you so sure.</v>

105
00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:40.200
<v Speaker 1>My ancestors were so privileged as far as I can tell.</v>

106
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.810
<v Speaker 1>My grandparents on my father's side,</v>

107
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.930
<v Speaker 1>my father grew up in a log cabin until he was five.</v>

108
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.430
<v Speaker 1>He had like three rooms.</v>

109
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother was a cleaning woman,</v>

110
00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 1>fur fur farms in the,</v>

111
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.100
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

112
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.830
<v Speaker 1>in central Saskatchewan in the 1930s she cooked for threshing cruise.</v>

113
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

114
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.780
<v Speaker 1>she chopped wood piles that were as big as the damn cabin to get through the</v>

115
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.810
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>

116
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like where?</v>

117
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Where's the privilege?</v>

118
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I see it accrues to me as a consequence of my race.</v>

119
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

120
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:05.791
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

121
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:08.130
<v Speaker 1>So we're now we're going to have a discussion about race are Wayne.</v>

122
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.121
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

123
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:13.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing about the toxic left is that everything is about group</v>

124
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:14.184
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

125
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.120
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say,</v>

126
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.130
<v Speaker 1>let's even take the argument further though and say,</v>

127
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:17.401
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

128
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:19.260
<v Speaker 1>well because of my skin color,</v>

129
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm differentially privileged.</v>

130
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.381
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

131
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:23.940
<v Speaker 1>So from,</v>

132
00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:25.320
<v Speaker 1>from a historical perspective,</v>

133
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.280
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

134
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.080
<v Speaker 1>so what you're going to make everybody be on the basis of their race now pay for</v>

135
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:34.740
<v Speaker 1>some historical inequity and you're going to view the,</v>

136
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.310
<v Speaker 1>the history of the relationships between men and women as one fundamentally of</v>

137
00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:39.144
<v Speaker 1>oppression.</v>

138
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the way we're going to play this is that it wasn't that men and women see</v>

139
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.350
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally cooperated throughout history to bring themselves out of the</v>

140
00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:52.530
<v Speaker 1>fundamental catastrophe that history has always been.</v>

141
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what it was.</v>

142
00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:58.551
<v Speaker 1>Despite the fact that in 1895 the typical person in the western world lived on</v>

143
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>less than a dollar a day.</v>

144
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 1>By today's standards,</v>

145
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>which is far below the UN's current guidelines for abject poverty.</v>

146
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 1>We're going to revisit that.</v>

147
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>We're going to say no.</v>

148
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:07.281
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

149
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental reality of the world was that men are oppressed women.</v>

150
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.013
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

151
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.273
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

152
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>So that brings me to a second argument that you are no doubt going to hear</v>

153
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:17.241
<v Speaker 1>tonight,</v>

154
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

155
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 1>men need to check their privilege.</v>

157
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 1>That there's an idea here that,</v>

158
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

159
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>women in particular the me too movement.</v>

161
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>There's been a,</v>

162
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>an awareness and awakening the part of the power of women in society and it's</v>

163
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:32.211
<v Speaker 1>time that,</v>

164
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>that be acknowledged.</v>

165
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 1>What will be your response to that?</v>

166
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

167
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.831
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

168
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>when the discussion is about power,</v>

169
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 1>that sends a shutter up my spine immediately,</v>

171
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 1>partly because part of the postmodern doctrine,</v>

172
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 1>especially in its alliance with neo Marxism,</v>

173
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:48.940
<v Speaker 1>which is squirrel,</v>

174
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 1>strangest alliance by,</v>

175
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>by my estimates,</v>

176
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.690
<v Speaker 1>everything's about power.</v>

177
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>And I don't believe that.</v>

178
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that hierarchies are only about power when they've already transformed</v>

179
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>themselves into tyrannies.</v>

180
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that the fundamental hierarchies that characterize the west</v>

181
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>art t radical comparatively speaking,</v>

182
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.640
<v Speaker 1>like compared to the heavenly hierarchy in your utopian imagination,</v>

183
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 1>no doubt there exemplars of pure hell,</v>

184
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 1>but compared to everywhere else in the world right now and every other hierarchy</v>

185
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>throughout history,</v>

186
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>we're doing pretty damn well.</v>

187
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 1>And the fact is is that once we had reliable birth control,</v>

188
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>which really only happened in the 1960s,</v>

189
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.360
<v Speaker 1>women were welcomed most fundamentally,</v>

190
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:33.430
<v Speaker 1>although also opposed,</v>

191
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 1>but most fundamentally welcomed into every position of authority and competence</v>

192
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>that could possibly be laid open to them,</v>

193
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 1>to the point where now they make up something like it's damn near three quarters</v>

194
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>of humanities and social sciences students,</v>

195
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 1>they dominate the healthcare fields.</v>

196
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.060
<v Speaker 1>So how fast do you expect the transformation to take place?</v>

197
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>While the argument is,</v>

198
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:54.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

199
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 1>it would've never happened without political pressure.</v>

200
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

201
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.093
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

202
00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.993
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

203
00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.833
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

204
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.860
<v Speaker 1>What triggered it was reliable birth control and that made it possible.</v>

205
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.671
<v Speaker 1>It was reliable,</v>

206
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 1>birth control and reliable,</v>

207
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.683
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

208
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 1>menstrual sanitation and all of those things that no one ever takes into account</v>

209
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 1>that made the playing field open and it's transformed utterly.</v>

210
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:19.341
<v Speaker 1>And in what,</v>

211
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:20.390
<v Speaker 1>50 years,</v>

212
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 1>how fast do you think these things can happen?</v>

213
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

214
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

215
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.020
<v Speaker 1>and I'm certainly not against equality of opportunity.</v>

216
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:27.854
<v Speaker 1>You have to be here.</v>

217
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

218
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.670
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what has to be wrong with you to be against equality of opportunity.</v>

219
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

220
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>even if you're selfish,</v>

221
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:41.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're not absolutely out for destruction and you're only selfish,</v>

222
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 1>let's say anybody with any sense would go for equality of opportunity at least</v>

223
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>because it gives you the possibility of exploiting the maximum number of</v>

224
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.260
<v Speaker 1>qualified and talented people.</v>

225
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.281
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

226
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:53.510
<v Speaker 1>and equality of outcome.</v>

227
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:54.344
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

228
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.980
<v Speaker 2>we'll save that for the debate tonight.</v>

229
00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it'll come up.</v>

230
00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:58.931
<v Speaker 2>Final question.</v>

231
00:08:58.931 --> 00:09:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking all of you pre debate.</v>

232
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think this debate is going to go from here?</v>

233
00:09:02.471 --> 00:09:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you think we're,</v>

234
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.690
<v Speaker 2>we're in a kind of cultural spasm or do you think there's something more</v>

235
00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:09.400
<v Speaker 2>fundamental happening in our culture,</v>

236
00:09:09.401 --> 00:09:10.720
<v Speaker 2>a new tribalism,</v>

237
00:09:10.721 --> 00:09:14.560
<v Speaker 2>a new set of antagonisms they're going to take much longer to work at?</v>

238
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it'll depend on how well we each behave in the next 10 years because I</v>

239
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 1>think things could get way better everywhere really fast,</v>

240
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>or we could degenerate back into our idiot 20th century.</v>

241
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Tribalisms and I would say,</v>

242
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 1>if I had to bet,</v>

243
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:35.454
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

244
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:35.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:09:35.931 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

246
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.820
<v Speaker 1>what are you seeing?</v>

247
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.481
<v Speaker 2>You're out there,</v>

248
00:09:37.481 --> 00:09:40.000
<v Speaker 2>you're in the public's.</v>

249
00:09:40.001 --> 00:09:40.834
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

250
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

251
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

252
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

253
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I would say that</v>

254
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.700
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of pressure in both directions.</v>

255
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:55.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

256
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm heartened by the fact that so many people</v>

257
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 1>have been taking the psychological material that I've been providing online to</v>

258
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 1>heart and doing what they can to put themselves together.</v>

259
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm disheartened by the fact that</v>

260
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.540
<v Speaker 1>everything now is transformed into,</v>

261
00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:15.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

262
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.880
<v Speaker 1>virtually everything is transformed into a polarized political argument.</v>

263
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:25.210
<v Speaker 1>And there seems to be no understanding of the fact that not everything is</v>

264
00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:26.660
<v Speaker 1>actually political.</v>

265
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.130
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't think that,</v>

266
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the discussion about political correctness,</v>

267
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.693
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

268
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

269
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's both theological and philosophical,</v>

270
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

271
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:42.050
<v Speaker 1>it's always presented are often presented in politicize terms,</v>

272
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:47.110
<v Speaker 1>not least because if you're influenced by the radical leftist collective</v>

273
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.860
<v Speaker 1>collectivist ideology,</v>

274
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.410
<v Speaker 1>that is the only playing field.</v>

275
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.620
<v Speaker 1>It's all hierarchies at each other's throats playing power games.</v>

276
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.320
<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>

277
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.140
<v Speaker 1>The free speech thing is really interesting because on the radical left end of</v>

278
00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:03.411
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

279
00:11:03.411 --> 00:11:03.710
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

280
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.510
<v Speaker 1>there is no debate about free speech.</v>

281
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.400
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a debate about free speech from that ideological position because</v>

282
00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:11.780
<v Speaker 1>there isn't any such thing.</v>

283
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.330
<v Speaker 1>All there is is those who are maneuvering for power within their respective</v>

284
00:11:17.331 --> 00:11:19.500
<v Speaker 1>groups making claims that benefit from,</v>

285
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:19.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

286
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the basic axiom of the interpretive system,</v>

287
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.620
<v Speaker 1>so free speech.</v>

288
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.150
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that it isn't.</v>

289
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.910
<v Speaker 1>The reason that free speech has become politicized is because</v>

290
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.330
<v Speaker 1>if you adopt the collectivist viewpoint,</v>

291
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a shibboleth.</v>

292
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:35.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a fantasy.</v>

293
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.820
<v Speaker 1>You might think you're speaking freely,</v>

294
00:11:37.821 --> 00:11:38.630
<v Speaker 1>but you're not.</v>

295
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.650
<v Speaker 1>You're just expanding on that.</v>

296
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.570
<v Speaker 1>How prevalent gender absolutely.</v>

297
00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:42.404
<v Speaker 1>Smile.</v>

298
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.320
<v Speaker 1>My Rez.</v>

299
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

300
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:44.840
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

301
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.840
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's funny about the postmodern insistence on identity,</v>

302
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it's absolutely comical in a very,</v>

303
00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:53.324
<v Speaker 1>very dark,</v>

304
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 1>is the emergence of intersectionality because the intersectional theorists</v>

305
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:03.510
<v Speaker 1>actually identified the Achilles heel of the collectivist perspective.</v>

306
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

307
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>because what they pointed out was,</v>

308
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:06.971
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

309
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 1>let's say we cover the standard groups.</v>

310
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why these are the standard groups,</v>

311
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 1>but let's say sex,</v>

312
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity and race for the sake of argument.</v>

313
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:17.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

314
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:18.760
<v Speaker 1>what about how they interact?</v>

315
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:19.991
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

316
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:20.824
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

317
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 1>what about that?</v>

318
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.540
<v Speaker 1>What about the fact that gender is infinitely differentiable,</v>

319
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 1>not least from the left wing perspective.</v>

320
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 1>And what about the fact that there's endless numbers of ethnic variance and what</v>

321
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:31.751
<v Speaker 1>are you going to do?</v>

322
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.570
<v Speaker 1>You're going to control for the interaction between all of those.</v>

323
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is yes.</v>

324
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what we'll try to do before we give up our radiology.</v>

325
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.360
<v Speaker 1>But the fact of the matter is,</v>

326
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:44.410
<v Speaker 1>is that the reason the west decided on a radical,</v>

327
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.390
<v Speaker 1>individualistic perspective to begin with is because we figured out 2000 years</v>

328
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:50.224
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

329
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.340
<v Speaker 1>at least at the origins of this type of thinking that,</v>

330
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.870
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

331
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.090
<v Speaker 1>everyone is so unique that you can frack,</v>

332
00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.510
<v Speaker 1>you can fraction hate their group identity right down to the level of the</v>

333
00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

334
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.010
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] well,</v>

335
00:13:02.011 --> 00:13:02.844
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

336
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.593
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

337
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going to happen.</v>

339
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I think the universities for example,</v>

340
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I think they've done themselves yet.</v>

341
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they can escape from,</v>

342
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:12.901
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>

343
00:13:12.901 --> 00:13:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

344
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I've watched large organizations crumble and that can happen very often and</v>

345
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:20.263
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

346
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.590
<v Speaker 1>One serious error.</v>

347
00:13:21.591 --> 00:13:22.424
<v Speaker 1>We'll do it.</v>

348
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think I've tried to lay it out.</v>

349
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I think the universities have made seven serious errors.</v>

350
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't want,</v>

351
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna have to say those for the stage tonight and then universities will</v>

352
00:13:31.991 --> 00:13:34.090
<v Speaker 2>absolutely be a topic of our discussion.</v>

353
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

354
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:39.140
<v Speaker 2>But a real pleasure to get a taste for your remarks and appreciate your passion</v>

355
00:13:39.141 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 2>and your,</v>

356
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:39.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

357
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 2>a willingness to,</v>

358
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.380
<v Speaker 2>to step onto the stage and engage with other people's ideas in a spirit of free</v>

359
00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:47.800
<v Speaker 2>and open exchange.</v>

360
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

361
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully it will go well and it'll be an intelligent discussion and we'll get</v>

362
00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:52.080
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
