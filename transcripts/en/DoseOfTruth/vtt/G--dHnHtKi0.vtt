00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.540
<v Speaker 1>What is your view on psychological egoism?</v>

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>If we're all ultimately acting out of self interest,</v>

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>then does altruism have any merit?</v>

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the questions well post and that's,</v>

5
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those questions that leads into a philosophical,</v>

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>a dead end because it's not well post you.</v>

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>There isn't any such thing as self interest.</v>

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right way to think about it because you're not alone.</v>

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>And so this is why like Piaget,</v>

10
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:31.041
<v Speaker 1>John Piaget cause he thought about this intelligently look first of all,</v>

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>who self interests do you meet?</v>

12
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean your immediate self interest in the next second?</v>

13
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>So that would be impulsive pleasure.</v>

14
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>We're all acting for the gaining of impulsive pleasure and to hell with</v>

15
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:41.574
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

16
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously that's a stupid way to behave because everyone knows that because</v>

17
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>you can do impulsive,</v>

18
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>short term gratifying things like snort cocaine now and you can keep doing that</v>

19
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>and pay off real,</v>

20
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>real well in the extremely short term and they'll just auger you into the ground</v>

21
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>in the medium to long term.</v>

22
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>So if you're acting in your own self interest,</v>

23
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>let's take that apart.</v>

24
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Over what period of time your self interest in the next second you're self</v>

25
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>interest in the next hour.</v>

26
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're impulsive and you want to gratify an impulse,</v>

27
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously acting in your self interest in the next second or the next two</v>

28
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>seconds or the next minute.</v>

29
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>But you know you'll pay for that.</v>

30
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you punch someone or you slap someone cause you're so angry and they,</v>

31
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 1>and they knock you for a loop and then they charge you with assault.</v>

33
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.851
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

34
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>so well it was great in your self interest in the second,</v>

35
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>but like future,</v>

36
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>remember that Simpsons episode,</v>

37
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>homer drank a quart of Manet's and vodka and margin.</v>

38
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>All his kids were telling him not to and he said,</v>

39
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>well that's a problem for future homer.</v>

40
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I sure don't envy that guy.</v>

41
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.311
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

42
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the best Simpson's lines ever,</v>

43
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:52.501
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

44
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>And well that's it.</v>

45
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:53.971
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

46
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:54.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

47
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>well there isn't just you.</v>

48
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

49
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>there's now you and there's tonight you and there's tomorrow morning you,</v>

50
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 1>that's the one that'll have the hangover by the way.</v>

51
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>And there's next week you and next month you and next year you and old you.</v>

52
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're going to act in your self interest,</v>

53
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:14.631
<v Speaker 1>you have to take that collective of use across time into account when you make</v>

54
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:15.594
<v Speaker 1>your decision.</v>

55
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>And now here's the cool thing about that.</v>

56
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>So then that say well that would be acting in your self interest writ large</v>

57
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>right across time spans,</v>

58
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is future you and someone else that you have to live with right</v>

59
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:28.651
<v Speaker 1>now that's not,</v>

60
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>you are pretty much the same people.</v>

61
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're going to act in your self interest and you have other people</v>

62
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:34.561
<v Speaker 1>around you,</v>

63
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:37.860
<v Speaker 1>then you also want to act in their self interest because otherwise they won't</v>

64
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

65
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>they won't cooperate with you and they won't compete with you in a reasonable</v>

66
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

67
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And so that's going to be a catastrophe.</v>

68
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to act out what's good for you now and what's good for you next</v>

69
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.520
<v Speaker 1>month and next year and you want to do that in a way that's good for you and</v>

70
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>your family and your community right now.</v>

71
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Next week and next year and you're going to take all of those things into</v>

72
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>account at the same time.</v>

73
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.390
<v Speaker 1>That's an equivalent rated game from Piaget,</v>

74
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Gideon and perspective,</v>

75
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>and it was his idea that that constituted the basis for proper moral judgment</v>

76
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 1>and it's a brilliant idea.</v>

77
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant idea.</v>

78
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>And so that's your true self interest.</v>

79
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference between your interest in the interest of others,</v>

80
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>not in any fundamental sense,</v>

81
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>even your enemies,</v>

82
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>which is why you're enjoying to treat your enemy as if he was yourself.</v>

83
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Because he is,</v>

84
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:27.071
<v Speaker 1>when you think,</v>

86
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:27.161
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

87
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:27.701
<v Speaker 1>you should wish,</v>

88
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

89
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>you should wish your enemies well.</v>

90
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.573
<v Speaker 1>Well why?</v>

91
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

92
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that you hope they get a bigger house than you.</v>

93
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It's that let's say you're,</v>

94
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>you're being pursued and tormented by someone who's truly reprehensible.</v>

95
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>That person is,</v>

96
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>they have a miserable life man.</v>

97
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.421
<v Speaker 1>In all likelihood,</v>

98
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>let's say they're truly malevolent,</v>

99
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.500
<v Speaker 1>you know they live in hell and what you might hope for them is that they could</v>

100
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get out of there cause it's not good for them and it's not</v>

101
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>good for anyone else think.</v>

102
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:54.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

103
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>even your enemies,</v>

104
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

105
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be good if they could get their act together and stop being so</v>

106
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>unnecessarily malevolent?</v>

107
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's in your self interest.</v>

108
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that your self interest is somehow opposed to other people's or that</v>

109
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>if you maximize yourself interest,</v>

110
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:14.101
<v Speaker 1>you're not operating in the best interest of other people is predicated on a</v>

111
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>poor idea of what constitutes your self interest because you're not separate in</v>

112
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>any real sense from other people.</v>

113
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 1>You maybe not separate from everything in some real sense.</v>

114
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

115
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:25.054
<v Speaker 1>I mean young,</v>

116
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 1>young in his book mysterium connectionists he had this idea,</v>

117
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go through it real quick.</v>

118
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated idea that this is how you put yourself together.</v>

119
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you do is you,</v>

120
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>you join your emotions and your,</v>

121
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>and your rationality.</v>

122
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.903
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

123
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>so that your mind and your emotions are one thing he called out the first</v>

124
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:45.454
<v Speaker 1>conjunction.</v>

125
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.463
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

126
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>so that your motivations and your emotions and the way that you think about the</v>

127
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>world are all acting in the same direction.</v>

128
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.561
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

129
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first conjunction and you get your act together that way.</v>

130
00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>So that would mean incorporation of aggression and sexuality from a Freud in</v>

131
00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:00.881
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

132
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 1>those parts of you that are difficult to integrate come to be integrated into</v>

133
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:05.494
<v Speaker 1>one thing.</v>

134
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 1>So you can use your anger when you need to and you have your sexuality under</v>

135
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

136
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have you,</v>

137
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 1>but you know how to use it and it's a power for you.</v>

138
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.393
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

139
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.593
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

140
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>and you're properly assertive in all of those things.</v>

141
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>And so you build yourself into one psychological unit and then you embody that.</v>

142
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>So that's the second conjunction.</v>

143
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>The second conjunction is take your mind,</v>

144
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.751
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

145
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>

146
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>unity,</v>

147
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>and acted out,</v>

148
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.130
<v Speaker 1>acted out in the world so that there's no distinction between you and what you</v>

149
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 1>do between you and the way you think about the world and your philosophy and how</v>

150
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you act.</v>

151
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 1>That makes you a second kind of unity.</v>

152
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>And then the final conjunction,</v>

153
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>which is the most difficult one,</v>

154
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 1>is to stop thinking that the world is different than you are.</v>

155
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>This is why I ask people to clean up the rooms.</v>

156
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like your room is you,</v>

157
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.143
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>

158
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>And so you go in there and you up your room,</v>

159
00:05:57.651 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>your cleaning you up to the same way you're developing discipline,</v>

160
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>you're putting yourself in order,</v>

161
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>you're developing a vision of the future.</v>

162
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>You're figuring out how to dress,</v>

163
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>you're figuring out how to take care of your things.</v>

164
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>You're interacting with the micro cosmos that you have in front of you and</v>

165
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>learning how to balance chaos and order.</v>

166
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference between you and what's around you and that's a very</v>

167
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 1>difficult thing to understand and so you want to act in a way that's good for</v>

168
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 1>you but good for everything else at the same time and that's,</v>

169
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.860
<v Speaker 1>that's a high moral virtue and that so there is there.</v>

170
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way of thinking about the relationship between psychological</v>

171
00:06:37.171 --> 00:06:38.850
<v Speaker 1>egoism and altruism.</v>

172
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're,</v>

173
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.000
<v Speaker 1>as you move towards a broader conceptualization of things,</v>

174
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.140
<v Speaker 1>you start to understand that there is no selfish selfish,</v>

175
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.510
<v Speaker 1>there is no selfish self interest.</v>

176
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.060
<v Speaker 1>It isn't how life works.</v>

177
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're married to someone for example,</v>

178
00:06:56.401 --> 00:06:58.650
<v Speaker 1>and you're stuck with them for the next 50 years,</v>

179
00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:00.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can't win an argument with them.</v>

180
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.910
<v Speaker 1>You can make peace because there you man,</v>

181
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.133
<v Speaker 1>there you,</v>

182
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.120
<v Speaker 1>there are a huge part of your experience.</v>

183
00:07:09.121 --> 00:07:13.140
<v Speaker 1>You have to treat that person as if they are you and then live.</v>

184
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:13.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

185
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.401
<v Speaker 1>it isn't like,</v>

186
00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:16.260
<v Speaker 1>well I'm going to treat you well because you're me.</v>

187
00:07:16.261 --> 00:07:18.360
<v Speaker 1>It's because people don't treat themselves very well.</v>

188
00:07:18.361 --> 00:07:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Often it's way more complicated than that.</v>

189
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.230
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

190
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.540
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to defeat your wife man,</v>

191
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 1>because then you live with a defeated wife and if you think she isn't going to</v>

192
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.591
<v Speaker 1>take revenge on you,</v>

193
00:07:28.591 --> 00:07:29.100
<v Speaker 1>then you're,</v>

194
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.210
<v Speaker 1>you're not very bright.</v>

195
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.230
<v Speaker 1>So you want to listen to what she has to say and you want to listen to her</v>

196
00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:38.370
<v Speaker 1>problems and you want to help her solve them because she's you and you want to</v>

197
00:07:38.371 --> 00:07:41.160
<v Speaker 1>do the same with your kids and then you want to do the same with the people</v>

198
00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:46.110
<v Speaker 1>around you if you can do it so and so the whole idea of like,</v>

199
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

200
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.570
<v Speaker 1>we're basically wired to be selfish.</v>

201
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Well we are when we're not very wise and we act impulsively.</v>

202
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.430
<v Speaker 1>But as your view of the world broadens,</v>

203
00:07:56.431 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 1>you start to understand that this is why in the Buddhist philosophy,</v>

204
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:00.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Buddha attain Nirvana.</v>

206
00:08:02.221 --> 00:08:04.740
<v Speaker 1>So that meant he could stay in union with the gods,</v>

207
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.461
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

208
00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:05.850
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

209
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.130
<v Speaker 1>he attained the highest form of,</v>

210
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.260
<v Speaker 1>of subjective experience,</v>

211
00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:11.094
<v Speaker 1>what might be,</v>

212
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.760
<v Speaker 1>which might be something like total immersion in bliss and meaning.</v>

213
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.560
<v Speaker 1>But he rejected it because he went back into the world to help other people</v>

214
00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:23.940
<v Speaker 1>attain nirvana or at least to move towards it because he realized that there was</v>

215
00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:26.940
<v Speaker 1>no individual redemption without the redemption of all.</v>

216
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:28.530
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

217
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.820
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand that,</v>

218
00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:31.650
<v Speaker 1>then you're just not very wise.</v>

219
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.440
<v Speaker 1>And so you're trying to be a force for good in the world.</v>

220
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.330
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean just good for you.</v>

221
00:08:36.331 --> 00:08:37.164
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>

222
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:42.290
<v Speaker 1>it's just blind because there isn't any isolated you that isn't how things are</v>

223
00:08:43.471 --> 00:08:45.540
<v Speaker 1>that is now realities lays itself out.</v>

224
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:46.650
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
