1
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I can use a biological example too,</v>

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>which would place me outside of the postmodern realm of argument because the</v>

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists don't believe in biology but,</v>

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.110
<v Speaker 1>but they act like they do cause they all die.</v>

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.283
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

7
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.081
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

8
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:27.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>this primatologist named,</v>

10
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.591
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you two stories.</v>

12
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:31.881
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:32.421
<v Speaker 1>Cause these are,</v>

14
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:33.410
<v Speaker 1>these are really useful.</v>

15
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>So the ones about rats,</v>

16
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>and I got this story from Jaak Panksepp who is a great neuroscientist.</v>

17
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.400
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called affective neuroscience,</v>

18
00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:41.930
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is on my reading list.</v>

19
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.100
<v Speaker 1>It's on my website.</v>

20
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good book affect of neuroscience.</v>

21
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:46.790
<v Speaker 1>He's a great scientist.</v>

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the people who he learned that he learned that rats laugh.</v>

23
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.360
<v Speaker 1>They laugh out ultrasonically like bat.</v>

24
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to,</v>

25
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>you tickle them with a pencil eraser,</v>

26
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.481
<v Speaker 1>they laugh,</v>

27
00:00:56.481 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>but you have to record it and then slow it down and then you can hear them and</v>

28
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:00.921
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

29
00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:04.040
<v Speaker 1>well rats laugh like who've whopping daad grant for that?</v>

30
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.150
<v Speaker 1>What kind of idiocy is that?</v>

31
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

32
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.841
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

33
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:06.081
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

34
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:06.291
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

35
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:06.831
<v Speaker 1>Just don't,</v>

36
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:07.161
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

37
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:08.810
<v Speaker 1>don't get ahead of yourself here.</v>

38
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.840
<v Speaker 1>he was showing that,</v>

40
00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>that that capacity for social interaction,</v>

41
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:19.121
<v Speaker 1>for social interaction that was mediated by physiological touch activated the</v>

42
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:21.434
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>

43
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.873
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

44
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>activated the same circuits in rats,</v>

45
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't people and that those are actual biological circuits.</v>

46
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And we share them even with rats.</v>

47
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:32.631
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

48
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>rats are quite similar to human beings.</v>

49
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:35.204
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

50
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.080
<v Speaker 1>I could say especially postmodernists,</v>

51
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:39.914
<v Speaker 1>but I won't.</v>

52
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.673
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

53
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

54
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 1>and so the fact that that,</v>

55
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>that little routes giggle when you tickle them is actually extraordinarily</v>

57
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

58
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>He also identified</v>

59
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.911
<v Speaker 1>surprising,</v>

60
00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking too much lately.</v>

61
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.693
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

62
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>he also identified the primary place circuit and mammals.</v>

63
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big deal too from a scientific perspective.</v>

64
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:06.920
<v Speaker 1>That's like discovering a new continent,</v>

65
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.220
<v Speaker 1>like discovering a whole brain system that people really didn't know existed.</v>

66
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

67
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.920
<v Speaker 1>So here's a little story about rats.</v>

68
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Young rats like to engage in rough and tumble play,</v>

69
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>especially juvenile males.</v>

70
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case for puppies.</v>

71
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever had a puppy,</v>

72
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 1>dogs are like that.</v>

73
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 1>They liked to wrestle.</v>

74
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the things that he may,</v>

75
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 1>all human beings tend to do with their offspring.</v>

76
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:28.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's a really,</v>

77
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:29.150
<v Speaker 1>really good thing,</v>

78
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.720
<v Speaker 1>like rough and tumble play with children really helps socialize them because it</v>

79
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:37.721
<v Speaker 1>helps them figure out the difference between a touch and even rough touch and</v>

80
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

81
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.681
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

82
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Cause one of the things you're doing when you're rough and tumble playing with</v>

83
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:42.861
<v Speaker 1>the little kid is,</v>

84
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:43.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:44.900
<v Speaker 1>you throw them up in the air and you're wrestling around.</v>

86
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.861
<v Speaker 1>I built my,</v>

87
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I had two couches when my kids were little that were sort of face to face.</v>

88
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.520
<v Speaker 1>So we built this little wrestling ring and I used to go in there and pound them</v>

89
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>half to death every night,</v>

90
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.730
<v Speaker 1>so they loved that.</v>

92
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:57.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean they get so excited about that.</v>

93
00:02:57.771 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>They love that so much.</v>

94
00:02:58.791 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

95
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>But the reason for that is like you're stretching out their bodies and you're</v>

96
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>showing them that they can't put their thumb in your eye and you're teaching</v>

97
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:07.980
<v Speaker 1>them to be graceful and,</v>

98
00:03:07.981 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

99
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>and you're teaching them the difference between something new that's happening</v>

100
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>to the body and something painful.</v>

101
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>You're really teaching them to dance.</v>

102
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's this really complicated physiological dance that that is indicative of</v>

103
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:22.490
<v Speaker 1>a socialized being.</v>

104
00:03:22.491 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why women like men who can dance by the way,</v>

105
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

106
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>because it shows that you can pay attention to someone else,</v>

107
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.161
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

108
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>that you're coordinated.</v>

109
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>But even more importantly that you can take the fact of your coordination and</v>

110
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>coordinate that with someone else's coordination.</v>

111
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.411
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

112
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>and that's very primal and physiological.</v>

113
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>It's built right into your body and rough and tumble play helps with that a lot.</v>

114
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

115
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.451
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

116
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>rats also liked to rough and tumble play for much the same reasons and sort of</v>

117
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>sort of pretty much all social mammals.</v>

118
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.280
<v Speaker 1>So you can tell that rats like it.</v>

119
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

120
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>how do you know if a rat like something?</v>

121
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.461
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

122
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>he'll work for it.</v>

123
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.690
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways you can figure out if a rep wants to work for something is</v>

124
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:02.524
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

125
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>you get them in a state where maybe he's desperate for whatever he's working for</v>

127
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>and you can put a little spring on them and figure out how hard he pulls to go</v>

128
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

129
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>He knows where he's going to get that.</v>

130
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And then you can measure the force that he's willing to apply in that gives you</v>

131
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>a rough estimate of his motivation.</v>

132
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe ask a bar,</v>

133
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:18.971
<v Speaker 1>press like,</v>

134
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>like a coke,</v>

137
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>cocaine addicted rat to,</v>

138
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 1>to receive the reward.</v>

139
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And you can count rate of bar pressing and you can get an estimate of how</v>

140
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>excited the route is to go do whatever it is the route's going to do.</v>

141
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>And so Panksepp used to,</v>

142
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

143
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.243
<v Speaker 1>put rats,</v>

144
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>it pair them one riot against the other and kind of a play a Rina,</v>

145
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>not a very big thing.</v>

146
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.323
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

147
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.080
<v Speaker 1>and these were juvenile males and they would work to do that.</v>

148
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

149
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.453
<v Speaker 1>So they liked it.</v>

150
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe one rat was 10% bigger than the other.</v>

151
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And then when you paired them,</v>

152
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>the big rat would beat the little route because 10% weight advantage was enough</v>

153
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>to make the bigger rat dominant.</v>

154
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.171
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

155
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>So then they established basically dominance and submission.</v>

156
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>You might think about that as a power relationship.</v>

157
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>And to some degree it is.</v>

158
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>But it's more complicated than that.</v>

159
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.320
<v Speaker 1>And this is very important.</v>

160
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:06.154
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

161
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.190
<v Speaker 1>so the rats play together once and the a big rep pins the little route really</v>

162
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>very much like wrestling rats wrestle just like people wrestle.</v>

163
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.383
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

164
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 1>and if you pair them together,</v>

165
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 1>then the big wrap can pin the little rat.</v>

166
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.891
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

167
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 1>so now you got dominant rats,</v>

168
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:26.760
<v Speaker 1>subordinate rat,</v>

169
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and,</v>

170
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>but then you see,</v>

171
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 1>if you stop the experiment there,</v>

172
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:32.981
<v Speaker 1>you'd think,</v>

173
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>well the rats play to establish dominance and submission.</v>

174
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that rats don't just play once,</v>

175
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:39.191
<v Speaker 1>they play many,</v>

176
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:39.431
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

177
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>

178
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's also the case with human beings is that you don't just play once,</v>

179
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.521
<v Speaker 1>you play many,</v>

180
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:46.354
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>

181
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>And there is a difference between the rules of a game and the rules of a set of</v>

182
00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:51.604
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

183
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's so unbelievably important.</v>

184
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>So you keep that in mind cause we'll return to that.</v>

185
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.493
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

186
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>the time the two routes get together,</v>

187
00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>the little rat house to house,</v>

188
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>the big route to play because the rule basically is subordinate entity asks</v>

189
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>dominant entity to play.</v>

190
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>And so the little rat does what mammals do to play.</v>

191
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:11.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

192
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 1>they kind of put their paws down and put the rear end up bit up in the air.</v>

193
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>You see dogs do that.</v>

194
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>And unless you're completely clueless,</v>

195
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>you know that that doesn't mean he's going for your throat.</v>

196
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>It means he wants you to whack them on the side of the head so he can sort of</v>

197
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>pretend to bite you.</v>

198
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

199
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.731
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

200
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious if you've played with dogs and children.</v>

201
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.103
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

202
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

203
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

204
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And I make that comparison because dogs and children and understand each other,</v>

205
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

206
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 1>They're pack animals,</v>

207
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>they follow the same basic rules.</v>

208
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:37.971
<v Speaker 1>They know how to play.</v>

209
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 1>They can become friends,</v>

210
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>otherwise he wouldn't have them as pets.</v>

211
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean the dog's not the children.</v>

212
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.023
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

213
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

214
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.783
<v Speaker 1>the little rat ass,</v>

215
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.700
<v Speaker 1>the big role to play in big rep things.</v>

216
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

217
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

218
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

219
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.271
<v Speaker 1>That will play.</v>

220
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 1>They wrestle and you pair them multiple times.</v>

221
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Well if you pair them multiple times,</v>

222
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 1>what you find is that less the big rat lets the little rat win 30% of the time</v>

223
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 1>the little rat won't ask the big rat to play anymore.</v>

224
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.851
<v Speaker 1>And that you think,</v>

225
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:02.930
<v Speaker 1>well who cares what?</v>

226
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Like why is that important?</v>

227
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:04.491
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

228
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>it's really important.</v>

229
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a really important discovery because it shows you that the,</v>

230
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 1>that even rats have a set set a sense of fair play that emerges across iterated</v>

231
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:15.344
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

232
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.891
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

233
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:16.161
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

234
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

235
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>it's evidence for the biological instantiation of a social morality.</v>

236
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal,</v>

237
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:22.100
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

238
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a big discovery.</v>

239
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.140
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

240
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>and it shows you that even at the level of rats,</v>

241
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>they're very social animals by the way.</v>

242
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.753
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

243
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.400
<v Speaker 1>the interactions between rats,</v>

244
00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 1>her are mediated by something like a sense of fairness or justice.</v>

245
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 1>And so that's extremely cool because,</v>

246
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:39.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 1>we tend to think of animals as having dominance hierarchies.</v>

248
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's predicated on power.</v>

249
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 1>And that idea,</v>

250
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>even though the bloody postmodernists don't believe in biology,</v>

251
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.970
<v Speaker 1>they extend that analogy up to human beings.</v>

252
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just not true.</v>
