<v Speaker 1>grand prairie that I went to college in Vancouver.</v>

32
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>the dates on my website very soon.</v>

33
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.770
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

34
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm still making the arrangements.</v>

35
00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to come and listen to me talk,</v>

36
00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:31.390
<v Speaker 1>then you'll have the opportunity to do so and so.</v>

37
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.700
<v Speaker 1>So I have to say good night.</v>

39
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.170
<v Speaker 1>And so good night to all of you.</v>

40
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

41
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.453
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 1>what would I like to compose with?</v>

43
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:48.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you're tuning in and I hope that you're using the information that</v>

45
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>you're finding as a consequence of tuning in to put your lives together,</v>

46
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>because it would really be good in 2018 if a whole bunch of people did</v>

47
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>everything they could to put their lives together because then maybe we could</v>

48
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>avoid this idiot catastrophe that we seem to be dreadfully sliding towards.</v>

49
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be lovely if we could just not do that.</v>

50
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>So until next time,</v>

51
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>bye bye.</v>
