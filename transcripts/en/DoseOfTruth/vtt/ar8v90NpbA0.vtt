Says,

2
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.683
Dr. Peterson,

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.590
I want to thank you.

4
00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:11.840
We'll just,

5
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.500
this isn't a question for what you do.

6
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.550
I'm a 22 year old girl and your videos are helping me so much with figuring my

7
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:18.290
life out.

8
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.750
You are alone are helping me be braver everyday.

9
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.030
Well,

10
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.260
I'm really happy about that.

11
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.570
You know,

12
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.990
and I liked your emphasis on bravery,

13
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:25.261
you know,

14
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:29.700
because one of the things that we've learned as clinicians say is that when you

15
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:31.350
help people overcome anxiety,

16
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:33.780
it isn't that you make them less anxious necessarily.

17
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.590
Although I think you could do that to some degree by having people confront some

18
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:38.850
of the demons in their past,

19
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:40.980
but instead of making them less anxious,

20
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:42.000
you make them braver.

21
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.290
And that's not the same thing,

22
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.591
right?

23
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:46.260
Because there's lots of reason to be anxious.

24
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.340
The world's full of uncertainty and fear and reasons for fear and reasons for

25
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:50.760
pain.

26
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.970
But to be braver means to confront those voluntarily.

27
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:55.230
And that's really a good thing.

28
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.190
When will the next Bible lecturer occur on October 24th.

29
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.140
There'll be three of them before the end of December.

30
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:03.030
And I want to keep them going into the future.

31
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.360
They,

32
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.310
they've been quite successful I would say.

33
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:06.440
And um,

34
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.250
I would like to go through the whole book,

35
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.070
although that would probably take me the rest of my life.

36
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.920
But I do really think it's necessary because it is the case that the,

37
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.070
the,

38
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.020
the specific narratives and the metanarrative that are,

39
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.220
that are embedded in the biblical stories and its surrounding literature are at

40
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:25.560
the fundament of Western culture.

41
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:26.010
And,

42
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.550
um,

43
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.160
we need to reconnect with that in order to make sure that our,

44
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.720
that our culture stays strong.

45
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.000
And I don't think it's particularly strong right now.

46
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:34.050
And that's a very bad,

47
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.360
that's a very bad thing for everyone.

48
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.020
It leads to nihilism and despair and,

49
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.720
and an ability to plan for a meaningful future and cynicism and all of those

50
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:45.961
things.

51
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:49.950
And that's especially bad for young people because when you're young and your

52
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:50.910
life is ahead of you,

53
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.920
it's the last,

54
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.990
the last time that you need to be nihilistic and cynical.

55
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:56.310
It's definitely not good.

56
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.420
So.
