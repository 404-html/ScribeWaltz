1
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>So I was thinking the other day</v>

2
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.073
<v Speaker 1>about</v>

3
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.173
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>there are mathematicians who think that there isn't anything more real,</v>

6
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>the numbers,</v>

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>and that's an interesting proposition.</v>

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's obviously the case that once you invent or discover numbers that</v>

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>that confers on you a tremendous power and who knows the limits of that power</v>

10
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.083
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

11
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>the claim that numbers are more real than anything else is predicated in part on</v>

12
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 1>the fact that when you discover them or invent them and start to utilize them,</v>

13
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>that your ability to operate in the world expands immensely.</v>

14
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one of the ways of judging whether or not something is real is</v>

15
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>whether or not when you use it,</v>

16
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>that facilitates your means of operating in the world.</v>

17
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.073
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

18
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.750
<v Speaker 1>numbers are abstractions.</v>

19
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.350
<v Speaker 1>And so that raises another question which is,</v>

20
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.753
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>what's more real?</v>

22
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>The thing that's being abstracted from or the abstractions and again that's not</v>

23
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>obvious and maybe the question of more real isn't Germane.</v>

24
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a question of equal reality,</v>

25
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's not obvious that abstractions aren't real and you can make a strong</v>

26
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>case that there are more real than anything else,</v>

27
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>and so then you might ask yourself,</v>

28
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>well then what are the most real abstractions?</v>

29
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what I'm going to start to talk about tonight.</v>

30
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about it in relationship to as many rules as I can</v>

31
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>layout simultaneously.</v>

32
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll go through the rules first.</v>

33
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>So rule one is stand up straight with your shoulders back,</v>

34
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>and rule two is treat yourself like you're someone responsible for helping a</v>

35
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.601
<v Speaker 1>number three,</v>

36
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>which is very tightly associated with number two.</v>

37
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>There are sort of variations on a theme is make friends with those people who</v>

38
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>want the best for you.</v>

39
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

40
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>these last two rules aren't injunctions designed to make your life easier.</v>

41
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>They're actually injunctions designed to make your life more difficult.</v>

42
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Character Guard said at one point that his role in life,</v>

43
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>given that everything was proceeding to become easier and easier in all possible</v>

44
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:53.041
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

45
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>that there would come a time when people would cry out for difficulty.</v>

46
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly how he envisioned role in the world,</v>

47
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>interestingly enough,</v>

48
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>as a universal benefactor of mankind who would strive to do nothing other than</v>

49
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>to make life more difficult for everyone.</v>

50
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

51
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And so rule two and three are like that because treat yourself as if you're</v>

52
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>someone responsible for helping isn't the same as be nice to yourself.</v>

53
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.253
<v Speaker 1>It's not that.</v>

54
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And to associate with people who want the best for you means that they get to</v>

55
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>demand the best from you.</v>

56
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's also not an easy thing.</v>

57
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Rule four is compare yourself to who you were yesterday and not to who someone</v>

58
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>else is today.</v>

59
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's an injunction about envy,</v>

60
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.993
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>

62
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>You need people who need things that are above you because you need to do</v>

63
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>something worthwhile with your life.</v>

64
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>You need something to a map,</v>

65
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>but one of the consequences of that is that you can become envious of people</v>

66
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>that you believe have attained more in a deserved or undeserved manner,</v>

67
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>and that can make you better.</v>

68
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>And so it's much better to compare yourself to yourself and to use yourself as</v>

69
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>the target for improvement.</v>

70
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>And comparison rule five is don't let your children do anything that makes you</v>

71
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:10.024
<v Speaker 1>dislike them,</v>

72
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>and the rule of thumb there is if you dislike them,</v>

73
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>then other people will,</v>

74
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>and it's a bad idea to allow your children to act in a way that makes other</v>

75
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 1>children disliked them or adults disliked them,</v>

76
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>given that they're going to have to deal with children and they're going to have</v>

77
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>to deal with adults.</v>

78
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.300
<v Speaker 1>So your primary responsibility as a parent is to help your child learn how to</v>

79
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:38.581
<v Speaker 1>behave so that the social world opens up its arms to them and welcomes them at</v>

80
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>every level and you've done your job.</v>

81
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>If you can manage that,</v>

82
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a simple thing to do.</v>

83
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Rule six is put your house in perfect order before you criticize the world,</v>

84
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.370
<v Speaker 1>and that's not take no action for others until you have your act together.</v>

85
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.950
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what the rule means.</v>

86
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It means that bind your ambition with humility and work on what's right in front</v>

87
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>of you that you will suffer for if you get wrong,</v>

88
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.470
<v Speaker 1>before you engage in the large scale transformation of other people.</v>

89
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Rule seven is do what is meaningful and not what is expedient,</v>

90
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>and I would say in some sense in some sense,</v>

91
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>that's the core ethos of the book,</v>

92
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>not exactly because rule eight,</v>

93
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:38.011
<v Speaker 1>which is tell the truth or at least don't lie as a necessary conjunction to that</v>

94
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>are unnecessary additional element because I don't think that you can pursue</v>

95
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>what is meaningful without telling the truth,</v>

96
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is if you don't tell the truth or let's say if you lie,</v>

97
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 1>which is an easier way to think about it,</v>

98
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>you corrupt the mechanisms,</v>

99
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:57.691
<v Speaker 1>the instinctual mechanisms that that that manifest as meaning and then you can't</v>

100
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>trust them and that's a very bad idea.</v>

101
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>So the fundamental reason to not lie is because you corrupt your own</v>

102
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:08.001
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>

103
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>If you lie and when you corrupt your own perceptions,</v>

104
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>then you can't rely on yourself and if you can't rely on yourself,</v>

105
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>then well good luck to you because what are you going to rely on in the absence</v>

106
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>of your own judgment?</v>

107
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Your you've got nothing.</v>

108
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

109
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 1>if you lose that rule,</v>

110
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>rule eight a is,</v>

111
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.691
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

112
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth or don't,</v>

113
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 1>or at least don't lie.</v>

114
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.923
<v Speaker 1>Rule nine,</v>

115
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>assume that the person that you're listening to know something you don't,</v>

116
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>and that's not so much a mark of respect for the person,</v>

117
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:46.121
<v Speaker 1>although it is that it's a mark of recognition of your own unbearable ignorance.</v>

118
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

119
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.060
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you have to do in life is decide whether you're more.</v>

120
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 1>You have to make friends more with.</v>

121
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Let me see.</v>

122
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

123
00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>let me rephrase that properly.</v>

124
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>You have to decide what's more important,</v>

125
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 1>what you know or what you don't know.</v>

126
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.291
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

127
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of what you don't know,</v>

128
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>and so if you make friends with that,</v>

129
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 1>if you decide that's important,</v>

130
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 1>then well,</v>

131
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing because you're going to be surrounded by what you don't know</v>

132
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>your entire life.</v>

133
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're appreciative of that,</v>

134
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.980
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to make things go better for you.</v>

135
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

136
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 1>but the other element of that is,</v>

137
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.141
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

138
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>why should you be appreciative of what you don't know?</v>

139
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:31.371
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

140
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:31.611
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

141
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't if you're life is absolutely perfect in every way you have exactly</v>

142
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 1>what you needed and want.</v>

143
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.600
<v Speaker 1>You've put everything in order around you then what you know is sufficient.</v>

144
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:46.601
<v Speaker 1>But if you believe that things could still be put right around you in your own</v>

145
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:50.150
<v Speaker 1>personal life and with regard to the effect that you have,</v>

146
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:50.984
<v Speaker 1>another people,</v>

147
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.080
<v Speaker 1>then obviously what you don't yet know,</v>

148
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:56.450
<v Speaker 1>it was more important than what you do know and you should be paying attention</v>

149
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 1>to find out what you don't know at every possible moment.</v>

150
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 1>And if you're fortunate,</v>

151
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:05.390
<v Speaker 1>when you have a conversation with someone and you're actually interested in what</v>

152
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:06.224
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

153
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 1>then even if they're not very good at communicating,</v>

154
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>even if they're awkward or even if they display a certain amount of enmity</v>

155
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:13.724
<v Speaker 1>towards you,</v>

156
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility that they might tell you something you don't</v>

157
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

158
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 1>In which case you can walk away from the conversation less ignorant and corrupt</v>

159
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>than you were when you started the conversation.</v>

160
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 1>And if your life isn't everything that you would like it to be,</v>

161
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 1>than being slightly less ignorant and corrupt is probably a good thing,</v>

162
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.280
<v Speaker 1>and so the rule 10 years be precise in your speech and that's that's an</v>

163
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:45.041
<v Speaker 1>observation I would say that that's a variant of a new testament in junction</v>

164
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:51.371
<v Speaker 1>which is or maybe a description of the nature of the world which is knock and</v>

165
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:56.711
<v Speaker 1>the door will open and ask and you will receive which a very strange theory</v>

166
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.643
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

167
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>but which I would say is far more in accordance with what we know about the</v>

168
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>psychology of perception,</v>

169
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

170
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 1>than you might imagine because it is the case that</v>

171
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>you don't get what you don't aim at.</v>

172
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 1>You might get what you do a mat and your aim might get better as you aim as</v>

173
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:21.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

174
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 1>which is something to consider</v>

175
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 1>if you specify the nature of the.</v>

176
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:28.831
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

177
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 1>If you specify the nature of the being that you want to bring into being,</v>

178
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 1>then you radically increased the probability that that's what will occur.</v>

179
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 1>And of course you all know that because you regard yourself at least to some</v>

180
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>degree as active creative agents,</v>

181
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

182
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Your fundamental attitude towards yourself at at least in the manner that you</v>

183
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 1>act towards yourself is that you wake up in the morning and you have a landscape</v>

184
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:59.481
<v Speaker 1>of possibilities that lay themselves open to you and you make choices between</v>

185
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>those possibilities and determined in consequence how the world is going to</v>

186
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.070
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself.</v>

187
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>So you confront a field of potential.</v>

188
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it and through your choices you determine</v>

189
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.580
<v Speaker 1>which elements of that potential are going to concretize them selves into the</v>

190
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:21.591
<v Speaker 1>real world and you are very unhappy with yourself.</v>

191
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do that properly and you're very unhappy with other people.</v>

192
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:28.410
<v Speaker 1>If they don't do that properly and you're very unhappy with other people.</v>

193
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>If they don't treat you like that's what you're like.</v>

194
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Because part of what you demand from people,</v>

195
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.700
<v Speaker 1>let's say in terms of sheer civility is that they act towards you is if you're</v>

196
00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:45.300
<v Speaker 1>the locus of voluntary choice in a world of potential and you are braid each</v>

197
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:46.260
<v Speaker 1>other for that as well.</v>

198
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:49.110
<v Speaker 1>If you have children and parents,</v>

199
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 1>your parents will say to you,</v>

200
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.173
<v Speaker 1>if you're fortunate,</v>

201
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.310
<v Speaker 1>you're not living up to your potential,</v>

202
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.370
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a compliment in a sense,</v>

203
00:10:56.371 --> 00:11:01.371
<v Speaker 1>even though it's also a judgment and the compliment is I know perfectly well</v>

204
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 1>that you could be more than you are and you're hang your head if you have any</v>

205
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:08.760
<v Speaker 1>sense and you'll think like you think in relationship to your own conscience,</v>

206
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:09.660
<v Speaker 1>that yes,</v>

207
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of potential that are not fully realizing and that actually</v>

208
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:18.020
<v Speaker 1>constitutes a transgression against the good and I don't.</v>

209
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever met anyone who doesn't believe that.</v>

210
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.043
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

211
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.200
<v Speaker 1>If you have a reasonable conversation with them,</v>

212
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:27.900
<v Speaker 1>it just seems self evident.</v>

213
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

214
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe now and then you meet someone who's narcissistically self satisfied,</v>

215
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.770
<v Speaker 1>but then they're narcissistic and that's not good.</v>

216
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:35.270
<v Speaker 1>That as a,</v>

217
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>as a medium to longterm strategy,</v>

218
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:39.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a catastrophe that ends in disaster.</v>

219
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:40.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

220
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a short term.</v>

221
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 1>It protects people,</v>

222
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:44.200
<v Speaker 1>but longterm it's.</v>

223
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not good in the least,</v>

224
00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:47.970
<v Speaker 1>and of course other people don't appreciate it as well.</v>

225
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Rule 11 is don't bother children when they're skateboarding and that's actually</v>

226
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 1>a discussion of courage,</v>

227
00:11:55.150 --> 00:12:00.150
<v Speaker 1>of encouragement more more specifically because I've been trying to understand,</v>

228
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:01.024
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

229
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.620
<v Speaker 1>what role parents play in the lives of their children and I would say this is a</v>

230
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:10.621
<v Speaker 1>role that that that is a fundamental importance as well as attempting to guide</v>

231
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>your children so that they act in a socially desirable manner so that the world</v>

232
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>opens itself up to them.</v>

233
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.100
<v Speaker 1>You also want to encourage them,</v>

234
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.380
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same as sheltering them.</v>

235
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same at all.</v>

236
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.920
<v Speaker 1>And to encourage someone is to say something like or to act out something like,</v>

237
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:30.461
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

238
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:31.294
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

239
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.540
<v Speaker 1>as you move,</v>

240
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.260
<v Speaker 1>the world's already difficult because the world isn't easy for children anymore</v>

241
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.440
<v Speaker 1>than it's easy for adults.</v>

242
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.900
<v Speaker 1>The difficulties are they're not the same.</v>

243
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Their child's size difficulties,</v>

244
00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:44.050
<v Speaker 1>but there are still difficulties.</v>

245
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:49.890
<v Speaker 1>The world is a very hard place and it's a bitter place in many ways and it's not</v>

246
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Speaker 1>only a hard and bitter place.</v>

247
00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:56.560
<v Speaker 1>It's also touched with betrayal and malevolence and that's the fundamental</v>

248
00:12:56.561 --> 00:12:57.394
<v Speaker 1>bottom line,</v>

249
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.730
<v Speaker 1>but there's something in you that is capable of taking that full on and</v>

250
00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:07.600
<v Speaker 1>transcending it and that encouragement.</v>

251
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:08.261
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

252
00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

253
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.290
<v Speaker 1>as difficult as things are,</v>

254
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>you're up to the challenge and to interfere with children when they're</v>

255
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 1>skateboarding.</v>

256
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.011
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

257
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:18.844
<v Speaker 1>when they're doing,</v>

258
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 1>let's say in advisably dangerous things which kids of course do.</v>

259
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.150
<v Speaker 1>If they're skateboarding.</v>

260
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:31.050
<v Speaker 1>To interfere with that is to interfere with the child's willingness to</v>

261
00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily expose themselves to the risks that they need to expose themselves</v>

262
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.490
<v Speaker 1>to in order to develop this sort of competence that allows them to thrive in a</v>

263
00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:44.650
<v Speaker 1>world they cannot be sheltered from.</v>

264
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:51.060
<v Speaker 1>And so to interfere with children when they're taking the necessary risks is not</v>

265
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.840
<v Speaker 1>love or empathy,</v>

266
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.340
<v Speaker 1>but cowardice on the part of parents and it's deeply damaging to children.</v>

267
00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.740
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you as a clinical psychologist,</v>

268
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.790
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a client come to my office in all the hundreds in,</v>

269
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:05.730
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

270
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.280
<v Speaker 1>in all of the hundreds of encounters I've had with people in my office.</v>

271
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a client say my parents made me to independent.</v>

272
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

273
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.190
<v Speaker 1>That hasn't happened once.</v>

274
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Right now my parents made me too dependent or I conspired with my parents to</v>

275
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:27.880
<v Speaker 1>perpetuate my dependence.</v>

276
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.250
<v Speaker 1>That happened all the time.</v>

277
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.580
<v Speaker 1>So there's a rule of thumb,</v>

278
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:34.660
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a good one,</v>

279
00:14:34.661 --> 00:14:38.860
<v Speaker 1>which I believe is often applied in nursing homes by people who work in nursing</v>

280
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:39.131
<v Speaker 1>homes,</v>

281
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:40.960
<v Speaker 1>which is of course a very difficult job.</v>

282
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.700
<v Speaker 1>And the rule is do not do anything for anyone they can do for themselves.</v>

283
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.180
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that it's a form of theft,</v>

284
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.381
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

285
00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:51.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't first all,</v>

286
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

287
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 1>If you do something for someone and it facilitates their movement forward,</v>

288
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 1>then they moved forward because you help them.</v>

289
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Which is something I was very careful about as a therapist.</v>

290
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give my clients advice first.</v>

291
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 1>It might fail,</v>

292
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.300
<v Speaker 1>in which case they are going to pay for my advice and second,</v>

293
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 1>if it succeeds,</v>

294
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:17.210
<v Speaker 1>then I get to be the successful one and I don't want to steal the success from</v>

295
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:18.044
<v Speaker 1>my clients.</v>

296
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad idea.</v>

297
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I want to help them figure out what it is that they should aim at and then help</v>

298
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:29.501
<v Speaker 1>plot out a strategy for attaining that and but I want to ensure that it's their</v>

299
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 1>destiny,</v>

300
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.170
<v Speaker 1>not something I'm imposing,</v>

301
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.950
<v Speaker 1>and of course the imposition of that sort of thing is the hallmark of a bad,</v>

302
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I would say therapeutic relationship,</v>

303
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:41.780
<v Speaker 1>but also a bad relationship period.</v>

304
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.711
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

305
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:45.500
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you want to do with your partners,</v>

306
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 1>your spouse or your say your husband or wife and also with your children,</v>

307
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 1>is to listen to them so that you can figure out what their problems are and</v>

308
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:56.450
<v Speaker 1>figure out with them because they're going to figure that out by communicating</v>

309
00:15:56.451 --> 00:16:00.290
<v Speaker 1>and then perhaps aid them in the development of a strategy,</v>

310
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 1>but you have to ensure very carefully that you're not imposing your own</v>

311
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.740
<v Speaker 1>structure in a manner that's going to steal from them.</v>

312
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.120
<v Speaker 1>What's rightfully theirs,</v>

313
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:12.843
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

314
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:18.350
<v Speaker 1>so rule 11 is an injunction to courage as the fundamental because you could say,</v>

315
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:19.101
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

316
00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:21.440
<v Speaker 1>what's the antidote to the catastrophe of life?</v>

317
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 1>And one answer might be safety.</v>

318
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:24.171
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

319
00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:24.411
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

320
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

321
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:29.570
<v Speaker 1>look everyone sensible enough to know that a certain amount of provision for</v>

322
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:30.404
<v Speaker 1>safety is,</v>

323
00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:31.640
<v Speaker 1>is worthwhile.</v>

324
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 1>You should probably wear your seat belts when you're driving around in your car</v>

325
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.000
<v Speaker 1>because why take fool hardy risks,</v>

326
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.810
<v Speaker 1>but given that there is no security in life,</v>

327
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:46.930
<v Speaker 1>in the final analysis than encouragement is a much better medication than</v>

328
00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Speaker 1>sheltering and so,</v>

329
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:51.840
<v Speaker 1>and that was,</v>

330
00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.400
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

331
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.400
<v Speaker 1>that's I think in keeping with the idea that what life is essentially is not a</v>

332
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:03.140
<v Speaker 1>place to attain happiness or even to aim for happiness even though you should be</v>

333
00:17:03.141 --> 00:17:05.240
<v Speaker 1>grateful if someone comes along now and then,</v>

334
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.610
<v Speaker 1>but a call to something like adventure.</v>

335
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.270
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the proper way of conceptualizing it.</v>

336
00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Certainly if you go watch a story,</v>

337
00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:14.280
<v Speaker 1>a movie,</v>

338
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.170
<v Speaker 1>read a book,</v>

339
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.221
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

340
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 1>If you encounter a narrative that's gripping,</v>

341
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.550
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a romance or a classic adventure story,</v>

342
00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 1>then the element of it that's gripping is the adventure,</v>

343
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.400
<v Speaker 1>and so to portray life as an adventure in romance and and in the world is the</v>

344
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:35.060
<v Speaker 1>proper way to portray it and the way that you</v>

345
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 1>facilitate the adventure is through encouragement.</v>

346
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 1>I had a client once.</v>

347
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:42.951
<v Speaker 1>I really liked him.</v>

348
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:43.820
<v Speaker 1>He was a good guy,</v>

349
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:44.763
<v Speaker 1>smart guy,</v>

350
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:46.430
<v Speaker 1>good looking young guy,</v>

351
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.410
<v Speaker 1>had everything going for him.</v>

352
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

353
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 1>he's a good musician.</v>

354
00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:51.300
<v Speaker 1>He was a talented athlete,</v>

355
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.600
<v Speaker 1>but he hadn't been encouraged.</v>

356
00:17:55.601 --> 00:17:56.434
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say</v>

357
00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.220
<v Speaker 1>he told me about his relationship with his girlfriend.</v>

358
00:18:00.221 --> 00:18:01.054
<v Speaker 1>He said</v>

359
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.650
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend wanted to go biking around southern Ontario.</v>

360
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:12.490
<v Speaker 1>She was about 19 or 20 and he thought he might join her and when she went and</v>

361
00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:13.760
<v Speaker 1>talked to her parents,</v>

362
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:19.630
<v Speaker 1>they made every provision possible to help her prepare for the journey to make</v>

363
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:20.930
<v Speaker 1>sure her bike was in good shape,</v>

364
00:18:20.931 --> 00:18:24.080
<v Speaker 1>to make sure she had the right equipment to help her plot out a route,</v>

365
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.210
<v Speaker 1>and when he went and talked to his parents,</v>

366
00:18:26.211 --> 00:18:30.380
<v Speaker 1>all they did was worried that he was going to get hurt and like he might get</v>

367
00:18:30.381 --> 00:18:33.140
<v Speaker 1>hurt because people get hurt,</v>

368
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:38.240
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't understand that they were choosing between the hurt that he</v>

369
00:18:38.241 --> 00:18:41.120
<v Speaker 1>might encounter by going out in the world and having an adventure,</v>

370
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.080
<v Speaker 1>let's say with his girlfriend or the hurt that he would encounter by staying at</v>

371
00:18:45.081 --> 00:18:45.890
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

372
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.390
<v Speaker 1>towering in his basement,</v>

373
00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.480
<v Speaker 1>under the protection of his over loving parents.</v>

374
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

375
00:18:50.901 --> 00:18:53.450
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend ventured bravely into the world.</v>

376
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.111
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

377
00:18:54.111 --> 00:18:54.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

378
00:18:54.261 --> 00:18:56.810
<v Speaker 1>which of those two things is most likely to be damaging?</v>

379
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And their answer to that is,</v>

380
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.461
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

381
00:18:58.461 --> 00:19:00.510
<v Speaker 1>his parents wouldn't worry as much as if he.</v>

382
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.280
<v Speaker 1>If he was in the basement and that's the wrong worry.</v>

383
00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Even because they should worry more.</v>

384
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Not less so in rural 12,</v>

385
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:14.750
<v Speaker 1>his pedicab when you encounter one on the street and it's a oddly enough,</v>

386
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.410
<v Speaker 1>a meditation on fragility.</v>

387
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a discussion of what you do when you don't know what to do and that's</v>

388
00:19:24.981 --> 00:19:27.590
<v Speaker 1>really when things have gone badly for you.</v>

389
00:19:27.591 --> 00:19:32.180
<v Speaker 1>When you face a terrible tragedy in your own personal life or in your familiar</v>

390
00:19:32.181 --> 00:19:34.160
<v Speaker 1>life or perhaps even in the life of your community.</v>

391
00:19:34.161 --> 00:19:37.330
<v Speaker 1>When things come crowding in and you too quickly in,</v>

392
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:37.780
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

393
00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.480
<v Speaker 1>in the case of a death in the family or a terrible illness or the collapse of a</v>

394
00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:45.260
<v Speaker 1>dream or any of the things that can flip your world.</v>

395
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Upside down is how do you cope with that.</v>

396
00:19:47.361 --> 00:19:52.361
<v Speaker 1>And that chapter contains discussion of the necessity of narrowing your</v>

397
00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:55.400
<v Speaker 1>timeframe.</v>

398
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes the right way to look at the world is across years and</v>

399
00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:03.890
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's across months and when things are more out of control,</v>

400
00:20:03.891 --> 00:20:07.610
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it's across days and when things are really.</v>

401
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.260
<v Speaker 1>When you're really up against the wall,</v>

402
00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:14.261
<v Speaker 1>it's a car across hours or even minutes and during those minutes then you</v>

403
00:20:14.511 --> 00:20:16.940
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on doing as well as you can.</v>

404
00:20:16.941 --> 00:20:20.930
<v Speaker 1>With what's right in front of you for the longest unit of time that you can</v>

405
00:20:20.931 --> 00:20:22.760
<v Speaker 1>tolerate conceptualizing.</v>

406
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what you do at someone's deathbed and while you're doing that and</v>

407
00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:28.310
<v Speaker 1>suffering away madly,</v>

408
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.420
<v Speaker 1>then you also take the time to appreciate everything you can.</v>

409
00:20:32.421 --> 00:20:33.740
<v Speaker 1>That manifests itself,</v>

410
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.110
<v Speaker 1>that allows itself to be appreciated.</v>

411
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.600
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the metaphor of the cat,</v>

412
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

413
00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:44.300
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the 12 rules and I'll return to rule one which is stand up</v>

414
00:20:44.301 --> 00:20:45.680
<v Speaker 1>straight with your shoulders back,</v>

415
00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:50.470
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to use it as platform for laying out the abstractions that I</v>

416
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:53.470
<v Speaker 1>talked to at the beginning of the lecture.</v>

417
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 1>So some of you might be familiar with the central Dallas symbol.</v>

418
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:04.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of dao and dow is a very strange word.</v>

419
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.840
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have an easily translatable single meaning,</v>

420
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.790
<v Speaker 1>at least in English.</v>

421
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It means a variety of things.</v>

422
00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 1>That means the path of life.</v>

423
00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:16.840
<v Speaker 1>So that would mean that the path that you take as you move forward through life,</v>

424
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 1>but it would mean more also the proper path.</v>

425
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.141
<v Speaker 1>So it's that.</v>

426
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the proper path through life.</v>

427
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 1>So the idea dow is a symbol of reality and one of the things that means is the</v>

428
00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>path you take through life,</v>

429
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:32.911
<v Speaker 1>and so there's an implicit idea there that the fundamental reality of life is</v>

430
00:21:32.921 --> 00:21:34.450
<v Speaker 1>the path you take through life.</v>

431
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not a materialist idea,</v>

432
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a different kind of idea.</v>

433
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:42.100
<v Speaker 1>It's the idea that life is a journey while we're mobile creatures and we're on a</v>

434
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:46.480
<v Speaker 1>journey and the best way to conceptualize reality is as the place that you</v>

435
00:21:46.481 --> 00:21:47.470
<v Speaker 1>journey through,</v>

436
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:48.730
<v Speaker 1>and the question is,</v>

437
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

438
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:50.560
<v Speaker 1>what are the elements?</v>

439
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.990
<v Speaker 1>What are the constituent elements of the place that you journey through?</v>

440
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Because that's also part of Dow and the Dallas believed that that's the Yin and</v>

441
00:21:57.611 --> 00:21:58.061
<v Speaker 1>Yang,</v>

442
00:21:58.061 --> 00:22:02.530
<v Speaker 1>and Yin is the black serpent because those are two serpent's head to head that</v>

443
00:22:02.531 --> 00:22:04.210
<v Speaker 1>make up the totality of the world,</v>

444
00:22:04.211 --> 00:22:07.210
<v Speaker 1>and the black serpent is Yin and Yang.</v>

445
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Yin is feminine.</v>

446
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Classically speaking,</v>

447
00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:11.200
<v Speaker 1>from the Taoist perspective,</v>

448
00:22:11.201 --> 00:22:13.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a symbolic representation.</v>

449
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.420
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that women are Yin and that men,</v>

450
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:17.200
<v Speaker 1>men aren't.</v>

451
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it's an attempt to use sexual symbolism to represent a deeper</v>

452
00:22:22.931 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 1>underlying reality,</v>

453
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.600
<v Speaker 1>and Yang is masculine.</v>

454
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Urine is dark and night and there's a white.in the black serpent and there's a</v>

455
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:33.640
<v Speaker 1>black.in the white serpent.</v>

456
00:22:33.641 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 1>The serpent is the daytime and masculinity and it's the interplay between those</v>

457
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:42.400
<v Speaker 1>two things that make up reality and one can transform into the other at any</v>

458
00:22:42.401 --> 00:22:43.210
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

459
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.760
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the Taoist idea of reality,</v>

460
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.140
<v Speaker 1>and so there's Yin and Yang and they make up the world and the question is</v>

461
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.520
<v Speaker 1>perhaps act question is,</v>

462
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:51.881
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

463
00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:53.710
<v Speaker 1>what exactly does that mean?</v>

464
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

465
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.680
<v Speaker 1>it actually means something.</v>

466
00:22:56.681 --> 00:23:00.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of abstraction and it's actually an incredibly helpful obstruction.</v>

467
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Once you understand the abstraction,</v>

468
00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.270
<v Speaker 1>it might be the most real abstraction there is.</v>

469
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.810
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to lay out a little bit on layout for you,</v>

470
00:23:10.811 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Speaker 1>a little bit about what these two domains refer to,</v>

471
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.260
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to make a case that they're real and then I'm going to tell</v>

472
00:23:17.261 --> 00:23:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you what it means that they're real.</v>

473
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:25.470
<v Speaker 1>So you could think of Yin as chaos.</v>

474
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Now we need to know what chaos is now.</v>

475
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is what God made the world out of at the beginning of time.</v>

476
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.390
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that chaos is this,</v>

477
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.510
<v Speaker 1>something like potential and so you can imagine,</v>

478
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.990
<v Speaker 1>and this is not how we think as modern people because we tend to think in a</v>

479
00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:44.830
<v Speaker 1>materialist way,</v>

480
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 1>but it is how we act</v>

481
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.360
<v Speaker 2>and as I said already,</v>

482
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:52.870
<v Speaker 2>you act as if you confront potential and you treat potential as if it's real and</v>

483
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:59.720
<v Speaker 2>if your attitude towards it confers on you a certain moral obligation,</v>

484
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.930
<v Speaker 2>which is why you know what people mean when they say you're not living up to</v>

485
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:06.194
<v Speaker 2>your potential.</v>

486
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.120
<v Speaker 2>No one ever says,</v>

487
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.790
<v Speaker 2>well what do you mean by potential?</v>

488
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Not unless they're being argumentative,</v>

489
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:16.430
<v Speaker 2>because you already know and very few people say,</v>

490
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 2>while I'm fully living up to my potential.</v>

491
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.920
<v Speaker 2>So you admit to the reality that undergirds that conception that makes that</v>

492
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:26.540
<v Speaker 2>question and possibility immediately.</v>

493
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.040
<v Speaker 2>The potential is while potential is the future.</v>

494
00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it and we believe in the future.</v>

495
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:35.570
<v Speaker 2>We believe that it exists.</v>

496
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Even though it isn't here and it's not measurable.</v>

497
00:24:38.391 --> 00:24:38.870
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

498
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:43.640
<v Speaker 2>It only exists as a potential set of realizable possibilities.</v>

499
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what the future is and it's really what we contend with.</v>

500
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.100
<v Speaker 2>We don't really contend with the present precisely.</v>

501
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 2>We Orient Ourselves towards the future and the future comes at us from every</v>

502
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:55.490
<v Speaker 2>direction and we we,</v>

503
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.550
<v Speaker 2>we decide as we encounter the future,</v>

504
00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:03.290
<v Speaker 2>which parts of it we're going to interact with and how we're going to construct</v>

505
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:05.900
<v Speaker 2>the present and the past as a consequence of doing that,</v>

506
00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.370
<v Speaker 2>and so part of chaos is potential and that's the positive part.</v>

507
00:25:10.371 --> 00:25:13.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're in a bind,</v>

508
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.380
<v Speaker 2>what you look for is potential.</v>

509
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Is there another way of conceptualizing this?</v>

510
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Do I have a different way of of acting?</v>

511
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Can I make another plan?</v>

512
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Is there something that I'm not taking into account that would make this</v>

513
00:25:26.961 --> 00:25:28.700
<v Speaker 2>terrible situation tolerable?</v>

514
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:33.970
<v Speaker 2>That's all an attempt to to call upon potential and to use it to transfigure a</v>

515
00:25:35.331 --> 00:25:40.150
<v Speaker 2>reality that's intolerable and maybe it's intolerable because of the way you're</v>

516
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.270
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizing it.</v>

517
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:41.631
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

518
00:25:41.631 --> 00:25:44.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm not being naive about that.</v>

519
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.650
<v Speaker 2>I understand perfectly well that people can find themselves so badly cornered in</v>

520
00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:52.340
<v Speaker 2>life that they're basically done no matter what they do.</v>

521
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:57.410
<v Speaker 2>People obviously developed fatal illnesses and they die and their businesses</v>

522
00:25:57.411 --> 00:26:02.300
<v Speaker 2>collapsed and genuinely terrible things can happen to you that aren't your</v>

523
00:26:02.301 --> 00:26:02.900
<v Speaker 2>fault,</v>

524
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 2>that you can't fix.</v>

525
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that you can just gerrymander the world by changing your</v>

526
00:26:08.361 --> 00:26:08.841
<v Speaker 2>attitude.</v>

527
00:26:08.841 --> 00:26:10.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not that straightforward,</v>

528
00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:15.910
<v Speaker 2>but I am saying that you have a tremendous ability to transform the landscape of</v>

529
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:21.050
<v Speaker 2>possibility that reveals itself in front of you and that when things are</v>

530
00:26:21.051 --> 00:26:21.680
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>

531
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.450
<v Speaker 2>that's your best bet.</v>

532
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean it will succeed.</v>

533
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.650
<v Speaker 2>It just means you don't have a better option and so chaos.</v>

534
00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:35.120
<v Speaker 2>That potential is also something that manifests itself in a terrible manner.</v>

535
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.310
<v Speaker 2>So imagine this.</v>

536
00:26:36.311 --> 00:26:37.730
<v Speaker 2>This is a good way of thinking about it.</v>

537
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.910
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you have an intimate relationship.</v>

538
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's say a marriage and the marriage is predicated on trust and fidelity,</v>

539
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 2>which is a variant of trust,</v>

540
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:55.760
<v Speaker 2>and that trust and fidelity is an axiom of your memories.</v>

541
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:57.481
<v Speaker 2>You might think,</v>

542
00:26:57.481 --> 00:26:57.631
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

543
00:26:57.631 --> 00:26:58.470
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

544
00:26:58.471 --> 00:26:59.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

545
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

546
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.510
<v Speaker 2>let's play it out.</v>

547
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you've been married for 10 years and then your wife tells you that she</v>

548
00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:08.040
<v Speaker 2>has had three affairs.</v>

549
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Each of them lasted three years and the last one has lasted five years and it's</v>

550
00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:13.470
<v Speaker 2>still ongoing.</v>

551
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you discover that,</v>

552
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:16.703
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

553
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.090
<v Speaker 2>so then you might say,</v>

554
00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:18.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

555
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 2>what happens then?</v>

556
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

557
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:24.540
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that everything you thought was wrong.</v>

558
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.651
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

559
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:30.000
<v Speaker 2>and this is such an interesting thing because it actually means you had the past</v>

560
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.400
<v Speaker 2>and you think the past is fixed.</v>

561
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:33.660
<v Speaker 2>It's done with.</v>

562
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's the past,</v>

563
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.940
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden you find out that one of the things that you thought about</v>

564
00:27:38.941 --> 00:27:43.560
<v Speaker 2>the past and it happens to be a very important thing wasn't true at all.</v>

565
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that whole past that you thought was what it was,</v>

566
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.650
<v Speaker 2>wasn't what it was at all.</v>

567
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:55.130
<v Speaker 2>And so it transforms itself from an actuality into potential and most of that</v>

568
00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:57.990
<v Speaker 2>potential is negative.</v>

569
00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're relieved that your wife had an affair.</v>

570
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:02.963
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

571
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.270
<v Speaker 2>but that's an important consideration because you know you can imagine a</v>

572
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:11.271
<v Speaker 2>situation where your marriage is dreadfully unhappy and you're just looking for</v>

573
00:28:11.521 --> 00:28:12.900
<v Speaker 2>an excuse to leave.</v>

574
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.060
<v Speaker 2>It's possible that that revelation,</v>

575
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.620
<v Speaker 2>even though it would be shocking,</v>

576
00:28:16.621 --> 00:28:18.900
<v Speaker 2>would also come with a fair bit of relief,</v>

577
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:20.220
<v Speaker 2>and so this potential,</v>

578
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 2>the potential that manifests itself even when it's unexpected,</v>

579
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.750
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't only necessarily manifest itself in a negative guys,</v>

580
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.040
<v Speaker 2>it can also free,</v>

581
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:29.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

582
00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.680
<v Speaker 2>and and if your marriage was unhappy,</v>

583
00:28:31.681 --> 00:28:33.270
<v Speaker 2>even if you wanted to cling to it,</v>

584
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:38.510
<v Speaker 2>if your marriage wasn't happy and the betrayal was revealed and you're divorced</v>

585
00:28:39.121 --> 00:28:40.770
<v Speaker 2>and you set yourself up in two years,</v>

586
00:28:40.771 --> 00:28:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you might be in a better place than you were.</v>

587
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.000
<v Speaker 2>It's not a pathway I'm recommending by the way.</v>

588
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that it's more complicated than it looks.</v>

589
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.030
<v Speaker 2>That's the introduction of chaos into order.</v>

590
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:52.021
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

591
00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:53.610
<v Speaker 2>And the the,</v>

592
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.760
<v Speaker 2>the oldest story we have is something like order is susceptible to disruption by</v>

593
00:29:00.751 --> 00:29:04.110
<v Speaker 2>chaos and the human.</v>

594
00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.870
<v Speaker 2>That the fundamental demand that's made on the human being is to contend with</v>

595
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:11.490
<v Speaker 2>the chaos that disrupts order.</v>

596
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.790
<v Speaker 2>Not to live in order and not to live in chaos,</v>

597
00:29:14.791 --> 00:29:18.090
<v Speaker 2>but to be able to contend with the chaos that disrupts order.</v>

598
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.010
<v Speaker 2>And so when you encourage your children,</v>

599
00:29:20.011 --> 00:29:20.844
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

600
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.170
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing is encouraging them to become the masters of the chaos that</v>

601
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 2>can disrupt order rather than denizens of order,</v>

602
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.750
<v Speaker 2>which makes them tyrants or Denisons of chaos,</v>

603
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.820
<v Speaker 2>which makes them nihilistic and hopeless.</v>

604
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.070
<v Speaker 2>So you train your children,</v>

605
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.850
<v Speaker 2>you encourage your children and yourself and your partner if you have any sense</v>

606
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.720
<v Speaker 2>to be a master of emergent chaos and to be able to contend with that.</v>

607
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.153
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

608
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.330
<v Speaker 2>so chaos has potential and it's this disruptive.</v>

609
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:55.810
<v Speaker 2>It's the capacity of the infinite world to disrupt your finite considerations.</v>

610
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:57.680
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of looking at it.</v>

611
00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Another way of looking at it is it's the serpent in the garden of Eden and the</v>

612
00:30:02.691 --> 00:30:06.650
<v Speaker 2>reason that that story is set up the way it is is because it's trying to</v>

613
00:30:06.651 --> 00:30:11.651
<v Speaker 2>represent that there is no place that so bounded and secure,</v>

614
00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:17.650
<v Speaker 2>even if it's set up by God himself that doesn't have an agent of chaos inside</v>

615
00:30:18.561 --> 00:30:19.250
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

616
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.490
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same idea that the Dallas put forward with their,</v>

617
00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.620
<v Speaker 2>with their symbolic representation.</v>

618
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just portrayed in a different manner.</v>

619
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:28.703
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

620
00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.253
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

621
00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:35.450
<v Speaker 2>what do you do in the garden given that there's a snake in it and the answer to</v>

622
00:30:35.451 --> 00:30:40.451
<v Speaker 2>that is something like you become the master of snakes and so and that's a deep</v>

623
00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:43.040
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

624
00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.970
<v Speaker 2>That's the same idea as confronting the dragon and getting the treasure.</v>

625
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:51.320
<v Speaker 2>That's the same idea as going to the bottom of the ocean and rescuing your</v>

626
00:30:51.321 --> 00:30:52.970
<v Speaker 2>father from the belly of the whale.</v>

627
00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.130
<v Speaker 2>It's the same idea and that's an element in the greatest of stories in the</v>

628
00:30:58.131 --> 00:31:00.200
<v Speaker 2>greatest of stories is heroic,</v>

629
00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.430
<v Speaker 2>heroic story and the heroic story is to voluntarily confront the unknown when it</v>

630
00:31:04.431 --> 00:31:08.870
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself and together something of value as a consequence and to share</v>

631
00:31:08.871 --> 00:31:09.740
<v Speaker 2>it with the community.</v>

632
00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.850
<v Speaker 2>There isn't a story that's more emblematic of what it means to be human then</v>

633
00:31:13.851 --> 00:31:14.510
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

634
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.850
<v Speaker 2>that that is us.</v>

635
00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.620
<v Speaker 2>That's our best bet.</v>

636
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:20.841
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

637
00:31:20.841 --> 00:31:22.340
<v Speaker 2>so chaos.</v>

638
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is the catastrophe that will suddenly enter your life.</v>

639
00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is the flood.</v>

640
00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.230
<v Speaker 2>That's definitely coming.</v>

641
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is the ever present possibility of apocalypse in your personal life and</v>

642
00:31:35.101 --> 00:31:38.570
<v Speaker 2>your familiar life and in this broader social life,</v>

643
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:39.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

644
00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is the consequence of your finite fragility existing in a world that's</v>

645
00:31:44.481 --> 00:31:45.380
<v Speaker 2>beyond you.</v>

646
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is potential.</v>

647
00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is what lies before you.</v>

648
00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is what you can call on when you need something to rescue yourself from</v>

649
00:31:54.021 --> 00:31:55.370
<v Speaker 2>malfunctioning order.</v>

650
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a permanent element of existence.</v>

651
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is what you don't know.</v>

652
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is what's outside the fire.</v>

653
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is what's outside the walls of your house.</v>

654
00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is what's outside the walls of your town.</v>

655
00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is what's outside of the borders of your country.</v>

656
00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.300
<v Speaker 2>All of that is chaos and potential</v>

657
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:19.993
<v Speaker 3>order</v>

658
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:27.270
<v Speaker 2>order is where you are when what you're doing is working in the manner that you</v>

659
00:32:27.491 --> 00:32:28.324
<v Speaker 2>intended,</v>

660
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.531
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

661
00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a very specific definition.</v>

662
00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.460
<v Speaker 2>How do you know that you know what you're doing?</v>

663
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

664
00:32:34.031 --> 00:32:36.490
<v Speaker 2>you don't because you don't know what you're doing because you don't know</v>

665
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:37.180
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

666
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Everything you do is bounded by ignorance while you still have to operate in the</v>

667
00:32:41.181 --> 00:32:41.780
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

668
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:46.780
<v Speaker 2>and so what you do is you make finite plans and the new execute plans and then</v>

669
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:52.211
<v Speaker 2>you execute strategies to to make those plans manifest themselves,</v>

670
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.890
<v Speaker 2>and if the plan's manifest themselves the way that you desired,</v>

671
00:32:55.891 --> 00:32:58.400
<v Speaker 2>then you regard your knowledge as sufficient.</v>

672
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.330
<v Speaker 2>That's your definition of truth and it's the only definition of truth that you</v>

673
00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:07.010
<v Speaker 2>can use because you don't have everything at hand and when you're aware what</v>

674
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 2>you're doing is working that's order and you might think,</v>

675
00:33:10.851 --> 00:33:11.001
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

676
00:33:11.001 --> 00:33:16.001
<v Speaker 2>I should just stay there because that's a comfortable place to be and there's a</v>

677
00:33:16.041 --> 00:33:19.160
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of truth to that except for one thing.</v>

678
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.773
<v Speaker 2>If you've</v>

679
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:28.820
<v Speaker 2>defined a domain of order and you stand in it and you wait,</v>

680
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:34.730
<v Speaker 2>the disorder will enter all by itself because things aren't static.</v>

681
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:39.731
<v Speaker 2>Things change all the time and your attempt to bind yourself within a static</v>

682
00:33:39.891 --> 00:33:44.891
<v Speaker 2>structure is destined to fail because everything around you is in flux and the</v>

683
00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:50.450
<v Speaker 2>thing that you parceled out as permanent will transform itself across time.</v>

684
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:51.860
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example.</v>

685
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're a perfectly well adapted 11 year old and it's actually possible</v>

686
00:33:57.081 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 2>to meet 11 year old children are often very delightful because they're like</v>

687
00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:01.160
<v Speaker 2>adult children,</v>

688
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:02.780
<v Speaker 2>they're not teenagers.</v>

689
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.690
<v Speaker 2>They're like they're.</v>

690
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:08.930
<v Speaker 2>They're the most mature form of children and they can be really delightful</v>

691
00:34:08.931 --> 00:34:13.931
<v Speaker 2>people and then like three years later you hate them and and the reason for that</v>

692
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:15.860
<v Speaker 2>is that of course,</v>

693
00:34:15.861 --> 00:34:17.150
<v Speaker 2>as soon as they hit puberty,</v>

694
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.090
<v Speaker 2>which is the emergence of chaos into the,</v>

695
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.000
<v Speaker 2>into the already developed childhood structures,</v>

696
00:34:23.001 --> 00:34:26.990
<v Speaker 2>really the emergence of sexuality into a structure that didn't have to adapt to</v>

697
00:34:26.991 --> 00:34:30.050
<v Speaker 2>sexuality and maybe even the emergence of aggression to some degree,</v>

698
00:34:30.051 --> 00:34:31.280
<v Speaker 2>but mostly sexuality.</v>

699
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:36.730
<v Speaker 2>If the child maintains only the 11 year old personality by the time they're 16,</v>

700
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.920
<v Speaker 2>they're no longer a delightful 11 year old.</v>

701
00:34:39.921 --> 00:34:43.850
<v Speaker 2>There are very immature 16 year old and the reason that I'm pointing that out is</v>

702
00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:47.570
<v Speaker 2>because just because something works for you now doesn't mean it's going to work</v>

703
00:34:47.571 --> 00:34:51.890
<v Speaker 2>for you five years from now and so in order to remain stable,</v>

704
00:34:51.891 --> 00:34:53.480
<v Speaker 2>you can't be stagnant.</v>

705
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:54.860
<v Speaker 2>They're not the same thing.</v>

706
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Stability is a dynamic,</v>

707
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.870
<v Speaker 2>not a not something static,</v>

708
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.750
<v Speaker 2>and so not only do you have to be where you are,</v>

709
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.410
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be going to where you're going and you have to be participating</v>

710
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:07.940
<v Speaker 2>in both of those things actively,</v>

711
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:13.540
<v Speaker 2>so it's stability plus transformation and I would say that manifests itself.</v>

712
00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:17.450
<v Speaker 2>You know when you're there because that manifests itself as meaningful.</v>

713
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.940
<v Speaker 2>That's actually the instinct of meaning,</v>

714
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:24.500
<v Speaker 2>which is an instinct and perhaps the deepest instinct is precisely the instinct</v>

715
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:27.560
<v Speaker 2>that tells you when were you are a sufficiently stable,</v>

716
00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:32.090
<v Speaker 2>but you're transforming yourself at a sufficient rate to keep up with everything</v>

717
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:35.330
<v Speaker 2>that's changing and you know that because if you're at your job,</v>

718
00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.770
<v Speaker 2>you might say to yourself,</v>

719
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:37.741
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

720
00:35:37.741 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 2>my job is really secure,</v>

721
00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:41.910
<v Speaker 2>but it's not very challenging and you think,</v>

722
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:42.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

723
00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.680
<v Speaker 2>why do you care about that?</v>

724
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.890
<v Speaker 2>It's very secure and the answer to that is,</v>

725
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:47.071
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

726
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:48.180
<v Speaker 2>if it's not challenging,</v>

727
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 2>it's deadening in a sense,</v>

728
00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:50.221
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

729
00:35:50.221 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 2>The spirit goes out of it.</v>

730
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.860
<v Speaker 2>If it's not challenging,</v>

731
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.890
<v Speaker 2>you need to be challenged and why is that?</v>

732
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:56.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

733
00:35:56.281 --> 00:35:56.791
<v Speaker 2>the answer is,</v>

734
00:35:56.791 --> 00:35:57.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

735
00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:01.920
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow is coming and whoever you are now isn't enough for tomorrow and so</v>

736
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.300
<v Speaker 2>today you also have to be preparing for tomorrow and next week and next year,</v>

737
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.650
<v Speaker 2>and if your job isn't challenging than it isn't doing that for you and you find</v>

738
00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:11.371
<v Speaker 2>it deadening,</v>

739
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:12.360
<v Speaker 2>not meaningful,</v>

740
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.920
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that it violates your most essential instinct and</v>

741
00:36:16.921 --> 00:36:21.921
<v Speaker 2>your most essential instinct is the instinct for meaning and it signifies that.</v>

742
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.370
<v Speaker 2>It actually signifies that you have the balance between chaos and order right</v>

743
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.601
<v Speaker 2>deeply,</v>

744
00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:28.434
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

745
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Which is why it's the most fundamental of instincts because chaos in order are</v>

746
00:36:32.011 --> 00:36:33.840
<v Speaker 2>the most real of things.</v>

747
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

748
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:40.320
<v Speaker 2>so you have the chaos that surrounds you and in some some sense infinite in</v>

749
00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:41.154
<v Speaker 2>scope,</v>

750
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.860
<v Speaker 2>and then you have the order that you produce,</v>

751
00:36:43.861 --> 00:36:46.440
<v Speaker 2>which is your mastery of it.</v>

752
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

753
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.570
<v Speaker 2>let's take order apart for a minute.</v>

754
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:52.320
<v Speaker 2>We want to think about the structure of order and bill,</v>

755
00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:55.500
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying that chaos is bad in order as good.</v>

756
00:36:55.501 --> 00:36:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that at all.</v>

757
00:36:56.551 --> 00:36:58.050
<v Speaker 2>That's not the right way to look at it.</v>

758
00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.213
<v Speaker 2>It's the balance.</v>

759
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.010
<v Speaker 2>It's the balance between them that's of crucial importance.</v>

760
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:02.830
<v Speaker 2>They just take.</v>

761
00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.950
<v Speaker 2>They exist as superordinate categories.</v>

762
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Whether you liked them or not is really not that relevant.</v>

763
00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 2>They're they're,</v>

764
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.870
<v Speaker 2>they're fundamental constituent elements of reality.</v>

765
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.610
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

766
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:14.881
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

767
00:37:14.881 --> 00:37:16.170
<v Speaker 2>what's your evidence for that?</v>

768
00:37:16.171 --> 00:37:20.400
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you one piece of evidence which I won't go into for for very much</v>

769
00:37:20.401 --> 00:37:21.234
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

770
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.870
<v Speaker 2>You have two hemispheres and each in your brain,</v>

771
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:26.970
<v Speaker 2>the brain is composed of two hemispheres,</v>

772
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.880
<v Speaker 2>which implies something about the nature of the world,</v>

773
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.050
<v Speaker 2>given that your brain is hypothetically adapted to the structure of the world.</v>

774
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:37.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not just your brain because animal brains have the same fundamental</v>

775
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:38.941
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

776
00:37:38.941 --> 00:37:43.440
<v Speaker 2>this bifurcated structure and the bifurcation indicates that there's two</v>

777
00:37:43.441 --> 00:37:47.340
<v Speaker 2>fundamental realities because otherwise why would you need a bifurcated</v>

778
00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:52.170
<v Speaker 2>structure or maybe you needed triune brain or one that's divided into four,</v>

779
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:53.400
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't what you have.</v>

780
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:58.500
<v Speaker 2>You have one that's divided into two and if your working definition of reality</v>

781
00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.700
<v Speaker 2>is scientific,</v>

782
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:00.781
<v Speaker 2>biological,</v>

783
00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:01.560
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

784
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:06.300
<v Speaker 2>then your definition of reality is reality is that which shapes life.</v>

785
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.500
<v Speaker 2>You can't actually do better than that from a Darwinian perspective,</v>

786
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:15.690
<v Speaker 2>and if the reality that shaped life produced a bifurcated representational</v>

787
00:38:15.691 --> 00:38:16.500
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

788
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:21.450
<v Speaker 2>then that implies that the proper way to represent reality and perhaps that</v>

789
00:38:21.451 --> 00:38:25.710
<v Speaker 2>reality itself is in fact bifurcated and I believe it's bifurcated in the manner</v>

790
00:38:25.711 --> 00:38:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I just described and the neurological evidence for that is actually quite</v>

791
00:38:30.151 --> 00:38:30.984
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming.</v>

792
00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.640
<v Speaker 2>It's come from multiple sources,</v>

793
00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:33.600
<v Speaker 2>some of them Russian,</v>

794
00:38:33.601 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 2>some of them American.</v>

795
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.760
<v Speaker 2>That's where most of the work has been done.</v>

796
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Your left hemisphere is specialized for operation in those situations that you</v>

797
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:43.120
<v Speaker 2>know and understand,</v>

798
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.320
<v Speaker 2>and your right hemisphere is specialized for operation in those situations that</v>

799
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:49.810
<v Speaker 2>you neither know nor understand,</v>

800
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.060
<v Speaker 2>and the proper way to orient yourself in life is to get the balance between</v>

801
00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:57.640
<v Speaker 2>those two sets of operations correct,</v>

802
00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.130
<v Speaker 2>and the way that manifests itself in your subjective experiences as meaningful</v>

803
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:03.964
<v Speaker 2>engagement.</v>

804
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.380
<v Speaker 2>And so that's not a bad first pass.</v>

805
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.600
<v Speaker 2>What would you say?</v>

806
00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:15.930
<v Speaker 2>Justification for the view that these two domains are the most real domains.</v>

807
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.031
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

808
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 2>so order.</v>

809
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.063
<v Speaker 2>What is order?</v>

810
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.253
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

811
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:25.420
<v Speaker 2>if you just sit there and do nothing,</v>

812
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.190
<v Speaker 2>that will be chaos.</v>

813
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.533
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

814
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:28.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

815
00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:29.580
<v Speaker 2>because you'll.</v>

816
00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.730
<v Speaker 2>You'll suffer and die.</v>

817
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what will happen.</v>

818
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.470
<v Speaker 2>So without action on your part.</v>

819
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Deterioration in death is a certainty.</v>

820
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

821
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:40.780
<v Speaker 2>so you need to act.</v>

822
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:45.760
<v Speaker 2>While when we built on an action platform been where the consequence of</v>

823
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:53.780
<v Speaker 2>3 billion years of evolution for action,</v>

824
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:55.341
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>

825
00:39:55.341 --> 00:40:00.341
<v Speaker 2>movement forward in the face of necessity is the prime dictum of life.</v>

826
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:02.270
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

827
00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Were embodied action.</v>

828
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.580
<v Speaker 2>What do you have to do when you act?</v>

829
00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

830
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.021
<v Speaker 2>at minimum,</v>

831
00:40:09.021 --> 00:40:11.180
<v Speaker 2>you have to do whatever keeps you able to act.</v>

832
00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.530
<v Speaker 2>These are truisms,</v>

833
00:40:12.531 --> 00:40:12.771
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

834
00:40:12.771 --> 00:40:13.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

835
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:14.630
<v Speaker 2>you have to have something to eat.</v>

836
00:40:14.631 --> 00:40:16.400
<v Speaker 2>You have to have some fresh water.</v>

837
00:40:16.401 --> 00:40:17.660
<v Speaker 2>You need some shelter,</v>

838
00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:18.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

839
00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.890
<v Speaker 2>You need some companionship.</v>

840
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.990
<v Speaker 2>You need a sexual partner,</v>

841
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.730
<v Speaker 2>you need children,</v>

842
00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:27.440
<v Speaker 2>you need play.</v>

843
00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.880
<v Speaker 2>You need to be touched,</v>

844
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:30.550
<v Speaker 2>and I mean,</v>

845
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I actually mean need by the way.</v>

846
00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:35.570
<v Speaker 2>People deprived to play go insane.</v>

847
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:37.010
<v Speaker 2>People who aren't touched,</v>

848
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:38.023
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

849
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.590
<v Speaker 2>These things are necessary.</v>

850
00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:39.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

851
00:40:39.831 --> 00:40:42.110
<v Speaker 2>assuming that survival itself is necessary,</v>

852
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:43.190
<v Speaker 2>but we'll start with that.</v>

853
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:48.020
<v Speaker 2>We'll start with the assumption that just sitting there and suffering and dying</v>

854
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:50.180
<v Speaker 2>is not the right solution.</v>

855
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

856
00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:52.850
<v Speaker 2>So you have to act in the world,</v>

857
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:58.010
<v Speaker 2>you have to act in the world that in a manner that stops you from deteriorating</v>

858
00:40:58.011 --> 00:40:59.390
<v Speaker 2>and dying at minimum,</v>

859
00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:04.670
<v Speaker 2>and that means that you have to address the problems that are intrinsic to that</v>

860
00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.593
<v Speaker 2>destiny.</v>

861
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Now you have all sorts of systems that evolved,</v>

862
00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.680
<v Speaker 2>have evolved to help you do that.</v>

863
00:41:09.681 --> 00:41:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Motivational systems we have to eat so you get hungry.</v>

864
00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.680
<v Speaker 2>You have to find water in and consume it.</v>

865
00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:16.670
<v Speaker 2>So you get thirsty,</v>

866
00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:17.780
<v Speaker 2>you get lonely,</v>

867
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.920
<v Speaker 2>you get curious.</v>

868
00:41:18.921 --> 00:41:19.754
<v Speaker 2>There's there's,</v>

869
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.760
<v Speaker 2>there's specialized biological systems that are very,</v>

870
00:41:22.761 --> 00:41:23.594
<v Speaker 2>very old.</v>

871
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:24.500
<v Speaker 2>You get aggressive,</v>

872
00:41:24.501 --> 00:41:25.460
<v Speaker 2>you get afraid,</v>

873
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:25.780
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

874
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.990
<v Speaker 2>you suffer pain,</v>

875
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:32.120
<v Speaker 2>all those specialized systems for all of those unit directional systems of</v>

876
00:41:32.121 --> 00:41:34.910
<v Speaker 2>orientation in the and they help you figure out what to do.</v>

877
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:35.870
<v Speaker 2>So when you're hungry,</v>

878
00:41:35.871 --> 00:41:37.540
<v Speaker 2>it's time to eat and when you're thirsty it's,</v>

879
00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:38.510
<v Speaker 2>it's time to drink.</v>

880
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.380
<v Speaker 2>And when your lonesome,</v>

881
00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:41.600
<v Speaker 2>it's time to seek out some companionship.</v>

882
00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:45.050
<v Speaker 2>And you have specialized systems that help you do that,</v>

883
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.760
<v Speaker 2>but they're not enough because,</v>

884
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:48.021
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

885
00:41:48.021 --> 00:41:48.950
<v Speaker 2>they're not very bright.</v>

886
00:41:48.951 --> 00:41:50.180
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of looking at it.</v>

887
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:53.630
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of uni dimensional and you also have the problem of organizing all</v>

888
00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:53.931
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

889
00:41:53.931 --> 00:41:54.261
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

890
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:54.381
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

891
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:57.440
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat now and you have to drink now and you need a companion.</v>

892
00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:01.190
<v Speaker 2>It's probably time to play and you have to do something about shelter and there</v>

893
00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:02.300
<v Speaker 2>isn't just you right now.</v>

894
00:42:02.301 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 2>There's you now and tomorrow and next week and a year from now,</v>

895
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:06.920
<v Speaker 2>five years from now,</v>

896
00:42:06.921 --> 00:42:11.450
<v Speaker 2>so you have to plan across all those stretches of time and there isn't just you</v>

897
00:42:11.451 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 2>now in the future,</v>

898
00:42:12.411 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 2>you there's you plus your family and your community and so all of that has to be</v>

899
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:18.890
<v Speaker 2>taken into account while you're plotting.</v>

900
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Your movement forward is very,</v>

901
00:42:21.351 --> 00:42:22.161
<v Speaker 2>very complicated.</v>

902
00:42:22.161 --> 00:42:26.270
<v Speaker 2>You have all these problems to solve simultaneously and your motivational</v>

903
00:42:26.271 --> 00:42:26.780
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>

904
00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.231
<v Speaker 2>anger,</v>

905
00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:31.490
<v Speaker 2>hunger and so forth can help you solve one of those problems now,</v>

906
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.070
<v Speaker 2>but not all of them permanently.</v>

907
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:38.270
<v Speaker 2>That requires higher cognitive function and that's part of what drove the</v>

908
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:41.300
<v Speaker 2>evolution of our complex cognitive systems.</v>

909
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:45.350
<v Speaker 2>That's how do you propagate the game across time in a complex environment.</v>

910
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.460
<v Speaker 2>The left hemisphere operates when,</v>

911
00:42:49.461 --> 00:42:49.880
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

912
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.420
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

913
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:55.130
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing works and so a lot of what you do during your life is to keep</v>

914
00:42:55.131 --> 00:42:57.080
<v Speaker 2>your right hemisphere off.</v>

915
00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.470
<v Speaker 2>People don't like it going on accidentally.</v>

916
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:02.180
<v Speaker 2>It's the home of negative emotion.</v>

917
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 2>It's the home of pain and anxiety.</v>

918
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.390
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing that turns on and freezes you in your tracks when something that</v>

919
00:43:08.391 --> 00:43:13.391
<v Speaker 2>you deeply did not expect happens and it prepares you to deal with the onslaught</v>

920
00:43:13.401 --> 00:43:14.660
<v Speaker 2>of what you didn't expect.</v>

921
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not all bad news because to use the right hemisphere in a judicious</v>

922
00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 2>manner is also something that adds intrigue and interest in artistic expression</v>

923
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:28.400
<v Speaker 2>and all sorts of positive things to your life.</v>

924
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:32.120
<v Speaker 2>So because potential is not only negative,</v>

925
00:43:32.121 --> 00:43:33.140
<v Speaker 2>it's also positive.</v>

926
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:34.040
<v Speaker 2>It can be,</v>

927
00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:39.040
<v Speaker 2>it can be dealt with in ways that are deeply enriching and meaningful order.</v>

928
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:41.541
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

929
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:42.920
<v Speaker 2>so you have to do something.</v>

930
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise the consequences are dire.</v>

931
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:48.201
<v Speaker 2>To do something,</v>

932
00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:49.580
<v Speaker 2>you have to value something.</v>

933
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a definitional issue because to do something is to act out the proposition</v>

934
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:57.350
<v Speaker 2>that the thing you're doing,</v>

935
00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.490
<v Speaker 2>the thing you're aiming at,</v>

936
00:43:58.491 --> 00:44:03.110
<v Speaker 2>let's say is preferable to the thing you have and preferable means you'll do it</v>

937
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:04.910
<v Speaker 2>so those things are tied together so tightly.</v>

938
00:44:04.911 --> 00:44:06.800
<v Speaker 2>You can't disentangle them.</v>

939
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:08.203
<v Speaker 2>If you say,</v>

940
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm aiming at x,</v>

941
00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:11.360
<v Speaker 2>but I don't value it,</v>

942
00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.580
<v Speaker 2>then there's something wrong with the way that you're conceptualizing the</v>

943
00:44:14.581 --> 00:44:19.581
<v Speaker 2>statement because to aim at something and to work to bring it into existence is</v>

944
00:44:20.091 --> 00:44:21.380
<v Speaker 2>the same as valuing it,</v>

945
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.341
<v Speaker 2>and if you say,</v>

946
00:44:22.341 --> 00:44:22.551
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

947
00:44:22.551 --> 00:44:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't value it,</v>

948
00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:24.890
<v Speaker 2>then something's out of kilter.</v>

949
00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:29.030
<v Speaker 2>Either you're acting out a false hood or you don't know what you're talking</v>

950
00:44:29.031 --> 00:44:29.480
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

951
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those two things and you meet people like that are deeply confused</v>

952
00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:33.550
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

953
00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Their action patterns and their verbal self representation don't Mesh,</v>

954
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.660
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that they're critics of value.</v>

955
00:44:42.661 --> 00:44:45.000
<v Speaker 2>It just means that they're deeply confused,</v>

956
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.360
<v Speaker 2>so you have to act or you suffer.</v>

957
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.201
<v Speaker 2>In order to act,</v>

958
00:44:49.201 --> 00:44:53.100
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a value structure because to act you have to value one thing</v>

959
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.030
<v Speaker 2>more than another,</v>

960
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.840
<v Speaker 2>which means that you have to inhabit a structure of value.</v>

961
00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.213
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

962
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:00.953
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

963
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:06.170
<v Speaker 2>so you need a structure value because it's the antidote to catastrophe.</v>

964
00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:08.483
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

965
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:11.760
<v Speaker 2>if you act out a structure of values socially,</v>

966
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.650
<v Speaker 2>which you will because you're social,</v>

967
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:17.940
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to pursue your aims in isolation because you're not.</v>

968
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.000
<v Speaker 2>You're not a solitary animal.</v>

969
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:22.650
<v Speaker 2>You're a social animal,</v>

970
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:24.270
<v Speaker 2>you're a tribal animal,</v>

971
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:26.250
<v Speaker 2>deeply tribal.</v>

972
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.630
<v Speaker 2>We live in groups.</v>

973
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.950
<v Speaker 2>We live in families,</v>

974
00:45:28.951 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 2>we live in communities.</v>

975
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:35.180
<v Speaker 2>We live in large societies were social at every level of analysis and we've been</v>

976
00:45:35.671 --> 00:45:39.630
<v Speaker 2>social for as long as we've been primates,</v>

977
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:41.310
<v Speaker 2>so maybe that's,</v>

978
00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:45.390
<v Speaker 2>that's at least 6 million years and it might be more like $60,</v>

979
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:46.200
<v Speaker 2>million years.</v>

980
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.150
<v Speaker 2>It's really a long time,</v>

981
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:51.840
<v Speaker 2>so it's not an arbitrary social construction.</v>

982
00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:52.861
<v Speaker 2>It's far,</v>

983
00:45:52.861 --> 00:45:53.940
<v Speaker 2>far deeper than that.</v>

984
00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Now what happens when you act out a structure of value in this social</v>

985
00:45:58.231 --> 00:45:59.064
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

986
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:03.480
<v Speaker 2>you produce a hierarchy inevitably.</v>

987
00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:04.591
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

988
00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:05.490
<v Speaker 2>let's think it through.</v>

989
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.533
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

990
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:07.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

991
00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:11.130
<v Speaker 2>let's say that you say that one thing is more worth doing than another,</v>

992
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever it happens to me,</v>

993
00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 2>and then you tell a bunch of people about what you're doing and they decided</v>

994
00:46:16.351 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to come along and help you do this thing that's valuable</v>

995
00:46:18.961 --> 00:46:23.490
<v Speaker 2>because they also think it's valuable and maybe you get 20 people together to do</v>

996
00:46:23.491 --> 00:46:24.270
<v Speaker 2>this thing.</v>

997
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it happens to me and the first thing you discover is that some of the</v>

998
00:46:27.931 --> 00:46:30.780
<v Speaker 2>people are way better at doing whatever it is that they're doing than other</v>

999
00:46:30.781 --> 00:46:31.614
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1000
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:36.240
<v Speaker 2>So and that and who knows why that is because it depends on what you chose to</v>

1001
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:36.750
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1002
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:37.021
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1003
00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:41.340
<v Speaker 2>If you chose a then it would be a different group of people who were good at it.</v>

1004
00:46:41.341 --> 00:46:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Then if you chose B,</v>

1005
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.400
<v Speaker 2>because people differ in their abilities,</v>

1006
00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:48.810
<v Speaker 2>but one thing you will not escape from if you make an organization to do</v>

1007
00:46:48.811 --> 00:46:53.811
<v Speaker 2>something valuable is the brute fact that it will be a minority of the people</v>

1008
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:55.590
<v Speaker 2>who are good at doing it.</v>

1009
00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.630
<v Speaker 2>And there's actually a law.</v>

1010
00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:01.140
<v Speaker 2>It's called price's law and it's a real law.</v>

1011
00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Even governs the size of cities and the massive stars and the heights of plants</v>

1012
00:47:06.901 --> 00:47:07.650
<v Speaker 2>in the jungle.</v>

1013
00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.140
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't govern human interactions.</v>

1014
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.460
<v Speaker 2>And price's law says that the square root of the number of people engaged in an</v>

1015
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:15.001
<v Speaker 2>enterprise,</v>

1016
00:47:15.001 --> 00:47:16.140
<v Speaker 2>we'll do half the work.</v>

1017
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.080
<v Speaker 2>So if you have 10 people doing something,</v>

1018
00:47:19.081 --> 00:47:20.460
<v Speaker 2>three of them will do half the work,</v>

1019
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.410
<v Speaker 2>but if you have 100 people doing something,</v>

1020
00:47:22.411 --> 00:47:24.180
<v Speaker 2>then 10 of them will do half the work.</v>

1021
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.950
<v Speaker 2>And if you have 10,000 people doing something than 100 of them will do half the</v>

1022
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.793
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

1023
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:30.820
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1024
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:35.680
<v Speaker 2>you know how wealth distributes itself such that a minority of people have most</v>

1025
00:47:35.681 --> 00:47:36.514
<v Speaker 2>of the money.</v>

1026
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Twelve 85 richest people in the world have as much money as the bottom two and a</v>

1027
00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:41.524
<v Speaker 2>half billion.</v>

1028
00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:42.640
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

1029
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 2>And everybody goes,</v>

1030
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:44.494
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1031
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:45.550
<v Speaker 2>the one percent.</v>

1032
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:46.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1033
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:46.721
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1034
00:47:46.721 --> 00:47:47.231
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1035
00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:48.370
<v Speaker 2>you're all the one percent.</v>

1036
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 2>So get over yourself because you're know western European,</v>

1037
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:57.730
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking and by world current world standards.</v>

1038
00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:59.590
<v Speaker 2>And certainly by historical standards,</v>

1039
00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.990
<v Speaker 2>you're all well ensconced in the one percent.</v>

1040
00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:03.910
<v Speaker 2>So if that's a problem,</v>

1041
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.200
<v Speaker 2>well it's a problem for all of you and some of you might be,</v>

1042
00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:08.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1043
00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.880
<v Speaker 2>richer than that,</v>

1044
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:12.820
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean all of you aren't in the same boat.</v>

1045
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:13.743
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>

1046
00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:19.150
<v Speaker 2>the fact that wealth aggregates in the hands of a small number of people is part</v>

1047
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 2>of the general expression of price's law.</v>

1048
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.250
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing special about the distribution of money.</v>

1049
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:29.170
<v Speaker 2>You see the same thing in every creative domain mean how many of you have have</v>

1050
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:30.260
<v Speaker 2>recorded a</v>

1051
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.920
<v Speaker 2>gold record?</v>

1052
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:37.940
<v Speaker 2>How many looks like zero up?</v>

1053
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:38.860
<v Speaker 2>There's one,</v>

1054
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:39.700
<v Speaker 2>one person,</v>

1055
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:40.211
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1056
00:48:40.211 --> 00:48:41.890
<v Speaker 2>there's 850 people in here.</v>

1057
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.380
<v Speaker 2>So there's one in the thousands.</v>

1058
00:48:43.381 --> 00:48:44.950
<v Speaker 2>So that's one 10th of one percent,</v>

1059
00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:45.784
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1060
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.550
<v Speaker 2>How many of you have written a piano concerto?</v>

1061
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1062
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 2>how bout painted a painting that's hanging in a national museum?</v>

1063
00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:57.311
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>

1064
00:48:57.311 --> 00:48:58.420
<v Speaker 2>it's none of view again,</v>

1065
00:48:58.900 --> 00:48:59.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1066
00:48:59.530 --> 00:48:59.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1067
00:48:59.831 --> 00:49:03.070
<v Speaker 2>and how many of you have been a member of a professional sports team?</v>

1068
00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:04.991
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1069
00:49:04.991 --> 00:49:06.520
<v Speaker 2>look up one one.</v>

1070
00:49:06.521 --> 00:49:07.720
<v Speaker 2>So that's one in 10,000.</v>

1071
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:08.051
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1072
00:49:08.051 --> 00:49:09.310
<v Speaker 2>you get the point here.</v>

1073
00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1074
00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.271
<v Speaker 2>if there was a couple,</v>

1075
00:49:10.271 --> 00:49:10.600
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>

1076
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:10.871
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1077
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:14.680
<v Speaker 2>So looks like it's easier to be a member of a professional sports team</v>

1078
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:20.110
<v Speaker 2>or my or my audience is is biased the samples biased,</v>

1079
00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:21.370
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1080
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:22.210
<v Speaker 2>but it is the case.</v>

1081
00:49:22.211 --> 00:49:25.810
<v Speaker 2>If you look at high levels of creative achievement of the sort of just described</v>

1082
00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:29.650
<v Speaker 2>that they characterize it staggering minority of people.</v>

1083
00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:35.070
<v Speaker 2>And so the rule is is that you produce a value system which you better produce</v>

1084
00:49:36.161 --> 00:49:39.490
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise you suffer and die and it isn't only that,</v>

1085
00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:40.150
<v Speaker 2>only that.</v>

1086
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1087
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:41.200
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1088
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.990
<v Speaker 2>here's something else you all know as far as I can tell,</v>

1089
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:50.710
<v Speaker 2>we start with the idea that there's an intrinsic chaotic element to life and</v>

1090
00:49:50.711 --> 00:49:55.711
<v Speaker 2>that includes the inevitability of suffering and malevolence betrayal at the</v>

1091
00:49:55.961 --> 00:49:57.460
<v Speaker 2>hands of yourself and other people.</v>

1092
00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.580
<v Speaker 2>So that's the baseline.</v>

1093
00:49:59.581 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's intolerable in many ways because life is in many ways intolerable.</v>

1094
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:04.780
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>

1095
00:50:04.781 --> 00:50:04.901
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1096
00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:07.150
<v Speaker 2>what do you do in the face of something that's intolerable?</v>

1097
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.940
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is when you try to find something that justifies it,</v>

1098
00:50:09.941 --> 00:50:10.151
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1099
00:50:10.151 --> 00:50:14.680
<v Speaker 2>You want to have something that gets you the hell out of bed in the morning and</v>

1100
00:50:14.681 --> 00:50:19.630
<v Speaker 2>not just any old morning but a morning when your father has Alzheimer's disease</v>

1101
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:23.410
<v Speaker 2>and your daughter has an incurable illness because you need something to get out</v>

1102
00:50:23.411 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 2>of bed for in those mornings too,</v>

1103
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:30.500
<v Speaker 2>and that better be the that you found in life and if the purpose is going to be</v>

1104
00:50:30.501 --> 00:50:32.960
<v Speaker 2>such that it gets you out of bed in those mornings,</v>

1105
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:37.940
<v Speaker 2>it better be a pretty damn noble purpose because otherwise why would you bother?</v>

1106
00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.520
<v Speaker 2>And so not only do you need a value structure,</v>

1107
00:50:40.521 --> 00:50:44.390
<v Speaker 2>you need one that's of sufficient tension,</v>

1108
00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:45.224
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1109
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:50.290
<v Speaker 2>or sufficient value or sufficient nobility so that it's worth suffering for</v>

1110
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:54.440
<v Speaker 2>because you're going to suffer and you better have something that makes the</v>

1111
00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:55.880
<v Speaker 2>suffering justifiable.</v>

1112
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:59.510
<v Speaker 2>And so not only do you need the value structure so that you don't just</v>

1113
00:50:59.511 --> 00:51:00.710
<v Speaker 2>deteriorate and die.</v>

1114
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:05.060
<v Speaker 2>You need the value structure so that when the flood comes in your life as it</v>

1115
00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:05.900
<v Speaker 2>certainly will,</v>

1116
00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.980
<v Speaker 2>that you have built a vessel that will sustain you through the catastrophe.</v>

1117
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's not this pursuit of happiness.</v>

1118
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not even the pursuit of security,</v>

1119
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.330
<v Speaker 2>it's none of that.</v>

1120
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:22.810
<v Speaker 2>It's the orientation that you've managed to produce in your own life towards a</v>

1121
00:51:23.241 --> 00:51:27.830
<v Speaker 2>higher good that's so high that it's worth bearing the burden of being to</v>

1122
00:51:27.831 --> 00:51:28.664
<v Speaker 2>produce.</v>

1123
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.340
<v Speaker 2>You implement that in the world.</v>

1124
00:51:31.341 --> 00:51:32.450
<v Speaker 2>You produce a hierarchy.</v>

1125
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.221
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>

1126
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:35.054
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1127
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.080
<v Speaker 2>and then you have the problem of hierarchy and the problem of hierarchy is a</v>

1128
00:51:39.081 --> 00:51:42.920
<v Speaker 2>very few people are going to be very good at whatever that hierarchy does and</v>

1129
00:51:42.921 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 2>then you have the second problem with hierarchy,</v>

1130
00:51:45.141 --> 00:51:49.250
<v Speaker 2>which is the problem I just laid out when I asked you about your spectacular</v>

1131
00:51:49.251 --> 00:51:52.610
<v Speaker 2>levels of attainment and found out that they were very.</v>

1132
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:54.500
<v Speaker 2>It was very unlikely.</v>

1133
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that you haven't attained worthwhile things.</v>

1134
00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:58.160
<v Speaker 2>That's not my point.</v>

1135
00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:03.350
<v Speaker 2>My point is is that very high levels of attainment or extraordinarily rare and</v>

1136
00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 2>that's an inevitability.</v>

1137
00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:08.570
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you decide that something's worth doing to inevitabilities,</v>

1138
00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:13.430
<v Speaker 2>people stack up at the top minority of people stack up at the top and take most</v>

1139
00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:14.390
<v Speaker 2>of the proceeds,</v>

1140
00:52:14.391 --> 00:52:17.240
<v Speaker 2>whatever they happen to be or deserve them or earn them,</v>

1141
00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:18.051
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1142
00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:18.381
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1143
00:52:18.381 --> 00:52:22.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't care how you conceptualize it and almost everybody else stacks up at the</v>

1144
00:52:22.281 --> 00:52:23.114
<v Speaker 2>bottom,</v>

1145
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:26.990
<v Speaker 2>and so the problem with hierarchies is that even though they're necessary,</v>

1146
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:30.650
<v Speaker 2>they tend to produce a situation where most people stack up at the bottom,</v>

1147
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:34.310
<v Speaker 2>and so that's the next thing that we have to contend with.</v>

1148
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:38.030
<v Speaker 2>You can't get rid of the hierarchies because if you get rid of the hierarchies,</v>

1149
00:52:38.031 --> 00:52:40.610
<v Speaker 2>there's no value structure and if there's no value structure,</v>

1150
00:52:40.611 --> 00:52:42.560
<v Speaker 2>not only do you deteriorate and die,</v>

1151
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:47.390
<v Speaker 2>you want to deteriorate and die and that's not a good solution.</v>

1152
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.220
<v Speaker 2>But if you do generate a hierarchy,</v>

1153
00:52:49.221 --> 00:52:51.980
<v Speaker 2>then you have the problem of the hierarchy.</v>

1154
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:56.690
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is the hierarchy is that it will dispossess most people now,</v>

1155
00:52:56.691 --> 00:53:00.080
<v Speaker 2>to the degree that the postmodernists have something to say,</v>

1156
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.660
<v Speaker 2>that's what they say is hierarchies,</v>

1157
00:53:02.661 --> 00:53:03.560
<v Speaker 2>dispossessed,</v>

1158
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:04.281
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1159
00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:09.281
<v Speaker 2>And then we can look at that clearly and carefully and we can say that doesn't</v>

1160
00:53:09.651 --> 00:53:10.730
<v Speaker 2>mean a,</v>

1161
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:15.290
<v Speaker 2>that hierarchies themselves are corrupt or that we can dispense with them,</v>

1162
00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:20.150
<v Speaker 2>but it also doesn't mean that we have no moral obligation to the dispossessed.</v>

1163
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:21.291
<v Speaker 2>And we say,</v>

1164
00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:21.411
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1165
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:24.170
<v Speaker 2>how do we deal with that politically,</v>

1166
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 2>conceptually and the way we deal with that,</v>

1167
00:53:26.281 --> 00:53:27.031
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>

1168
00:53:27.031 --> 00:53:31.650
<v Speaker 2>is to produce a political spectrum that ranges from left to right that deals</v>

1169
00:53:31.651 --> 00:53:34.020
<v Speaker 2>with hierarchy and the problems that hierarchies caused.</v>

1170
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:39.000
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that you can reliably assume about someone who's on the</v>

1171
00:53:39.001 --> 00:53:44.001
<v Speaker 2>right is that they will be patriotically in favor of the current hierarchy or</v>

1172
00:53:45.871 --> 00:53:47.640
<v Speaker 2>even more abstractly,</v>

1173
00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:52.350
<v Speaker 2>they're in favor of the idea of hierarchy itself and you say,</v>

1174
00:53:52.351 --> 00:53:52.531
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1175
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:57.531
<v Speaker 2>more power to the people on the right because you need hierarchies so they</v>

1176
00:53:57.751 --> 00:53:58.584
<v Speaker 2>should support them.</v>

1177
00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.810
<v Speaker 2>But then you have to take the people on the left who say,</v>

1178
00:54:00.811 --> 00:54:01.051
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1179
00:54:01.051 --> 00:54:04.680
<v Speaker 2>but what about the people who are dispossessed by the hierarchy?</v>

1180
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.330
<v Speaker 2>And what you have to say to them is,</v>

1181
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:07.283
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1182
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 2>we actually have to do something about that.</v>

1183
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:10.441
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

1184
00:54:10.441 --> 00:54:12.060
<v Speaker 2>well how do we do something about that?</v>

1185
00:54:12.061 --> 00:54:16.800
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is we don't actually know because there's no permanent solution</v>

1186
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.980
<v Speaker 2>to the problem of dispossession by the hierarchy.</v>

1187
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:22.590
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how to fix it.</v>

1188
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:23.731
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

1189
00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:23.941
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1190
00:54:23.941 --> 00:54:25.070
<v Speaker 2>we could flatten hierarchies.</v>

1191
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like not without disrupting the value structure.</v>

1192
00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:30.360
<v Speaker 2>That's a price you don't want to pay.</v>

1193
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:31.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1194
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:33.240
<v Speaker 2>we can take from the top and put it at the bottom.</v>

1195
00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:34.074
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1196
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.473
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1197
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:38.850
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically we could,</v>

1198
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.820
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that when you try that in practice,</v>

1199
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:42.871
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

1200
00:54:42.871 --> 00:54:47.871
<v Speaker 2>very easy to rapidly go too far and then what you end up with not is less</v>

1201
00:54:48.811 --> 00:54:50.040
<v Speaker 2>dispossessed.</v>

1202
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.400
<v Speaker 2>You end up with no one who has anything and that's not a good solution to the</v>

1203
00:54:56.161 --> 00:54:58.200
<v Speaker 2>problem of scarcity,</v>

1204
00:54:58.590 --> 00:54:59.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1205
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:03.510
<v Speaker 2>To make everyone equally dead or equally starving,</v>

1206
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:07.890
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially what the communist states did across the entirety of the</v>

1207
00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:12.891
<v Speaker 2>20th century is not the proper way to address the problem of hierarchy.</v>

1208
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Now it has to be addressed even if you're on the right,</v>

1209
00:55:16.351 --> 00:55:17.880
<v Speaker 2>because here's one thing that happens.</v>

1210
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Hierarchies tend to Ossify,</v>

1211
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:21.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1212
00:55:21.091 --> 00:55:23.610
<v Speaker 2>because what happens is that the people at the top,</v>

1213
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:25.140
<v Speaker 2>maybe they got there by merit,</v>

1214
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's easy for them to Gerrymander the system so they can stay there without</v>

1215
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:30.534
<v Speaker 2>merit.</v>

1216
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Or perhaps their children can stay there without merit or they can.</v>

1217
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Or the hierarchy becomes corrupt so that people who only use tyranny and power</v>

1218
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:39.804
<v Speaker 2>can climate,</v>

1219
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:43.020
<v Speaker 2>and so you don't have a hierarchy of competence and value anymore.</v>

1220
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:46.560
<v Speaker 2>You have a hierarchy of brute power which looks like a tyranny,</v>

1221
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 2>so there's all sorts of ways that hierarchies can deteriorate and we have to be</v>

1222
00:55:50.431 --> 00:55:53.040
<v Speaker 2>awake to ensure that that doesn't occur.</v>

1223
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:54.323
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1224
00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:59.790
<v Speaker 2>if the hierarchy gets so steep that everybody stacks up at zero and no one can</v>

1225
00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:00.624
<v Speaker 2>climb it,</v>

1226
00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:04.620
<v Speaker 2>which is basically the definition of a malfunctioning tyranny than all the</v>

1227
00:56:04.621 --> 00:56:06.990
<v Speaker 2>people at the bottom rightly think,</v>

1228
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:07.411
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1229
00:56:07.411 --> 00:56:11.370
<v Speaker 2>why don't we just destroy the game because we're already at zero?</v>

1230
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:13.380
<v Speaker 2>So what the hell do we have to lose?</v>

1231
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:17.400
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that you want to do if you're a sensible conservative,</v>

1232
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.690
<v Speaker 2>is make sure that the hierarchy maintains its routing and competence,</v>

1233
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:26.900
<v Speaker 2>that it's transparent and that it's climate double because otherwise it will</v>

1234
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:31.060
<v Speaker 2>ossify in steepen and then it will destroy itself.</v>

1235
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:35.290
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a conservative and you value stability and the hierarchy,</v>

1236
00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:39.640
<v Speaker 2>then you don't want to set up a situation where the most likely outcome is that</v>

1237
00:56:39.641 --> 00:56:41.140
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy destroys itself.</v>

1238
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:44.560
<v Speaker 2>So so we can be intelligent about this.</v>

1239
00:56:44.561 --> 00:56:45.041
<v Speaker 2>We could say,</v>

1240
00:56:45.041 --> 00:56:45.760
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1241
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.690
<v Speaker 2>don't be thinking.</v>

1242
00:56:46.691 --> 00:56:49.420
<v Speaker 2>You can get rid of hierarchies they've been around.</v>

1243
00:56:49.421 --> 00:56:50.680
<v Speaker 2>This is why I wrote chapter one.</v>

1244
00:56:50.681 --> 00:56:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I talked about lobsters.</v>

1245
00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:57.890
<v Speaker 2>The reason I talked about them is because not only is the hierarchical structure</v>

1246
00:56:59.021 --> 00:57:01.900
<v Speaker 2>itself as a permanent feature of existence,</v>

1247
00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 2>at least a third of a billion years old,</v>

1248
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:09.820
<v Speaker 2>which by the way means that you cannot attribute it to capitalism,</v>

1249
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:13.540
<v Speaker 2>the free market or the corrupt patriarchal west,</v>

1250
00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 2>unless you're willing to make the case that all three of those elements</v>

1251
00:57:17.171 --> 00:57:21.640
<v Speaker 2>contributed to the existence of dominance hierarchies among crustaceans,</v>

1252
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.650
<v Speaker 2>which seems highly unlikely.</v>

1253
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:24.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1254
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.230
<v Speaker 2>and this is actually something that's,</v>

1255
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:30.550
<v Speaker 2>that you can think about it as an idea that's actually directed towards the</v>

1256
00:57:30.551 --> 00:57:32.080
<v Speaker 2>productive left.</v>

1257
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:35.230
<v Speaker 2>If you want to help the dispossessed,</v>

1258
00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:40.770
<v Speaker 2>don't blame the existence of hierarchies on capitalism because it's wrong.</v>

1259
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.800
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong that the problem is way deeper than that.</v>

1260
00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.710
<v Speaker 2>And here's something else that's very interesting about capitalism,</v>

1261
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:49.870
<v Speaker 2>couple of things you might consider,</v>

1262
00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:51.243
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1263
00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:53.980
<v Speaker 2>we have become spectacularly wealthy since 18,</v>

1264
00:57:53.981 --> 00:57:54.670
<v Speaker 2>95,</v>

1265
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:55.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1266
00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:58.330
<v Speaker 2>First in the West Icelands at classic example.</v>

1267
00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean you guys are so much more wealthy than you were a hundred years ago that</v>

1268
00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:03.250
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely impossible to believe.</v>

1269
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:07.450
<v Speaker 2>And so that's first happened in the west to exponential economic growth starting</v>

1270
00:58:07.451 --> 00:58:08.620
<v Speaker 2>in about 1895.</v>

1271
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:09.700
<v Speaker 2>There's a long tail.</v>

1272
00:58:09.701 --> 00:58:09.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1273
00:58:09.911 --> 00:58:11.290
<v Speaker 2>people were improving before that,</v>

1274
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:12.860
<v Speaker 2>but it really kicked in around 18,</v>

1275
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:16.270
<v Speaker 2>95 and first happened in the west and now it's happening everywhere in the</v>

1276
00:58:16.271 --> 00:58:16.840
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1277
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this,</v>

1278
00:58:17.921 --> 00:58:18.754
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1279
00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:25.000
<v Speaker 2>the UN set a goal in 2000 to have the level of absolute poverty in the world by</v>

1280
00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:26.230
<v Speaker 2>2015,</v>

1281
00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:30.010
<v Speaker 2>which is the fastest rate of economic growth ever recorded.</v>

1282
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:32.380
<v Speaker 2>We attained it in 2012,</v>

1283
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.380
<v Speaker 2>three years ahead of the most optimistic projections.</v>

1284
00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:36.461
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1285
00:58:36.461 --> 00:58:40.480
<v Speaker 2>And so people are being lifted out of poverty at a rate that has never been seen</v>

1286
00:58:40.481 --> 00:58:44.830
<v Speaker 2>in the history of the world hooked to the power grids provided with cell phones</v>

1287
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:46.480
<v Speaker 2>provided with free,</v>

1288
00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:51.010
<v Speaker 2>with access to fresh water provided with access to medications that decrease</v>

1289
00:58:51.011 --> 00:58:52.000
<v Speaker 2>child mortality.</v>

1290
00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at the statistics,</v>

1291
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.550
<v Speaker 2>there are so many things getting better so fast you cannot even believe it.</v>

1292
00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:58.750
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1293
00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:03.750
<v Speaker 2>and here's the consequences as far as as far as the data indicate of the</v>

1294
00:59:03.761 --> 00:59:05.410
<v Speaker 2>operation of the free market system,</v>

1295
00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.600
<v Speaker 2>which does produce inequality.</v>

1296
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:08.613
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing,</v>

1297
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:10.390
<v Speaker 2>but as far as I can tell,</v>

1298
00:59:10.391 --> 00:59:15.391
<v Speaker 2>the only system that has ever produced wealth and as law or has every system</v>

1299
00:59:16.091 --> 00:59:17.380
<v Speaker 2>produces inequality,</v>

1300
00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:21.010
<v Speaker 2>but the only system we know of that produces,</v>

1301
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.830
<v Speaker 2>produces wealth and inequality is the free market.</v>

1302
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:28.190
<v Speaker 2>So here's a question for everyone left and right.</v>

1303
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:31.910
<v Speaker 2>How many units of inequality will you tolerate to produce one unit of wealth?</v>

1304
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.610
<v Speaker 2>And if the answer is zero,</v>

1305
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.250
<v Speaker 2>then you've gone too far.</v>

1306
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:40.790
<v Speaker 2>You're outside the appropriate political debate.</v>

1307
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:42.530
<v Speaker 2>That's the wrong answer.</v>

1308
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:47.660
<v Speaker 2>And if you try to impose that all there will be as mayhem because the price we</v>

1309
00:59:47.661 --> 00:59:50.570
<v Speaker 2>pay for wealth is inequality.</v>

1310
00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't mean that you can let inequality run to its ultimate extreme</v>

1311
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:57.980
<v Speaker 2>because then you run into the other problem,</v>

1312
00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:59.570
<v Speaker 2>which is the monopoly problem.</v>

1313
00:59:59.571 --> 01:00:00.590
<v Speaker 2>You've all played monopoly.</v>

1314
01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:03.230
<v Speaker 2>I presume what happens in every monopoly game,</v>

1315
01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.750
<v Speaker 2>if you lay it out,</v>

1316
01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:09.650
<v Speaker 2>everyone stacks out at zero up at zero except one person.</v>

1317
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:10.041
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1318
01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:11.420
<v Speaker 2>if you play it 50 times,</v>

1319
01:00:11.421 --> 01:00:14.990
<v Speaker 2>you'll find that it's hardly ever the same person because it's basically a game</v>

1320
01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:17.630
<v Speaker 2>of chance and there's a fair bit of chance by the way,</v>

1321
01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:19.700
<v Speaker 2>operating in the distribution of money in the world.</v>

1322
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not all chance,</v>

1323
01:00:20.721 --> 01:00:21.950
<v Speaker 2>but there's a fair bit of chance.</v>

1324
01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:26.420
<v Speaker 2>But the logical conclusion to a hierarchy that can play itself out totally is</v>

1325
01:00:26.421 --> 01:00:29.450
<v Speaker 2>that one person has everything and everyone else has nothing.</v>

1326
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Obviously that's not a useful outcome.</v>

1327
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:33.733
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1328
01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.080
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

1329
01:00:35.081 --> 01:00:38.210
<v Speaker 2>in the way there are ways that we fix that in our society.</v>

1330
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:42.710
<v Speaker 2>We have progressive tax policies and you can argue about their utility,</v>

1331
01:00:42.711 --> 01:00:46.700
<v Speaker 2>but that's one way of rectifying it potentially.</v>

1332
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Another way of rectifying is that we don't have one game,</v>

1333
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.220
<v Speaker 2>right in a pluralistic society,</v>

1334
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:53.001
<v Speaker 2>we have many,</v>

1335
01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:56.930
<v Speaker 2>many games that people can play and so if you can't be a successful lawyer,</v>

1336
01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:00.050
<v Speaker 2>then maybe you could be a successful plumber and if you can't be a successful</v>

1337
01:01:00.051 --> 01:01:00.560
<v Speaker 2>plumber,</v>

1338
01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.540
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can run this small restaurant or you know,</v>

1339
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:04.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a diversity of games.</v>

1340
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:06.170
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a good way of,</v>

1341
01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.700
<v Speaker 2>of allowing,</v>

1342
01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:12.290
<v Speaker 2>of increasing the robustness of the system so that you don't get hierarchies</v>

1343
01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:16.280
<v Speaker 2>that are so steep that they collapsed in upon themselves.</v>

1344
01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:20.390
<v Speaker 2>And so those are sophisticated approaches and perhaps your other approaches to.</v>

1345
01:01:20.391 --> 01:01:21.920
<v Speaker 2>But it's an intractable problem.</v>

1346
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:23.330
<v Speaker 2>It says in the New Testament,</v>

1347
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:26.660
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things you'd swear would be edited out because it's such a harsh</v>

1348
01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.673
<v Speaker 2>statement.</v>

1349
01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:28.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1350
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.080
<v Speaker 2>the poor will be with us always.</v>

1351
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1352
01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:31.940
<v Speaker 2>what's that in reference to?</v>

1353
01:01:31.941 --> 01:01:34.220
<v Speaker 2>It's also in reference to the matthew principle,</v>

1354
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:39.370
<v Speaker 2>which is another new testament statement and happens to be an economic axiom to</v>

1355
01:01:39.741 --> 01:01:43.310
<v Speaker 2>those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing.</v>

1356
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Everything will be taken.</v>

1357
01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:49.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the structure of the world and you can't lay it at the feet of the West.</v>

1358
01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.170
<v Speaker 2>It's the structure of the world.</v>

1359
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Now that means we have to contend with it and it's not an easy thing to contend</v>

1360
01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:58.880
<v Speaker 2>with and part of the reason that we have a continual political dialogue and that</v>

1361
01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:03.170
<v Speaker 2>we need to have a continual political dialogue is to make sure that our</v>

1362
01:02:03.171 --> 01:02:06.230
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies exist and remain intact,</v>

1363
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:10.820
<v Speaker 2>but don't become so steep and corrupt that they destroy themselves and you need</v>

1364
01:02:10.821 --> 01:02:12.050
<v Speaker 2>a left and a right for that,</v>

1365
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:17.590
<v Speaker 2>and if that means the left half has to admit that hierarchies are not only</v>

1366
01:02:18.021 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 2>necessary but valuable and the right has to admit that despite their necessity</v>

1367
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:23.670
<v Speaker 2>and value,</v>

1368
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>they tend to stack people up at the bottom and that actually constitutes a</v>

1369
01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:28.530
<v Speaker 2>continual problem.</v>

1370
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.090
<v Speaker 2>You see that in.</v>

1371
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.290
<v Speaker 2>You see that in the old testament because one of the things that happens in the</v>

1372
01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 2>old testament is Israel struggles up to state and empire status.</v>

1373
01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Six Times.</v>

1374
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.850
<v Speaker 2>It struggles out of the chaos,</v>

1375
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:46.410
<v Speaker 2>up to empire status,</v>

1376
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.270
<v Speaker 2>and then it gets corrupt.</v>

1377
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.310
<v Speaker 2>It loses the way.</v>

1378
01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:53.370
<v Speaker 2>It isn't balancing things between chaos and order properly.</v>

1379
01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:57.660
<v Speaker 2>The kings get arrogant is so to the people and they forget their relationship</v>

1380
01:02:57.661 --> 01:02:58.494
<v Speaker 2>with God.</v>

1381
01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.880
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it,</v>

1382
01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.560
<v Speaker 2>and then a profit comes up and says,</v>

1383
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.740
<v Speaker 2>you aren't paying enough attention to the widows and the orphans.</v>

1384
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.390
<v Speaker 2>You better look out because that displeases God and the Israelites who are stiff</v>

1385
01:03:09.391 --> 01:03:13.140
<v Speaker 2>necked and arrogant think what's God going to do to us,</v>

1386
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:17.850
<v Speaker 2>which is not a very wise way of thinking and so they don't take the steps</v>

1387
01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:21.960
<v Speaker 2>necessary to rectify their deviation from the proper path and they get</v>

1388
01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:27.050
<v Speaker 2>absolutely flattened and the consequences of that last for generations like</v>

1389
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:28.830
<v Speaker 2>seven generations,</v>

1390
01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:32.910
<v Speaker 2>and then they struggle their way up to something approximating empire status</v>

1391
01:03:32.911 --> 01:03:35.550
<v Speaker 2>again and exactly the same thing happens.</v>

1392
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:40.380
<v Speaker 2>They forget and they collapse and there's six stories like that in the Old</v>

1393
01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Testament.</v>

1394
01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:45.810
<v Speaker 2>It's all documented by a man named Northrop Frye who is a Canadian literary</v>

1395
01:03:45.811 --> 01:03:47.790
<v Speaker 2>critic who wrote a couple of books on the Bible.</v>

1396
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:50.460
<v Speaker 2>One called the great code and the other called words with power,</v>

1397
01:03:50.461 --> 01:03:52.020
<v Speaker 2>which I would highly recommend.</v>

1398
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:54.390
<v Speaker 2>It's an analysis of the Bible as literature.</v>

1399
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant for those of you who might be interested in union thinking,</v>

1400
01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.420
<v Speaker 2>fries thinking is a nice adjunct,</v>

1401
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:01.970
<v Speaker 2>so alright,</v>

1402
01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:02.873
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1403
01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.700
<v Speaker 2>so that's the nature of the world.</v>

1404
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Order chaos and order,</v>

1405
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.190
<v Speaker 2>and your goal is to keep those,</v>

1406
01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:15.330
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between those two things optimized and you do that by doing</v>

1407
01:04:15.331 --> 01:04:16.111
<v Speaker 2>what's meaningful,</v>

1408
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:17.400
<v Speaker 2>not what's expedient.</v>

1409
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.640
<v Speaker 2>That's rule six and you ensure that you have the world construed properly by</v>

1410
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:25.140
<v Speaker 2>following rule number eight,</v>

1411
01:04:25.141 --> 01:04:27.900
<v Speaker 2>which is tell the truth or at least don't lie.</v>

1412
01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:28.910
<v Speaker 2>You don't want a path.</v>

1413
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:29.580
<v Speaker 2>All the guys,</v>

1414
01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.660
<v Speaker 2>the instinct that orients you in the world and you will pathologize it by</v>

1415
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.520
<v Speaker 2>engaging in habitual deceit,</v>

1416
01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:38.430
<v Speaker 2>and the reason you do that is when you practice something,</v>

1417
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:43.170
<v Speaker 2>you build structures that specialize in that and then they run automatically.</v>

1418
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:44.970
<v Speaker 2>So if you're living a lie,</v>

1419
01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 2>which is a very common thing for people to do,</v>

1420
01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:50.400
<v Speaker 2>then you're building neurological mechanisms that view the world through that</v>

1421
01:04:50.401 --> 01:04:52.050
<v Speaker 2>lie and once they're built,</v>

1422
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:55.200
<v Speaker 2>they're you and good luck unbuilding them.</v>

1423
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.071
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

1424
01:04:56.071 --> 01:04:56.761
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>

1425
01:04:56.761 --> 01:05:00.600
<v Speaker 2>That's in part what happens to people who are addicted by the way they build</v>

1426
01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.760
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms of search,</v>

1427
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:07.680
<v Speaker 2>neurological structures that are focused on the drug and those systems are alive</v>

1428
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:10.460
<v Speaker 2>and all they want is the drug and they're,</v>

1429
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.041
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

1430
01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not psychological.</v>

1431
01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1432
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.820
<v Speaker 2>It's psychophysiological.</v>

1433
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Don't build structures of cognition predicated on deception because you will pay</v>

1434
01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:21.424
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

1435
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're going to guide your life with the orientation of the instinct</v>

1436
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:25.960
<v Speaker 2>of meaning,</v>

1437
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:30.430
<v Speaker 2>then you have to be very careful with what you say and write and think because</v>

1438
01:05:30.431 --> 01:05:32.980
<v Speaker 2>every time you say or write or think something,</v>

1439
01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:36.820
<v Speaker 2>you build a little neurological structure that specialized for that and it</v>

1440
01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:39.130
<v Speaker 2>participates in this parsing of the world.</v>

1441
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:41.380
<v Speaker 2>So all right,</v>

1442
01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.170
<v Speaker 2>chaos and order.</v>

1443
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Then you can say the order orders a hierarchy.</v>

1444
01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1445
01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:54.240
<v Speaker 2>so here's the next question.</v>

1446
01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Next two questions is order a hierarchy</v>

1447
01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.890
<v Speaker 2>and then a subsidiary question would be,</v>

1448
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:05.840
<v Speaker 2>if order is a hierarchy,</v>

1449
01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.430
<v Speaker 2>what's what?</v>

1450
01:06:07.431 --> 01:06:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Either what is at the top of the hierarchy or what should be at the top of the</v>

1451
01:06:11.721 --> 01:06:12.554
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>

1452
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:14.630
<v Speaker 2>The hierarchy is a structure value.</v>

1453
01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:18.800
<v Speaker 2>So that's the question is what should be of ultimate value.</v>

1454
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1455
01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:22.280
<v Speaker 2>So now we're going to take that apart a little bit.</v>

1456
01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.780
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I would say,</v>

1457
01:06:23.781 --> 01:06:26.660
<v Speaker 2>his order is not a hierarchy.</v>

1458
01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Order is a set of hierarchies.</v>

1459
01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:32.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a different thing.</v>

1460
01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:33.883
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1461
01:06:35.330 --> 01:06:36.950
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you how to think about that.</v>

1462
01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1463
01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:42.730
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you have a child and they're playing soccer and uh,</v>

1464
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:45.800
<v Speaker 2>your child is a pretty good soccer player.</v>

1465
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:47.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1466
01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a different story.</v>

1467
01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:51.170
<v Speaker 2>This actually happened.</v>

1468
01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:56.480
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to tell you a story about hockey and I'm since I'm Canadian.</v>

1469
01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:57.351
<v Speaker 2>What the hell?</v>

1470
01:06:57.351 --> 01:06:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I might as well tell you a story about hockey.</v>

1471
01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:00.043
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1472
01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:01.760
<v Speaker 2>my son played hockey.</v>

1473
01:07:01.761 --> 01:07:02.690
<v Speaker 2>He still plays hockey.</v>

1474
01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:07.900
<v Speaker 2>He's a pretty good hockey player and my wife and I used to go watch him play</v>

1475
01:07:07.971 --> 01:07:08.630
<v Speaker 2>hockey.</v>

1476
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:12.050
<v Speaker 2>There was an arena just down the street from us and there was a nice</v>

1477
01:07:12.051 --> 01:07:13.280
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood league there.</v>

1478
01:07:13.281 --> 01:07:18.170
<v Speaker 2>And so they'd start the kids into teams and then they let them play a few demo</v>

1479
01:07:18.171 --> 01:07:23.171
<v Speaker 2>games and if any team was getting stomped flat or any other team was winning too</v>

1480
01:07:23.421 --> 01:07:24.254
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

1481
01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.070
<v Speaker 2>then they'd rebalance the teams.</v>

1482
01:07:26.071 --> 01:07:29.930
<v Speaker 2>So that they were approximately equal in skill.</v>

1483
01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:32.390
<v Speaker 2>So that was the sorting of the teams.</v>

1484
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:33.411
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1485
01:07:33.411 --> 01:07:34.244
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1486
01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:35.800
<v Speaker 2>and then they,</v>

1487
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:40.250
<v Speaker 2>then they were on their teams and then they'd play 15 games during the regular</v>

1488
01:07:40.251 --> 01:07:40.551
<v Speaker 2>season.</v>

1489
01:07:40.551 --> 01:07:41.480
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have a little tournament,</v>

1490
01:07:41.481 --> 01:07:44.210
<v Speaker 2>see who won and it was really good.</v>

1491
01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.650
<v Speaker 2>It was good friendly league.</v>

1492
01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:48.680
<v Speaker 2>And so my son's team was in,</v>

1493
01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the championship game,</v>

1494
01:07:50.841 --> 01:07:51.980
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>

1495
01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.473
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1496
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:58.430
<v Speaker 2>there's one kid on his team who is the best player on the team by quite a</v>

1497
01:07:58.431 --> 01:07:58.940
<v Speaker 2>margin,</v>

1498
01:07:58.940 --> 01:07:59.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1499
01:07:59.211 --> 01:08:00.740
<v Speaker 2>he was very fast on his feet.</v>

1500
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:02.030
<v Speaker 2>He could,</v>

1501
01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:03.830
<v Speaker 2>he could skate rings around a lot of the kids.</v>

1502
01:08:03.831 --> 01:08:04.940
<v Speaker 2>He was good at stick handling.</v>

1503
01:08:04.941 --> 01:08:05.930
<v Speaker 2>He was a good hockey player.</v>

1504
01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:07.910
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1505
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:09.890
<v Speaker 2>he had some problems.</v>

1506
01:08:09.891 --> 01:08:10.724
<v Speaker 2>This kid,</v>

1507
01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.910
<v Speaker 2>one problem was he wouldn't pass the puck.</v>

1508
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:15.651
<v Speaker 2>Now you think,</v>

1509
01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:15.771
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1510
01:08:15.771 --> 01:08:18.350
<v Speaker 2>why the hell should you pass the park if you're the best hockey player?</v>

1511
01:08:18.351 --> 01:08:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Which is pretty much what he thought.</v>

1512
01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:21.080
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

1513
01:08:21.081 --> 01:08:21.914
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1514
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:23.990
<v Speaker 2>you're part of a team,</v>

1515
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:25.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1516
01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.170
<v Speaker 2>You want to be the best person on the team,</v>

1517
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:30.410
<v Speaker 2>fair enough and you want to win the hockey game.</v>

1518
01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:36.160
<v Speaker 2>But you also want to what make your team mates better players.</v>

1519
01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:37.813
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

1520
01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you even want to meet the people on other teams,</v>

1521
01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:41.390
<v Speaker 2>better players I knew,</v>

1522
01:08:41.391 --> 01:08:43.130
<v Speaker 2>now I know that's going a little bit too far,</v>

1523
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:48.230
<v Speaker 2>but you certainly want to make your teammates better players and you might</v>

1524
01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:48.441
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1525
01:08:48.441 --> 01:08:49.400
<v Speaker 2>well why would you do that?</v>

1526
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Because if there are better than maybe you won't be the best while that's a bone</v>

1527
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:57.170
<v Speaker 2>headed way of looking at the world because first of all,</v>

1528
01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.660
<v Speaker 2>if you amp up the competition around you,</v>

1529
01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:04.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe that'll motivate you to be even better and it's a hell of a way to win by</v>

1530
01:09:04.791 --> 01:09:06.200
<v Speaker 2>making everyone else lose.</v>

1531
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:08.420
<v Speaker 2>That's not much of a victory.</v>

1532
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:10.400
<v Speaker 2>And so if you have any sense,</v>

1533
01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:12.440
<v Speaker 2>you pass the damn park.</v>

1534
01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're the better player,</v>

1535
01:09:14.061 --> 01:09:16.250
<v Speaker 2>especially you especially do that.</v>

1536
01:09:16.251 --> 01:09:18.800
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you've got a comfortable two goal lead,</v>

1537
01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:24.820
<v Speaker 2>well then maybe you can risk taking the time away from that specific game to</v>

1538
01:09:26.361 --> 01:09:27.560
<v Speaker 2>build up the confidence,</v>

1539
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:30.020
<v Speaker 2>confidence and ability of your teammates.</v>

1540
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:33.770
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe everybody thinks that you're a bit of a leader and they make you</v>

1541
01:09:33.771 --> 01:09:34.604
<v Speaker 2>team captain.</v>

1542
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Not even so much because you're the best hockey player,</v>

1543
01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:38.174
<v Speaker 2>but because.</v>

1544
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1545
01:09:39.021 --> 01:09:39.854
<v Speaker 2>because why?</v>

1546
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>

1547
01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:41.841
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1548
01:09:41.841 --> 01:09:46.250
<v Speaker 2>So we're watching the game and it's pretty exciting and it's real close game and</v>

1549
01:09:46.251 --> 01:09:51.251
<v Speaker 2>it's like three to three and it's a minute left and now their team zips down the</v>

1550
01:09:52.051 --> 01:09:54.350
<v Speaker 2>nice and scores and really brilliant goal.</v>

1551
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:59.530
<v Speaker 2>And so my son's team loses except that they were in the championship and it was</v>

1552
01:10:00.051 --> 01:10:00.980
<v Speaker 2>a really good game.</v>

1553
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:04.790
<v Speaker 2>So you know whether or not they lost is not all that obvious.</v>

1554
01:10:04.791 --> 01:10:05.870
<v Speaker 2>They lost that game,</v>

1555
01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:06.861
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1556
01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:09.590
<v Speaker 2>there's a broader context to take into consideration.</v>

1557
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:10.131
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1558
01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:11.900
<v Speaker 2>So this kid,</v>

1559
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:18.220
<v Speaker 2>the star goes off the ice and he takes his hockey stick and he smashes it onto</v>

1560
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:21.740
<v Speaker 2>the cement and he's all angry because as far as he was concerned,</v>

1561
01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:22.910
<v Speaker 2>he was robbed.</v>

1562
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:27.330
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's because of his useless teammates who he didn't really spend any</v>

1563
01:10:27.331 --> 01:10:28.880
<v Speaker 2>time helping by the way.</v>

1564
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.140
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's because the referees were unfair and who the hell knows why but</v>

1565
01:10:33.141 --> 01:10:38.141
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't fair and his idiot farther rushes over to him and consoles him in on</v>

1566
01:10:40.641 --> 01:10:45.641
<v Speaker 2>his loss and supports them in his notion that he was robbed and I thought you</v>

1567
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:50.780
<v Speaker 2>unspeakable son of a bitch</v>

1568
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.000
<v Speaker 2>because he was an arrogant narcissist and it was way more important to him that</v>

1569
01:11:01.121 --> 01:11:06.121
<v Speaker 2>he had a son who was a star then that he had a son who is a good person</v>

1570
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.000
<v Speaker 2>and that's absolutely inexcusable.</v>

1571
01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:13.310
<v Speaker 2>He made the wrong choice.</v>

1572
01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:18.650
<v Speaker 2>He sacrificed his son Soul in part to help them save face for a hockey game.</v>

1573
01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.540
<v Speaker 2>That's not acceptable.</v>

1574
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.431
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1575
01:11:25.431 --> 01:11:26.900
<v Speaker 2>So here's what you tell your children.</v>

1576
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:30.850
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter whether you win or lose,</v>

1577
01:11:30.851 --> 01:11:32.080
<v Speaker 2>it matters how you play the game.</v>

1578
01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.910
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what the father should have told the son and he should have meant</v>

1579
01:11:36.911 --> 01:11:37.390
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1580
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:38.051
<v Speaker 2>And even better,</v>

1581
01:11:38.051 --> 01:11:39.520
<v Speaker 2>he should have known what it meant.</v>

1582
01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:43.930
<v Speaker 2>But who knows what that means because you tell your children that and maybe</v>

1583
01:11:43.931 --> 01:11:47.830
<v Speaker 2>they're not so happy because they lost a game and they look at you like you're</v>

1584
01:11:47.831 --> 01:11:48.664
<v Speaker 2>an alien.</v>

1585
01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:49.811
<v Speaker 2>And they think,</v>

1586
01:11:49.811 --> 01:11:49.961
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1587
01:11:49.961 --> 01:11:51.190
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do you mean by that?</v>

1588
01:11:51.191 --> 01:11:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously it matters whether you win and it does matter whether you win.</v>

1589
01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:58.450
<v Speaker 2>So what is it that you mean when you say that?</v>

1590
01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.800
<v Speaker 2>And your kid asks,</v>

1591
01:11:59.801 --> 01:11:59.921
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1592
01:11:59.921 --> 01:12:00.880
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>

1593
01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:02.050
<v Speaker 2>And you go,</v>

1594
01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:02.531
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1595
01:12:02.531 --> 01:12:03.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it means,</v>

1596
01:12:03.431 --> 01:12:04.900
<v Speaker 2>but it's a good rule.</v>

1597
01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.970
<v Speaker 2>So what do you mean by that?</v>

1598
01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Here's what you mean.</v>

1599
01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:14.540
<v Speaker 2>And it relates to rule five,</v>

1600
01:12:14.541 --> 01:12:15.740
<v Speaker 2>which is don't make your.</v>

1601
01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.800
<v Speaker 2>Don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them because other</v>

1602
01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:19.880
<v Speaker 2>people will dislike them.</v>

1603
01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:23.600
<v Speaker 2>That and you don't want other people to dislike your children unless you want</v>

1604
01:12:23.601 --> 01:12:26.720
<v Speaker 2>your children to inhabit a world where everyone dislikes them.</v>

1605
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:30.770
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you do because you don't like your children and maybe you don't like</v>

1606
01:12:30.771 --> 01:12:34.130
<v Speaker 2>your children because you let them behave in ways that makes you not like them.</v>

1607
01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:37.760
<v Speaker 2>And so the way you take revenge is by not correcting them so that other people</v>

1608
01:12:37.761 --> 01:12:40.670
<v Speaker 2>will punish them because you don't have the courage to discipline them.</v>

1609
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:43.100
<v Speaker 2>And if you think that people don't play that game,</v>

1610
01:12:43.101 --> 01:12:46.550
<v Speaker 2>then you don't know much about people because they play that game all the time.</v>

1611
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:48.141
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

1612
01:12:48.141 --> 01:12:48.974
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1613
01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:52.630
<v Speaker 2>it matters how you play the game.</v>

1614
01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.190
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter whether you win or lose.</v>

1615
01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Let's take that apart.</v>

1616
01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:55.631
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1617
01:12:55.631 --> 01:12:56.650
<v Speaker 2>so the first thing is,</v>

1618
01:12:56.950 --> 01:13:00.850
<v Speaker 2>and this goes back to the idea of the hierarchy is order a hierarchy and the</v>

1619
01:13:00.851 --> 01:13:01.750
<v Speaker 2>answer is no,</v>

1620
01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a set of all hierarchies.</v>

1621
01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Or You could say it's the,</v>

1622
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:10.670
<v Speaker 2>it's the set of all possible hierarchies because you know in,</v>

1623
01:13:10.671 --> 01:13:12.220
<v Speaker 2>in a society at a given time,</v>

1624
01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:13.840
<v Speaker 2>there's hierarchies that function.</v>

1625
01:13:13.841 --> 01:13:14.890
<v Speaker 2>But that transforms.</v>

1626
01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:16.600
<v Speaker 2>And then there's new hierarchies that function.</v>

1627
01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.010
<v Speaker 2>The specifics of the hierarchies change,</v>

1628
01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:23.650
<v Speaker 2>but the fact of the hierarchies remains.</v>

1629
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:28.780
<v Speaker 2>And so you can imagine a hierarchy as a metal structure that consists of a</v>

1630
01:13:28.781 --> 01:13:30.790
<v Speaker 2>multitude of possible hierarchies.</v>

1631
01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's going to change as life continues.</v>

1632
01:13:33.311 --> 01:13:38.311
<v Speaker 2>And so what you want for your children is not to be the master of hierarchy you</v>

1633
01:13:38.411 --> 01:13:42.310
<v Speaker 2>want for your children to be the master of the set of all possible hierarchies,</v>

1634
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:45.350
<v Speaker 2>because then no matter how things change,</v>

1635
01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:47.140
<v Speaker 2>they're ready say,</v>

1636
01:13:47.141 --> 01:13:47.291
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1637
01:13:47.291 --> 01:13:50.260
<v Speaker 2>how is it that you get ready for things to change?</v>

1638
01:13:50.261 --> 01:13:54.160
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is play so that people will invite you to play.</v>

1639
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.751
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1640
01:13:55.751 --> 01:13:56.620
<v Speaker 2>And there's a rule for,</v>

1641
01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.450
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1642
01:13:57.450 --> 01:13:58.283
<v Speaker 2>for children,</v>

1643
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:59.470
<v Speaker 2>for raising children,</v>

1644
01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:00.281
<v Speaker 2>and it really,</v>

1645
01:14:00.281 --> 01:14:01.114
<v Speaker 2>it's a rule.</v>

1646
01:14:01.330 --> 01:14:03.190
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you can do with your children.</v>

1647
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:06.910
<v Speaker 2>This is something good for men because men are more likely to do this than</v>

1648
01:14:06.911 --> 01:14:07.270
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

1649
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Although women can do it too,</v>

1650
01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:10.030
<v Speaker 2>but men are more likely to do it.</v>

1651
01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.810
<v Speaker 2>It's good for children to engage in rough and tumble play,</v>

1652
01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:15.243
<v Speaker 2>play fighting.</v>

1653
01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:16.331
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1654
01:14:16.331 --> 01:14:19.780
<v Speaker 2>if you have children and you've played with them physically,</v>

1655
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.940
<v Speaker 2>you know that they absolutely love it.</v>

1656
01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:27.360
<v Speaker 2>They will rough and tumble play with you until you are completely exhausted and</v>

1657
01:14:29.141 --> 01:14:32.440
<v Speaker 2>they're not even vaguely ready to quit.</v>

1658
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.220
<v Speaker 2>They have an inexhaustible hunger for it and they like it.</v>

1659
01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:38.470
<v Speaker 2>They like to be pushed to the edge.</v>

1660
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:42.220
<v Speaker 2>So I knew this when I was a new father,</v>

1661
01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.340
<v Speaker 2>partly because I read work by a man named Jaak Panksepp,</v>

1662
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:46.630
<v Speaker 2>who was a genius,</v>

1663
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:48.410
<v Speaker 2>an effect of neuroscientists,</v>

1664
01:14:48.411 --> 01:14:50.080
<v Speaker 2>one of the world's great neuroscientists,</v>

1665
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:52.390
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the world's greatest neuroscientists,</v>

1666
01:14:52.391 --> 01:14:54.580
<v Speaker 2>although there's four or five people that might compete with him.</v>

1667
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:57.550
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a book called affective neuroscience,</v>

1668
01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.630
<v Speaker 2>emotional neural science,</v>

1669
01:14:58.631 --> 01:15:00.190
<v Speaker 2>which is a work of real genius.</v>

1670
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.920
<v Speaker 2>He discovered the play circuit in mammals because there's a separate place</v>

1671
01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:04.691
<v Speaker 2>circuit in mammals,</v>

1672
01:15:04.691 --> 01:15:05.800
<v Speaker 2>a specialized circuit,</v>

1673
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:10.570
<v Speaker 2>and he did a lot of work on rats and showing that in order for a rat to become</v>

1674
01:15:10.571 --> 01:15:12.730
<v Speaker 2>socialized because rats are highly social,</v>

1675
01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:16.690
<v Speaker 2>they had to engage in iterative bouts of rough and tumble play.</v>

1676
01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.400
<v Speaker 2>And here's a cool thing.</v>

1677
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a ridiculously cool thing.</v>

1678
01:15:20.051 --> 01:15:20.884
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1679
01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:25.330
<v Speaker 2>and this has to do in some sense with the postmodern critique of the patriarchal</v>

1680
01:15:25.331 --> 01:15:26.164
<v Speaker 2>tyranny.</v>

1681
01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:29.560
<v Speaker 2>So if you take two juvenile rats,</v>

1682
01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:30.963
<v Speaker 2>males,</v>

1683
01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:32.763
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1684
01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:36.910
<v Speaker 2>you imagine you give them an opportunity to play.</v>

1685
01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:40.270
<v Speaker 2>So you throw two of them into a little player in and you let them wrestle,</v>

1686
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:41.763
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

1687
01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.710
<v Speaker 2>The next time that you bring them to the same place,</v>

1688
01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:48.670
<v Speaker 2>you can measure how much work they'll do to open the door to the arena,</v>

1689
01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.220
<v Speaker 2>how many times they'll push a button,</v>

1690
01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:53.530
<v Speaker 2>say to open the door or how hard,</v>

1691
01:15:53.531 --> 01:15:57.970
<v Speaker 2>how hard they'll pull if you tie a string spring to their tail and so you can</v>

1692
01:15:57.971 --> 01:16:01.580
<v Speaker 2>get an estimate of their motivation because the more motivated they are to play</v>

1693
01:16:01.581 --> 01:16:01.641
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

1694
01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:06.641
<v Speaker 2>the harder they'll work and rats will work really hard to play so you know that</v>

1695
01:16:06.941 --> 01:16:07.960
<v Speaker 2>they want to play.</v>

1696
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean assuming that you're willing to accept the fact that if you work for</v>

1697
01:16:11.531 --> 01:16:11.921
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1698
01:16:11.921 --> 01:16:12.600
<v Speaker 2>you want it.</v>

1699
01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like an operational definition,</v>

1700
01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:16.090
<v Speaker 2>so rats will work to play.</v>

1701
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Now if you let the rats out in the play arena and one rat is 10 percent bigger</v>

1702
01:16:22.781 --> 01:16:23.614
<v Speaker 2>than the other,</v>

1703
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.060
<v Speaker 2>then that rat will win.</v>

1704
01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:26.171
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

1705
01:16:26.171 --> 01:16:26.321
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1706
01:16:26.321 --> 01:16:27.280
<v Speaker 2>what does winning mean?</v>

1707
01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Rats wrestle like people wrestle.</v>

1708
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:34.090
<v Speaker 2>They even pin each other and they manifest play behavior to begin with,</v>

1709
01:16:34.091 --> 01:16:35.350
<v Speaker 2>like dogs playing in a park.</v>

1710
01:16:35.351 --> 01:16:37.060
<v Speaker 2>You know how a dog looks when it wants to play.</v>

1711
01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Sort of hunkers down a little bit.</v>

1712
01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:43.720
<v Speaker 2>It looks up at you like expectancy expectedly kind of moved back and forth,</v>

1713
01:16:43.721 --> 01:16:44.500
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

1714
01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.333
<v Speaker 2>okay human,</v>

1715
01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to play and if you have any sense and you know how to play,</v>

1716
01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.360
<v Speaker 2>then you look at the dog and you sort of go like this and the dog goes like this</v>

1717
01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:57.570
<v Speaker 2>and you cuff the dog not too hard and the dog bites you not too hard and then</v>

1718
01:16:57.611 --> 01:16:59.710
<v Speaker 2>you can play and you're both happy with that.</v>

1719
01:16:59.711 --> 01:17:04.630
<v Speaker 2>And kids can do that with dogs because kids understand dogs and dogs and kids</v>

1720
01:17:04.631 --> 01:17:05.291
<v Speaker 2>knew how to play.</v>

1721
01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:07.000
<v Speaker 2>If if your dog can play,</v>

1722
01:17:07.001 --> 01:17:08.920
<v Speaker 2>then you should not own a dog.</v>

1723
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.640
<v Speaker 2>You're not smart enough to own a dog.</v>

1724
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:12.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's true.</v>

1725
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:15.320
<v Speaker 2>And if you have a dog that can't play,</v>

1726
01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.730
<v Speaker 2>then don't have a kid.</v>

1727
01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.313
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1728
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:24.433
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

1729
01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Stupidest dog I ever saw was owned by a psychologist that was really</v>

1730
01:17:30.981 --> 01:17:31.814
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing.</v>

1731
01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:35.090
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

1732
01:17:35.091 --> 01:17:39.500
<v Speaker 2>so you put the rat to rats together and there's the 10 percent bigger route and</v>

1733
01:17:39.501 --> 01:17:43.580
<v Speaker 2>there's the 10 percent smaller rat and the 10 percent bigger rat stomps the</v>

1734
01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:44.840
<v Speaker 2>small rat and pins him.</v>

1735
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.340
<v Speaker 2>So he went.</v>

1736
01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:52.420
<v Speaker 2>And so now you're a postmodernist doing the experiment and you say powerful,</v>

1737
01:17:52.761 --> 01:17:55.160
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical rat dominates hierarchy.</v>

1738
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1739
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.901
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1740
01:17:56.901 --> 01:18:00.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what you conclude and to experiment and you're.</v>

1741
01:18:00.330 --> 01:18:02.780
<v Speaker 2>And it looks correct because powerful,</v>

1742
01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:06.020
<v Speaker 2>dominant rat dominated and one,</v>

1743
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.920
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1744
01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:07.753
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1745
01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:09.481
<v Speaker 2>cep,</v>

1746
01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:10.314
<v Speaker 2>for one thing,</v>

1747
01:18:11.490 --> 01:18:13.050
<v Speaker 2>rats live with rats.</v>

1748
01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:18.240
<v Speaker 2>No wonder they're not psychopathic individuals wandering from isolated community</v>

1749
01:18:18.241 --> 01:18:19.200
<v Speaker 2>die slated community.</v>

1750
01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.180
<v Speaker 2>They know all the other rats and that means they have to keep playing with them.</v>

1751
01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:30.170
<v Speaker 2>And the rules for playing with someone 30 times are not the same as the rules</v>

1752
01:18:30.181 --> 01:18:32.430
<v Speaker 2>for playing with someone once.</v>

1753
01:18:33.090 --> 01:18:38.040
<v Speaker 2>So Pang sap had the rats play repeatedly and what he observed was,</v>

1754
01:18:38.041 --> 01:18:38.311
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1755
01:18:38.311 --> 01:18:40.470
<v Speaker 2>now the next time you put those rats together,</v>

1756
01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.330
<v Speaker 2>the situation's a little different.</v>

1757
01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.190
<v Speaker 2>The little rat comes bouncing out and does the playful dog thing too.</v>

1758
01:18:47.191 --> 01:18:48.024
<v Speaker 2>The big rat.</v>

1759
01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.760
<v Speaker 2>So now the rule is you're the little rat you lost.</v>

1760
01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:53.760
<v Speaker 2>You have to be the creature that invites to play.</v>

1761
01:18:53.970 --> 01:18:55.080
<v Speaker 2>That's now your status.</v>

1762
01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:57.750
<v Speaker 2>So you bounced around and you know the big rats all cool.</v>

1763
01:18:57.751 --> 01:18:59.370
<v Speaker 2>And he's smoking a cigarette and doesn't want to,</v>

1764
01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:00.660
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to play,</v>

1765
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:03.120
<v Speaker 2>but they'll flick it away at some point and think,</v>

1766
01:19:03.121 --> 01:19:03.541
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1767
01:19:03.541 --> 01:19:04.530
<v Speaker 2>what the hell you know?</v>

1768
01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:08.520
<v Speaker 2>And so then he gets in it and so neat can stomp the little route again because</v>

1769
01:19:08.521 --> 01:19:09.420
<v Speaker 2>he's a bigger rat.</v>

1770
01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.460
<v Speaker 2>If the big Grad doesn't let the little rat win 30 percent of the time across</v>

1771
01:19:14.461 --> 01:19:15.480
<v Speaker 2>repeated play boats,</v>

1772
01:19:15.481 --> 01:19:17.430
<v Speaker 2>then the little rat won't ask him to play anymore.</v>

1773
01:19:19.170 --> 01:19:20.003
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>

1774
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:20.991
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1775
01:19:20.991 --> 01:19:23.300
<v Speaker 2>if you think about you don't think so what?</v>

1776
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.871
<v Speaker 2>You don't think.</v>

1777
01:19:23.871 --> 01:19:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Why did Jaak Panksepp waste his time studying play in rats?</v>

1778
01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:27.021
<v Speaker 2>You Think,</v>

1779
01:19:27.021 --> 01:19:27.711
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1780
01:19:27.711 --> 01:19:29.150
<v Speaker 2>that's an absolute miracle.</v>

1781
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Because it shows you that there's an ethic of fairplay that emerges as a</v>

1782
01:19:33.411 --> 01:19:35.480
<v Speaker 2>consequence of repeated bouts of play.</v>

1783
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Even among rats.</v>

1784
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.230
<v Speaker 2>It's so basic.</v>

1785
01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:40.430
<v Speaker 2>It isn't even human.</v>

1786
01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:41.503
<v Speaker 2>That ethic,</v>

1787
01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Speaker 2>they ethic of fairplay is deeper than human.</v>

1788
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:45.770
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>

1789
01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:49.670
<v Speaker 2>And it's the ethic that governs iterated interactions.</v>

1790
01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:52.280
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just in rats that we've seen this.</v>

1791
01:19:52.281 --> 01:19:53.080
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1792
01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.920
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees are pretty damn brutal.</v>

1793
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:56.690
<v Speaker 2>They're way more brutal than you think.</v>

1794
01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:57.591
<v Speaker 2>And they're really,</v>

1795
01:19:57.591 --> 01:19:58.424
<v Speaker 2>really strong.</v>

1796
01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Maybe six times as strong as an adult male.</v>

1797
01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Now there's the estimates vary,</v>

1798
01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:07.200
<v Speaker 2>but there are plenty strong enough to tear you to bits and that happens now and</v>

1799
01:20:07.201 --> 01:20:12.090
<v Speaker 2>then people have chimps for pets and they become adults and it's like don't mess</v>

1800
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:17.091
<v Speaker 2>with the chimp because it'll tear you to pieces and so and chimps are brutal and</v>

1801
01:20:17.851 --> 01:20:22.350
<v Speaker 2>this is interesting because they're our closest relatives and so Jane Goodall</v>

1802
01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:26.580
<v Speaker 2>discovered in the 19 seventies that rats or tribe or chimps are tribal.</v>

1803
01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:31.560
<v Speaker 2>They live in tribal groups like we do and they have a territory that's the known</v>

1804
01:20:31.561 --> 01:20:34.290
<v Speaker 2>territory and there's a perimeter that's the unknown.</v>

1805
01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:37.680
<v Speaker 2>That's chaos and other chimpanzees inhabit the chaos.</v>

1806
01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Foreign Chimpanzees and the juvenile chimps patrol the perimeters in groups of</v>

1807
01:20:43.501 --> 01:20:44.334
<v Speaker 2>four or five,</v>

1808
01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:45.690
<v Speaker 2>and if they spy us,</v>

1809
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:48.180
<v Speaker 2>a foreign chimp or two of them,</v>

1810
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.310
<v Speaker 2>if they outnumber them because they can't count,</v>

1811
01:20:50.311 --> 01:20:52.110
<v Speaker 2>but they have a sense of quantity.</v>

1812
01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:55.140
<v Speaker 2>If five chimps come across to foreign chimps,</v>

1813
01:20:55.141 --> 01:20:59.190
<v Speaker 2>they will tear them to bits and I actually mean that literally.</v>

1814
01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:02.430
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do and chimps also hunt.</v>

1815
01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:06.240
<v Speaker 2>They hunt colobus monkeys and they weigh about 40 pounds and they're quite</v>

1816
01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:08.400
<v Speaker 2>carnivorous and they will eat them alive.</v>

1817
01:21:08.401 --> 01:21:08.631
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1818
01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:09.464
<v Speaker 2>they're screaming,</v>

1819
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:14.700
<v Speaker 2>so there isn't a lot of empathy regulating chimp aggression,</v>

1820
01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:18.270
<v Speaker 2>which is something to think about when you think about human beings because it's</v>

1821
01:21:18.271 --> 01:21:21.120
<v Speaker 2>not obvious what regulates our aggression and you might think,</v>

1822
01:21:21.121 --> 01:21:21.301
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1823
01:21:21.301 --> 01:21:23.100
<v Speaker 2>it's your conscience and like,</v>

1824
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:23.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1825
01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:26.970
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's your conscience and maybe it's something else.</v>

1826
01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:27.871
<v Speaker 2>You read the book,</v>

1827
01:21:27.871 --> 01:21:30.690
<v Speaker 2>have you read the rape of Nanking for example,</v>

1828
01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.190
<v Speaker 2>and you'll start wondering very,</v>

1829
01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:35.010
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly about whether people have any conscience at all.</v>

1830
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:40.310
<v Speaker 2>So that's a story of absolutely atrocious Japanese behavior in China at,</v>

1831
01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:44.160
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of World War II and it's a horrifying book.</v>

1832
01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:45.630
<v Speaker 2>So read it with caution,</v>

1833
01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's very instructive.</v>

1834
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.500
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1835
01:21:49.501 --> 01:21:50.334
<v Speaker 2>the chimps,</v>

1836
01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:53.790
<v Speaker 2>the chimps are very brutal creatures and so you might think,</v>

1837
01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:54.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1838
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.810
<v Speaker 2>let's look at a chimp hierarchy because chimps have dominance hierarchies in</v>

1839
01:21:57.811 --> 01:21:57.931
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1840
01:21:57.931 --> 01:21:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Basically male dominated,</v>

1841
01:21:59.371 --> 01:22:02.760
<v Speaker 2>although there are lots of powerful female chimps say,</v>

1842
01:22:02.761 --> 01:22:03.031
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1843
01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:05.010
<v Speaker 2>who becomes the dominant chimp?</v>

1844
01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:06.990
<v Speaker 2>And the answer might be,</v>

1845
01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:08.700
<v Speaker 2>and this would be the postmodern answer,</v>

1846
01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:14.060
<v Speaker 2>the most powerful tyrannical brutal chimp rules because it's power that moves</v>

1847
01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:16.500
<v Speaker 2>you up the hierarchy.</v>

1848
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:19.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like that happened sometimes among chimps,</v>

1849
01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.110
<v Speaker 2>but you know what happens to tyron chimps,</v>

1850
01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:28.010
<v Speaker 2>they have an off day and to subordinate chimps each three quarters,</v>

1851
01:22:29.041 --> 01:22:34.041
<v Speaker 2>the size gang up to make a one and a half super chimp and then they tear him to</v>

1852
01:22:34.441 --> 01:22:35.274
<v Speaker 2>pieces.</v>

1853
01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:36.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1854
01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.190
<v Speaker 2>So here's the rule.</v>

1855
01:22:38.191 --> 01:22:41.760
<v Speaker 2>If you're a chimp tyrants meet bloody ends.</v>

1856
01:22:42.690 --> 01:22:47.690
<v Speaker 2>So how do you conduct yourself as a chimp if you want to be at the top of the</v>

1857
01:22:47.941 --> 01:22:52.110
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy and have preferential access to the things that being at the top of</v>

1858
01:22:52.111 --> 01:22:57.111
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy would give you and answer is engage in mutually reciprocal</v>

1859
01:22:57.631 --> 01:22:59.670
<v Speaker 2>interactions with your peers.</v>

1860
01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.890
<v Speaker 2>The chimps that rise to the top,</v>

1861
01:23:01.891 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>that stay there stable and also have the most stable functioning by the way,</v>

1862
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:10.570
<v Speaker 2>are the ones that have friends that are long term and permanent and engage in</v>

1863
01:23:10.571 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 2>reciprocal interactions not only with their friends,</v>

1864
01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.950
<v Speaker 2>but also with the females and the infants.</v>

1865
01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.960
<v Speaker 2>And so even among chimps,</v>

1866
01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:19.720
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal tyranny,</v>

1867
01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:24.760
<v Speaker 2>a is not the norm and B is not the proper motive approaching the situation,</v>

1868
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:28.060
<v Speaker 2>and so that speaks to a broader ethic.</v>

1869
01:23:28.061 --> 01:23:31.750
<v Speaker 2>The same kind of ethic that is spoken to with regards to the rat studies have</v>

1870
01:23:31.751 --> 01:23:35.680
<v Speaker 2>play behavior and you can see this sort of thing throughout the animal kingdom.</v>

1871
01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:36.640
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

1872
01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:40.750
<v Speaker 2>There's a pattern of reciprocal interaction that seems to stabilize social</v>

1873
01:23:40.751 --> 01:23:43.360
<v Speaker 2>animals that isn't predicated on brute force.</v>

1874
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe the simpler the animal,</v>

1875
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:48.460
<v Speaker 2>the more it's predicated on brute force,</v>

1876
01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:53.170
<v Speaker 2>but we are by no means simple animals and the idea that our hierarchies are</v>

1877
01:23:53.171 --> 01:23:54.790
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally tyrannical.</v>

1878
01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:56.380
<v Speaker 2>The patriarchy,</v>

1879
01:23:56.710 --> 01:24:01.710
<v Speaker 2>which is a word that nobody who thinks carefully should ever use casually.</v>

1880
01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:05.620
<v Speaker 2>That term is predicated on the idea that a,</v>

1881
01:24:05.621 --> 01:24:07.600
<v Speaker 2>that are hierarchies are tyrannical,</v>

1882
01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:08.740
<v Speaker 2>which they aren't.</v>

1883
01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:13.150
<v Speaker 2>Although they can become that way and be that the most reliable means to</v>

1884
01:24:13.151 --> 01:24:17.980
<v Speaker 2>attaining status within a hierarchy is through the expression of power and both</v>

1885
01:24:17.981 --> 01:24:19.930
<v Speaker 2>of those things are wrong.</v>

1886
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:22.120
<v Speaker 2>They're wrong.</v>

1887
01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:22.931
<v Speaker 2>And nonetheless,</v>

1888
01:24:22.931 --> 01:24:26.440
<v Speaker 2>that's the primary theory of the social sciences and the humanities,</v>

1889
01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:27.910
<v Speaker 2>and enough of that,</v>

1890
01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:28.500
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

1891
01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:33.500
<v Speaker 2>we have enough data to indicate that none of that's sufficiently sophisticated</v>

1892
01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.390
<v Speaker 2>to constitute a reasonable explanation of the world.</v>

1893
01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.780
<v Speaker 2>So we should dispense with it as fast as possible.</v>

1894
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.520
<v Speaker 2>All it's doing is dividing us into tribes and it's not solving the problems that</v>

1895
01:24:45.521 --> 01:24:47.620
<v Speaker 2>it's hypothetically intended to solve.</v>

1896
01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:49.203
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1897
01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:56.521
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1898
01:24:56.521 --> 01:25:00.690
<v Speaker 2>so now back to the question.</v>

1899
01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:01.553
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1900
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:06.000
<v Speaker 2>there isn't that hierarchy.</v>

1901
01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:10.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a set of hierarchies and it's like the set of games.</v>

1902
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:15.240
<v Speaker 2>So here's what you're telling your child when you say it doesn't matter whether</v>

1903
01:25:15.241 --> 01:25:16.074
<v Speaker 2>you win or lose,</v>

1904
01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:17.610
<v Speaker 2>it matters how you play the game.</v>

1905
01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:20.700
<v Speaker 2>What you're telling them is life is not a game.</v>

1906
01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.570
<v Speaker 2>It's not even a sequence of the same games.</v>

1907
01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.300
<v Speaker 2>It's multiple sequences of different games.</v>

1908
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:33.030
<v Speaker 2>And if you want to be a successful player in the set of multiple sequence of</v>

1909
01:25:33.031 --> 01:25:34.020
<v Speaker 2>different games,</v>

1910
01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.660
<v Speaker 2>then you have to adopt a higher order ethic.</v>

1911
01:25:37.410 --> 01:25:41.580
<v Speaker 2>And you don't subordinate that ethic to victory in any one game ever.</v>

1912
01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:46.940
<v Speaker 2>So you put the manner in which you play above your victory in,</v>

1913
01:25:47.190 --> 01:25:48.360
<v Speaker 2>in each instance.</v>

1914
01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:53.280
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that that produces the best possible outcome for you is that you</v>

1915
01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:55.710
<v Speaker 2>get invited to play the largest number of games.</v>

1916
01:25:56.670 --> 01:25:58.410
<v Speaker 2>And so let's go back to rule five.</v>

1917
01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.</v>

1918
01:26:01.650 --> 01:26:01.921
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1919
01:26:01.921 --> 01:26:03.060
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you like your.</v>

1920
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you love your children and you want the best for them.</v>

1921
01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.260
<v Speaker 2>You detach yourself and a little bit and you think,</v>

1922
01:26:09.261 --> 01:26:10.094
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1923
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be around forever.</v>

1924
01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:16.130
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to deal with a lot of different people,</v>

1925
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.440
<v Speaker 2>single people,</v>

1926
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:19.790
<v Speaker 2>like individuals,</v>

1927
01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:21.170
<v Speaker 2>groups of people,</v>

1928
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:23.690
<v Speaker 2>children and adults.</v>

1929
01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:29.140
<v Speaker 2>And what they have to be prepared for is to interact with that set of people in</v>

1930
01:26:29.301 --> 01:26:30.500
<v Speaker 2>the best possible manner.</v>

1931
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Because.</v>

1932
01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:32.750
<v Speaker 2>And so what do you want?</v>

1933
01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:32.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1934
01:26:32.961 --> 01:26:34.850
<v Speaker 2>let's say your child's two,</v>

1935
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:38.600
<v Speaker 2>and it's still pretty egocentric because children two year olds are quite</v>

1936
01:26:38.601 --> 01:26:39.434
<v Speaker 2>egocentric.</v>

1937
01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.970
<v Speaker 2>They can't share yet.</v>

1938
01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:45.140
<v Speaker 2>They don't really learn how to share in any technical sense till were about</v>

1939
01:26:45.141 --> 01:26:45.974
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>

1940
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:47.570
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for them to learn to share</v>

1941
01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.410
<v Speaker 2>between two and four.</v>

1942
01:26:51.411 --> 01:26:53.330
<v Speaker 2>They learn to share and to play.</v>

1943
01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:56.090
<v Speaker 2>And the way they learn is by at least in part,</v>

1944
01:26:56.091 --> 01:26:58.610
<v Speaker 2>by engaging in reciprocal interactions with their parents.</v>

1945
01:26:58.970 --> 01:26:59.121
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1946
01:26:59.121 --> 01:27:00.230
<v Speaker 2>what is it that it.</v>

1947
01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.040
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1948
01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:04.880
<v Speaker 2>That's your job when you're socializing a child who's two to four,</v>

1949
01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:08.240
<v Speaker 2>you have to do it between the ages of two and four by the way,</v>

1950
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:11.150
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't manage it by the time they're four,</v>

1951
01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.390
<v Speaker 2>then you might as well give up because it isn't going to happen.</v>

1952
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 2>And the literature on antisocial behavior in children is crystal clear on this</v>

1953
01:27:18.591 --> 01:27:19.424
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1954
01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:23.570
<v Speaker 2>If your child's antisocial at for you failed.</v>

1955
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:26.060
<v Speaker 2>And there isn't anything that can be done about it.</v>

1956
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:27.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a dismal literature.</v>

1957
01:27:27.771 --> 01:27:28.604
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>

1958
01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:33.710
<v Speaker 2>psychologists and sociologists and anthropologists and criminologists have tried</v>

1959
01:27:33.711 --> 01:27:38.711
<v Speaker 2>for like six decades to figure out how to remediate antisocial behavior in older</v>

1960
01:27:39.201 --> 01:27:42.470
<v Speaker 2>children and adolescents and they haven't managed it.</v>

1961
01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:44.173
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1962
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:47.000
<v Speaker 2>So two between two and four is crucial.</v>

1963
01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:52.650
<v Speaker 2>You want to help your child become the sort of person that other children want</v>

1964
01:27:52.651 --> 01:27:53.484
<v Speaker 2>to play with.</v>

1965
01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:57.960
<v Speaker 2>And the reason you want to do that is because from four onward,</v>

1966
01:27:57.990 --> 01:28:00.750
<v Speaker 2>other children are the primary agents of socialization.</v>

1967
01:28:01.410 --> 01:28:04.140
<v Speaker 2>And so if your children are accepted by other children,</v>

1968
01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:07.410
<v Speaker 2>then they're on their way because other children will socialize them.</v>

1969
01:28:07.411 --> 01:28:09.180
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you're not important as a parent,</v>

1970
01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:13.980
<v Speaker 2>but it means they find their peers who are at the same developmental level as</v>

1971
01:28:13.981 --> 01:28:18.270
<v Speaker 2>them and they start to reciprocally socialize one another and they do that</v>

1972
01:28:18.271 --> 01:28:19.104
<v Speaker 2>through play.</v>

1973
01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:23.550
<v Speaker 2>And so if you've prepared your child to be a great play companion,</v>

1974
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:26.520
<v Speaker 2>then you can just stand back and let it happen.</v>

1975
01:28:26.521 --> 01:28:28.770
<v Speaker 2>And you have to be around when something breaks down.</v>

1976
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:30.480
<v Speaker 2>When the system doesn't work properly,</v>

1977
01:28:30.481 --> 01:28:31.890
<v Speaker 2>you have to be there as a resource.</v>

1978
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:35.640
<v Speaker 2>But basically you can sort of push them out onto the playground and say,</v>

1979
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:36.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1980
01:28:36.301 --> 01:28:37.134
<v Speaker 2>you know what to do.</v>

1981
01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Go play and play is of absolutely crucial importance as documented by people</v>

1982
01:28:43.561 --> 01:28:44.670
<v Speaker 2>like John Piaget.</v>

1983
01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:50.240
<v Speaker 2>So you're trying to make your child maximally attractive as a play partner.</v>

1984
01:28:50.551 --> 01:28:55.140
<v Speaker 2>And the ethic there is while the world is made out of a sequence of hierarchies</v>

1985
01:28:55.141 --> 01:28:56.460
<v Speaker 2>that transform.</v>

1986
01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.260
<v Speaker 2>And so you want your child to be the sort of person who's invited.</v>

1987
01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Participate in what ever hierarchy organizes itself and how and what should a</v>

1988
01:29:07.711 --> 01:29:11.130
<v Speaker 2>child be like to do that while they have to be.</v>

1989
01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Be Reciprocal.</v>

1990
01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.790
<v Speaker 2>Take turns right.</v>

1991
01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.800
<v Speaker 2>You don't always get to pick the game.</v>

1992
01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.290
<v Speaker 2>You have to find out what other people want to do.</v>

1993
01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:21.300
<v Speaker 2>They have to want to play too.</v>

1994
01:29:21.450 --> 01:29:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Like there's all these sophisticated ethical rules that go around play and you</v>

1995
01:29:26.581 --> 01:29:29.580
<v Speaker 2>know if you're playing with some of you have played with kids that aren't fun to</v>

1996
01:29:29.581 --> 01:29:30.414
<v Speaker 2>play with,</v>

1997
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:31.560
<v Speaker 2>well what do they like?</v>

1998
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.510
<v Speaker 2>If something doesn't go their way,</v>

1999
01:29:33.511 --> 01:29:34.350
<v Speaker 2>what happens?</v>

2000
01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:39.360
<v Speaker 2>They have an emotional outburst so they revert to the behavior of a ill prepared</v>

2001
01:29:39.361 --> 01:29:40.194
<v Speaker 2>two year old.</v>

2002
01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.670
<v Speaker 2>They have a temper tantrum.</v>

2003
01:29:41.671 --> 01:29:42.780
<v Speaker 2>They burst into tears.</v>

2004
01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.970
<v Speaker 2>They thrashed around on the floor.</v>

2005
01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:48.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not fun because when you play,</v>

2006
01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:51.510
<v Speaker 2>if you don't lose some times that no one else ever wins,</v>

2007
01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:53.910
<v Speaker 2>so who the hell is going to play with someone like that?</v>

2008
01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:57.120
<v Speaker 2>A downtrodden victim,</v>

2009
01:29:57.121 --> 01:29:57.960
<v Speaker 2>that's all.</v>

2010
01:29:58.050 --> 01:29:58.883
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

2011
01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.380
<v Speaker 2>No kid with any sense is going to put up with that.</v>

2012
01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:01.830
<v Speaker 2>All they do,</v>

2013
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:03.390
<v Speaker 2>and this is exactly what kids are like,</v>

2014
01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:09.200
<v Speaker 2>if they find out that their potential play partner is a whiny two year old,</v>

2015
01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.930
<v Speaker 2>even though therefore they just start playing and they go find another kid,</v>

2016
01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.700
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what happens,</v>

2017
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:16.770
<v Speaker 2>and so if you want that for your kid,</v>

2018
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.590
<v Speaker 2>then make sure that they're whiny and bitter every time they lose.</v>

2019
01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:24.000
<v Speaker 2>A good way to do that is to never let them lose at anything so they don't get</v>

2020
01:30:24.001 --> 01:30:24.870
<v Speaker 2>any practice.</v>

2021
01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:25.111
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2022
01:30:25.111 --> 01:30:26.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't want my kid to lose.</v>

2023
01:30:26.371 --> 01:30:28.200
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong.</v>

2024
01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:29.573
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to.</v>

2025
01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:33.510
<v Speaker 2>You don't want your kid to lose in an unsophisticated manner.</v>

2026
01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:35.310
<v Speaker 2>That's not the same thing at all.</v>

2027
01:30:35.311 --> 01:30:38.940
<v Speaker 2>And if you think the way you accomplish that is by never having your kid lose,</v>

2028
01:30:38.941 --> 01:30:40.260
<v Speaker 2>then well then,</v>

2029
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:43.000
<v Speaker 2>well then we're back to the.</v>

2030
01:30:43.001 --> 01:30:44.860
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't even own a dog problem.</v>

2031
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:53.083
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2032
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:54.800
<v Speaker 2>so then you might take apart.</v>

2033
01:30:55.730 --> 01:30:58.160
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean to be a desirable play partner?</v>

2034
01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Assuming you're gonna play reciprocal,</v>

2035
01:31:00.201 --> 01:31:02.960
<v Speaker 2>repeated games across all sorts of different contexts.</v>

2036
01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:04.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2037
01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:04.480
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2038
01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole aspect that emerges from that.</v>

2039
01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:09.650
<v Speaker 2>See Nature back in the late 18 hundreds.</v>

2040
01:31:09.651 --> 01:31:13.070
<v Speaker 2>He was the first person to kind of caught onto this sort of thing because until</v>

2041
01:31:13.071 --> 01:31:13.790
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

2042
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:18.620
<v Speaker 2>people tended to think of morality as something that was invented rationally and</v>

2043
01:31:18.621 --> 01:31:20.660
<v Speaker 2>then imposed from the top down,</v>

2044
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:25.430
<v Speaker 2>but nature being a very intelligent observer noted that well,</v>

2045
01:31:25.431 --> 01:31:26.660
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't really the case.</v>

2046
01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:31.810
<v Speaker 2>There was a ethic already built into human interactions that we all acted out,</v>

2047
01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.510
<v Speaker 2>but that we didn't really understand very well.</v>

2048
01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:37.220
<v Speaker 2>So here's a way to think about that.</v>

2049
01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:43.090
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you're watching a wolf pack and wolves compete for dominance.</v>

2050
01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:47.900
<v Speaker 2>And so the way they do that is they basically have a play fight about it.</v>

2051
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Now it's this fairly serious play fight.</v>

2052
01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:54.050
<v Speaker 2>And so two wolves that are engaged in a dominance dispute will sort of sand</v>

2053
01:31:54.051 --> 01:31:55.400
<v Speaker 2>sideways to each other.</v>

2054
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:57.020
<v Speaker 2>You know how cats do that?</v>

2055
01:31:57.021 --> 01:32:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever watched two caps fight cats stand sideways,</v>

2056
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:01.151
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

2057
01:32:01.151 --> 01:32:01.241
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2058
01:32:01.241 --> 01:32:03.250
<v Speaker 2>why does it cat stand sideways when it's fighting?</v>

2059
01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:07.810
<v Speaker 2>It's because a sideways cat is a bigger cat than a hand on cat.</v>

2060
01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:11.890
<v Speaker 2>So the cat's trying to intimidate the other cat so it stand sideways and it</v>

2061
01:32:11.891 --> 01:32:13.930
<v Speaker 2>puffs itself up including its tail.</v>

2062
01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:18.140
<v Speaker 2>And the reason it does that is so that it looks bigger because one cat isn't.</v>

2063
01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Cats don't want to fight,</v>

2064
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 2>they want to threaten until one cat backs down.</v>

2065
01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:27.730
<v Speaker 2>And so they puff themselves up and they make horrible noises and they face off</v>

2066
01:32:27.731 --> 01:32:28.564
<v Speaker 2>against each other,</v>

2067
01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:32.290
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want to fight because the two cats that are fighting my damage</v>

2068
01:32:32.291 --> 01:32:32.621
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>

2069
01:32:32.621 --> 01:32:34.630
<v Speaker 2>then a third cat comes in and like wins.</v>

2070
01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a stupid strategy.</v>

2071
01:32:36.490 --> 01:32:37.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

2072
01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:37.731
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2073
01:32:37.731 --> 01:32:38.230
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>

2074
01:32:38.230 --> 01:32:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Most animals don't like to fight because they might damage to themselves.</v>

2075
01:32:41.351 --> 01:32:42.730
<v Speaker 2>And then another interloper.</v>

2076
01:32:42.731 --> 01:32:43.211
<v Speaker 2>We'll just,</v>

2077
01:32:43.211 --> 01:32:46.840
<v Speaker 2>when it's a stupid strategy and human beings are quite a bit like that.</v>

2078
01:32:46.841 --> 01:32:49.570
<v Speaker 2>We do a lot of posturing and defensive display,</v>

2079
01:32:49.571 --> 01:32:50.860
<v Speaker 2>an aggressive display and all that.</v>

2080
01:32:50.861 --> 01:32:52.420
<v Speaker 2>But we don't fight very often for the,</v>

2081
01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:53.440
<v Speaker 2>for the same reasons.</v>

2082
01:32:53.441 --> 01:32:56.770
<v Speaker 2>And it's only when those other mechanisms breakdown that we actually fight.</v>

2083
01:32:58.180 --> 01:32:59.013
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2084
01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:06.900
<v Speaker 2>what happens in a wolf dispute is this,</v>

2085
01:33:07.050 --> 01:33:12.050
<v Speaker 2>the wolves square off and they amp up the threats in the hope that one of the</v>

2086
01:33:14.101 --> 01:33:15.540
<v Speaker 2>wolves will back the hell down.</v>

2087
01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Because what'll happen is the wolf will chicken out one of them.</v>

2088
01:33:19.130 --> 01:33:20.070
<v Speaker 2>And then when it does,</v>

2089
01:33:20.071 --> 01:33:22.800
<v Speaker 2>it rolls over and shows its neck.</v>

2090
01:33:23.490 --> 01:33:24.323
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2091
01:33:24.690 --> 01:33:24.871
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2092
01:33:24.871 --> 01:33:26.250
<v Speaker 2>because when wolves hunt,</v>

2093
01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:28.260
<v Speaker 2>they go for the neck generally,</v>

2094
01:33:28.261 --> 01:33:30.720
<v Speaker 2>like wolves are quite cruel creatures in some sense.</v>

2095
01:33:30.721 --> 01:33:33.780
<v Speaker 2>And they'll actually eat moose standing up.</v>

2096
01:33:34.050 --> 01:33:35.640
<v Speaker 2>But generally speaking,</v>

2097
01:33:35.641 --> 01:33:36.510
<v Speaker 2>if they can manage it,</v>

2098
01:33:36.511 --> 01:33:39.150
<v Speaker 2>they go for the throat and they'll bring the animal down.</v>

2099
01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:42.750
<v Speaker 2>And so what the wolf is basically saying is,</v>

2100
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:45.390
<v Speaker 2>well you scared me half to death.</v>

2101
01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:46.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm a useful move.</v>

2102
01:33:46.890 --> 01:33:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm a useless moose.</v>

2103
01:33:48.570 --> 01:33:50.220
<v Speaker 2>You might as well tear up my neck.</v>

2104
01:33:50.730 --> 01:33:52.140
<v Speaker 2>And other wolf says,</v>

2105
01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:52.951
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2106
01:33:52.951 --> 01:33:55.800
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty detestable and you're kind of like a moose,</v>

2107
01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:00.720
<v Speaker 2>but I might need you to hunt tomorrow so I know I can tear out your neck,</v>

2108
01:34:00.721 --> 01:34:01.554
<v Speaker 2>but I won't.</v>

2109
01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:06.300
<v Speaker 2>And then the defeated Wolf stands up and he's not very happy and he's kind of a</v>

2110
01:34:06.301 --> 01:34:07.230
<v Speaker 2>low status wolf,</v>

2111
01:34:07.231 --> 01:34:09.270
<v Speaker 2>but at least he's still got his neck.</v>

2112
01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:14.220
<v Speaker 2>And the victor wolf gets to be high status wolf and he gets to go hunting with</v>

2113
01:34:14.221 --> 01:34:15.600
<v Speaker 2>his partner the next day.</v>

2114
01:34:16.170 --> 01:34:17.010
<v Speaker 2>And so you might think,</v>

2115
01:34:17.011 --> 01:34:17.191
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2116
01:34:17.191 --> 01:34:22.191
<v Speaker 2>wolves have a complex procedural morality and morality is don't tear the neck</v>

2117
01:34:23.881 --> 01:34:24.780
<v Speaker 2>out of your,</v>

2118
01:34:25.170 --> 01:34:28.920
<v Speaker 2>out of the out of the creature you defeat that's wrong.</v>

2119
01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:29.911
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>

2120
01:34:29.911 --> 01:34:30.061
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2121
01:34:30.061 --> 01:34:32.130
<v Speaker 2>that's the rule that will follow,</v>

2122
01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:35.400
<v Speaker 2>but that's wrong because wolves don't follow rules because wolves don't have</v>

2123
01:34:35.401 --> 01:34:39.060
<v Speaker 2>rules because they don't have language and they don't think not like us.</v>

2124
01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:41.520
<v Speaker 2>They act like they have rules.</v>

2125
01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:44.520
<v Speaker 2>They act so that if you watch them act,</v>

2126
01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:47.460
<v Speaker 2>you could label what they're doing with the rule.</v>

2127
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:50.130
<v Speaker 2>That's how we got our rules.</v>

2128
01:34:51.150 --> 01:34:52.860
<v Speaker 2>That's how we got our rules.</v>

2129
01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:56.820
<v Speaker 2>We acted out and ethic and then we.</v>

2130
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:00.290
<v Speaker 2>And then we coded it in stories.</v>

2131
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:03.230
<v Speaker 2>That's what our religious stories are there.</v>

2132
01:35:03.231 --> 01:35:08.150
<v Speaker 2>The consequence of us watching what it is that we do when we act ethically and</v>

2133
01:35:08.151 --> 01:35:12.260
<v Speaker 2>then transforming that into a story and everyone's intent on that story exists</v>

2134
01:35:12.261 --> 01:35:14.960
<v Speaker 2>absolutely intent on the story of good versus evil,</v>

2135
01:35:14.961 --> 01:35:15.350
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

2136
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:16.760
<v Speaker 2>because that's the fundamental story.</v>

2137
01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:18.740
<v Speaker 2>And why do you want to watch that story?</v>

2138
01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Because you want to know how to be the victor in the set of all possible games.</v>

2139
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:25.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's what that story's about and that's what movies are about.</v>

2140
01:35:25.791 --> 01:35:26.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's what books are about,</v>

2141
01:35:26.871 --> 01:35:28.700
<v Speaker 2>announced what religious narratives are about.</v>

2142
01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:32.720
<v Speaker 2>That's what everything that grips us at a literary level is about.</v>

2143
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:36.680
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that it grips this is because that's what the world is made of</v>

2144
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:38.270
<v Speaker 2>and that's what we need to know.</v>

2145
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:40.280
<v Speaker 2>So then you might think.</v>

2146
01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:41.960
<v Speaker 2>So here's something to think about.</v>

2147
01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.710
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a symbolic representation of this.</v>

2148
01:35:45.711 --> 01:35:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2149
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:48.200
<v Speaker 2>So there's this idea in Christianity,</v>

2150
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:52.190
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not talking about this from a religious perspective,</v>

2151
01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:53.090
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2152
01:35:53.090 --> 01:35:57.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about this from an anthropological perspective or a biological</v>

2153
01:35:57.471 --> 01:35:59.180
<v Speaker 2>perspective or a</v>

2154
01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:05.180
<v Speaker 2>that'll do an anthropological or a bylaw or psychological perspective.</v>

2155
01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.360
<v Speaker 2>So there's this idea in Christianity that Christ is Christ is the king of kings.</v>

2156
01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2157
01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:14.150
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to take that apart.</v>

2158
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:16.780
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you have a hierarchy,</v>

2159
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:18.103
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

2160
01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:19.610
<v Speaker 2>and there's someone at the top of it.</v>

2161
01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.020
<v Speaker 2>And so that person has the attributes necessary to be at the top of that</v>

2162
01:36:24.021 --> 01:36:24.854
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>

2163
01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's a hockey team and you go home and you tell a story about how the</v>

2164
01:36:29.421 --> 01:36:33.800
<v Speaker 2>best hockey player on your team played while they were being the best hockey</v>

2165
01:36:33.801 --> 01:36:34.460
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>

2166
01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a little hero narrative,</v>

2167
01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:40.460
<v Speaker 2>so little fragment of a hero narrative and maybe it's hockey,</v>

2168
01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:41.593
<v Speaker 2>soccer,</v>

2169
01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:42.553
<v Speaker 2>plumbing,</v>

2170
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:43.423
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>

2171
01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:44.473
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

2172
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:45.290
<v Speaker 2>art.</v>

2173
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:46.520
<v Speaker 2>There's all these hierarchies.</v>

2174
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:50.030
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the thing that's at the top of all of them.</v>

2175
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:54.830
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's all the at the top of all of them has something in common.</v>

2176
01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:59.420
<v Speaker 2>That's whatever it is that's in common across all the things that are at the</v>

2177
01:36:59.421 --> 01:37:00.254
<v Speaker 2>top.</v>

2178
01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:01.850
<v Speaker 2>So imagine this,</v>

2179
01:37:01.851 --> 01:37:02.121
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2180
01:37:02.121 --> 01:37:03.380
<v Speaker 2>so you could think about this.</v>

2181
01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that you're a novelist and you want to distill some characters and you</v>

2182
01:37:08.571 --> 01:37:11.950
<v Speaker 2>want the good evil character because what the hell good is your book without a</v>

2183
01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.880
<v Speaker 2>good evil character and you want a good,</v>

2184
01:37:13.881 --> 01:37:16.090
<v Speaker 2>good character because the same problem applies.</v>

2185
01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:20.090
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to just tell a story about some guy's Day,</v>

2186
01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:21.201
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2187
01:37:21.201 --> 01:37:21.891
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to say,</v>

2188
01:37:21.891 --> 01:37:22.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2189
01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:27.520
<v Speaker 2>John woke up at six and then he smacked his lips four times in blank 20 times</v>

2190
01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:32.840
<v Speaker 2>and then he swung his feet over across the bed and walked into the bathroom.</v>

2191
01:37:33.050 --> 01:37:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Because who cares about any of that?</v>

2192
01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:39.650
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to know that because you know how to move your mouth and cough</v>

2193
01:37:39.651 --> 01:37:41.090
<v Speaker 2>and walk to the bathroom.</v>

2194
01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not helpful.</v>

2195
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:44.060
<v Speaker 2>You want to distillation.</v>

2196
01:37:44.061 --> 01:37:47.570
<v Speaker 2>You want the novelist who have watched a bunch of people and abstracted out</v>

2197
01:37:47.571 --> 01:37:52.100
<v Speaker 2>someone who's good in a way that's good across a bunch of people and you want</v>

2198
01:37:52.101 --> 01:37:56.610
<v Speaker 2>him to have abstracted out someone who's evil that's abstracted across a bunch</v>

2199
01:37:56.611 --> 01:37:57.381
<v Speaker 2>of evil characters,</v>

2200
01:37:57.381 --> 01:37:59.100
<v Speaker 2>so you see that in hamlet for example.</v>

2201
01:37:59.101 --> 01:38:03.480
<v Speaker 2>You see that Dostoevsky where the where the characters are bigger than life and</v>

2202
01:38:03.481 --> 01:38:07.140
<v Speaker 2>you want them bigger than life because you want it distilled so that you can</v>

2203
01:38:07.141 --> 01:38:09.810
<v Speaker 2>learn from it and what you're learning is that ethic.</v>

2204
01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:10.981
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2205
01:38:10.981 --> 01:38:13.890
<v Speaker 2>so that imagine that you have 100 hierarchies,</v>

2206
01:38:13.891 --> 01:38:15.240
<v Speaker 2>just mundane hierarchies.</v>

2207
01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Then you take the people at the top of all those hierarchies and say that you</v>

2208
01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:20.520
<v Speaker 2>group them into groups of 10.</v>

2209
01:38:21.490 --> 01:38:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2210
01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 2>so you take 10 admirable people and then you say,</v>

2211
01:38:24.811 --> 01:38:25.021
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2212
01:38:25.021 --> 01:38:28.020
<v Speaker 2>we're going to average across them and we're going to come out with the most ad</v>

2213
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:31.140
<v Speaker 2>with a compass it admirable person made.</v>

2214
01:38:31.141 --> 01:38:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Out of those 10,</v>

2215
01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:33.900
<v Speaker 2>you have 100 to begin with.</v>

2216
01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:36.150
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you have a thousand to begin with.</v>

2217
01:38:36.151 --> 01:38:38.610
<v Speaker 2>You distill them to 100 admirable people.</v>

2218
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Then you take that hundred admirable people in,</v>

2219
01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:42.090
<v Speaker 2>you distill them into 10.</v>

2220
01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Then you take those 10 admirable people and you distill them into one and what</v>

2221
01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:51.450
<v Speaker 2>that one is is what's admirable across the entire set of admirable people.</v>

2222
01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:55.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a divine figure in a mythological story.</v>

2223
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:57.330
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

2224
01:38:57.690 --> 01:38:59.130
<v Speaker 2>And so the Christian ideas,</v>

2225
01:38:59.170 --> 01:39:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Christ is the king of kings and that's what it means.</v>

2226
01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:06.330
<v Speaker 2>You go into a cathedral and the cathedral is across by the way,</v>

2227
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:11.490
<v Speaker 2>and the cross is the place where suffering is accepted and the cross is a dome</v>

2228
01:39:11.491 --> 01:39:11.880
<v Speaker 2>over it.</v>

2229
01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Then that's the sky.</v>

2230
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.891
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2231
01:39:13.891 --> 01:39:18.180
<v Speaker 2>So there's an idea in the cathedral and the idea is that the place of the cross,</v>

2232
01:39:18.181 --> 01:39:19.710
<v Speaker 2>which is where suffering occurs,</v>

2233
01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:21.690
<v Speaker 2>is the center of the universe,</v>

2234
01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:22.950
<v Speaker 2>which is the Dome,</v>

2235
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:26.460
<v Speaker 2>and then you look up at the Dome and you see this figure staring down at you.</v>

2236
01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:30.900
<v Speaker 2>That's the king of kings and that's how to behave in the world.</v>

2237
01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:33.600
<v Speaker 2>That's what that image represents.</v>

2238
01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:34.921
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

2239
01:39:34.921 --> 01:39:35.754
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2240
01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:36.803
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean?</v>

2241
01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:37.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2242
01:39:37.021 --> 01:39:42.021
<v Speaker 2>here's a way of unpacking it and this is associated with its associated with the</v>

2243
01:39:43.261 --> 01:39:47.040
<v Speaker 2>idea of how to behave across the set of all possible hierarchies.</v>

2244
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:48.181
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2245
01:39:48.181 --> 01:39:49.014
<v Speaker 2>what should you do?</v>

2246
01:39:49.230 --> 01:39:49.501
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2247
01:39:49.501 --> 01:39:50.610
<v Speaker 2>according to rule one,</v>

2248
01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:53.610
<v Speaker 2>you should stand up straight with your shoulders back.</v>

2249
01:39:54.570 --> 01:39:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2250
01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Now the people who have been,</v>

2251
01:39:56.850 --> 01:39:59.310
<v Speaker 2>some of the people who've been criticizing me say,</v>

2252
01:39:59.670 --> 01:39:59.851
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2253
01:39:59.851 --> 01:40:01.860
<v Speaker 2>because I pointed out that hierarchies exist.</v>

2254
01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:02.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm justifying them.</v>

2255
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:08.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like pointing out that something exists is not the same as justifying it.</v>

2256
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:14.190
<v Speaker 2>It's just pointing out that it exists and pointing out that it exists without</v>

2257
01:40:14.191 --> 01:40:14.851
<v Speaker 2>justifying.</v>

2258
01:40:14.851 --> 01:40:19.650
<v Speaker 2>It is certainly not saying that the way to attain dominance in a hierarchy is</v>

2259
01:40:19.651 --> 01:40:20.670
<v Speaker 2>through power.</v>

2260
01:40:20.970 --> 01:40:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Was the other thing that I've been criticized for,</v>

2261
01:40:23.130 --> 01:40:24.720
<v Speaker 2>which is not what I'm saying.</v>

2262
01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:25.561
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2263
01:40:25.561 --> 01:40:26.394
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>

2264
01:40:26.650 --> 01:40:27.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2265
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even saying that a little bit.</v>

2266
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:31.500
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the opposite of what I'm saying.</v>

2267
01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:32.221
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

2268
01:40:32.221 --> 01:40:32.511
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2269
01:40:32.511 --> 01:40:34.500
<v Speaker 2>what if you stand up straight with your shoulders back?</v>

2270
01:40:34.710 --> 01:40:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a powerful stance?</v>

2271
01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:37.950
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

2272
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.791
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2273
01:40:38.791 --> 01:40:39.810
<v Speaker 2>actually no.</v>

2274
01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:42.600
<v Speaker 2>A powerful stance is this,</v>

2275
01:40:42.810 --> 01:40:43.643
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2276
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.981
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2277
01:40:43.981 --> 01:40:45.630
<v Speaker 2>not really because I'm not very good at it,</v>

2278
01:40:45.631 --> 01:40:48.600
<v Speaker 2>but if I knew what I was doing,</v>

2279
01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:53.170
<v Speaker 2>this would be it and I put myself sideways so I'm not much of a target and I'm</v>

2280
01:40:53.171 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 2>ready for attack.</v>

2281
01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:54.941
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2282
01:40:54.941 --> 01:40:56.410
<v Speaker 2>that's not this dance.</v>

2283
01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:58.510
<v Speaker 2>This dance is different.</v>

2284
01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2285
01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:01.330
<v Speaker 2>and that that isn't this dance either.</v>

2286
01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.610
<v Speaker 2>This is a defensive crouch.</v>

2287
01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:06.250
<v Speaker 2>This is what happens if you're depressed and anxious,</v>

2288
01:41:06.590 --> 01:41:06.851
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2289
01:41:06.851 --> 01:41:07.900
<v Speaker 2>This dance is,</v>

2290
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:11.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to take what the world throws at me.</v>

2291
01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:13.001
<v Speaker 2>Right in.</v>

2292
01:41:13.001 --> 01:41:17.200
<v Speaker 2>That might be the trials and tribulations that are associated with the hierarchy</v>

2293
01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:19.420
<v Speaker 2>because that's a tough battle in and of itself,</v>

2294
01:41:19.690 --> 01:41:23.500
<v Speaker 2>but it also might be all the terrible unknown things that are going to come your</v>

2295
01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:24.250
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2296
01:41:24.250 --> 01:41:29.050
<v Speaker 2>What's the right attitude is stand the hell up with some courage and take it</v>

2297
01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:32.710
<v Speaker 2>right voluntarily with courage,</v>

2298
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:36.100
<v Speaker 2>so it's actually a stance of maximal vulnerability,</v>

2299
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:39.640
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability adopted voluntarily.</v>

2300
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:42.370
<v Speaker 2>That's what the crucifix represents.</v>

2301
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:43.623
<v Speaker 2>Just so you know,</v>

2302
01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:48.520
<v Speaker 2>it represents the willingness to take on the suffering of the world voluntarily,</v>

2303
01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:49.900
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing,</v>

2304
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:53.890
<v Speaker 2>and that's associated with whatever at the top of the hierarchy.</v>

2305
01:41:53.890 --> 01:41:58.890
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is the best possible strategy that you have to be successful across</v>

2306
01:42:00.281 --> 01:42:04.720
<v Speaker 2>the set of all possible hierarchies is to maximally accept the fact that your</v>

2307
01:42:04.721 --> 01:42:05.200
<v Speaker 2>vote,</v>

2308
01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:08.980
<v Speaker 2>that you're vulnerable to accept that as the price of being,</v>

2309
01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:11.320
<v Speaker 2>and that's the essential message.</v>

2310
01:42:11.490 --> 01:42:15.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not only the message of Christianity by the way you see this sort of idea</v>

2311
01:42:15.311 --> 01:42:20.311
<v Speaker 2>expressed in all sorts of religious structures in the daoists to return to them</v>

2312
01:42:21.610 --> 01:42:21.851
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2313
01:42:21.851 --> 01:42:22.031
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2314
01:42:22.031 --> 01:42:23.920
<v Speaker 2>where should you be in the world?</v>

2315
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:27.730
<v Speaker 2>The world is made out of the catastrophe of chaos and the tyranny of order.</v>

2316
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Where do you stand in that place?</v>

2317
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:34.330
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is with one foot in chaos and one foot in order.</v>

2318
01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:36.580
<v Speaker 2>That's the line down the middle.</v>

2319
01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:37.810
<v Speaker 2>That's the Tao.</v>

2320
01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:38.770
<v Speaker 2>That's the way,</v>

2321
01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.390
<v Speaker 2>that's the point of meaning.</v>

2322
01:42:40.570 --> 01:42:43.270
<v Speaker 2>It's the same place that's at the center of a cathedral.</v>

2323
01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.590
<v Speaker 2>It's the same idea.</v>

2324
01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:50.250
<v Speaker 2>You stand there because you're secure because you have tradition and the power</v>

2325
01:42:51.461 --> 01:42:56.380
<v Speaker 2>of your civilization behind you and you have one foot in chaos because that's</v>

2326
01:42:56.381 --> 01:42:57.850
<v Speaker 2>not enough and never will be,</v>

2327
01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:03.700
<v Speaker 2>and the instinct that puts you there is the instinct of meaning and you can use</v>

2328
01:43:03.701 --> 01:43:07.210
<v Speaker 2>that as a guide and it's a deep neurological instinct.</v>

2329
01:43:07.570 --> 01:43:09.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not some EPA phenomena.</v>

2330
01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:14.740
<v Speaker 2>It's the most real thing there is as far as I can tell and associated with that</v>

2331
01:43:14.741 --> 01:43:16.360
<v Speaker 2>as a certain attitude towards life,</v>

2332
01:43:16.361 --> 01:43:20.890
<v Speaker 2>which is to venture courageously out into the unknown,</v>

2333
01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.110
<v Speaker 2>is to put yourself on the line,</v>

2334
01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:23.710
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2335
01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:25.600
<v Speaker 2>to heed the call of adventure,</v>

2336
01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:29.050
<v Speaker 2>to risk yourself voluntarily.</v>

2337
01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:30.940
<v Speaker 2>You have no choice anyways,</v>

2338
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.621
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2339
01:43:32.621 --> 01:43:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Because you're in this all the way.</v>

2340
01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:37.360
<v Speaker 2>There's no out that isn't death.</v>

2341
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.690
<v Speaker 2>The full catastrophe is at your feet.</v>

2342
01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:43.870
<v Speaker 2>You can't evade or escape that,</v>

2343
01:43:44.410 --> 01:43:48.460
<v Speaker 2>but what you can do is choose how it is that you're going to confront it,</v>

2344
01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:53.090
<v Speaker 2>and so rule one is to stand up straight with your shoulders back and to</v>

2345
01:43:53.091 --> 01:43:53.781
<v Speaker 2>manifest,</v>

2346
01:43:53.781 --> 01:43:56.630
<v Speaker 2>and this is the thing that's so amazing about this,</v>

2347
01:43:56.631 --> 01:43:57.400
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2348
01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:02.400
<v Speaker 2>and that what lands are kind of ultimate reality to the idea of positioning</v>

2349
01:44:03.561 --> 01:44:04.520
<v Speaker 2>yourself properly.</v>

2350
01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:05.953
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

2351
01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:07.963
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2352
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:13.390
<v Speaker 2>let's presume that you're a very pessimistic person or a very realistic person,</v>

2353
01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:17.173
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>

2354
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:17.601
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2355
01:44:17.601 --> 01:44:19.610
<v Speaker 2>what's the fundamental reality of life?</v>

2356
01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:19.941
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

2357
01:44:19.941 --> 01:44:20.121
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2358
01:44:20.121 --> 01:44:21.650
<v Speaker 2>it's suffering and malevolence.</v>

2359
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:23.631
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2360
01:44:23.631 --> 01:44:24.464
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2361
01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:28.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a hard argument to forestall,</v>

2362
01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:32.240
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's true.</v>

2363
01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:33.351
<v Speaker 2>It's true,</v>

2364
01:44:33.351 --> 01:44:34.130
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

2365
01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:35.540
<v Speaker 2>It's not the final truth.</v>

2366
01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:37.340
<v Speaker 2>The final truth is,</v>

2367
01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:39.890
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that that's true,</v>

2368
01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:45.640
<v Speaker 2>the ability of the human spirit to prevail is more powerful than death and evil.</v>

2369
01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:51.220
<v Speaker 2>That's the truth,</v>

2370
01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:53.650
<v Speaker 2>and you know that you know that,</v>

2371
01:44:53.651 --> 01:44:54.430
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2372
01:44:54.430 --> 01:44:58.030
<v Speaker 2>you know that because you're ashamed that you're not everything you could be.</v>

2373
01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:03.940
<v Speaker 2>You know that because the people that you admire are people who manifest courage</v>

2374
01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:08.200
<v Speaker 2>in the diarist of straights and you know that as well because when you meet</v>

2375
01:45:08.201 --> 01:45:10.660
<v Speaker 2>people like that and you're not like that,</v>

2376
01:45:10.930 --> 01:45:12.040
<v Speaker 2>they shame you.</v>

2377
01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:15.310
<v Speaker 2>That speaks to your deepest possible instinct.</v>

2378
01:45:15.311 --> 01:45:19.780
<v Speaker 2>You know what you could be and you know too that you see people contend with</v>

2379
01:45:19.781 --> 01:45:24.310
<v Speaker 2>situations that are so difficult that it's truly a miracle that they can contend</v>

2380
01:45:24.311 --> 01:45:25.144
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

2381
01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:25.511
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2382
01:45:25.511 --> 01:45:26.500
<v Speaker 2>when I think of people,</v>

2383
01:45:26.650 --> 01:45:26.771
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2384
01:45:26.771 --> 01:45:28.600
<v Speaker 2>I think the people who work in funeral homes,</v>

2385
01:45:28.601 --> 01:45:29.680
<v Speaker 2>that's a good example.</v>

2386
01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:30.760
<v Speaker 2>That's hard,</v>

2387
01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2388
01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:37.030
<v Speaker 2>That's death and grief every day and it's not something that you can avoid.</v>

2389
01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:38.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's right there.</v>

2390
01:45:38.651 --> 01:45:40.210
<v Speaker 2>It's as real as it can possibly be.</v>

2391
01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.830
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a story about that.</v>

2392
01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:47.820
<v Speaker 2>Had a client who was very afraid of being alive and she wanted to sleep all the</v>

2393
01:45:50.531 --> 01:45:54.190
<v Speaker 2>time and she took sleeping pills and all sorts of other things so that she could</v>

2394
01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:59.340
<v Speaker 2>evade the burden of being conscious and she was a very good dreamer and she.</v>

2395
01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:04.180
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't doing well in university and she had a dream one night that</v>

2396
01:46:06.130 --> 01:46:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Gypsy told her that she was actually lucid during her dreams by the way,</v>

2397
01:46:10.121 --> 01:46:14.140
<v Speaker 2>and she could ask her dream characters what they meant and they would tell her,</v>

2398
01:46:14.290 --> 01:46:16.990
<v Speaker 2>which was something I'd never seen anyone else manage.</v>

2399
01:46:17.410 --> 01:46:18.243
<v Speaker 2>In any case,</v>

2400
01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:22.060
<v Speaker 2>she jumped up this gypsy that she met in the forest and the Gypsy told her that</v>

2401
01:46:22.061 --> 01:46:22.990
<v Speaker 2>unless she learned to,</v>

2402
01:46:23.650 --> 01:46:25.540
<v Speaker 2>unless she could learn to work in a slaughter house,</v>

2403
01:46:25.541 --> 01:46:29.440
<v Speaker 2>she never finished her degree and so she told me that story.</v>

2404
01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:30.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this,</v>

2405
01:46:30.791 --> 01:46:35.590
<v Speaker 2>but the classic treatment for people who are afraid of things is to expose them</v>

2406
01:46:35.591 --> 01:46:37.000
<v Speaker 2>to what they're afraid of.</v>

2407
01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Which is a good lesson if you have children because you want to expose your</v>

2408
01:46:41.321 --> 01:46:43.840
<v Speaker 2>children to challenges because that makes them stronger.</v>

2409
01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:45.460
<v Speaker 2>It has to be done voluntarily,</v>

2410
01:46:45.461 --> 01:46:48.220
<v Speaker 2>but if you have posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

2411
01:46:48.221 --> 01:46:53.221
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're the of a vicious sexual assault by a stranger and two years</v>

2412
01:46:53.431 --> 01:46:55.320
<v Speaker 2>later you have posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>

2413
01:46:56.100 --> 01:47:00.120
<v Speaker 2>The most effective treatment is to get you to relive the experience in as much</v>

2414
01:47:00.121 --> 01:47:04.140
<v Speaker 2>vivid detail as you possibly can and experience all the emotions that occurred</v>

2415
01:47:04.141 --> 01:47:06.200
<v Speaker 2>while it was happening and if the.</v>

2416
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:07.470
<v Speaker 2>If you do that,</v>

2417
01:47:07.471 --> 01:47:09.630
<v Speaker 2>the more upset you get when you do that,</v>

2418
01:47:09.631 --> 01:47:10.680
<v Speaker 2>if you do it voluntarily,</v>

2419
01:47:10.681 --> 01:47:13.380
<v Speaker 2>the faster you get better and the longer you stay better,</v>

2420
01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:17.970
<v Speaker 2>and so it's a general rule of thumb in psychotherapy is if someone's avoiding</v>

2421
01:47:17.971 --> 01:47:18.570
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2422
01:47:18.570 --> 01:47:20.040
<v Speaker 2>find out what they're avoiding,</v>

2423
01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:25.200
<v Speaker 2>break it into manageable pieces and have them voluntarily expose themselves to</v>

2424
01:47:25.201 --> 01:47:27.300
<v Speaker 2>it and they will be cured.</v>

2425
01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's the dragon fight in,</v>

2426
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:30.570
<v Speaker 2>in clinical practice,</v>

2427
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:35.670
<v Speaker 2>find what you most want to what you most need will be found where you least want</v>

2428
01:47:35.671 --> 01:47:37.320
<v Speaker 2>to look right.</v>

2429
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:38.640
<v Speaker 2>That's a hell of a statement.</v>

2430
01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:43.350
<v Speaker 2>So she told me this dream and I thought,</v>

2431
01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:43.651
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2432
01:47:43.651 --> 01:47:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to arrange for you to work in a slaughter house.</v>

2433
01:47:48.241 --> 01:47:49.710
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't seem like very.</v>

2434
01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:51.420
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't eat meat by the way.</v>

2435
01:47:51.421 --> 01:47:52.980
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't go into a butcher store.</v>

2436
01:47:53.130 --> 01:47:57.480
<v Speaker 2>I took her into a butcher store once and she had a very catastrophic reaction.</v>

2437
01:47:57.481 --> 01:47:59.550
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't handle it anyways.</v>

2438
01:48:01.110 --> 01:48:01.531
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2439
01:48:01.531 --> 01:48:01.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2440
01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:03.540
<v Speaker 2>we can arrange the slaughterhouse thing.</v>

2441
01:48:03.541 --> 01:48:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you go away and for a while and come back in a week and see if you can</v>

2442
01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:09.060
<v Speaker 2>come up with an alternative.</v>

2443
01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.141
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2444
01:48:10.141 --> 01:48:10.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2445
01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:12.090
<v Speaker 2>she came back and she said,</v>

2446
01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:13.710
<v Speaker 2>I want to see an embalming.</v>

2447
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:15.451
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

2448
01:48:15.451 --> 01:48:16.284
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

2449
01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:17.250
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2450
01:48:17.250 --> 01:48:18.990
<v Speaker 2>how the hell am I going to arrange that?</v>

2451
01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.570
<v Speaker 2>So I phoned a couple of funeral homes and I said,</v>

2452
01:48:21.571 --> 01:48:21.781
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2453
01:48:21.781 --> 01:48:26.781
<v Speaker 2>I've got this person who's really afraid of death and she had this dream and I</v>

2454
01:48:27.601 --> 01:48:28.890
<v Speaker 2>told them the story and they said,</v>

2455
01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:29.813
<v Speaker 2>no problem,</v>

2456
01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:31.133
<v Speaker 2>bring her in.</v>

2457
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:34.770
<v Speaker 2>And so I wasn't looking forward to this by the way.</v>

2458
01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2459
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:38.430
<v Speaker 2>so we went and she was very,</v>

2460
01:48:38.431 --> 01:48:41.580
<v Speaker 2>very nervous because she certainly didn't think she could handle that.</v>

2461
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.830
<v Speaker 2>And as I said already,</v>

2462
01:48:43.831 --> 01:48:45.510
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't exactly thrilled about it either,</v>

2463
01:48:45.511 --> 01:48:46.111
<v Speaker 2>but in,</v>

2464
01:48:46.111 --> 01:48:47.130
<v Speaker 2>for a pound in,</v>

2465
01:48:47.131 --> 01:48:47.791
<v Speaker 2>for a penny in,</v>

2466
01:48:47.791 --> 01:48:48.900
<v Speaker 2>for a pound as they say.</v>

2467
01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:49.711
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

2468
01:48:49.711 --> 01:48:54.000
<v Speaker 2>we went to the funeral parlor and they showed us around and we asked a bunch of</v>

2469
01:48:54.001 --> 01:48:54.691
<v Speaker 2>questions like,</v>

2470
01:48:54.691 --> 01:48:56.730
<v Speaker 2>how the hell did they cope with their jobs?</v>

2471
01:48:56.731 --> 01:48:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Because that's just a mystery to me.</v>

2472
01:48:58.321 --> 01:48:59.101
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

2473
01:48:59.101 --> 01:48:59.281
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2474
01:48:59.281 --> 01:49:02.460
<v Speaker 2>it was actually really useful for them to guide people through the process of</v>

2475
01:49:02.461 --> 01:49:06.150
<v Speaker 2>grief and that their experience was that that had given them a renewed</v>

2476
01:49:06.151 --> 01:49:07.440
<v Speaker 2>appreciation for life,</v>

2477
01:49:07.441 --> 01:49:08.940
<v Speaker 2>which is well</v>

2478
01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:13.590
<v Speaker 2>that would account for why they were able to do it because it seems like a very</v>

2479
01:49:13.591 --> 01:49:14.250
<v Speaker 2>hard job.</v>

2480
01:49:14.250 --> 01:49:19.250
<v Speaker 2>And so we went into this room and watch this embalming and I was about eight</v>

2481
01:49:20.851 --> 01:49:22.130
<v Speaker 2>feet away from this small room.</v>

2482
01:49:22.131 --> 01:49:24.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty gruesome operation as you might imagine.</v>

2483
01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:25.733
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2484
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:29.110
<v Speaker 2>my client was sitting beside me and I was watching her and watching the</v>

2485
01:49:29.111 --> 01:49:30.000
<v Speaker 2>embalming as well.</v>

2486
01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 2>And for the first while she was just looking to the side,</v>

2487
01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:34.590
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

2488
01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:39.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not here and I certainly can't handle that and no bloody wonder literally.</v>

2489
01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:40.771
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>

2490
01:49:40.771 --> 01:49:42.720
<v Speaker 2>But then she would take the odd glance,</v>

2491
01:49:42.721 --> 01:49:45.420
<v Speaker 2>say she'd go like this and then look away.</v>

2492
01:49:45.630 --> 01:49:47.770
<v Speaker 2>And then as the minutes by,</v>

2493
01:49:47.771 --> 01:49:48.970
<v Speaker 2>but fairly rapidly,</v>

2494
01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:53.440
<v Speaker 2>she was spending more time watching and less time looking away until she was</v>

2495
01:49:53.441 --> 01:49:54.910
<v Speaker 2>finally doing nothing but watching.</v>

2496
01:49:55.810 --> 01:49:59.050
<v Speaker 2>And then at some point she asked if she could come in and put her hand on the</v>

2497
01:49:59.051 --> 01:49:59.500
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

2498
01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:03.280
<v Speaker 2>and so they gave her a glove and she did that and then she went and sat down and</v>

2499
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:07.660
<v Speaker 2>she was quite quiet about all this and quite quiet afterwards as well.</v>

2500
01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:09.820
<v Speaker 2>So what did she discover?</v>

2501
01:50:10.730 --> 01:50:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2502
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:12.580
<v Speaker 2>she didn't discover the death was,</v>

2503
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:13.660
<v Speaker 2>wasn't horrible.</v>

2504
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:18.910
<v Speaker 2>She didn't discover that and she didn't discover the death wasn't terrifying</v>

2505
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:20.770
<v Speaker 2>because it certainly was.</v>

2506
01:50:21.310 --> 01:50:24.160
<v Speaker 2>But what she did discover was that she was a hell of a lot tougher than she</v>

2507
01:50:24.161 --> 01:50:24.994
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

2508
01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:25.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2509
01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:28.330
<v Speaker 2>and much quicker than she would have believed.</v>

2510
01:50:28.570 --> 01:50:30.550
<v Speaker 2>And she went away thinking,</v>

2511
01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:31.953
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

2512
01:50:33.250 --> 01:50:34.083
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

2513
01:50:34.630 --> 01:50:37.600
<v Speaker 2>I did the thing I was most afraid of doing.</v>

2514
01:50:37.601 --> 01:50:38.800
<v Speaker 2>And here I am.</v>

2515
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Not only am I not more damaged than I was,</v>

2516
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:44.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually better than I was.</v>

2517
01:50:45.670 --> 01:50:48.700
<v Speaker 2>And so from then on she had a reference point.</v>

2518
01:50:48.701 --> 01:50:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2519
01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Which is an interesting thing.</v>

2520
01:50:50.501 --> 01:50:54.280
<v Speaker 2>I think this is why primordial people initiate their,</v>

2521
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:55.450
<v Speaker 2>especially their young men,</v>

2522
01:50:55.451 --> 01:50:57.520
<v Speaker 2>because it sort of happens automatically with young women.</v>

2523
01:50:57.910 --> 01:51:00.520
<v Speaker 2>They expose their young men to something absolutely terrifying,</v>

2524
01:51:00.850 --> 01:51:02.650
<v Speaker 2>genuinely terrifying.</v>

2525
01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:04.090
<v Speaker 2>So for the rest of their lives,</v>

2526
01:51:04.091 --> 01:51:08.140
<v Speaker 2>they know the difference between what's actually terrifying and what's just sort</v>

2527
01:51:08.141 --> 01:51:11.320
<v Speaker 2>of normal catastrophe because you really need to know that,</v>

2528
01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:11.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2529
01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Because you need to know that you can prevail and one of the things she learned</v>

2530
01:51:15.221 --> 01:51:20.221
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of that exposure was that she could prevail despite the</v>

2531
01:51:21.011 --> 01:51:22.150
<v Speaker 2>realities of life.</v>

2532
01:51:22.410 --> 01:51:22.811
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

2533
01:51:22.811 --> 01:51:25.990
<v Speaker 2>that's what you want to teach your children mostly by example,</v>

2534
01:51:26.590 --> 01:51:30.340
<v Speaker 2>is that they can prevail despite the realities of life.</v>

2535
01:51:30.630 --> 01:51:30.941
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

2536
01:51:30.941 --> 01:51:34.450
<v Speaker 2>that also means that you have to have admitted to what the realities of life</v>

2537
01:51:34.451 --> 01:51:34.990
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2538
01:51:34.990 --> 01:51:36.910
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that's so interesting about that.</v>

2539
01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Here's another story.</v>

2540
01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:42.250
<v Speaker 2>So you know the story of King Arthur and the holy grail.</v>

2541
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:48.530
<v Speaker 2>The holy grail is the ultimate value that it's a symbol of whatever the ultimate</v>

2542
01:51:48.531 --> 01:51:49.364
<v Speaker 2>value is.</v>

2543
01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:53.150
<v Speaker 2>And King Arthur assembles is nights around the round table and it's a round</v>

2544
01:51:53.151 --> 01:51:55.460
<v Speaker 2>table because they're all equal.</v>

2545
01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Despite the fact that they have a king,</v>

2546
01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:01.670
<v Speaker 2>they sit as equals at the round table and they all decided to go off to seek for</v>

2547
01:52:01.671 --> 01:52:02.504
<v Speaker 2>the holy grail.</v>

2548
01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:06.920
<v Speaker 2>It's either the cup that Christ drank out of at the last supper,</v>

2549
01:52:06.921 --> 01:52:08.750
<v Speaker 2>the cup that held his blood on the cross.</v>

2550
01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:09.860
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those two things.</v>

2551
01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:10.881
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really matter.</v>

2552
01:52:10.881 --> 01:52:13.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a symbol of what's redemptive.</v>

2553
01:52:13.670 --> 01:52:14.870
<v Speaker 2>That's what the holy grail is,</v>

2554
01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:17.630
<v Speaker 2>so it's a representation of the ultimate value.</v>

2555
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:23.350
<v Speaker 2>The question is where do you go to seek out what's of ultimate value and answer</v>

2556
01:52:23.351 --> 01:52:23.780
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2557
01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:28.280
<v Speaker 2>in the tail of of King Arthur and the holy grail is that each night entered the</v>

2558
01:52:28.281 --> 01:52:32.900
<v Speaker 2>forest when they began their search at the place that looks darkest to them.</v>

2559
01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:40.080
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing is that it's necessary if you're going to stand up straight</v>

2560
01:52:40.421 --> 01:52:45.410
<v Speaker 2>with your shoulders back to confront the darkness of the world,</v>

2561
01:52:45.411 --> 01:52:46.244
<v Speaker 2>head on,</v>

2562
01:52:46.730 --> 01:52:51.730
<v Speaker 2>to take responsibility for the tragedy of existence and for for malevolence.</v>

2563
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:53.210
<v Speaker 2>That's what it means.</v>

2564
01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:57.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the what the Christian injunction to take the sins of the world onto</v>

2565
01:52:57.141 --> 01:53:00.230
<v Speaker 2>yourself means it means it's your bloody problem,</v>

2566
01:53:00.590 --> 01:53:03.410
<v Speaker 2>and to confront Satan in the desert is the same idea,</v>

2567
01:53:03.770 --> 01:53:07.640
<v Speaker 2>is that not only do you have to take on the tragedy of the world as if it's your</v>

2568
01:53:07.641 --> 01:53:08.570
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>

2569
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:12.710
<v Speaker 2>but you have to contend with the spirit of malevolence while you're doing so,</v>

2570
01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:14.030
<v Speaker 2>and it's in doing that,</v>

2571
01:53:14.031 --> 01:53:15.290
<v Speaker 2>that you find your destiny.</v>

2572
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:20.470
<v Speaker 2>That's where you find the highest of possible values and that's the call and</v>

2573
01:53:20.610 --> 01:53:23.330
<v Speaker 2>that's the call to the nobility of being because you might think,</v>

2574
01:53:23.331 --> 01:53:23.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2575
01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:27.050
<v Speaker 2>what could possibly justify your life more thoroughly?</v>

2576
01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.670
<v Speaker 2>What could make you the best player of all possible games than to take the</v>

2577
01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:37.240
<v Speaker 2>tragedy of the world onto your shoulders and to fight with all your ability</v>

2578
01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:43.040
<v Speaker 2>against the malevolence in your own heart.</v>

2579
01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:45.953
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2580
01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:58.160
<v Speaker 1>The first one I'll choose here.</v>

2581
01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for coming to speak with us.</v>

2582
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:01.820
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of Iceland?</v>

2583
01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:10.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2584
01:54:11.410 --> 01:54:12.243
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2585
01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:13.810
<v Speaker 1>thank you all for coming.</v>

2586
01:54:14.290 --> 01:54:18.970
<v Speaker 1>It's quite remarkable to see so many people come out for such a serious</v>

2587
01:54:18.971 --> 01:54:19.870
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

2588
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:22.030
<v Speaker 1>It isn't exactly what you'd expect.</v>

2589
01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:23.613
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2590
01:54:23.670 --> 01:54:24.503
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2591
01:54:24.850 --> 01:54:28.720
<v Speaker 1>everyone has been ridiculously hospitable to me and my family.</v>

2592
01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:30.233
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2593
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:32.080
<v Speaker 1>we've seen some beautiful things.</v>

2594
01:54:32.081 --> 01:54:33.160
<v Speaker 1>We were at the blue lagoon,</v>

2595
01:54:33.161 --> 01:54:34.360
<v Speaker 1>which was very impressive.</v>

2596
01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:39.660
<v Speaker 1>We went to the house today where Gorbachev and Reagan met in 1996 and that was</v>

2597
01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:41.440
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

2598
01:54:41.441 --> 01:54:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I went and saw some rare manuscripts at the university this morning,</v>

2599
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:50.910
<v Speaker 1>a lager and his crew of people have been very organized and you have a beautiful</v>

2600
01:54:53.530 --> 01:54:58.510
<v Speaker 1>little capital city that's extraordinarily impressive and you've produced this</v>

2601
01:54:58.511 --> 01:55:03.511
<v Speaker 1>amazing venue and your country is cruising along on all cylinders and it's a</v>

2602
01:55:05.471 --> 01:55:06.460
<v Speaker 1>hell of an achievement.</v>

2603
01:55:07.150 --> 01:55:08.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I think.</v>

2604
01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2605
01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that almost all the time when I come to a European country,</v>

2606
01:55:13.930 --> 01:55:15.490
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how well it works.</v>

2607
01:55:15.491 --> 01:55:15.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2608
01:55:15.731 --> 01:55:16.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a harsh place,</v>

2609
01:55:16.721 --> 01:55:17.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2610
01:55:17.230 --> 01:55:18.063
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2611
01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:22.870
<v Speaker 1>you made a lot of what you have and it looks to me like it's just getting better</v>

2612
01:55:23.410 --> 01:55:28.410
<v Speaker 1>and so it's peaceful and productive and civilized and beautiful and hospitable</v>

2613
01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:30.573
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2614
01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:33.273
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

2615
01:55:34.150 --> 01:55:35.560
<v Speaker 1>And thank you for inviting me.</v>

2616
01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm this one.</v>

2617
01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:46.500
<v Speaker 1>The next one is regarding the headpieces on you.</v>

2618
01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2619
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:50.550
<v Speaker 1>when such an article is written,</v>

2620
01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:56.630
<v Speaker 1>what is your interpretation of the costs or further potential explanations are</v>

2621
01:55:59.281 --> 01:56:00.750
<v Speaker 1>there for this phenomenon?</v>

2622
01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:02.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2623
01:56:02.731 --> 01:56:03.564
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

2624
01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:05.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2625
01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:07.680
<v Speaker 1>we could start with what I might be contributing to it</v>

2626
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:16.020
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2627
01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:17.250
<v Speaker 1>One thing I've had to learn,</v>

2628
01:56:17.251 --> 01:56:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I've had some interactions with public exposure for probably</v>

2629
01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:29.900
<v Speaker 1>15 years because I worked a little bit with a public television station in</v>

2630
01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Ontario before all this blew up.</v>

2631
01:56:36.910 --> 01:56:40.480
<v Speaker 1>My producer who was someone who was very much on my side.</v>

2632
01:56:40.481 --> 01:56:45.481
<v Speaker 1>So I worked for a public affairs show first of all as irregular panelist and</v>

2633
01:56:46.391 --> 01:56:48.460
<v Speaker 1>then as a columnist for a couple of years.</v>

2634
01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:52.090
<v Speaker 1>My producer,</v>

2635
01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:53.380
<v Speaker 1>who is the level headed guy</v>

2636
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:58.390
<v Speaker 1>well versed in what worked well in panel discussions,</v>

2637
01:56:59.610 --> 01:57:04.610
<v Speaker 1>told me to be very careful about controlling my proclivity towards anger because</v>

2638
01:57:07.211 --> 01:57:08.980
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't play very well publicly.</v>

2639
01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:11.013
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

2640
01:57:12.810 --> 01:57:13.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2641
01:57:13.090 --> 01:57:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I kept trying to learn the doctrine of minimal necessary force.</v>

2642
01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:17.373
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2643
01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I think that aggression is a good thing if it's controlled.</v>

2644
01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good antidote to fear.</v>

2645
01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:27.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the things that can help you maintain your ground in the</v>

2646
01:57:27.161 --> 01:57:28.450
<v Speaker 1>face of resistance,</v>

2647
01:57:28.930 --> 01:57:31.270
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be applied very,</v>

2648
01:57:31.271 --> 01:57:36.271
<v Speaker 1>very judiciously and it isn't obvious that I always do that as well as I might</v>

2649
01:57:37.690 --> 01:57:37.900
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

2650
01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:42.760
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to deal with difficult and dangerous and contentious issues,</v>

2651
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:45.850
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to get punished for your failures.</v>

2652
01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm trying to learn too</v>

2653
01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:53.710
<v Speaker 1>detach myself and to not,</v>

2654
01:57:53.711 --> 01:57:54.544
<v Speaker 1>not in a,</v>

2655
01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:56.510
<v Speaker 1>not in an I don't care way,</v>

2656
01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:57.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2657
01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:02.480
<v Speaker 1>but in a watchful way and to keep all of that under control as much as possible</v>

2658
01:58:02.921 --> 01:58:07.900
<v Speaker 1>and to use minimal necessary force and it's hard to learn to do that well.</v>

2659
01:58:08.530 --> 01:58:11.110
<v Speaker 1>And so to the degree that I don't do that,</v>

2660
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:16.000
<v Speaker 1>then I instigate more opposition than I might.</v>

2661
01:58:17.230 --> 01:58:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a hard time with that to some degree because I do find some of what I</v>

2662
01:58:22.391 --> 01:58:23.224
<v Speaker 1>have been,</v>

2663
01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:25.270
<v Speaker 1>let's say opposing,</v>

2664
01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:27.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2665
01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:32.500
<v Speaker 1>what would you say</v>

2666
01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:35.153
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2667
01:58:35.170 --> 01:58:36.550
<v Speaker 1>it makes me deeply,</v>

2668
01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:40.210
<v Speaker 1>it disturbs me deeply and makes me unhappy and ashamed.</v>

2669
01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:45.160
<v Speaker 1>That's particularly the case when I see what's happening at the universities.</v>

2670
01:58:46.330 --> 01:58:51.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not impressed by what's happening in the social sciences and the humanities.</v>

2671
01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm not impressed with the postmodernists.</v>

2672
01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:57.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not impressed with the Marxists and I'm certainly not impressed with the</v>

2673
01:58:57.851 --> 01:59:02.851
<v Speaker 1>people or the theories that juxtapose the two in this particularly ideological</v>

2674
01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:10.440
<v Speaker 1>brew that's been fermenting say since the 19 sixties and so it's not easy to</v>

2675
01:59:11.291 --> 01:59:13.450
<v Speaker 1>maintain equanimity in the face of that,</v>

2676
01:59:13.451 --> 01:59:16.830
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because it's still necessary to.</v>

2677
01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you think their ideology has permeated all of media or because not all of it?</v>

2678
01:59:24.730 --> 01:59:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2679
01:59:25.210 --> 01:59:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the other thing is that,</v>

2680
01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:29.020
<v Speaker 1>and this is why dealing now,</v>

2681
01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:32.050
<v Speaker 1>now we can turn to what the media might bring to this.</v>

2682
01:59:32.051 --> 01:59:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2683
01:59:32.770 --> 01:59:33.603
<v Speaker 1>ideological,</v>

2684
01:59:33.970 --> 01:59:35.770
<v Speaker 1>ideological pre commitments.</v>

2685
01:59:35.770 --> 01:59:40.770
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly the case and inability to see anything other than in</v>

2686
01:59:41.201 --> 01:59:42.400
<v Speaker 1>politicized terms.</v>

2687
01:59:42.401 --> 01:59:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't view that what I'm doing as fundamentally political.</v>

2688
01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

2689
01:59:46.980 --> 01:59:51.980
<v Speaker 1>In fact I don't view the battle that's raging in the idiation substructure of</v>

2690
01:59:52.331 --> 01:59:54.100
<v Speaker 1>our society is fundamentally political.</v>

2691
01:59:54.101 --> 01:59:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it's deeper than political.</v>

2692
01:59:55.601 --> 01:59:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It's at least philosophical and it's probably theological,</v>

2693
02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:04.360
<v Speaker 1>but the but the people who've been pillaring me,</v>

2694
02:00:04.361 --> 02:00:07.480
<v Speaker 1>let's say who tend to be the postmodern neo marxists types,</v>

2695
02:00:07.481 --> 02:00:11.920
<v Speaker 1>or at least leading in that direction cannot conceptualize anything that isn't</v>

2696
02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:14.110
<v Speaker 1>political in their world.</v>

2697
02:00:14.111 --> 02:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>There isn't anything that isn't political.</v>

2698
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:18.370
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that you might consider,</v>

2699
02:00:18.371 --> 02:00:19.001
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2700
02:00:19.001 --> 02:00:20.320
<v Speaker 1>is you know,</v>

2701
02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I've been perhaps represented as an as an advocate of free speech,</v>

2702
02:00:28.931 --> 02:00:33.931
<v Speaker 1>and of course there's a lot of debate about what free speech really is from the</v>

2703
02:00:34.991 --> 02:00:39.991
<v Speaker 1>radical leftist types and here's something that you have to understand from the</v>

2704
02:00:40.570 --> 02:00:43.810
<v Speaker 1>collectivist perspective that dominates the radical left.</v>

2705
02:00:44.110 --> 02:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>There is no such thing as free speech.</v>

2706
02:00:48.130 --> 02:00:49.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not that they oppose it,</v>

2707
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:53.290
<v Speaker 1>it's that it isn't a move in their game.</v>

2708
02:00:53.590 --> 02:00:54.880
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>

2709
02:00:55.210 --> 02:00:56.860
<v Speaker 1>So if you stand up and say,</v>

2710
02:00:57.730 --> 02:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm manifesting my opinion as an individual,</v>

2711
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>then that's not a acceptable move because you aren't an individual.</v>

2712
02:01:08.890 --> 02:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>You're an Avatar of your dominant group and whatever you otter,</v>

2713
02:01:15.010 --> 02:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>regardless of why you think you're honoring it or regardless of whether you</v>

2714
02:01:19.181 --> 02:01:24.181
<v Speaker 1>think it's your individual opinion is nothing but a power move in your dominance</v>

2715
02:01:25.271 --> 02:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and so it's not like they oppose free speech.</v>

2716
02:01:28.601 --> 02:01:33.370
<v Speaker 1>It's that it doesn't exist in their conceptual framework and so that's one of</v>

2717
02:01:33.371 --> 02:01:38.371
<v Speaker 1>the things that drives and they hit pieces because I do believe in the</v>

2718
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:39.793
<v Speaker 1>individual</v>

2719
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe in free speech and I do believe in a world outside the</v>

2720
02:01:44.331 --> 02:01:45.530
<v Speaker 1>conceptual realm,</v>

2721
02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:50.740
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of propositions that aren't part and parcel of the postmodernist slash</v>

2722
02:01:51.471 --> 02:01:55.610
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxist game and they're not very happy with that.</v>

2723
02:01:56.370 --> 02:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not playing by the rules and so they don't know what to do about that.</v>

2724
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>The simplest thing to do is to call me far right,</v>

2725
02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>are all right because then they can.</v>

2726
02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:08.990
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2727
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:11.390
<v Speaker 1>that's an evil category and that dispenses with that,</v>

2728
02:02:11.391 --> 02:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>but it also means they don't have to contend with any of my arguments and that's</v>

2729
02:02:15.141 --> 02:02:15.974
<v Speaker 1>convenient,</v>

2730
02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>so it's easier to demonize than it is to contend.</v>

2731
02:02:22.610 --> 02:02:27.470
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't seem to help them because the more they scream,</v>

2732
02:02:27.590 --> 02:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>the more people that actually listen to you hear that are not far right.</v>

2733
02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:32.750
<v Speaker 1>You're not all thrive.</v>

2734
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:34.400
<v Speaker 1>And they stopped believing them.</v>

2735
02:02:35.150 --> 02:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2736
02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing.</v>

2737
02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I've talked with my wife about this because it's been in been.</v>

2738
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:44.810
<v Speaker 1>It's produced a lot of tension in our family because it's very stressful.</v>

2739
02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2740
02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:46.580
<v Speaker 1>for all sorts of reasons,</v>

2741
02:02:46.581 --> 02:02:47.660
<v Speaker 1>but that's certainly one of them,</v>

2742
02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2743
02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:48.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2744
02:02:48.771 --> 02:02:53.771
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not the case that when I read a headpiece that I'm very pleased</v>

2745
02:02:54.561 --> 02:02:57.200
<v Speaker 1>about it and I'm often quite worried about it.</v>

2746
02:02:57.201 --> 02:02:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Like the New York Times piece,</v>

2747
02:02:58.971 --> 02:02:59.521
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2748
02:02:59.521 --> 02:03:01.880
<v Speaker 1>is a good example and it's idiot.</v>

2749
02:03:02.190 --> 02:03:03.023
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2750
02:03:03.230 --> 02:03:04.070
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

2751
02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:05.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2752
02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:08.030
<v Speaker 1>insistence that I was promoting,</v>

2753
02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:09.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2754
02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>monogamy with the weapons of the state of all the insane ideas.</v>

2755
02:03:14.721 --> 02:03:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2756
02:03:15.230 --> 02:03:19.670
<v Speaker 1>who the hell believes that it's like some isis guys.</v>

2757
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:20.840
<v Speaker 1>That's about it.</v>

2758
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2759
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:21.780
<v Speaker 1>so it's an,</v>

2760
02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:26.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a completely absurd accusation and it certainly bore no resemblance to</v>

2761
02:03:27.051 --> 02:03:28.280
<v Speaker 1>anything that I meant.</v>

2762
02:03:29.090 --> 02:03:29.691
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2763
02:03:29.691 --> 02:03:34.691
<v Speaker 1>it's a powerful media organization and lots of people warned me in the immediate</v>

2764
02:03:34.971 --> 02:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>aftermath of that,</v>

2765
02:03:35.890 --> 02:03:40.400
<v Speaker 1>that it would be my downfall and including people who were less,</v>

2766
02:03:40.650 --> 02:03:42.320
<v Speaker 1>they weren't fearful people.</v>

2767
02:03:42.321 --> 02:03:43.910
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very stressful.</v>

2768
02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:45.830
<v Speaker 1>So one question is,</v>

2769
02:03:45.831 --> 02:03:46.011
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2770
02:03:46.011 --> 02:03:47.990
<v Speaker 1>should I be doing interviews like that at all?</v>

2771
02:03:47.991 --> 02:03:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things I thought is no written interviews only live</v>

2772
02:03:52.101 --> 02:03:52.934
<v Speaker 1>interviews,</v>

2773
02:03:53.090 --> 02:03:54.440
<v Speaker 1>only the whole thing.</v>

2774
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:57.590
<v Speaker 1>So the one today you had is the last one.</v>

2775
02:03:57.770 --> 02:03:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Well see,</v>

2776
02:03:59.271 --> 02:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because the,</v>

2777
02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.990
<v Speaker 1>there's another side of it which is decide you laid out.</v>

2778
02:04:02.991 --> 02:04:05.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like this happened with the,</v>

2779
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:09.830
<v Speaker 1>some of you have seen the channel for interview that I did with Kathy Newman.</v>

2780
02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:16.620
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2781
02:04:18.650 --> 02:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>You know when that was,</v>

2782
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:24.740
<v Speaker 1>I would say that was a stressful interview and I would say that the two weeks</v>

2783
02:04:24.741 --> 02:04:27.560
<v Speaker 1>after the interview we're also very stressful because,</v>

2784
02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:29.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2785
02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:32.930
<v Speaker 1>first of all there was the interview and I thought they just cut it to seven</v>

2786
02:04:32.931 --> 02:04:35.090
<v Speaker 1>minutes and pillory me and leave it at that.</v>

2787
02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:38.790
<v Speaker 1>But they it to seven minutes and pilloried me.</v>

2788
02:04:38.791 --> 02:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>And then they posted the whole interview,</v>

2789
02:04:40.711 --> 02:04:41.850
<v Speaker 1>which just shocked me,</v>

2790
02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.770
<v Speaker 1>but here's the shocking thing.</v>

2791
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>The people who posted that interview thought it went well.</v>

2792
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:51.120
<v Speaker 1>That's why they posted it.</v>

2793
02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:51.721
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think,</v>

2794
02:04:51.721 --> 02:04:52.291
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2795
02:04:52.291 --> 02:04:53.160
<v Speaker 1>this is contentious.</v>

2796
02:04:53.161 --> 02:04:53.941
<v Speaker 1>We better put it out,</v>

2797
02:04:53.941 --> 02:04:54.481
<v Speaker 1>believe me.</v>

2798
02:04:54.481 --> 02:04:56.460
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think that that is not what they thought.</v>

2799
02:04:56.490 --> 02:04:57.480
<v Speaker 1>They thought it went fine.</v>

2800
02:04:57.870 --> 02:05:01.980
<v Speaker 1>And so then there was this overwhelming response to it and that was completely</v>

2801
02:05:01.981 --> 02:05:02.814
<v Speaker 1>unexpected.</v>

2802
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:05.190
<v Speaker 1>And then the counter response was,</v>

2803
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Peterson's army of alt right trolls is victimizing Kathy Newman.</v>

2804
02:05:10.650 --> 02:05:11.780
<v Speaker 1>And that was.</v>

2805
02:05:12.170 --> 02:05:14.430
<v Speaker 1>That was the response of her employers,</v>

2806
02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:15.540
<v Speaker 1>the technical response,</v>

2807
02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:16.540
<v Speaker 1>because that's what they publish.</v>

2808
02:05:16.541 --> 02:05:19.230
<v Speaker 1>They said we had to call the police to evaluate the threat.</v>

2809
02:05:19.530 --> 02:05:20.363
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2810
02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:21.301
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2811
02:05:21.301 --> 02:05:25.170
<v Speaker 1>so what anybody can call in police to evaluate a threat.</v>

2812
02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that the threat justified police intervention or that there was</v>

2813
02:05:28.951 --> 02:05:29.784
<v Speaker 1>a threat.</v>

2814
02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:32.100
<v Speaker 1>It just meant that that's how you responded to it.</v>

2815
02:05:32.190 --> 02:05:34.380
<v Speaker 1>And then they spun the victim narrative for Kathy,</v>

2816
02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.960
<v Speaker 1>which was I think reprehensible.</v>

2817
02:05:36.961 --> 02:05:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Given that.</v>

2818
02:05:37.770 --> 02:05:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what Kathy Newman is exactly,</v>

2819
02:05:40.530 --> 02:05:42.000
<v Speaker 1>but she's not a bloody victim.</v>

2820
02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:43.590
<v Speaker 1>She's not powerless.</v>

2821
02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:47.190
<v Speaker 1>She's one of the most powerful women in the United Kingdom and she has a salary</v>

2822
02:05:47.191 --> 02:05:48.870
<v Speaker 1>that's commensurate with that and good,</v>

2823
02:05:49.050 --> 02:05:49.621
<v Speaker 1>good for her.</v>

2824
02:05:49.621 --> 02:05:50.730
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely fine,</v>

2825
02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:53.130
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get to have that and also be a victim.</v>

2826
02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:55.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right way to play the game.</v>

2827
02:05:56.100 --> 02:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>And so then a whole bunch of newspapers laid out the story that poor Kathy was</v>

2828
02:06:01.801 --> 02:06:05.220
<v Speaker 1>being trolled by my legion of all right,</v>

2829
02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:06.450
<v Speaker 1>angry people,</v>

2830
02:06:07.050 --> 02:06:09.090
<v Speaker 1>but then the numbers started to mount,</v>

2831
02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:09.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2832
02:06:09.731 --> 02:06:12.510
<v Speaker 1>an after it was like 4 million people.</v>

2833
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It got the whole troll argument got hard to sustain unless you think there are</v>

2834
02:06:16.531 --> 02:06:17.364
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2835
02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:21.300
<v Speaker 1>well now it's perhaps 30 million people have watched either the whole thing or</v>

2836
02:06:21.570 --> 02:06:22.650
<v Speaker 1>major clips from it.</v>

2837
02:06:22.651 --> 02:06:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's more than that.</v>

2838
02:06:23.611 --> 02:06:27.510
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to sustain the old troll argument when it's 30 million people,</v>

2839
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.830
<v Speaker 1>but it was very.</v>

2840
02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I thought that narrative was going to prevail for a while that you know,</v>

2841
02:06:32.250 --> 02:06:32.431
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2842
02:06:32.431 --> 02:06:36.330
<v Speaker 1>she got victimized and it was all these terrible people that went after her.</v>

2843
02:06:36.331 --> 02:06:37.350
<v Speaker 1>But that collapsed.</v>

2844
02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:38.820
<v Speaker 1>But it's very stressful.</v>

2845
02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:39.893
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2846
02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:42.460
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that I've,</v>

2847
02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I've learned,</v>

2848
02:06:43.220 --> 02:06:47.240
<v Speaker 1>so I've been obsessing about another statement in the New Testament for about</v>

2849
02:06:47.241 --> 02:06:47.931
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>

2850
02:06:47.931 --> 02:06:49.010
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to figure it out,</v>

2851
02:06:49.011 --> 02:06:49.440
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

2852
02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:53.390
<v Speaker 1>it's the statement that you should turn the other cheek and that's a tough one,</v>

2853
02:06:53.391 --> 02:06:53.661
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2854
02:06:53.661 --> 02:06:54.494
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

2855
02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:55.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2856
02:06:55.251 --> 02:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>

2857
02:06:56.121 --> 02:06:57.230
<v Speaker 1>who wants to do that?</v>

2858
02:06:57.380 --> 02:06:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Because you want to explode in righteous anger.</v>

2859
02:06:59.871 --> 02:07:01.610
<v Speaker 1>At least you want to defend yourself.</v>

2860
02:07:01.611 --> 02:07:03.230
<v Speaker 1>You want to do one of those things.</v>

2861
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:05.630
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell does that mean?</v>

2862
02:07:06.230 --> 02:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>And partly what it means is</v>

2863
02:07:12.250 --> 02:07:13.180
<v Speaker 1>if you're attack</v>

2864
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:15.980
<v Speaker 1>and you're innocent,</v>

2865
02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:17.121
<v Speaker 1>and and look,</v>

2866
02:07:17.121 --> 02:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I'm like globally innocent or anything like that,</v>

2867
02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:26.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not guilty of the accusations that are levied at me or at least I not</v>

2868
02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:31.280
<v Speaker 1>guilty in the manner that the accusations would indicate.</v>

2869
02:07:32.930 --> 02:07:37.060
<v Speaker 1>If you're being attacked and you're not guilty of the accusations,</v>

2870
02:07:37.061 --> 02:07:38.560
<v Speaker 1>then the attacks</v>

2871
02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:44.980
<v Speaker 1>say more about the attacker then their intended target.</v>

2872
02:07:46.330 --> 02:07:46.721
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2873
02:07:46.721 --> 02:07:49.750
<v Speaker 1>so far I've been able to withstand the attacks.</v>

2874
02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:54.400
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that is that it said more about the attackers then about</v>

2875
02:07:54.401 --> 02:07:55.234
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

2876
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:56.890
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>

2877
02:07:56.891 --> 02:08:01.891
<v Speaker 1>can I tolerate that because it's still very stressful and</v>

2878
02:08:04.090 --> 02:08:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I very a waiver on that back and forth.</v>

2879
02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:11.700
<v Speaker 1>And then of course the other issue is is that some people in the media of</v>

2880
02:08:11.710 --> 02:08:12.341
<v Speaker 1>pilloried me,</v>

2881
02:08:12.341 --> 02:08:13.540
<v Speaker 1>but many haven't.</v>

2882
02:08:14.010 --> 02:08:14.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2883
02:08:14.341 --> 02:08:18.070
<v Speaker 1>there've been very many thoughtful people that have written thoughtful pieces</v>

2884
02:08:18.071 --> 02:08:18.700
<v Speaker 1>about me.</v>

2885
02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:21.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a Canadian consortium of 200 newspapers,</v>

2886
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.230
<v Speaker 1>the post media group,</v>

2887
02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:24.670
<v Speaker 1>and they came out.</v>

2888
02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:28.810
<v Speaker 1>The entire group came out in favor of my stance in relationship to bill</v>

2889
02:08:28.811 --> 02:08:30.130
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in Canada,</v>

2890
02:08:30.131 --> 02:08:31.570
<v Speaker 1>which was a speech,</v>

2891
02:08:31.620 --> 02:08:35.130
<v Speaker 1>a speech piece of legislation that compelled speech and so</v>

2892
02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:39.030
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2893
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.863
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2894
02:08:40.830 --> 02:08:41.620
<v Speaker 1>so far,</v>

2895
02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:42.900
<v Speaker 1>same with the protests.</v>

2896
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:45.360
<v Speaker 1>When people come out to protest against me.</v>

2897
02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:50.420
<v Speaker 1>The first video that went viral was a protest at the University of Toronto and</v>

2898
02:08:51.150 --> 02:08:54.190
<v Speaker 1>after the protest was over that the pro,</v>

2899
02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:55.770
<v Speaker 1>the anti free speech,</v>

2900
02:08:55.771 --> 02:09:00.771
<v Speaker 1>people at the protests took the microphone away in and blasted white noise and</v>

2901
02:09:01.051 --> 02:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>made it impossible for anyone to speak even though it was an open mic event.</v>

2902
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>So that got broadcast and then about two hours after the event I went down to</v>

2903
02:09:12.031 --> 02:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>talk to the cops.</v>

2904
02:09:12.871 --> 02:09:15.360
<v Speaker 1>To see if anybody had been hurt or anything like that,</v>

2905
02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:17.460
<v Speaker 1>and then on the way back into the university,</v>

2906
02:09:17.461 --> 02:09:22.461
<v Speaker 1>I go to Costco and buy half a dozen like radical types and about 30 of their</v>

2907
02:09:24.121 --> 02:09:28.440
<v Speaker 1>hangers on and then there's a crowd of people that I would say we're probably</v>

2908
02:09:28.441 --> 02:09:33.030
<v Speaker 1>supporting me that that gathered around me and they went after me and videotaped</v>

2909
02:09:33.031 --> 02:09:38.031
<v Speaker 1>all of it on their cell phones and then they posted that and the idea was that</v>

2910
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:40.500
<v Speaker 1>that was going to do me in,</v>

2911
02:09:41.070 --> 02:09:46.070
<v Speaker 1>but what happened was the comments were a 100 to one in favor of what I was say.</v>

2912
02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:51.540
<v Speaker 1>So that was another example where the protests were more damaging to the</v>

2913
02:09:51.541 --> 02:09:53.310
<v Speaker 1>protestors then they were to me,</v>

2914
02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:56.820
<v Speaker 1>and that's been luckily fortunately,</v>

2915
02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:58.680
<v Speaker 1>miraculously all of that,</v>

2916
02:09:59.010 --> 02:10:00.120
<v Speaker 1>a recurrent pattern.</v>

2917
02:10:01.110 --> 02:10:06.110
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is whether or not I can tolerate it and whether my family</v>

2918
02:10:06.901 --> 02:10:07.681
<v Speaker 1>can tolerate it.</v>

2919
02:10:07.681 --> 02:10:08.514
<v Speaker 1>And so far,</v>

2920
02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:09.810
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2921
02:10:09.810 --> 02:10:12.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to do something difficult,</v>

2922
02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>let's say the right amount of controversy isn't zero.</v>

2923
02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:21.210
<v Speaker 1>The question is how much controversy can you handle and how much of the mud</v>

2924
02:10:21.211 --> 02:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>that's thrown will stick.</v>

2925
02:10:22.411 --> 02:10:25.770
<v Speaker 1>And then how much of it deserves to stick all of those things.</v>

2926
02:10:25.771 --> 02:10:28.410
<v Speaker 1>You go to scour your conscience under those circumstances.</v>

2927
02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:29.893
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

2928
02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:34.250
<v Speaker 1>so I've been fortunate.</v>

2929
02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:39.500
<v Speaker 4>It seems like you've taken on this dragon voluntarily.</v>

2930
02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:42.290
<v Speaker 4>It seems like from the beginning you've known that this,</v>

2931
02:10:42.530 --> 02:10:43.071
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2932
02:10:43.071 --> 02:10:43.904
<v Speaker 4>when you</v>

2933
02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:49.040
<v Speaker 4>spoke up against a biddle see 16 in Canada,</v>

2934
02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:52.250
<v Speaker 4>you knew that this might become tough.</v>

2935
02:10:53.150 --> 02:10:58.150
<v Speaker 4>Well Guide taught people to negotiate in my clinical practice for a long time.</v>

2936
02:10:58.580 --> 02:10:58.821
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2937
02:10:58.821 --> 02:11:00.050
<v Speaker 4>I've had lots of clients,</v>

2938
02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:05.410
<v Speaker 4>many of those clients were female and the are the goal in my consulting with</v>

2939
02:11:07.311 --> 02:11:10.670
<v Speaker 4>them was to double or triple their salary within five years.</v>

2940
02:11:11.570 --> 02:11:14.840
<v Speaker 4>And so that wasn't necessarily the only goal.</v>

2941
02:11:14.841 --> 02:11:16.160
<v Speaker 4>We discussed all sorts of goals,</v>

2942
02:11:16.161 --> 02:11:17.390
<v Speaker 4>but that was often one.</v>

2943
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:22.370
<v Speaker 4>And so I was very accustomed to organizing people to negotiate and there's,</v>

2944
02:11:22.371 --> 02:11:23.480
<v Speaker 4>if you want to negotiate,</v>

2945
02:11:23.481 --> 02:11:24.620
<v Speaker 4>there's a couple of rules.</v>

2946
02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:28.520
<v Speaker 4>The first rule is you have to be able to say no.</v>

2947
02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:34.970
<v Speaker 4>And what no means is there isn't anything you can do to me to get me to do that.</v>

2948
02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:36.830
<v Speaker 4>That's what no means.</v>

2949
02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:37.131
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2950
02:11:37.131 --> 02:11:37.821
<v Speaker 4>like you can be.</v>

2951
02:11:37.821 --> 02:11:40.340
<v Speaker 4>You can have different degrees of seriousness about no,</v>

2952
02:11:40.341 --> 02:11:42.410
<v Speaker 4>but if you're going to negotiate with your boss,</v>

2953
02:11:42.411 --> 02:11:44.420
<v Speaker 4>say for a substantial raise,</v>

2954
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:47.810
<v Speaker 4>no means if I don't get it,</v>

2955
02:11:47.811 --> 02:11:48.890
<v Speaker 4>then I will leave.</v>

2956
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:52.010
<v Speaker 4>That's fundamentally and leaving will cost you more than.</v>

2957
02:11:52.190 --> 02:11:53.090
<v Speaker 4>It's not a threat,</v>

2958
02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:53.953
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2959
02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:58.880
<v Speaker 4>It has to be the observation that me leaving will cost you substantially more</v>

2960
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.340
<v Speaker 4>than giving me the rates.</v>

2961
02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.480
<v Speaker 4>You have to be in a position to make that case or you don't win the negotiation.</v>

2962
02:12:05.481 --> 02:12:09.800
<v Speaker 4>And so I always put my clients in a position where if they went and asked for</v>

2963
02:12:09.801 --> 02:12:10.634
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

2964
02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:14.180
<v Speaker 4>they were in a position to win because we didn't go and ask before that.</v>

2965
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:17.810
<v Speaker 4>So when I made the video criticizing bill c 16,</v>

2966
02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:21.680
<v Speaker 4>I thought I'm not abiding by this damn piece of legislation.</v>

2967
02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:22.813
<v Speaker 4>And then I thought,</v>

2968
02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:23.091
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2969
02:12:23.091 --> 02:12:25.040
<v Speaker 4>what does it mean that I'm not?</v>

2970
02:12:25.730 --> 02:12:26.563
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

2971
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:28.041
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2972
02:12:28.041 --> 02:12:29.720
<v Speaker 4>I had multiple sources of income.</v>

2973
02:12:29.721 --> 02:12:30.620
<v Speaker 4>So I was reading.</v>

2974
02:12:30.890 --> 02:12:35.120
<v Speaker 4>I was reasonably positioned to tolerate a fair bit of push back.</v>

2975
02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:35.901
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2976
02:12:35.901 --> 02:12:37.030
<v Speaker 4>I could've gotten wiped out.</v>

2977
02:12:37.031 --> 02:12:38.480
<v Speaker 4>You had things gone sideways,</v>

2978
02:12:38.481 --> 02:12:42.770
<v Speaker 4>but it would have been difficult to take me out completely and I thought</v>

2979
02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:47.540
<v Speaker 4>there's no way I'm abiding by this piece of legislation.</v>

2980
02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:48.590
<v Speaker 4>I was willing,</v>

2981
02:12:48.590 --> 02:12:53.090
<v Speaker 4>I thought through the negative consequences now I didn't of course think that</v>

2982
02:12:53.091 --> 02:12:56.960
<v Speaker 4>any of this would happen because this is just completely preposterous and no one</v>

2983
02:12:56.961 --> 02:12:58.370
<v Speaker 4>could have possibly foreseen it,</v>

2984
02:12:58.371 --> 02:12:59.204
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

2985
02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:03.890
<v Speaker 4>So I would say there were certain things I faced in doing that,</v>

2986
02:13:03.891 --> 02:13:08.891
<v Speaker 4>but I couldn't have foreseen the absolutely explosive consequences.</v>

2987
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:11.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm not unhappy that I did it.</v>

2988
02:13:11.781 --> 02:13:12.680
<v Speaker 4>I would do it again.</v>

2989
02:13:13.190 --> 02:13:14.300
<v Speaker 4>I am still doing it.</v>

2990
02:13:14.301 --> 02:13:15.134
<v Speaker 4>I suppose.</v>

2991
02:13:15.530 --> 02:13:16.363
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2992
02:13:18.690 --> 02:13:19.310
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2993
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:22.790
<v Speaker 4>which of your 12 rules do you break most often?</v>

2994
02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I could probably still be better at listening to people I like.</v>

2995
02:13:37.381 --> 02:13:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I have these,</v>

2996
02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:39.333
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2997
02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:40.770
<v Speaker 1>I do interviews with people.</v>

2998
02:13:40.771 --> 02:13:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I call them discussions because they're not really interviews.</v>

2999
02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Probably they're not interviews because I talked too much,</v>

3000
02:13:47.250 --> 02:13:49.020
<v Speaker 1>so I had to call them discussions.</v>

3001
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:54.330
<v Speaker 1>But I would say the most common criticism of those discussions is that I'm in,</v>

3002
02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I interrupt the people that I'm discussing things with and until the</v>

3003
02:13:59.671 --> 02:14:02.910
<v Speaker 1>conversation probably a little bit more towards me,</v>

3004
02:14:03.150 --> 02:14:07.530
<v Speaker 1>my thinking then there is now part of that I think is my natural tendency</v>

3005
02:14:07.531 --> 02:14:11.940
<v Speaker 1>towards like I've always talked a lot ever since I was like three,</v>

3006
02:14:12.510 --> 02:14:13.343
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

3007
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:15.150
<v Speaker 1>continually.</v>

3008
02:14:15.450 --> 02:14:16.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

3009
02:14:16.110 --> 02:14:16.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm there,</v>

3010
02:14:16.650 --> 02:14:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm verbally fluent,</v>

3011
02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:18.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3012
02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:20.700
<v Speaker 1>it's part of my nature and extroverted.</v>

3013
02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:22.433
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

3014
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:26.080
<v Speaker 1>you can always get better at listening,</v>

3015
02:14:26.620 --> 02:14:27.453
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3016
02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:29.430
<v Speaker 1>And so I can listen and,</v>

3017
02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:31.810
<v Speaker 1>and I practiced that because I'm a therapist.</v>

3018
02:14:31.811 --> 02:14:33.160
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that's probably the rule.</v>

3019
02:14:33.161 --> 02:14:34.420
<v Speaker 1>I break that rule nine,</v>

3020
02:14:34.421 --> 02:14:37.120
<v Speaker 1>like assume that the person you're listening to know something you don't.</v>

3021
02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:42.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm not as good at that yet as I could be because I wouldn't get that</v>

3022
02:14:44.170 --> 02:14:45.700
<v Speaker 1>criticism if I was like,</v>

3023
02:14:45.701 --> 02:14:47.170
<v Speaker 1>it's not every comment or anything.</v>

3024
02:14:47.171 --> 02:14:50.230
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like every 20th comment or every 30th comment,</v>

3025
02:14:50.231 --> 02:14:51.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

3026
02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:51.791
<v Speaker 1>But it's still,</v>

3027
02:14:51.791 --> 02:14:52.690
<v Speaker 1>it's consistent.</v>

3028
02:14:52.691 --> 02:14:54.400
<v Speaker 1>And so every time I have an interview I think,</v>

3029
02:14:54.401 --> 02:14:54.671
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3030
02:14:54.671 --> 02:14:56.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to shut up a little bit more.</v>

3031
02:14:57.130 --> 02:15:00.490
<v Speaker 1>But then I get excited about what's happening and you know,</v>

3032
02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:02.950
<v Speaker 1>and talk too much.</v>

3033
02:15:08.190 --> 02:15:09.770
<v Speaker 1>One thing related to that,</v>

3034
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:15.140
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you seem to go off on a tangent.</v>

3035
02:15:15.141 --> 02:15:16.850
<v Speaker 1>When you're discussing something,</v>

3036
02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:18.770
<v Speaker 1>you go into a,</v>

3037
02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:19.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3038
02:15:19.250 --> 02:15:20.900
<v Speaker 1>something related to it,</v>

3039
02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:24.440
<v Speaker 1>then you come back to a greater structure of things.</v>

3040
02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:25.533
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3041
02:15:25.690 --> 02:15:30.690
<v Speaker 1>do you have you laid all this out before you say it or do you just go from one</v>

3042
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:36.560
<v Speaker 1>topic to another and they somehow relate together and become whole?</v>

3043
02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3044
02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:38.090
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

3045
02:15:38.090 --> 02:15:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Both.</v>

3046
02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3047
02:15:39.170 --> 02:15:42.080
<v Speaker 1>But so before I do a talk,</v>

3048
02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:43.093
<v Speaker 1>like I have to,</v>

3049
02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I think about the talk all day before I do it,</v>

3050
02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:47.150
<v Speaker 1>like not 100 percent of the time,</v>

3051
02:15:47.151 --> 02:15:47.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

3052
02:15:47.530 --> 02:15:52.340
<v Speaker 1>it's in my mind all the time and what I'm trying to get as the basic narrative</v>

3053
02:15:52.730 --> 02:15:55.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's something you can only use a metaphor to describe it.</v>

3054
02:15:55.611 --> 02:16:00.611
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you wanted to cross a swamp and there were stones under the surface.</v>

3055
02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:04.640
<v Speaker 1>You need to know where the stones are to get from one side of the swamp to the</v>

3056
02:16:04.641 --> 02:16:05.240
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

3057
02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:07.310
<v Speaker 1>And so then that's what I do in my imagination,</v>

3058
02:16:07.311 --> 02:16:07.581
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3059
02:16:07.581 --> 02:16:07.821
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3060
02:16:07.821 --> 02:16:12.821
<v Speaker 1>well there's this area I have to traverse and there's stepping stones along the</v>

3061
02:16:13.221 --> 02:16:13.820
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

3062
02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I need to know where they're located.</v>

3063
02:16:16.220 --> 02:16:19.520
<v Speaker 1>And so that might be like 12 points or something like that.</v>

3064
02:16:19.850 --> 02:16:21.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the rough path.</v>

3065
02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:26.620
<v Speaker 1>And then I have a whole corpus of stories that fit each of those points and then</v>

3066
02:16:29.291 --> 02:16:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I can choose how I'm going to weave those together.</v>

3067
02:16:32.170 --> 02:16:34.220
<v Speaker 1>But I have to remember where I'm going.</v>

3068
02:16:34.630 --> 02:16:35.111
<v Speaker 1>If I'm.</v>

3069
02:16:35.111 --> 02:16:35.944
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3070
02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:38.170
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm healthy and functioning properly,</v>

3071
02:16:38.171 --> 02:16:41.860
<v Speaker 1>then I can go way out on a tangent and I can still remember,</v>

3072
02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:42.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

3073
02:16:42.671 --> 02:16:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I have to tie that back to this point and move to the next step.</v>

3074
02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:47.193
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

3075
02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3076
02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like jazz improvisation essentially,</v>

3077
02:16:50.771 --> 02:16:51.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3078
02:16:51.011 --> 02:16:52.660
<v Speaker 1>you have the melody and it,</v>

3079
02:16:52.661 --> 02:16:56.920
<v Speaker 1>it has to organize the melody has to organize all the improvisation.</v>

3080
02:16:57.310 --> 02:17:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And then I have all these stories that I know,</v>

3081
02:17:00.850 --> 02:17:01.630
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

3082
02:17:01.630 --> 02:17:06.630
<v Speaker 1>every time I tell this story I try to vary it so that it brings in something I</v>

3083
02:17:06.671 --> 02:17:07.720
<v Speaker 1>haven't brought in before.</v>

3084
02:17:07.721 --> 02:17:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Integrate something,</v>

3085
02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:09.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3086
02:17:09.491 --> 02:17:11.710
<v Speaker 1>like what are the things I was trying to do tonight,</v>

3087
02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:16.300
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to figure out for a long time is how to integrate the idea of</v>

3088
02:17:16.301 --> 02:17:21.301
<v Speaker 1>the good player of games with the idea of voluntarily shouldering you're the</v>

3089
02:17:22.270 --> 02:17:23.530
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe of life.</v>

3090
02:17:23.710 --> 02:17:25.510
<v Speaker 1>I know those are the same thing,</v>

3091
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:30.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's not obvious why and I'm still not completely obvious to me,</v>

3092
02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:35.380
<v Speaker 1>but I know that the connection exists and I got a fair bit of fairways tonight</v>

3093
02:17:35.381 --> 02:17:39.070
<v Speaker 1>farther than I had at stacking those concepts on top of each other.</v>

3094
02:17:39.370 --> 02:17:43.630
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing I'm always trying to do is to take each of these sets of</v>

3095
02:17:43.631 --> 02:17:47.230
<v Speaker 1>ideas and to weave them together more tightly,</v>

3096
02:17:47.650 --> 02:17:50.980
<v Speaker 1>but also to push them further in their development.</v>

3097
02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:52.350
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

3098
02:17:52.350 --> 02:17:54.310
<v Speaker 1>And you've been doing that on this tour.</v>

3099
02:17:54.490 --> 02:17:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Have you been developing your ideas?</v>

3100
02:17:58.450 --> 02:17:58.691
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

3101
02:17:58.691 --> 02:17:59.524
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>

3102
02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:00.281
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

3103
02:18:00.281 --> 02:18:00.760
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

3104
02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:03.250
<v Speaker 1>You can't give an effective lecture without.</v>

3105
02:18:03.910 --> 02:18:04.743
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

3106
02:18:06.730 --> 02:18:08.920
<v Speaker 1>you don't deliver a talk to an audience.</v>

3107
02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:10.571
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3108
02:18:10.571 --> 02:18:13.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not app talk second,</v>

3109
02:18:13.511 --> 02:18:14.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't deliver it.</v>

3110
02:18:15.490 --> 02:18:15.881
<v Speaker 1>Third,</v>

3111
02:18:15.881 --> 02:18:18.550
<v Speaker 1>it isn't an audience like all of that's wrong.</v>

3112
02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:25.140
<v Speaker 1>You talk to individuals in the audience one at a time and they're representative</v>

3113
02:18:25.841 --> 02:18:26.381
<v Speaker 1>of the whole,</v>

3114
02:18:26.381 --> 02:18:28.090
<v Speaker 1>but you're not talking to the audience.</v>

3115
02:18:28.091 --> 02:18:29.590
<v Speaker 1>If you're afraid of public speaking,</v>

3116
02:18:29.591 --> 02:18:29.871
<v Speaker 1>it's [inaudible].</v>

3117
02:18:29.871 --> 02:18:31.120
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to the audience.</v>

3118
02:18:31.121 --> 02:18:31.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3119
02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:32.291
<v Speaker 1>forget about that.</v>

3120
02:18:32.291 --> 02:18:33.280
<v Speaker 1>You just talked to people.</v>

3121
02:18:33.460 --> 02:18:34.420
<v Speaker 1>You know how to do that,</v>

3122
02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:40.680
<v Speaker 1>and then you're not delivering a talk because then it's a canned product.</v>

3123
02:18:41.711 --> 02:18:44.830
<v Speaker 1>You muscle just hand people pieces of paper that they could read.</v>

3124
02:18:45.550 --> 02:18:46.450
<v Speaker 1>It's more efficient.</v>

3125
02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Why not do that?</v>

3126
02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:53.820
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing if you address people properly is that you involve them in the</v>

3127
02:18:56.171 --> 02:19:01.171
<v Speaker 1>process of furthering exploration of important concepts and you think,</v>

3128
02:19:01.691 --> 02:19:01.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3129
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.770
<v Speaker 1>how can you do that?</v>

3130
02:19:02.770 --> 02:19:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Because they're sitting there passively.</v>

3131
02:19:04.751 --> 02:19:05.584
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3132
02:19:05.650 --> 02:19:05.831
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3133
02:19:05.831 --> 02:19:06.790
<v Speaker 1>you're not passive.</v>

3134
02:19:07.550 --> 02:19:08.710
<v Speaker 1>You're not verbal,</v>

3135
02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:10.780
<v Speaker 1>but when you're not passive,</v>

3136
02:19:10.781 --> 02:19:11.740
<v Speaker 1>like I listened,</v>

3137
02:19:12.370 --> 02:19:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I listened to whether or not everyone's rustling around.</v>

3138
02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:16.750
<v Speaker 1>If you're rustling around,</v>

3139
02:19:16.751 --> 02:19:20.110
<v Speaker 1>then I'm not balancing chaos in order to properly.</v>

3140
02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:21.640
<v Speaker 1>You're not gripped.</v>

3141
02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:23.740
<v Speaker 1>If you're.</v>

3142
02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:25.420
<v Speaker 1>If I can hear noise in the audience,</v>

3143
02:19:25.421 --> 02:19:26.254
<v Speaker 1>it's not right.</v>

3144
02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I watched one by one and I see sometimes they're shaking their head like this.</v>

3145
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're nodding.</v>

3146
02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they look confused.</v>

3147
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:35.930
<v Speaker 1>If if people look confused,</v>

3148
02:19:35.931 --> 02:19:36.171
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3149
02:19:36.171 --> 02:19:36.321
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3150
02:19:36.321 --> 02:19:37.430
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got that right.</v>

3151
02:19:37.431 --> 02:19:40.100
<v Speaker 1>I have to be watching people and seeing that they're understanding,</v>

3152
02:19:40.101 --> 02:19:43.850
<v Speaker 1>they're following along and that indication that they're following along helps</v>

3153
02:19:43.851 --> 02:19:45.620
<v Speaker 1>me figure out if I'm in the right place,</v>

3154
02:19:45.650 --> 02:19:50.650
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a dynamic that goes along with it and so all of that,</v>

3155
02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:53.900
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you're doing if you engage the audience properly,</v>

3156
02:19:53.901 --> 02:19:57.200
<v Speaker 1>is you shouldn't be talking about things you don't know enough about to talk</v>

3157
02:19:57.201 --> 02:19:57.830
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3158
02:19:57.830 --> 02:19:59.090
<v Speaker 1>So if you have to read your notes,</v>

3159
02:19:59.091 --> 02:19:59.924
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3160
02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:00.411
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

3161
02:20:00.411 --> 02:20:03.110
<v Speaker 1>you don't know enough to talk about that because you need notes.</v>

3162
02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:03.651
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

3163
02:20:03.651 --> 02:20:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Maybe when you're first starting to talk about something,</v>

3164
02:20:05.601 --> 02:20:06.231
<v Speaker 1>you need notes,</v>

3165
02:20:06.231 --> 02:20:08.090
<v Speaker 1>but if you need notes,</v>

3166
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:09.560
<v Speaker 1>you haven't prepared enough.</v>

3167
02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:12.560
<v Speaker 1>You should know like 10 times as much about the topic.</v>

3168
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Then you're going to talk about in the talk.</v>

3169
02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:15.561
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

3170
02:20:15.561 --> 02:20:16.400
<v Speaker 1>who the hell are you?</v>

3171
02:20:17.090 --> 02:20:18.140
<v Speaker 1>And so while right,</v>

3172
02:20:18.141 --> 02:20:18.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're.</v>

3173
02:20:18.601 --> 02:20:19.850
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be the authority,</v>

3174
02:20:19.851 --> 02:20:24.851
<v Speaker 1>so you need to know these things and so and then knowing these things,</v>

3175
02:20:25.971 --> 02:20:29.300
<v Speaker 1>you want to stretch them further because when you're.</v>

3176
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:32.930
<v Speaker 1>This is a theater and lecture theater.</v>

3177
02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Theater is drama,</v>

3178
02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:36.860
<v Speaker 1>so why is it a lecture?</v>

3179
02:20:36.861 --> 02:20:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Theater?</v>

3180
02:20:37.610 --> 02:20:39.170
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] lecture is drama.</v>

3181
02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:40.850
<v Speaker 1>What's the drama?</v>

3182
02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Drama delivering a talk.</v>

3183
02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:44.713
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3184
02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:46.350
<v Speaker 1>there's no drama in that.</v>

3185
02:20:46.351 --> 02:20:47.810
<v Speaker 1>A tape recorder can do that.</v>

3186
02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:53.770
<v Speaker 1>The drama is to engage with the ideas actively in real time and to discover with</v>

3187
02:20:55.251 --> 02:21:00.140
<v Speaker 1>the audience what the consequences and that's what makes a novel great.</v>

3188
02:21:00.140 --> 02:21:00.741
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

3189
02:21:00.741 --> 02:21:04.190
<v Speaker 1>the reason that Dostoyevsky novel is great is because Dostoevsky did not know</v>

3190
02:21:04.191 --> 02:21:05.600
<v Speaker 1>where he was going when he started.</v>

3191
02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:07.400
<v Speaker 1>He had problems,</v>

3192
02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:07.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3193
02:21:07.761 --> 02:21:09.650
<v Speaker 1>like crime and punishment is a great example.</v>

3194
02:21:09.651 --> 02:21:12.470
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to explore the relationship between crime and punishment.</v>

3195
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:13.580
<v Speaker 1>He didn't think,</v>

3196
02:21:14.060 --> 02:21:14.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3197
02:21:14.271 --> 02:21:15.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm a postmodern,</v>

3198
02:21:15.171 --> 02:21:16.040
<v Speaker 1>neo marxists tonight.</v>

3199
02:21:16.041 --> 02:21:19.100
<v Speaker 1>I have a solution to the problem of crime and punishment and I'm going to write</v>

3200
02:21:19.101 --> 02:21:22.160
<v Speaker 1>a novel describing what the right solution is.</v>

3201
02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:23.031
<v Speaker 1>He thought,</v>

3202
02:21:23.031 --> 02:21:23.880
<v Speaker 1>here's a problem,</v>

3203
02:21:23.881 --> 02:21:24.121
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3204
02:21:24.121 --> 02:21:25.310
<v Speaker 1>This is a major problem.</v>

3205
02:21:25.490 --> 02:21:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to divide myself into 10 characters and I'm going to have a war and</v>

3206
02:21:30.261 --> 02:21:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to see what prevails,</v>

3207
02:21:32.540 --> 02:21:34.460
<v Speaker 1>and he takes you along on that voyage and it's.</v>

3208
02:21:34.970 --> 02:21:37.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes Dostoevsky different than Ayn rand.</v>

3209
02:21:38.210 --> 02:21:39.043
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

3210
02:21:39.140 --> 02:21:43.430
<v Speaker 1>because Ayn rand already knew who the good guys and the bad guys were and maybe</v>

3211
02:21:43.431 --> 02:21:45.050
<v Speaker 1>she was right and maybe she wasn't.</v>

3212
02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter what matters is that what she did wasn't literature.</v>

3213
02:21:49.700 --> 02:21:51.920
<v Speaker 1>It was just sophisticated propaganda,</v>

3214
02:21:52.350 --> 02:21:52.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3215
02:21:52.610 --> 02:21:53.180
<v Speaker 1>like it,</v>

3216
02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:56.150
<v Speaker 1>it taps into literature upon occasion,</v>

3217
02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:57.013
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3218
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:58.580
<v Speaker 1>but she knew where she was going.</v>

3219
02:21:58.581 --> 02:22:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Dusky Dostoevsky,</v>

3220
02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:05.030
<v Speaker 1>he discovered it along the way and so he takes you along on the journey and</v>

3221
02:22:05.031 --> 02:22:08.180
<v Speaker 1>that's any great artists does that takes you along in the journey.</v>

3222
02:22:08.420 --> 02:22:12.200
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so rare vivifying to encounter anything that's genuinely</v>

3223
02:22:12.201 --> 02:22:17.201
<v Speaker 1>artistic is because you're along for the conflict between chaos and order and</v>

3224
02:22:17.871 --> 02:22:21.890
<v Speaker 1>that's way more interesting than having a talk delivered to you.</v>

3225
02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that that journey might lead to a bad.</v>

3226
02:22:25.350 --> 02:22:30.350
<v Speaker 1>In some cases you've spoken of Hitler when he was speaking to audiences and he</v>

3227
02:22:30.481 --> 02:22:35.481
<v Speaker 1>was listening to the audiences and that and he started to find what really</v>

3228
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:37.770
<v Speaker 1>engaged them and made them,</v>

3229
02:22:38.350 --> 02:22:39.183
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3230
02:22:39.420 --> 02:22:39.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3231
02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:40.673
<v Speaker 1>excited.</v>

3232
02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:41.833
<v Speaker 1>He was saying,</v>

3233
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:46.230
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that you might get it wrong because of that dynamic?</v>

3234
02:22:46.410 --> 02:22:46.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3235
02:22:46.651 --> 02:22:47.291
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

3236
02:22:47.291 --> 02:22:51.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's a terrible threat to get it wrong because you know,</v>

3237
02:22:52.650 --> 02:22:53.260
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3238
02:22:53.260 --> 02:22:54.450
<v Speaker 1>in rule three,</v>

3239
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:56.940
<v Speaker 1>make friends with the people who want the best for you.</v>

3240
02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:01.020
<v Speaker 1>There are other rules that were associated with that that I didn't write about.</v>

3241
02:23:01.050 --> 02:23:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Like make friends with people with own.</v>

3242
02:23:04.930 --> 02:23:05.250
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3243
02:23:05.250 --> 02:23:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

3244
02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Be Very careful with who.</v>

3245
02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Be Very careful about who you share good news with.</v>

3246
02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:16.640
<v Speaker 1>That was one rule and another rule was be very careful about whom you share bad</v>

3247
02:23:16.741 --> 02:23:17.574
<v Speaker 1>news with.</v>

3248
02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:20.520
<v Speaker 1>And those are sort of hallmarks of friendship.</v>

3249
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:21.451
<v Speaker 1>If you have friends,</v>

3250
02:23:21.451 --> 02:23:22.680
<v Speaker 1>you can tell good news too.</v>

3251
02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:25.350
<v Speaker 1>You know what it's like to tell good news to someone that you shouldn't tell.</v>

3252
02:23:25.351 --> 02:23:26.184
<v Speaker 1>Good news too.</v>

3253
02:23:26.580 --> 02:23:30.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're not happy about your good news.</v>

3254
02:23:30.220 --> 02:23:32.760
<v Speaker 1>There are bitter about it and they'll show it in some way.</v>

3255
02:23:32.761 --> 02:23:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'll trump your good news or they won't listen.</v>

3256
02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Or they'll bring up another topic or they're secretly angry or whatever.</v>

3257
02:23:38.881 --> 02:23:42.270
<v Speaker 1>You walk away from sharing the good news thinking you should have kept your damn</v>

3258
02:23:42.271 --> 02:23:44.580
<v Speaker 1>mouth shut and that's not a good sign.</v>

3259
02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:45.773
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

3260
02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:48.990
<v Speaker 1>But some people you can tell good news too and they'll be happy because they</v>

3261
02:23:48.991 --> 02:23:51.840
<v Speaker 1>have enough sense to know that life's to catastrophe.</v>

3262
02:23:51.841 --> 02:23:53.130
<v Speaker 1>And if something good happened to you,</v>

3263
02:23:53.131 --> 02:23:53.821
<v Speaker 1>then hooray.</v>

3264
02:23:53.821 --> 02:23:54.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3265
02:23:54.121 --> 02:23:57.630
<v Speaker 1>because and then bad news is the same thing.</v>

3266
02:23:57.631 --> 02:24:00.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you tell bad news to someone,</v>

3267
02:24:00.930 --> 02:24:02.790
<v Speaker 1>they need to let you suffer,</v>

3268
02:24:03.330 --> 02:24:03.601
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3269
02:24:03.601 --> 02:24:06.660
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't make you feel better quick because they're upset because you're</v>

3270
02:24:06.661 --> 02:24:07.080
<v Speaker 1>upset,</v>

3271
02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:07.590
<v Speaker 1>none of that.</v>

3272
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:08.670
<v Speaker 1>They just have to take it.</v>

3273
02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:09.713
<v Speaker 1>And that's hard.</v>

3274
02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:11.370
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

3275
02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:15.240
<v Speaker 1>I think I forgot what the hell the question was here.</v>

3276
02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting tired so I'm losing my ability to go back</v>

3277
02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:25.680
<v Speaker 1>where you may get it wrong when you're interacting with the audience.</v>

3278
02:24:25.740 --> 02:24:26.573
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3279
02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:28.653
<v Speaker 3>Look</v>

3280
02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:33.730
<v Speaker 1>what Hitler did was this far as I can tell,</v>

3281
02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:35.500
<v Speaker 1>and I've talked to politicians who've,</v>

3282
02:24:35.570 --> 02:24:38.470
<v Speaker 1>who've built grassroots political parties about how they did it too.</v>

3283
02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:39.903
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

3284
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:43.300
<v Speaker 1>the audience talks to you when you,</v>

3285
02:24:43.510 --> 02:24:44.590
<v Speaker 1>when you deliver,</v>

3286
02:24:44.770 --> 02:24:45.190
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

3287
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.850
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

3288
02:24:45.850 --> 02:24:50.380
<v Speaker 1>when you speak publicly and they talk to you with their emotional reactions,</v>

3289
02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:56.340
<v Speaker 1>and then you can learn how to say what produces a given emotional reaction,</v>

3290
02:24:57.730 --> 02:24:59.260
<v Speaker 1>especially if that's what you want.</v>

3291
02:24:59.261 --> 02:24:59.820
<v Speaker 1>If you want,</v>

3292
02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:00.041
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3293
02:25:00.041 --> 02:25:01.900
<v Speaker 1>control over the crowd or maybe you want,</v>

3294
02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:05.470
<v Speaker 1>you want to harness the anger of the crowd.</v>

3295
02:25:05.471 --> 02:25:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's say [inaudible] your own motivations.</v>

3296
02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:10.210
<v Speaker 1>What were Hitler's motivations?</v>

3297
02:25:10.900 --> 02:25:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Here's the psychoanalytic answer.</v>

3298
02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:15.310
<v Speaker 1>If you cannot understand the motivations,</v>

3299
02:25:15.430 --> 02:25:18.130
<v Speaker 1>look at the consequences and infer the motivation.</v>

3300
02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:20.140
<v Speaker 1>What's the consequence?</v>

3301
02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Hitler blows his brains out in a bunker under Berlin when Europe is on fire.</v>

3302
02:25:26.170 --> 02:25:29.680
<v Speaker 1>What was the motivation as suicidal apocalypse?</v>

3303
02:25:30.850 --> 02:25:31.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the motivation.</v>

3304
02:25:32.530 --> 02:25:34.690
<v Speaker 1>How do you generate as suicidal apocalypse?</v>

3305
02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:35.760
<v Speaker 1>You a mad it.</v>

3306
02:25:36.430 --> 02:25:38.830
<v Speaker 1>How do you get the crowd to go along?</v>

3307
02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:42.640
<v Speaker 1>You speak in that manner and you watch for the emotional response and when you</v>

3308
02:25:42.641 --> 02:25:44.440
<v Speaker 1>get the anger that you're after,</v>

3309
02:25:44.650 --> 02:25:49.420
<v Speaker 1>you facilitate it and you let your imagination dwell on that and you become a</v>

3310
02:25:49.421 --> 02:25:54.421
<v Speaker 1>master of that and that's what Hitler did and it wasn't like the Germans weren't</v>

3311
02:25:54.491 --> 02:25:56.560
<v Speaker 1>angry and they had their reasons.</v>

3312
02:25:56.980 --> 02:25:58.990
<v Speaker 1>World War One was brutal.</v>

3313
02:25:59.770 --> 02:26:03.970
<v Speaker 1>They lost the Versailles treaty was a catastrophe in the 19 twenties.</v>

3314
02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Every decent hardworking German lost all of their savings in hyperinflation and</v>

3315
02:26:11.141 --> 02:26:14.530
<v Speaker 1>the entire country was threatened by a radical leftist revolution.</v>

3316
02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:19.510
<v Speaker 1>It was rough and people were not happy and many of them had been terribly</v>

3317
02:26:19.511 --> 02:26:21.040
<v Speaker 1>brutalized by world war one,</v>

3318
02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:25.840
<v Speaker 1>so there was no shortage of anger to capitalize on and Hitler was just the guy</v>

3319
02:26:26.050 --> 02:26:27.190
<v Speaker 1>annoyed as he was,</v>

3320
02:26:27.191 --> 02:26:28.024
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3321
02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:32.230
<v Speaker 1>that he was rejected from art school three times despite despite having a fair</v>

3322
02:26:32.231 --> 02:26:33.430
<v Speaker 1>bit of artistic talent.</v>

3323
02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:38.940
<v Speaker 1>He had his reasons for resentment and anger and hatred and that's just a tiny</v>

3324
02:26:40.211 --> 02:26:41.044
<v Speaker 1>part of it.</v>

3325
02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:41.501
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3326
02:26:41.501 --> 02:26:43.150
<v Speaker 1>These things can go terribly wrong.</v>

3327
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:44.620
<v Speaker 1>It depends,</v>

3328
02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:46.570
<v Speaker 1>at least in part on what you're aiming at.</v>

3329
02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:49.930
<v Speaker 1>People ask me what I'm aiming at and I would say,</v>

3330
02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean who knows,</v>

3331
02:26:51.431 --> 02:26:51.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3332
02:26:51.731 --> 02:26:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't know yourself and I don't know myself not to the final depths,</v>

3333
02:26:57.310 --> 02:26:59.920
<v Speaker 1>but I think what I'm aiming at,</v>

3334
02:27:01.180 --> 02:27:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping is exactly what I say I'm aiming at.</v>

3335
02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:09.840
<v Speaker 1>I hope that what I'm aiming at is to tell people stories</v>

3336
02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:17.880
<v Speaker 1>and provide them with clinical intervention in information that's derived from</v>

3337
02:27:18.101 --> 02:27:23.101
<v Speaker 1>the best literature and science that I know so that they can be fortified in</v>

3338
02:27:23.981 --> 02:27:28.660
<v Speaker 1>their ability to contend with tragedy and malevolence and the reason that I'm</v>

3339
02:27:28.661 --> 02:27:29.494
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

3340
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:32.380
<v Speaker 1>As far as I'm concerned is because when I wrote my first book,</v>

3341
02:27:32.381 --> 02:27:33.550
<v Speaker 1>which was maps of meaning,</v>

3342
02:27:34.090 --> 02:27:36.310
<v Speaker 1>the audio version of which is out next week,</v>

3343
02:27:36.311 --> 02:27:37.144
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3344
02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it'll be easier to understand because it's red and the intonation is all</v>

3345
02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:43.073
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3346
02:27:43.330 --> 02:27:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I concluded after studying the psychological dynamics of the Cold War,</v>

3347
02:27:49.870 --> 02:27:54.870
<v Speaker 1>that the only proper medication to tyrannical collectivism was the sovereignty</v>

3348
02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:00.580
<v Speaker 1>of the individual and that as a consequence,</v>

3349
02:28:00.610 --> 02:28:03.190
<v Speaker 1>the sovereign individual needed to be strengthened.</v>

3350
02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:07.840
<v Speaker 1>That that was the path forward was least harm and most potential good.</v>

3351
02:28:08.350 --> 02:28:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what I'm doing my evidence for that is that I've been doing</v>

3352
02:28:13.361 --> 02:28:14.680
<v Speaker 1>it for 30 years.</v>

3353
02:28:15.250 --> 02:28:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I taught courses based on that at Harvard and at the University of Toronto</v>

3354
02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:20.740
<v Speaker 1>consistently.</v>

3355
02:28:21.470 --> 02:28:25.880
<v Speaker 1>The lectures were made into a television program in Toronto that was popular.</v>

3356
02:28:26.210 --> 02:28:29.840
<v Speaker 1>The lecturers became explosively popular online.</v>

3357
02:28:30.050 --> 02:28:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Everybody can see what I'm saying as far as I can tell and apart from the hip</v>

3358
02:28:35.241 --> 02:28:35.930
<v Speaker 1>pieces,</v>

3359
02:28:35.930 --> 02:28:38.240
<v Speaker 1>which are perhaps valid criticisms,</v>

3360
02:28:38.241 --> 02:28:39.470
<v Speaker 1>although I don't believe so.</v>

3361
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:40.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3362
02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:45.920
<v Speaker 1>the overwhelming evidence as far as I can tell is that it's having a positive</v>

3363
02:28:45.921 --> 02:28:46.754
<v Speaker 1>consequence.</v>

3364
02:28:47.180 --> 02:28:47.391
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3365
02:28:47.391 --> 02:28:48.224
<v Speaker 1>and I'm hoping,</v>

3366
02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:51.050
<v Speaker 1>and I have people watching me and criticizing me,</v>

3367
02:28:51.051 --> 02:28:52.700
<v Speaker 1>like friends of mine in my family,</v>

3368
02:28:52.850 --> 02:28:55.580
<v Speaker 1>trying to make sure that this all works and so hopefully</v>

3369
02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing something that isn't good.</v>

3370
02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:02.563
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

3371
02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:03.553
<v Speaker 1>But yes.</v>

3372
02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:11.380
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>

3373
02:29:13.700 --> 02:29:14.290
<v Speaker 1>The last,</v>

3374
02:29:14.290 --> 02:29:15.400
<v Speaker 1>last question,</v>

3375
02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:18.580
<v Speaker 1>what did you think of the last star wars movie?</v>

3376
02:29:23.650 --> 02:29:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I've gone,</v>

3377
02:29:24.220 --> 02:29:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I saw the last star wars movie,</v>

3378
02:29:26.890 --> 02:29:29.350
<v Speaker 1>but I saw one of the last.</v>

3379
02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I've probably seen three of the last five star wars movies I would say,</v>

3380
02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:37.000
<v Speaker 1>and I thought they were all the same movie as the First Star Wars movie.</v>

3381
02:29:37.690 --> 02:29:38.523
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3382
02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:39.513
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3383
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:40.990
<v Speaker 1>so I haven't,</v>

3384
02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:43.300
<v Speaker 1>they haven't been my cup of tea.</v>

3385
02:29:43.301 --> 02:29:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I'm having said that,</v>

3386
02:29:46.751 --> 02:29:47.740
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious that,</v>

3387
02:29:48.450 --> 02:29:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3388
02:29:48.730 --> 02:29:49.900
<v Speaker 1>the superhero movies,</v>

3389
02:29:49.901 --> 02:29:51.070
<v Speaker 1>the star wars movies,</v>

3390
02:29:51.071 --> 02:29:52.240
<v Speaker 1>the star trek movies,</v>

3391
02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:57.540
<v Speaker 1>the fantastic success that marvel in particular has had with their Superhero</v>

3392
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Pantheon.</v>

3393
02:29:58.380 --> 02:30:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Like those are the most expensive artifacts that people make a,</v>

3394
02:30:00.900 --> 02:30:01.541
<v Speaker 1>those movies.</v>

3395
02:30:01.541 --> 02:30:02.860
<v Speaker 1>That's something to really think about.</v>

3396
02:30:02.861 --> 02:30:03.131
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3397
02:30:03.131 --> 02:30:05.290
<v Speaker 1>people put $200,000,000 into a movie like that.</v>

3398
02:30:05.350 --> 02:30:07.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not the most expensive thing we make,</v>

3399
02:30:07.211 --> 02:30:08.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's bloody well up there.</v>

3400
02:30:08.621 --> 02:30:09.454
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you,</v>

3401
02:30:09.660 --> 02:30:12.370
<v Speaker 1>and it's pretty interesting to realize as well,</v>

3402
02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:16.100
<v Speaker 1>but making the special effects for those movies which,</v>

3403
02:30:16.170 --> 02:30:17.920
<v Speaker 1>which is a form of artificial reality,</v>

3404
02:30:17.921 --> 02:30:18.341
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

3405
02:30:18.341 --> 02:30:22.690
<v Speaker 1>is part of what's driving computational sophistication forward because the big</v>

3406
02:30:22.691 --> 02:30:26.470
<v Speaker 1>processors are being used most intensively to render reality.</v>

3407
02:30:26.890 --> 02:30:31.890
<v Speaker 1>And so whatever's happening in those movies is something far more significant</v>

3408
02:30:32.291 --> 02:30:33.310
<v Speaker 1>than you might think.</v>

3409
02:30:33.700 --> 02:30:38.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it all speaks to the unquenchable power of mythology and its proclivity</v>

3410
02:30:40.121 --> 02:30:43.750
<v Speaker 1>to manifest itself in a multitude of forms and,</v>

3411
02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:44.920
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3412
02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:48.010
<v Speaker 1>and to be in t eternally compelling to people.</v>

3413
02:30:48.011 --> 02:30:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And so generally that seems to be a really good thing to me.</v>

3414
02:30:52.920 --> 02:30:56.920
<v Speaker 1>So I mean the Harry Potter series I think is a better example than the star wars</v>

3415
02:30:56.921 --> 02:30:58.150
<v Speaker 1>series because I think that,</v>

3416
02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I think that the star wars series is a bit too consciously contrived.</v>

3417
02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Harry Potter series is genuinely to my way of thinking anyways,</v>

3418
02:31:10.931 --> 02:31:12.880
<v Speaker 1>is it genuine intuitive production?</v>

3419
02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3420
02:31:14.380 --> 02:31:16.570
<v Speaker 1>and rolling got her mythology.</v>

3421
02:31:16.780 --> 02:31:17.710
<v Speaker 1>She so good at that.</v>

3422
02:31:17.711 --> 02:31:18.640
<v Speaker 1>I just can't believe it.</v>

3423
02:31:18.641 --> 02:31:20.520
<v Speaker 1>It's just absolutely unbelievable.</v>

3424
02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:22.710
<v Speaker 1>And you think of the consequences of that.</v>

3425
02:31:22.711 --> 02:31:27.711
<v Speaker 1>She wrote seven books about wizards like teenage wizards and child wizards and</v>

3426
02:31:28.831 --> 02:31:33.831
<v Speaker 1>magical castle threatened by giant snakes and portrayed the battle between good</v>

3427
02:31:33.931 --> 02:31:37.470
<v Speaker 1>and evil on a landscape of chaos and order and sold.</v>

3428
02:31:37.740 --> 02:31:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's her empire worth in terms of total financial consequences?</v>

3429
02:31:43.051 --> 02:31:43.884
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>

3430
02:31:44.780 --> 02:31:46.590
<v Speaker 1>It's in the tens of billions of dollars.</v>

3431
02:31:46.591 --> 02:31:47.424
<v Speaker 1>Certainly.</v>

3432
02:31:47.610 --> 02:31:50.280
<v Speaker 1>She got all these kids to read 600 page books.</v>

3433
02:31:50.281 --> 02:31:53.070
<v Speaker 1>They produced all these movies that were fantastically expensive.</v>

3434
02:31:53.340 --> 02:31:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Everybody read them and went and watched them.</v>

3435
02:31:55.651 --> 02:31:56.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3436
02:31:56.210 --> 02:31:57.220
<v Speaker 1>and what do you see there?</v>

3437
02:31:57.221 --> 02:32:00.390
<v Speaker 1>It's dying and resurrecting hero fights is satanic.</v>

3438
02:32:00.391 --> 02:32:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Figure and attains final victory through death and resurrection.</v>

3439
02:32:04.670 --> 02:32:05.503
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

3440
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:06.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3441
02:32:06.211 --> 02:32:08.850
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't contrived that came out of the story.</v>

3442
02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:10.343
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

3443
02:32:13.100 --> 02:32:15.240
<v Speaker 1>the mythologies seeps in no matter what.</v>

3444
02:32:15.340 --> 02:32:16.173
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

3445
02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:16.741
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3446
02:32:16.741 --> 02:32:18.240
<v Speaker 1>and this is something I learned from you,</v>

3447
02:32:18.270 --> 02:32:20.460
<v Speaker 1>is that it's time for us to understand it.</v>

3448
02:32:21.480 --> 02:32:24.720
<v Speaker 1>We can't just live by it unconsciously anymore.</v>

3449
02:32:24.970 --> 02:32:27.900
<v Speaker 1>We have to understand that as well as living by it.</v>

3450
02:32:28.530 --> 02:32:30.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's the task of the 21st century.</v>

3451
02:32:31.200 --> 02:32:32.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

3452
02:32:33.300 --> 02:32:34.980
<v Speaker 1>So if we understand it,</v>

3453
02:32:34.981 --> 02:32:39.090
<v Speaker 1>then maybe we can fortify ourself against collectivist ideology,</v>

3454
02:32:39.091 --> 02:32:39.924
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

3455
02:32:39.930 --> 02:32:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping because that's a bad pathway.</v>

3456
02:32:43.050 --> 02:32:48.050
<v Speaker 1>So you were able to turn that question into a very good final words somehow.</v>

3457
02:32:48.570 --> 02:32:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

3458
02:32:49.050 --> 02:32:50.160
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>

3459
02:32:50.161 --> 02:32:50.971
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

3460
02:32:50.971 --> 02:32:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Thank</v>

3461
02:32:53.140 --> 02:32:53.350
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
