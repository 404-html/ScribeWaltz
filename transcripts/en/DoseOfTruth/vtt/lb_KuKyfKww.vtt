<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

2
00:00:00.731 --> 00:00:01.564
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson,</v>

3
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm a 17 year old girl and up tool gets turned to rare for someone like me who</v>

4
00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:06.844
<v Speaker 1>listened to,</v>

5
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is,</v>

7
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.600
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it is.</v>

8
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

9
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea that the only people who are listening to me or angry white</v>

10
00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:16.294
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

11
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.693
<v Speaker 1>he's a maker.</v>

12
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>He might get in this whole idea</v>

13
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>and brown women in the audience too.</v>

14
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>As far as I'm concerned.</v>

15
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.780
<v Speaker 1>This is just so absurd as that.</v>

16
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that this has even become controversial,</v>

17
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:41.050
<v Speaker 1>is talking to people about,</v>

18
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>taking responsibility for the state of the world onto themselves,</v>

20
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.850
<v Speaker 1>the radical leftist identity politics.</v>

21
00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:53.080
<v Speaker 1>City logs can only view this through the lens of their radical leftist identity</v>

22
00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:53.741
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

23
00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>And instead of noticing that this isn't a political issue,</v>

24
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>except that I don't like the radical leftists and the restrictions on free</v>

25
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:06.291
<v Speaker 1>speech [inaudible] for me,</v>

26
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.990
<v Speaker 1>it's the politics junkie.</v>

27
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Speaker 1>It's found founders,</v>

28
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>the politicians started to do the things that they don't get to do is staring</v>

29
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>into philosophical realm or they stepped into the theological rep and they</v>

30
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:29.020
<v Speaker 1>should stay the hell out of both</v>

31
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.513
<v Speaker 1>the individual.</v>

32
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.460
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

33
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>you're no longer where you should.</v>

34
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>You've transformed yourself into a tire and not the good time,</v>

35
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.950
<v Speaker 1>not that there is a good conductor.</v>

36
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.190
<v Speaker 1>So now the consequences of God,</v>

37
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.153
<v Speaker 1>Carlos,</v>

38
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.230
<v Speaker 1>because our would be objected to that vociferously and with a fair degree of</v>

39
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:57.354
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

40
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>the only responsible can be mounted is the response that exists within that</v>

41
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>domain of conceptualization of identity politics.</v>

42
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>And so since I'm objecting to that,</v>

43
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>then I must be the reprehensible editing slept well,</v>

44
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that story.</v>

45
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to work out because that is what's going on.</v>

46
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>So and so to the 17 year old girl,</v>

47
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like who knows how many 17 year old girls are paying attention to what I'm</v>

48
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>saying?</v>

49
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.823
<v Speaker 1>I need to,</v>

50
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's in the tens of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands.</v>

51
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>And so the mere fact that that isn't the story,</v>

52
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:36.951
<v Speaker 1>that a small subsection of the ideological he committed partner media is telling</v>

53
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.310
<v Speaker 1>you by no means all of them by any stretch of the imagination doesn't mean it's</v>

54
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:43.490
<v Speaker 1>cannot be true.</v>

55
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>So now when might be rare statistically speaking for 17 year olds to be</v>

56
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>listening to me,</v>

57
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>but her plenty of them that are,</v>

58
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>I get letters from them all the time.</v>

59
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>More power to them as far as I'm concerned.</v>

60
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated message that lectures are very sophisticated and difficult.</v>

61
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.830
<v Speaker 1>It's great if,</v>

62
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to find that your interest is captured by them,</v>

63
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>then there's something to that.</v>

64
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>What advice would I give for teens?</v>

65
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Like you do what you think's right,</v>

66
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.973
<v Speaker 1>Kiddo.</v>

67
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.300
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
