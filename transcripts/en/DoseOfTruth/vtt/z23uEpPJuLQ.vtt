00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Here's an idea that's expressed.</v>

2
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Christian symbolism was an idea that Christ was crucified before he headed to</v>

3
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

4
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>The heroin hell and rise to mythological idea.</v>

5
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>It's an article and liberal idea as far as I'm aware.</v>

6
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 1>But there's an idea there.</v>

7
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.020
<v Speaker 1>If you want to move out,</v>

8
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.000
<v Speaker 1>you have to go down first,</v>

9
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.140
<v Speaker 1>then you kind of know this,</v>

10
00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:41.391
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Because most of the things that you've learned in your life,</v>

12
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.220
<v Speaker 1>you've learned the hard way.</v>

13
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.720
<v Speaker 1>And so most any hole that will increase in wisdom tends to come back,</v>

14
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>a sacrificial cost,</v>

15
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.770
<v Speaker 1>You have to die and there's an intermediary period of chaos and horror and then</v>

17
00:00:57.311 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe come out of that.</v>

18
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>You're wiser and more work together,</v>

19
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>but you paid for it.</v>

20
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

21
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's being the consequence of that process for me is,</v>

22
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I've looked into these,</v>

24
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>this motivation for atrocity,</v>

25
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.240
<v Speaker 1>and I told you what I concluded you could make about what you want,</v>

26
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:16.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's all from them.</v>

27
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Something very positive for me,</v>

28
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>which was to shed light on something else,</v>

29
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:21.844
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

30
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>well let's say you can need,</v>

31
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.750
<v Speaker 1>and this has to do with the solution of the problem.</v>

32
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you can detail problem and so I need the problem.</v>

33
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.041
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>

34
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>if it's detailed though property,</v>

35
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>then there's a solution that emerges from it.</v>

36
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>If you could identify the nature of the true level,</v>

37
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>it's then you clarify the nature of its officers,</v>

38
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>which is whatever is good and then you didn't perhaps pursue that and perhaps</v>

39
00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>that's how you can spray the malevolence.</v>

40
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Whatever good is,</v>

41
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:48.610
<v Speaker 1>is not what he,</v>

42
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>and it's the opposite of that.</v>

43
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:51.010
<v Speaker 1>And some would say,</v>

44
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>well what do you do instead of trading trending down half of cane?</v>

45
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's answer that is</v>

46
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.270
<v Speaker 1>you don't look for the insufficiency of the world in the structure.</v>

47
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>You look for the insufficiency of destruction of the world in you.</v>

48
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>If things aren't going well enough for you,</v>

49
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>then you have some work to do and you might pay Paul.</v>

50
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a thing because the world,</v>

51
00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:23.884
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot to it.</v>

52
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a railing against you in some finding ways.</v>

53
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>And there's no doubt that that's the case.</v>

54
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.000
<v Speaker 1>You've got your options.</v>

55
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:36.001
<v Speaker 1>You can either pass your catastrophe at the feet of God and become bitter and</v>

56
00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 1>cruel and resentful and works as a consequence.</v>

57
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Or you can take it upon yourself,</v>

58
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.580
<v Speaker 1>prove what you improve and also assume that the same time that there's enough to</v>

59
00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>you that you can actually bench.</v>

60
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with regards to malevolence itself.</v>

61
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 1>You can look for that upside for yourself and there's evidence for no time of</v>

62
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:55.540
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

63
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.900
<v Speaker 1>And then you can go after those people that you regard as particularly in the</v>

64
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>straight in your world up that way.</v>

65
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>But that's how insurance develop.</v>

66
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

67
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>and there's a better idea,</v>

68
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.920
<v Speaker 1>which is my one love to yourself first and see just how much of that constraint</v>

69
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>excite yourself start before you start worrying about how much of that younger,</v>

70
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>the constraint it under people.</v>

71
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.450
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why you need to send your house in perfect order before he</v>

72
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>criticized the world.</v>

73
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Because all of that,</v>

74
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>and then this one seems to go down the pathway that cane go gone,</v>

75
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 1>and the people still go down constantly.</v>

76
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>There might making everything worse for them,</v>

77
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>for their families,</v>

78
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.991
<v Speaker 1>for the community,</v>

79
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>for the world.</v>

80
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>You have the alternative of taking all of that onto yourself,</v>

81
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.320
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

82
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>and so that's fine.</v>

83
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>In our most profound transformative stories,</v>

84
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 1>let's say the person who revives me,</v>

85
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>the world is the person who voluntarily accepts their own vulnerability.</v>

86
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what's symbolized by the crucifixion.</v>

87
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>That's why that symbol as Gregory Poole for 2000 years,</v>

88
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.400
<v Speaker 1>since the proper pathway is to take on your mortality is your responsibility.</v>

89
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 1>And the second is to,</v>

90
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

91
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.303
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

92
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.430
<v Speaker 1>how would I put this</v>

93
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>to notice that the temptation that's laid down by the spirit of malevolence is</v>

94
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:42.451
<v Speaker 1>it temptation that you confront that you have to take responsibility for and</v>

95
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.400
<v Speaker 1>that you have to attain victory over?</v>

96
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a psychological drama,</v>

97
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.940
<v Speaker 1>and that's the story that sits at the bottom of her culture with its emphasis on</v>

98
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:52.410
<v Speaker 1>the dignity of the individual,</v>

99
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.350
<v Speaker 1>isn't the suffering of the individual.</v>

100
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.253
<v Speaker 1>It's divine.</v>

101
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not the malevolence of the individual,</v>

102
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.353
<v Speaker 1>it's divine.</v>

103
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.480
<v Speaker 1>It's the capacity of the individual in principle to accept both of those,</v>

104
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>to work for the remediation.</v>

105
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's the story that allows us our natural rights and our innate dignity</v>

106
00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:13.380
<v Speaker 1>and the responsibility that we have taught ourselves into our families,</v>

107
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:14.250
<v Speaker 1>into the community.</v>

108
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's the acting out of that story that produces individuals who are healthy</v>

109
00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:20.370
<v Speaker 1>and thriving.</v>

110
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Families that work and survive in communities that are integral and don't</v>

111
00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>degenerate into something resembling health.</v>

112
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's important as Carl,</v>

113
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:34.371
<v Speaker 1>you don't point it out for us to wake up because we're so powerful now.</v>

114
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.420
<v Speaker 1>We need to wake up and you need to understand what it is that we'd be doing</v>

115
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:41.580
<v Speaker 1>right and wrong for all of this time.</v>

116
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I have to implement that as consciously and clearheaded Layton intentively</v>

117
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
<v Speaker 1>properly as I possibly can in our individual lives and to see what great things</v>

118
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:55.620
<v Speaker 1>might happen as a consequence if you did some</v>

119
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
