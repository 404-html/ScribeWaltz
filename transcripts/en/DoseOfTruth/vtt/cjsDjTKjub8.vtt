00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.490
<v Speaker 1>The more I read about the Gulag System in,</v>

2
00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>in the USSR and what happened in China,</v>

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>what happened in Nazi Germany,</v>

4
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>the more it became evident to me that these weren't top down systems imposed by</v>

5
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>tyrants on an unwilling innocent population,</v>

6
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>but decisions on the part of entire cultures to go down a certain road.</v>

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Often the leaders were following,</v>

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>which I would say it was particularly the case with Hitler,</v>

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>which isn't to deny him his criminal culpability,</v>

10
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:37.311
<v Speaker 1>but Hitler was unbelievably good at letting the crowd tell him what to say.</v>

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>he was a mirror for the crowd and he was a good orator,</v>

14
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>but he paid attention to the crowd.</v>

15
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And so when he said something that made everyone cheer,</v>

16
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>they're dark hearts would come out in the mob and cheer about something he said</v>

18
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>that was say dramatic or vengeful.</v>

19
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Well then he'd say more of that and the things that he said that were peaceful,</v>

20
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>that produced no emotional reaction from the crowd.</v>

21
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>He just said less of.</v>

22
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>And so the crowd taught him over time exactly what to sell them and that that</v>

23
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>can be good in some sense.</v>

24
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>If a leader does that carefully,</v>

25
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>that that means he's integrating what the crowd wants with his style of</v>

26
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:12.991
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>

27
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:17.991
<v Speaker 1>But it can be terrible if the mob is the crowd and the mob is outraged and out</v>

28
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.434
<v Speaker 1>for blood,</v>

29
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>and that's what happened in Nazi Germany.</v>

30
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't blame it on Hitler.</v>

31
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>That's just not reasonable.</v>

32
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>It's distributed through the entire population and it's at the individual level</v>

33
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>of analysis that's most significant.</v>
