1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.010
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about this this week too,</v>

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>cause I was thinking about Noah's Ark and there was a phrase in that story that</v>

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand,</v>

4
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>which was that Noah was perfect in his generations.</v>

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.841
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

6
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means.</v>

7
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>And you know when you're,</v>

8
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>when you're going through a book like the Bible,</v>

9
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand a phrase that actually means you've missed something,</v>

10
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that that's just not,</v>

11
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>that's not Germane to the story.</v>

12
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>It means you're stupid.</v>

13
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.351
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get it,</v>

14
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

15
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.611
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get it.</v>

16
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>You didn't understand it.</v>

17
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.063
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

18
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>the idea that Noah was perfect in his generations and that's why he could build</v>

19
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:36.531
<v Speaker 1>an arc that would sustain him and him and humanity itself through the flood.</v>

20
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>It meant that he,</v>

21
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>not only did he walk with God,</v>

22
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>which is something that we talked about in the context of the sermon on the</v>

23
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>mount,</v>

24
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.021
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

25
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>he established proper relationships with his family,</v>

26
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>with his children.</v>

27
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>And so what that meant was that his,</v>

28
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>not only was he well integrated as a person,</v>

29
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>but his level of integration had reached the point where it stretched out beyond</v>

30
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>him and encompassed his family.</v>

31
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>And so it was Noah and the family that was in the arc.</v>

32
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you,</v>

33
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>and I really understood this this year because I had a very tumultuous year,</v>

34
00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you could think about it from a personal perspective.</v>

35
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I could think about it as a year that had no shortage of floods.</v>

36
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

37
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason that I was able to get through it,</v>

38
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I also had terrible health problems.</v>

39
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.193
<v Speaker 1>And the only,</v>

40
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons I was able to get through it was because my family really</v>

41
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>came together around me,</v>

42
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:21.571
<v Speaker 1>my kids,</v>

43
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:22.051
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>

44
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>my parents and my friends as well,</v>

45
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>particularly a certain group of friends.</v>

46
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly all of that came together in my mind this week.</v>

47
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.031
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

48
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:33.151
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

49
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 1>that's what it means to be perfect in his generations meant that he hadn't just</v>

50
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>straightened himself out.</v>

51
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>He'd also straightened out to his relationships with his family.</v>

52
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you that when crisis strikes you wish it will,</v>

53
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.663
<v Speaker 1>it will.</v>

54
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>The flood will come.</v>

55
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:48.931
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

56
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>That's why the apocalypse is always upon us.</v>

57
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 1>The flood will definitely come in your life.</v>

58
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And to the degree that you've organized yourself psychologically and also healed</v>

59
00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>the relationships between you and your family,</v>

60
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>that could be the critical element that that determines whether you live or die</v>

61
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>when a crisis comes or,</v>

62
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>or whether it's someone in your family lives or dies.</v>

63
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea of the arc containing the man who's who walks with God and whose</v>

64
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>generations are perfect and that that's what sustains humanity through the</v>

65
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:16.351
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

66
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like you couldn't be more psychologically accurate than that.</v>

67
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.531
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

68
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing I was thinking about this week,</v>

69
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:23.154
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

70
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about another line in the new testament.</v>

71
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it's from the sermon on the mount,</v>

72
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not absolutely sure.</v>

73
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Christ compares the Kingdom of Heaven to a mustard seed.</v>

74
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>And so I was thinking about it.</v>

75
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Mustard seed is a very tiny seed and it grows into quite a spectacular complex</v>

76
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:40.614
<v Speaker 1>plant.</v>

77
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about how you should operate in the world in order to make it</v>

78
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:46.171
<v Speaker 1>a better place,</v>

79
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>assuming that that's what you should be doing and that is what you should be</v>

80
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:49.861
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

81
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>And there there's lots in the world to fix.</v>

82
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Everything that bothers you about the world and about yourself should be fixed</v>

83
00:02:57.451 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>and you can do that.</v>

84
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 1>And my dawning realization,</v>

85
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend,</v>

86
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.631
<v Speaker 1>he lives in Montreal,</v>

87
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>his name is James Simon.</v>

88
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a great painter and he's taught me a lot of things help.</v>

89
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>He's helped me design my house and beautify it.</v>

90
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And I bought some paintings from him a couple of years ago.</v>

91
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

92
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>and he did this series of paintings where he went around North America and,</v>

93
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.650
<v Speaker 1>and stood in different places and then he painted the view from here down.</v>

94
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 1>And so it's his feet planted in different places on roads in the desert,</v>

95
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:30.154
<v Speaker 1>on the ocean.</v>

96
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I have one actually hanging over my toilet,</v>

97
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>which is him standing at a urinal.</v>

98
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.113
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

100
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.101
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

101
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:36.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to make a point.</v>

103
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>And the point was that wherever you are,</v>

104
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 1>it's worth paying attention.</v>

105
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's cause you know,</v>

106
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>so all these places that he visited,</v>

107
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>he looked at exactly where he was standing by the side of the road in the</v>

108
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 1>desert,</v>

109
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>sort of mundane in some sense.</v>

110
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>But then maybe he put 40 hours into that painting,</v>

111
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:53.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.041
<v Speaker 1>and it's very,</v>

113
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 1>very realistic painting with really good light.</v>

114
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>And what he's telling you as a painter is everything is worth paying attention</v>

115
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>to an infinite amount,</v>

116
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:03.590
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have enough time.</v>

117
00:04:03.591 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>And so the artists does that for you,</v>

118
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:05.501
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

119
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>The artist looks and looks and looks and looks and looks and then gives you that</v>

120
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:09.671
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>

121
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can look at the painting and it reminds you that,</v>

122
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>right where you are is there's every,</v>

123
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>everything that there is is right where you are.</v>

124
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's a hard thing to realize,</v>

125
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually true.</v>

126
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>And so I've,</v>

127
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>I've been telling people online in various ways and in lectures that they should</v>

128
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>start fixing up the world by cleaning up the room.</v>

129
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to just elaborate on that a little bit before I get back to the</v>

130
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>lecture itself.</v>

131
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>So I'd say it's become this Internet weird Internet meme,</v>

132
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:38.760
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

133
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.593
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

134
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

135
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.633
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

136
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

137
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's a joke and good,</v>

138
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:44.014
<v Speaker 1>it's a joke.</v>

139
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I really happy about the fact that so much of this has got like the leaving of</v>

140
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>humor and it's really important because that's what stops things from</v>

141
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>degenerating into and to conflict humor.</v>

142
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about this idea of cleaning up your room in relationship to</v>

143
00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>the mustard seed idea.</v>

144
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 1>And you see the thing about cleaning up your room,</v>

145
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 1>this is also something I learned from Carl Young and his studies on alchemy</v>

146
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:07.960
<v Speaker 1>because for young,</v>

147
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.620
<v Speaker 1>when the alchemist was attempting to make the philosopher's stone and he was not</v>

148
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>only engaged in the transformation of the material world,</v>

149
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:19.201
<v Speaker 1>but he was engaged in a process of self transformation that occurred at the same</v>

150
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:19.961
<v Speaker 1>time as the,</v>

151
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>as the chemical trend,</v>

152
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>as the chemical transformation.</v>

153
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>So it was a psychological work in some sense.</v>

154
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you want to sort out your room and beautified cause the beauty is also</v>

155
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

156
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 1>And let's say that all you have is just a little room.</v>

157
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not rich,</v>

158
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>you're poor.</v>

159
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>And you don't have any power,</v>

160
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:35.381
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing,</v>

161
00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>but you've got your damn room and you've got this space right in front of you.</v>

162
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 1>You know that that's a part of the cosmos that you can come to grips with and</v>

163
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.051
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

164
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:44.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

165
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:46.330
<v Speaker 1>what's there in front of you right in front of you?</v>

166
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

167
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how open your eyes are that that's the proper answer because you</v>

168
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:52.250
<v Speaker 1>could say,</v>

169
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>w William Blake said this,</v>

170
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

171
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 1>eldest Huxley made comments that were very similar in a transcendent state.</v>

172
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>You can see infinity in the finite and you might say,</v>

173
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:01.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

174
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

175
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>you can see infinity in what you have within your grasp.</v>

176
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:06.870
<v Speaker 1>If you look and you could say,</v>

177
00:06:06.871 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the case with your room and so you want to clean up your room.</v>

178
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

179
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

180
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.341
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>

181
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:14.174
<v Speaker 1>Exactly?</v>

182
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.721
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

183
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>the room is a room as a place to sleep.</v>

184
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>And so if you set your room up properly,</v>

185
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>then you figure out how to sleep and when you should sleep and how you should</v>

186
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:23.121
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

187
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 1>And then you figure it out when you should wake up.</v>

188
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 1>And then you figure out,</v>

189
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.021
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

190
00:06:26.021 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>what clothes you should wear because they have to be arranged properly in your</v>

191
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:29.151
<v Speaker 1>dresser.</v>

192
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:30.990
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have some place to put your clothes.</v>

193
00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to have some clothes,</v>

194
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out what you're gonna wear those clothes to do,</v>

195
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

196
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>And then that means you got to figure out what you're going to do and then your</v>

197
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 1>room has to serve that purpose because otherwise it doesn't set up properly.</v>

198
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't set up,</v>

199
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't serve your purposes,</v>

200
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 1>you will be unhappy and not happy in the room.</v>

201
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Because the way that we perceive the world is as a place to move from point a to</v>

202
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>point B in.</v>

203
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 1>And then if the place that we're in facilitates that movement,</v>

204
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 1>then we're happy to be there.</v>

205
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 1>And if the place that we're in serves as an obstacle to that movement,</v>

206
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:06.560
<v Speaker 1>then we're unhappy to be there.</v>

207
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>And so what it means to set up your room is that you have to have somewhere to</v>

208
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 1>go that's worthwhile or you can't set up your room and then your room has to be</v>

209
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>set up to facilitate that.</v>

210
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing is,</v>

211
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you have to make it beautiful,</v>

212
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 1>but that's not easy,</v>

213
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:20.241
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

214
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 1>That means you have to have some taste.</v>

215
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean you have to have money.</v>

216
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't because you can be garish with money and you can be tasteful with</v>

217
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:29.384
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

218
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 1>All you need is taste and taste beats money when it comes to beautifying things,</v>

219
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:33.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean not that money is trivial because it's not,</v>

221
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 1>the taste is crucial and people who are very artistically oriented can make</v>

222
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:42.320
<v Speaker 1>beautiful things out of virtually nothing.</v>

223
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.311
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

224
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 1>the literature suggests that if you're going to make beautiful things,</v>

225
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.380
<v Speaker 1>putting real constraints on,</v>

226
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 1>on what you allow yourself to do,</v>

227
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 1>facilitates creativity instead of interfering with it.</v>

228
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Because let's say you have to make something out of nothing,</v>

229
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

230
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,</v>

231
00:07:58.551 --> 00:07:59.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

232
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 1>You have to make something out of nothing and you have to be creative in order</v>

233
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:03.224
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

234
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:03.970
<v Speaker 1>And so then to,</v>

235
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.720
<v Speaker 1>to beautify your room means that you also have to develop your capacity to be</v>

236
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 1>creative and so then you can make your room shine,</v>

237
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 1>but then what will happen is that if your family isn't together,</v>

238
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.600
<v Speaker 1>they will interfere with that.</v>

239
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>You'll interfere with that because you won't have the discipline to do it</v>

240
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:21.261
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

241
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 1>But then when you start building this,</v>

242
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

243
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.700
<v Speaker 1>this little microcosm of perfection with what you have at hand,</v>

244
00:08:27.701 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 1>and it'll evoke all the pathologies of everyone in your household,</v>

245
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>the wonder what the hell you're up to in there and they won't necessarily be</v>

246
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>happy because if you're,</v>

247
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 1>if they're in a lowly place,</v>

248
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:38.391
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

249
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:38.991
<v Speaker 1>and so are you,</v>

250
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:40.400
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to move out of that,</v>

251
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.443
<v Speaker 1>then the,</v>

252
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 1>the higher you move out of that,</v>

253
00:08:42.891 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 1>the more the place they're in looks bad.</v>

254
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.101
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

255
00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:46.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

256
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>what they should do is celebrate your victory over chaos and evil.</v>

257
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:50.960
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what will happen.</v>

258
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:54.170
<v Speaker 1>What will happen instead is that they will attempt to pull you back down.</v>

259
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 1>They'll attempt to,</v>

260
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 1>and I mean obviously all families still do that,</v>

261
00:08:58.111 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

262
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.560
<v Speaker 1>but all families do that to some degree and some families do almost nothing but</v>

263
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

264
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that if you're going to organize your room,</v>

265
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have to confront the devils in your house.</v>

266
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's often,</v>

267
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 1>that's often a terrifying thing because some of those devils have have lineages</v>

268
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>that go back many,</v>

269
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:17.881
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

270
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>many generations.</v>

271
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.520
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows what you have to struggle with in order to overcome that and</v>

272
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:23.950
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

273
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>And so to sort yourself out into fix up your room is a non trivial matter,</v>

274
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:29.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.590
<v Speaker 1>and you can do that.</v>

276
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 1>You'll learn by doing that.</v>

277
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:36.000
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you'll learn enough by doing that so that you can fix up your</v>

278
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 1>family a little bit.</v>

279
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 1>And then having done that,</v>

280
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 1>you'll have enough characters so that when you try to operate in the world at</v>

281
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:42.481
<v Speaker 1>your job,</v>

282
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:44.880
<v Speaker 1>or maybe in the broader social spheres,</v>

283
