1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.930
<v Speaker 1>so back to discuss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to discuss.</v>

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fundamental thing that I learned</v>

4
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>from Paul Rosin is to see us as these</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing omnivores.</v>

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>This is part of our survival strategy</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more than other other apes.</v>

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.690
<v Speaker 1>We are just brilliant omnivores and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the Omnivore's dilemma,</v>

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>which is we've got to be interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of new stuff.</v>

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.950
<v Speaker 1>We're not tied to one place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can roam onto a whole new continent.</v>

9
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>So we were interested in stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but stuff has all kinds of toxins and</v>

10
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>microbes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to be careful about that stuff.</v>

11
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>And so these motives have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention and this is actually an</v>

12
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>interesting way to understand the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have both motives,</v>

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 1>but if so imagined two siblings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of whom is set more towards trying</v>

15
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>new stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking out new stuff,</v>

16
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.450
<v Speaker 1>and the other is a little more fearful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're like,</v>

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.033
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.900
<v Speaker 1>let's not try that.</v>

20
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>That stay with what's tried and true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's progressivism and</v>

21
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>conservatives and that's the origins of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

22
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.860
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at kids' behavior at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>age of two or three,</v>

23
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>it does predict how it will vote much</v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

24
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Not Hugely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a clear prediction there.</v>

25
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.900
<v Speaker 1>so disgust is part of a regulatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>system about our engagement with the</v>

27
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:18.740
<v Speaker 1>world and whether we are just sorta out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and,</v>

28
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

29
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we seek out variety and diversity.</v>

30
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I think diversity is just a great thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whether we want a little more order</v>

31
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:26.030
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictability.</v>

32
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Conservatives are neater than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive's if you take photos of</v>

33
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>their rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:36.500
<v Speaker 1>you can actually use the cleanliness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

36
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>You can predict how they vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.870
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out what's really cool about</v>

38
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>disgust in modern politics is if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all the different things that</v>

39
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>we're fighting over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in this country,</v>

40
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>our culture wars over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>going back a few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

43
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:53.000
<v Speaker 1>the flag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>

44
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:53.834
<v Speaker 1>all of these things.</v>

45
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a study with my colleagues was</v>

46
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.420
<v Speaker 1>led by Seneca Leyva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 1>in which we asked all these cultural war</v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes of people.</v>

48
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 1>And we also had their scores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the discus scale,</v>

49
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>but one of the foundations of morality</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sanctity and purity and it relates to</v>

50
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:11.630
<v Speaker 1>discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we found is that if you know,</v>

51
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>if you know what people's left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

52
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.240
<v Speaker 1>how they place themselves in the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>rightscale,</v>

53
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.680
<v Speaker 1>you can pretty much predict where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall on most cultural war attitudes</v>

54
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.480
<v Speaker 1>except for those that load on or</v>
<v Speaker 1>implicate sanctity or purity.</v>

55
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>So what I mean his flag burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

56
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:29.511
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:32.290
<v Speaker 1>do you think that people should have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to burn the American flag or</v>

58
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>country's flag as an expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a political action?</v>

59
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:39.050
<v Speaker 1>What do you think people can give some</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer in a one to seven scale and</v>

60
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>people on the right?</v>

61
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Think more like the say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People on the left,</v>

62
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.310
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who score high on loyalty are</v>

63
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>more likely to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who have low run it say yes,</v>

64
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>and that's even taking account of where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are on the left right dimension.</v>

65
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>But here's the cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

66
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>it's only if you add in the purity or</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctity thing,</v>

67
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>but you can really understand what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are doing because people see the</v>

68
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>flag not as just a piece of cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see it as having some innate</v>

69
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some something sacred about it which</v>

70
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>must be protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

71
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is true.</v>

72
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>They think of it as a unifying center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

73
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there's something sacred,</v>

74
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>and this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the central piece of my work</v>

75
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>around politics and morality is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology of sanctity.</v>
