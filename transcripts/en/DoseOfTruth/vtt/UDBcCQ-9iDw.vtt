1
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised.</v>

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.230
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank you because what was surprising about your electric today?</v>

3
00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>It was his concept of altruism.</v>

4
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>I think you've been able to just put everything together and at the end come</v>

5
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:15.500
<v Speaker 1>with a higher value of altruism.</v>

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.630
<v Speaker 1>And to me it was a surprise.</v>

7
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>You don't come in here and I have a relationship with altruism and the one that</v>

8
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I find it's difficult for me is that there's an evolutionary process of my</v>

9
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:26.810
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

10
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>It's an organ is developed,</v>

11
00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:29.024
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

13
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.840
<v Speaker 1>and I'm amazed at how often I think of three people,</v>

14
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.020
<v Speaker 1>me and myself and I to the point where where I've actually written down counter</v>

15
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>all of the iterations of me,</v>

16
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.050
<v Speaker 1>myself and I and either my thoughts or my speech or even in someone else's and</v>

17
00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a page and saw them do we think of wheat as far as I've been able to</v>

18
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>ascertain is because I have to expend energy to think about someone else.</v>

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

20
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.781
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

21
00:00:55.781 --> 00:01:00.781
<v Speaker 1>and yet yet I'm addicted to ease and comfort because my natural evolution is</v>

22
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:02.360
<v Speaker 1>going to be some comfort.</v>

23
00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:02.861
<v Speaker 1>And you hear it in,</v>

24
00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 1>in alcoholics anonymous.</v>

25
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>booze ain't the problem.</v>

27
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 1>You're addicted to ease and comfort.</v>

28
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.880
<v Speaker 1>How do I overcome my,</v>

29
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 1>what I think is my sense of ease and comfort to be able to make altruism</v>

30
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 2>a more natural state of being good.</v>

31
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Good,</v>

32
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.503
<v Speaker 2>good question.</v>

33
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

34
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.180
<v Speaker 2>the first was a comment about the emphasis in my talk today on altruism in the</v>

35
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 2>second is how do I,</v>

36
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 2>how do people overcome their proclivity to only act on their own behalf?</v>

37
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.541
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

38
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:41.541
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I will say is that I don't believe that what I spoke about</v>

39
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 2>today was in favor of altruism.</v>

40
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.590
<v Speaker 2>And and I,</v>

41
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 2>that's not a negative comment on your question,</v>

42
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>

43
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 2>so there's a,</v>

44
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

45
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.331
<v Speaker 2>there's a pro,</v>

46
00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 2>here's a primary religious injunction.</v>

47
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Treat the other person like you would like to be treated yourself.</v>

48
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 2>That does not mean be nice to other people.</v>

49
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.650
<v Speaker 2>It does not mean sacrifice yourself excessively for other people it means think</v>

50
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 2>about the other person has,</v>

51
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 2>if they were you,</v>

52
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 2>and figure out how you can mutually interacts to better both of you.</v>

53
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 2>At the same time you have to build yourself into the equation.</v>

54
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 2>It's an equation.</v>

55
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>

56
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not that the others are more valuable,</v>

57
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 2>it's that we're all valuable,</v>

58
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 2>were equally valuable.</v>

59
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:26.791
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>

60
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 2>well how do you remind yourself of that?</v>

61
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is through terror because terror is the genuine</v>

62
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 2>motivator.</v>

63
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 2>So they save</v>

64
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 2>fear of God is the beginning of all wisdom.</v>

65
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Well what does that mean?</v>

66
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 2>It means first that you don't get away with anything.</v>

67
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 2>And it's really useful to know that because if you really know that you won't</v>

68
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 2>try to get away with while you still will because people are stupid but,</v>

69
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.520
<v Speaker 2>but at least it will mitigate the possibility.</v>

70
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>

71
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you something that young said,</v>

72
00:02:57.361 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 2>this is quite,</v>

73
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.960
<v Speaker 2>this is quite profound and,</v>

74
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

75
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I think the right answer to this question.</v>

76
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 2>So young believed he was interested in the emergence of higher morality.</v>

77
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

78
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.350
<v Speaker 2>something that the developmental psychologist,</v>

79
00:03:09.351 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Sean Piaget was also interested in.</v>

80
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Here's a thought.</v>

81
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 2>We started out as individuals.</v>

82
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Then we learned to play games with other people,</v>

83
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

84
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>children learn how to play games without the children.</v>

85
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 2>And that made them social.</v>

86
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 2>So our society is a game.</v>

87
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant game that we're all playing together voluntarily.</v>

88
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 2>And so children were first learned how to play the game,</v>

89
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 2>and only later did they learn the rules of the game.</v>

90
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 2>And he learned how to play the game first and then learn the rules to how to</v>

91
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.244
<v Speaker 2>speak the rules.</v>

92
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 2>And then at some point they realized that they were also creators of the rules.</v>

93
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>And so that's moral development on a continual on a,</v>

94
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not a continuum,</v>

95
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:46.771
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

96
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:47.061
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

97
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a fractured staircase upward.</v>

98
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 2>But young was interested in elements of moral action that were higher than that.</v>

99
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 2>And so he conceptualized it symbolically.</v>

100
00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 2>So imagine this,</v>

101
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 2>you did this in the last book he wrote called mysterium connectionists.</v>

102
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you're exist so that your conceptual structures and your</v>

103
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 2>emotions are an uneasy relationship with one another.</v>

104
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.330
<v Speaker 2>So you're sort of a house divided amongst yourself.</v>

105
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 2>And so what you have to do is you have to put together your mind and your,</v>

106
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 2>and your emotion so that they're working as a,</v>

107
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.863
<v Speaker 2>as a unit.</v>

108
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 2>And you do that in part by actually being forthright about what it is that you</v>

109
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 2>want for yourself and to other people.</v>

110
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 2>And to learn how to negotiate that.</v>

111
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 2>So that inner tension disappears.</v>

112
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 2>And so now you're a unified,</v>

113
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.270
<v Speaker 2>you're a unified entity of emotion and thought they're not conflicting with one</v>

114
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

115
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 2>And then what you do is you take that entity,</v>

116
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 2>which is still in some sense separate from your body because you're not acting</v>

117
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 2>these out and you bring those two together.</v>

118
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 2>And he thought about that as the psychological equivalent of the incarnation</v>

119
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.321
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

120
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's integrated spirit integrating with the body.</v>

121
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is that you take your emotions and motivations and capacity</v>

122
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:01.730
<v Speaker 2>for thinking that are now one thing and you act out those things you.</v>

123
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 2>So you embodied them in the world.</v>

124
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 2>And that's another thing that brings integrity.</v>

125
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a step past out in the step past that is to understand that</v>

126
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 2>there's no deal.</v>

127
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.310
<v Speaker 2>So you have the integrated spirit,</v>

128
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 2>mind and body</v>

129
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 2>in opposition to the world.</v>

130
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

131
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 2>the next thing you do is realize that there is no opposition with the world.</v>

132
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.020
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you are as a,</v>

133
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.811
<v Speaker 2>and this is very,</v>

134
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 2>very complicated.</v>

135
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 2>You're walking down the street.</v>

136
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] street is a good example of this in Toronto and they're decimated</v>

137
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:30.741
<v Speaker 2>alcoholic,</v>

138
00:05:30.741 --> 00:05:31.361
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia.</v>

139
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:33.790
<v Speaker 2>It's littering the landscape so to speak.</v>

140
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 2>You walk around them,</v>

141
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.531
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

142
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

143
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 2>that's not me.</v>

144
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:37.691
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

145
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:38.524
<v Speaker 2>yes it is.</v>

146
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.740
<v Speaker 2>It's you in so far as your tendency is to react in a negative way and to skirt</v>

147
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:45.724
<v Speaker 2>the territory.</v>

148
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.160
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

149
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a disturbance in your field of being.</v>

150
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 2>It's you now,</v>

151
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to do about it and I wouldn't recommend that you do anything</v>

152
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 2>because you'd probably just make it worse.</v>

153
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a very big problem that's lying there on the sidewalk.</v>

154
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 2>And it may be well beyond your capacity to fix it.</v>

155
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 2>But in so far as it's a disturbance in your field of being,</v>

156
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.793
<v Speaker 2>it's you,</v>

157
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 2>it's you and all the problems that are in the world that,</v>

158
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>that you experienced there you,</v>

159
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 2>and so you stop thinking about things in terms of an opposition between what's</v>

160
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 2>good for you and what's good for the world because there is no difference.</v>

161
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 2>There's no difference between the two.</v>

162
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.760
<v Speaker 2>And that that doesn't mean that the pathway from what's good for you in your</v>

163
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 2>more limited domain to what's good for everyone is an easy one to compute.</v>

164
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:31.881
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

165
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>

166
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 2>But there is no,</v>

167
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 2>there is no technical difference between them,</v>

168
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.491
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

169
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:42.491
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm engaged in a psychotherapeutic dialogue with my clients when I'm doing</v>

170
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:43.454
<v Speaker 2>it properly,</v>

171
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they're learning from me.</v>

172
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 2>It's that we're learning together.</v>

173
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 2>And every time I solved one of their problems or help them solve one of their</v>

174
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

175
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 2>I help myself solve one of my problems.</v>

176
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.791
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

177
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.680
<v Speaker 2>because people bring to me,</v>

178
00:06:57.681 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 2>bring into my sessions the terrible things that go wrong with people in life.</v>

179
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Their partner has cancer,</v>

180
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:04.650
<v Speaker 2>their father's hasn't,</v>

181
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 2>father has Alzheimer's,</v>

182
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 2>they're suffering with alcoholism.</v>

183
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Their career is collapsing.</v>

184
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Like these aren't things that are happening to them.</v>

185
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 2>These are things that happen to everyone.</v>

186
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 2>And to figure out how to solve that for someone is to figure out how to solve it</v>

187
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:18.801
<v Speaker 2>for yourself.</v>

188
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 2>There's no difference whatsoever.</v>

189
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

190
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 2>and then so there's to know that,</v>

191
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.620
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

192
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.920
<v Speaker 2>to think of that and certainly works in,</v>

193
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 2>in an intimate relationship.</v>

194
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 2>If you think that you're somehow different than your wife,</v>

195
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 2>while certain she's going to remind you otherwise constantly.</v>

196
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.321
<v Speaker 2>But it's an,</v>

197
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 2>it's an error.</v>

198
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:38.780
<v Speaker 2>It's an error because you're,</v>

199
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 2>you're tied together so tightly that whatever happens to one inevitably happens</v>

200
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:45.861
<v Speaker 2>to the other.</v>

201
00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:46.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's true in,</v>

202
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 2>in the network reality that we all inhabit.</v>

203
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.970
<v Speaker 2>So then the,</v>

204
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 2>the terror thing emerges when you start to realize that those problems that you</v>

205
00:07:55.521 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 2>don't address that or may be magnified by your impulsive and foolishly self</v>

206
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 2>centered and instrumental behavior,</v>

207
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:06.140
<v Speaker 2>you're manipulating the world on behalf of your own narrow interests.</v>

208
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

209
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 2>we'll come back to haunt you.</v>

210
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a terrifying thing to think through.</v>

211
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.070
<v Speaker 2>But once you think through it and understand it,</v>

212
00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:19.610
<v Speaker 2>then what happens is you're more afraid of acting selfishly,</v>

213
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 2>then you are willing to do it.</v>

214
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

215
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.911
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

216
00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:23.744
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that.</v>

217
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

218
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Because I know all hell will break loose if I do that and I'm not going there.</v>

219
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 2>And so the terror element has a huge one.</v>

220
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:31.420
<v Speaker 2>It makes it,</v>

221
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:31.730
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

222
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

223
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.210
<v Speaker 2>it fortifies your cause you can't just act</v>

224
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:37.850
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

225
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the moral fortitude for that.</v>

226
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.070
<v Speaker 2>You can aim at the good and run from what's terrible,</v>

227
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 2>then you're,</v>

228
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 2>then you're motivated.</v>

229
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.193
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

230
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:51.853
<v Speaker 1>with your environment,</v>

231
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

232
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.480
<v Speaker 1>reaching out to your environment,</v>

233
00:08:56.481 --> 00:08:57.314
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it,</v>

234
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 1>that expenditure of energy rather as an investment?</v>

235
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:00.781
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

236
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:01.501
<v Speaker 2>It's an investment.</v>

237
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good way of putting it.</v>

238
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
