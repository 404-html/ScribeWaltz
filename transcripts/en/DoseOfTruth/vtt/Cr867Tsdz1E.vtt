1
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:06.741
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2
00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the psycho analyst and I liked the idea that you have a psyche</v>

3
00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:14.780
<v Speaker 1>that's inside of you and that that is structured in partly consciously and in</v>

4
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.280
<v Speaker 1>part conch unconsciously.</v>

5
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that that's really cool and I've learned a lot from the</v>

6
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:20.810
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalyst,</v>

7
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.711
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

8
00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:26.711
<v Speaker 1>there is a funny consequence of thinking the way they think and you do think the</v>

9
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:27.471
<v Speaker 1>way they think,</v>

10
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't know it.</v>

11
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Like we tend to think that a lot of us is inside our head.</v>

12
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the psyche model basically.</v>

14
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.270
<v Speaker 1>But the more I've practiced as a clinical psychologist,</v>

15
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.781
<v Speaker 1>the last,</v>

16
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I've actually been convinced that that's true.</v>

17
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.291
<v Speaker 1>So I could say,</v>

18
00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 1>let's say I want to know about your personality.</v>

20
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.011
<v Speaker 1>We think,</v>

21
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:46.131
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

22
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I want to know you.</v>

23
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I want to know about your subjectivity.</v>

24
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to know what's inside of you,</v>

25
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't actually what you do.</v>

26
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Want to know if,</v>

27
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

28
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing clinical work,</v>

29
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>say with someone you want to know,</v>

30
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.240
<v Speaker 1>did they have any friends?</v>

31
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.790
<v Speaker 1>That's really important because if you're miserable and anxious and badly placed</v>

32
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:06.830
<v Speaker 1>in life and misbehaving,</v>

33
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons that all of that can occur is because you don't have any</v>

34
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:10.941
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

35
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:11.774
<v Speaker 1>You don't know anyone,</v>

36
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>and that's not something that's inside you.</v>

37
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

38
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>it's you localized in a broader sphere.</v>

39
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:19.911
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

40
00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:20.151
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

41
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:20.984
<v Speaker 1>do you have job?</v>

42
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>And while let's talk about the job,</v>

43
00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 1>do you actually make enough money with your job?</v>

44
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Is it satisfying for you in any way?</v>

45
00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Are you bullied all the time?</v>

46
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:29.804
<v Speaker 1>When you're at work?</v>

47
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Does it provoke anxiety?</v>

48
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Is it a career that allows you to go somewhere?</v>

49
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Are you overworked?</v>

50
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.850
<v Speaker 1>but let's start with just the first question.</v>

52
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a job?</v>

53
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>if the answer to that is no,</v>

55
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.600
<v Speaker 1>you have a serious problem and that would enough,</v>

56
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.470
<v Speaker 1>might be too depressed you and make you anxious and hopeless and nihilistic and</v>

57
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:49.304
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

58
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.331
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

59
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:50.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>you're not reacting very well to not having a job.</v>

61
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.580
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of a foolish objection.</v>

62
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Even though some of it might be true.</v>

63
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.270
<v Speaker 1>One problem is,</v>

64
00:01:58.271 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>is that you're not reacting very well to not having a job,</v>

65
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>but in other problem is that you don't have a job and that actually constitutes</v>

66
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:05.414
<v Speaker 1>a problem,</v>

67
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

68
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to eat.</v>

69
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a place to live.</v>

70
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.640
<v Speaker 1>So those aren't psychological problems.</v>

71
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:11.181
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>

72
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Even though a psychological problem could make it worse.</v>

73
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Well are you as educated as you should be?</v>

74
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.290
<v Speaker 1>That's another question.</v>

75
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>How do you handle drugs and alcohol?</v>

76
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Are they taking you down a bad pathway?</v>

77
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.113
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

78
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.043
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

79
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.390
<v Speaker 1>what about intimate relationships?</v>

80
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.283
<v Speaker 1>We have one,</v>

81
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.960
<v Speaker 1>you have a plan for one or they,</v>

82
00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:32.270
<v Speaker 1>is that a never ending series of catastrophes or something that you avoid</v>

83
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:33.104
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

84
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>

85
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 1>And maybe people don't,</v>

86
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.060
<v Speaker 1>aren't attracted to you for one reason or another.</v>

87
00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:40.430
<v Speaker 1>And you could think about that as a psychological problem,</v>

88
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's an interpersonal problem.</v>

89
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.070
<v Speaker 1>And the degree to which that's a psychological problem is,</v>

90
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.360
<v Speaker 1>is certainly an specified when you first begin to talk to somebody.</v>

91
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.590
<v Speaker 1>What about your family?</v>

92
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a family?</v>

93
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's hard to be in the world all by yourself,</v>

94
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.233
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

95
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.160
<v Speaker 1>It makes things a lot more stressful.</v>

96
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Even though having a family can also be extraordinarily stressful.</v>

97
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

98
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>don't do you have plans to have children?</v>

99
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing with your parents?</v>

100
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you get along with your siblings?</v>

101
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

102
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

103
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>All of that to me is more fundamental and it's outside of you.</v>

104
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Those are elements of your experience more broadly conceptualized more than they</v>

105
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>are objects of your psychology or of your internal experience.</v>

106
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

107
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:23.304
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like</v>

108
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.111
<v Speaker 1>while a person is,</v>

109
00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:28.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.040
<v Speaker 1>is it is a creature that exists at multiple levels of analysis,</v>

111
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

112
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Something might go wrong with you at a cellular level,</v>

113
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:38.340
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you're born with a genetic abnormality,</v>

114
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.420
<v Speaker 1>so something's wrong with you molecularly or you have something wrong with a</v>

115
00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:43.260
<v Speaker 1>major organ.</v>

116
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe there's something wrong with you psychologically,</v>

117
00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:50.310
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're in a pathological family or maybe you're stuck in a pathological</v>

118
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:53.670
<v Speaker 1>social system and figuring out what's,</v>

119
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.840
<v Speaker 1>why you're suffering means going up and down those different levels.</v>

120
00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Trying to specify the appropriate level for analysis and also the appropriate</v>

121
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:02.850
<v Speaker 1>level for intervention.</v>

122
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.440
<v Speaker 1>And for me as a,</v>

123
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:05.071
<v Speaker 1>as I've said,</v>

124
00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:08.580
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm a great admirer of the psychoanalysts and I do things like dream</v>

125
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.061
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

126
00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:13.860
<v Speaker 1>which I really find you an incredibly useful and enlightening the first,</v>

127
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:15.450
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental level of analysis is,</v>

128
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:15.611
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

129
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:17.340
<v Speaker 1>what's your experience structured like?</v>

130
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.533
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

131
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't localized in you.</v>

132
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Now the behaviorists do that too because it's one of the things I really liked</v>

133
00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:26.280
<v Speaker 1>about the behavioral approach to psychotherapy.</v>

134
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:26.701
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

135
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 1>very concrete and practical.</v>

136
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:29.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like they'll say,</v>

137
00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:30.114
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

138
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.420
<v Speaker 1>there are certain things that you need to have in order to live properly and</v>

139
00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't have the skills or the wherewithal wherewithal to accumulate</v>

140
00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:40.140
<v Speaker 1>them and we'll break them down into tiny little pieces and you'll practice.</v>

141
00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:41.010
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

142
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.990
<v Speaker 1>with someone who doesn't have any friends,</v>

143
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 1>then you do a micro analysis of their social skills,</v>

144
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:50.700
<v Speaker 1>say and maybe an analysis of the kinds of anxiety that are stopping them from</v>

145
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:52.140
<v Speaker 1>going out and meeting people.</v>

146
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.020
<v Speaker 1>And then you address those things practically one by one.</v>

147
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:56.820
<v Speaker 1>You tried to get the person to have some friends.</v>

148
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.240
<v Speaker 1>He tried to figure out how they can establish an intimate relationship.</v>

149
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.670
<v Speaker 1>You see if you can help them sort out their family,</v>

150
00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:04.560
<v Speaker 1>you do what you can about their employment.</v>

151
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:08.910
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's only tangentially related to really in some sense to the</v>

152
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:10.050
<v Speaker 1>structure of their psyche.</v>

153
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.970
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you'll see if you work as a clinician or as a counselor is</v>

154
00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:18.000
<v Speaker 1>that most of the time people come and see you because they have problems,</v>

155
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 1>not because they have psychological problems and those things are not that easy</v>

156
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:23.070
<v Speaker 1>to distinguish.</v>

157
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

158
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:25.400
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of the psychoanalytic idea,</v>

159
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.861
<v Speaker 1>sort of like,</v>

160
00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:26.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

161
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 1>if you just start your act together,</v>

162
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:28.860
<v Speaker 1>everything would work out for you.</v>

163
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

164
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.653
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

165
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.153
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

166
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.000
<v Speaker 1>there's some truth in that,</v>

167
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.733
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

168
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.193
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

169
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.161
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

170
00:05:40.161 --> 00:05:43.190
<v Speaker 1>if you're 55 years old and you've just been laid off work,</v>

171
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

172
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.520
<v Speaker 1>and maybe through no fault of your own,</v>

173
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

174
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.670
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious how much getting your act together,</v>

175
00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:53.390
<v Speaker 1>it's going to help you find another job because the,</v>

176
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>the actual problem that you're facing me have relatively to do with you.</v>

177
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>And that would especially be the case if you're maybe on the bottom half of the</v>

178
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>intelligence distribution for example.</v>

179
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't as easy for you just to go out and pick up new skills at the</v>

180
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 1>drop of a hat,</v>

181
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

182
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>And that gets harder as you get older because your Iq actually declines quite</v>

183
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 1>substantially as you get older.</v>

184
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 1>The working or the the fluid intelligence part anyways,</v>

185
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 1>exercise can keep that at bay,</v>

186
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:22.491
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

187
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>It's the best way to keep that at bay.</v>
