1
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.133
<v Speaker 1>Long suffering.</v>

2
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I was noticing from the stories of Jacob and a lot of</v>

3
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>these biblical narratives is you do have this all powerful God who is able to</v>

4
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>kind of essentially be the hidden protagonist in the narrative.</v>

5
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 1>But then the funny thing is that he's kind of revealing some of his qualities</v>

6
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>throughout the course of the story.</v>

7
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>So you were talking about,</v>

8
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.973
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 1>the weird paradox of the fact that God,</v>

10
00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:44.401
<v Speaker 1>somehow ally was Jacob Israel to win the fight and he does that with Abraham to,</v>

11
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

12
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>So my question is relating to pan seps thing about the rats that you told like</v>

13
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>three or four times and the number of occasions I saw when I got my recent</v>

14
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:53.311
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>

15
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>you talked about it where the bigger rat lets the smaller rat win because then</v>

16
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

17
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>the smaller rep won't engage in the game.</v>

18
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

19
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>is two fold for me.</v>

20
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>One is God allowing humanity to win periodically.</v>

21
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>So that's to allow us to actually engage in the dialogue through these stories</v>

22
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>

23
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>is it a much more primitive version of the virtue of humility?</v>

24
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Which you wouldn't normally characterize of an of an omnipotent,</v>

25
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>omnipotent day at [inaudible].</v>

26
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.981
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

27
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 2>those are excellent questions.</v>

28
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the second one in particular that that that God's decision to</v>

29
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 2>allow human victory from time to time is actually a manifestation of something</v>

30
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 2>approximating humility or at least mercy.</v>

31
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 2>But humility is an interesting take on it.</v>

32
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:45.371
<v Speaker 1>it's also connected to Paul's image of how Christ handed him hands himself over</v>

34
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>and allows himself to be defeated by men and therefore a conquers sin,</v>

35
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:52.160
<v Speaker 1>which is man's enemy.</v>

36
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird,</v>

37
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.250
<v Speaker 1>it's the same paradox where God enters into that dynamic with people and loses</v>

38
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>and willingly loses.</v>

39
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Well that's okay.</v>

41
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 2>So if the first thing I would say is that,</v>

42
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 2>that's a really interesting analogy.</v>

43
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

44
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.493
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

45
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.391
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

46
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:15.460
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated enough questions so that I can't go be,</v>

47
00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I can go beyond the question actually because it's so complicated</v>

48
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:22.070
<v Speaker 2>that I don't think I can formulate it any better than you already did.</v>

49
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.590
<v Speaker 2>Like it's an interesting string of ideas.</v>

50
00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:29.591
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to play with it a while to see it does shed interesting light on why</v>

51
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 2>God is amenable to negotiation in the Old Testament,</v>

52
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:35.660
<v Speaker 2>which is really a strange,</v>

53
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.531
<v Speaker 2>as you pointed out,</v>

54
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.580
<v Speaker 2>it's really a strange thing.</v>

55
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:42.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is omnipotent God who obviously can do whatever he wants and yet</v>

56
00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 2>he allowed,</v>

57
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.660
<v Speaker 2>he can be bargained with.</v>

58
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 2>And then that also opens up the question of why like your hypothesis as well.</v>

59
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 2>If you don't let the little rat win now and then,</v>

60
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 2>then they get dejected and quit playing.</v>

61
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

62
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

63
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty good observation if people don't get to win now and then,</v>

64
00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

65
00:02:59.591 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

66
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of what happens to cane.</v>

67
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.681
<v Speaker 2>God says,</v>

68
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 2>well you're not playing a straight game.</v>

69
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're not winning.</v>

70
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.573
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

71
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.243
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

72
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 2>there's an intimation in the old testament and I think it's more developed in</v>

73
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 2>the New Testament,</v>

74
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 2>maybe not that the straighter the game you play,</v>

75
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 2>the more likely you are to win.</v>

76
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.370
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe part of the reason that God lets Abraham bargain and even Jacob is</v>

77
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 2>because they've started to play very straight games.</v>

78
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe you do when you're wrestling with God if you play a straight game.</v>

79
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that's,</v>

80
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that's,</v>

81
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason that's true is because that's actually why we would define it</v>

82
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 2>as a street gate now.</v>

83
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Then we could speak psychologically.</v>

84
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

85
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I think that what we've come to recognize as a straight game is the game that in</v>

86
00:03:55.301 --> 00:04:00.301
<v Speaker 2>the broadest number of situations across the widest range of time spans is most</v>

87
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 2>likely to produce a positive outcome.</v>

88
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

89
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 2>that's actually the grounds for our sense of ethics that it's really practical.</v>

90
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Not to Belabor it too much because there was,</v>

91
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>there was an interesting insight from Chesterton's demand who was Thursday where</v>

92
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:19.261
<v Speaker 1>God sets himself up as the benevolent antagonist so as to accelerate the game.</v>

93
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

94
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.920
<v Speaker 2>Well I think that that's a really interesting idea.</v>

95
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is,</v>

96
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 2>there is hints I would say throughout the biblical stories that the reason that</v>

97
00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:34.160
<v Speaker 2>God tolerates Satan,</v>

98
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:34.641
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

99
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.310
<v Speaker 2>is because without an adversary,</v>

100
00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:38.300
<v Speaker 2>you're soft.</v>

101
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

102
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

103
00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:44.510
<v Speaker 2>that's tied in with the notion that life is something like a moral struggle.</v>

104
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

105
00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:48.200
<v Speaker 2>that that's the fundamental essence of being a moral struggle.</v>

106
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Now I think that that's phenomenologically a reasonable observation.</v>

107
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's maybe other people don't experience it that way,</v>

108
00:04:56.421 --> 00:05:00.770
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me like within my own experience that that's accurate.</v>

109
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.491
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

110
00:05:01.491 --> 00:05:02.061
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>

111
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:02.361
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

112
00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:05.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that says about the fundamental nature of reality,</v>

113
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 2>but I had a vision at one point that I was in a ring with Satan actually,</v>

114
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

115
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.213
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not.</v>

116
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.810
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

117
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.120
<v Speaker 2>it was like a Roman coliseum.</v>

118
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.460
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

119
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.790
<v Speaker 2>I was rather upset to find myself there,</v>

120
00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:23.690
<v Speaker 2>but I won.</v>

121
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.640
<v Speaker 2>And I asked God afterwards why he would do such a thing.</v>

122
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.510
<v Speaker 2>And his answer was he knew I could win.</v>

123
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.250
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

124
00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:34.461
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

125
00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:35.330
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>

126
00:05:35.331 --> 00:05:36.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to make of that.</v>

127
00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:37.041
<v Speaker 2>Believe me,</v>

128
00:05:37.041 --> 00:05:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what to make of that.</v>

129
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 2>But the idea was that if you're trying to encourage someone rather than protect</v>

130
00:05:45.981 --> 00:05:46.161
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

131
00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:47.510
<v Speaker 2>because those are really different things,</v>

132
00:05:47.511 --> 00:05:47.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

133
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.760
<v Speaker 2>To protect someone isn't to make them strong,</v>

134
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 2>to encourage them is to make them strong.</v>

135
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Then you set them a series of challenges,</v>

136
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.253
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

137
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.581
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

138
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:03.581
<v Speaker 2>At the point where they may win and maybe you could make a case that that's what</v>

139
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 2>you do if you really care for someone.</v>

140
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Now I know that that's it.</v>

141
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that that interpretation is correct.</v>

142
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

143
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

144
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

145
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 2>but there's something,</v>

146
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean you definitely with your children,</v>

147
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're wrestling with them,</v>

148
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 2>say when you're playing with them,</v>

149
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 2>you use,</v>

150
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.853
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

151
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Push them to the limit of their ability because otherwise they don't transcend</v>

152
00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:28.780
<v Speaker 2>their current abilities.</v>

153
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.603
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

154
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.900
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

155
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

156
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.640
<v Speaker 2>so we'll see some of you,</v>

157
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.360
<v Speaker 2>perhaps most of you in December and I think we'll finish off genesis at that</v>

158
00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:55.534
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

159
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.800
<v Speaker 2>And then in the new year,</v>

160
00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:58.600
<v Speaker 2>probably not till the spring,</v>

161
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll start with exodus,</v>

162
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.480
<v Speaker 2>which I'm really looking forward to because I really liked the exodus story.</v>

163
00:07:04.481 --> 00:07:07.390
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing story and unbelievably deep,</v>

164
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.360
<v Speaker 2>not well the ones we've covered so far,</v>

165
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.380
<v Speaker 2>pretty good as well.</v>

167
00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:14.820
<v Speaker 2>But so thank you all for coming and will perhaps see you in about it.</v>
