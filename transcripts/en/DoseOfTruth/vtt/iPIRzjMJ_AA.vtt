00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.423
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>so there's malevolence that has to be contended with.</v>

3
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And then the other element is that you have to contend with the tragedy of life.</v>

4
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's so in the,</v>

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>in the passion of the Christ did that and that story.</v>

6
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Christ of course encounters Satan and the desert.</v>

7
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>and he's tempted there.</v>

9
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the encounter with evil archetypically speaking.</v>

10
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>And then the crucifixion itself is the encounter with the tragedy of life,</v>

11
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:30.541
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>It's betrayal and death voluntarily accepted.</v>

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>And so I understood that that was a symbolic representation of the logos and</v>

14
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>that that was the they,</v>

15
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.101
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

16
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:46.101
<v Speaker 1>The embodied manifestation of this heroic path that mediated between these two</v>

17
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>extremes that was really useful.</v>

18
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Like that was a really useful discovery for me.</v>

19
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And because there was implications to it too,</v>

20
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

21
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>and profound implications that also seem to work out in relationship to what I</v>

22
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>was learning about clinical psychology.</v>

23
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.151
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

24
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:00.751
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

25
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you do if you're a clinical psychologist,</v>

26
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:08.451
<v Speaker 1>as you help people learn to encounter things that they're afraid of in a</v>

27
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>controlled manner,</v>

28
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>and they get less,</v>

29
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>they don't get less afraid,</v>

30
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>they get braver.</v>

31
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>So you actually act out the process of confrontation with tragedy,</v>

32
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>voluntary confrontation with tragedy.</v>

33
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's curative.</v>

34
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you're exposing them to their past or the present or things</v>

35
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>they're worried about in the future.</v>

36
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>As long as they decide to do it voluntarily,</v>

37
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>they get stronger and better.</v>

38
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.771
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>

39
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:28.891
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>what's the limit to that?</v>

41
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.100
<v Speaker 1>All the limit is to accept the limitations and catastrophes of your own</v>

42
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>mortality voluntarily.</v>

43
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

44
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>and that's the potentially the proper pathway through life,</v>

45
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>or at least it's the least bad pathway through life,</v>

46
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>which is something,</v>

47
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>and then I think the same can be said fairly decisively for the willingness to</v>

49
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>grapple with,</v>

50
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>with malevolence,</v>

51
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>on a personal and individual level,</v>

53
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

54
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>

55
00:01:57.691 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>I started to lecture about that and,</v>

56
00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

57
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>and to lay out those ideas more and more clearly over the years as I've been</v>

58
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:03.941
<v Speaker 1>lecturing.</v>

59
00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I did for TV Ontario.</v>

60
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's why the lectures became popular because,</v>

61
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd put some words to ideas that people already knew and could revitalize a</v>

63
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>symbolic vocabulary that people had become divorced from.</v>

64
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

65
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>and that there was a hole in the culture exactly where those ideas needed to be.</v>

66
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>And so people found that they were,</v>

67
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>people tell me when they come and talk to me,</v>

69
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:28.051
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

70
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:28.884
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

71
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.731
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking,</v>

72
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:30.151
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

73
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 1>I already know what you're saying,</v>

74
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have the words for it.</v>

75
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.021
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

76
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:34.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what our marketable story is like is that you all know the story.</v>

78
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.421
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know,</v>

79
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:40.910
<v Speaker 1>you know it or you know,</v>

80
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>at a level that you can't articulate,</v>

81
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>but you still recognize it when you see it and you still act it out and you see</v>

82
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>it in other people.</v>

83
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>But it's really,</v>

84
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:49.531
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

85
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:51.690
<v Speaker 1>really good to have the words.</v>

86
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why you should be very careful about what you say and</v>

87
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>particularly careful about what you write.</v>
