WEBVTT

1
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>So we were talking about your treatment at the hands,</v>

2
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:10.581
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

3
00:00:10.581 --> 00:00:11.620
<v Speaker 1>of Western feminists.</v>

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>And like I read infidel,</v>

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.700
<v Speaker 1>very shortly after you published it,</v>

7
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.941
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

8
00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

9
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.500
<v Speaker 1>I love that book man.</v>

10
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:19.790
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I read that I thought,</v>

11
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

12
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I used,</v>

13
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

14
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was remarkable.</v>

15
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:31.991
<v Speaker 1>I thought your comment on your comments on viewing Western culture from the</v>

16
00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 1>perspective of an immigrant that was how refer for genuine education and,</v>

17
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>and your comments on your,</v>

18
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.470
<v Speaker 1>your experience with the efficiency of the Dutch state say,</v>

19
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:44.570
<v Speaker 1>and you're sort of amazement at how well it worked.</v>

20
00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>That was just,</v>

21
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was so remarkable and clearheaded and I thought when I read</v>

22
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:49.971
<v Speaker 1>infidel I thought,</v>

23
00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.110
<v Speaker 1>this woman is immediately going to be a hero to feminists everywhere because</v>

25
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.980
<v Speaker 1>she's removed himself from this oppressive state and moved out into the world</v>

26
00:00:57.981 --> 00:00:59.510
<v Speaker 1>and become a powerful figure when,</v>

27
00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>what was the probability of that?</v>

28
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>It was like zero,</v>

29
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>and that you suffered as a consequence of your beliefs and you stood up</v>

31
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly for them.</v>

32
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:11.600
<v Speaker 1>And I thought if you wanted to find a feminist hero that you're certainly,</v>

33
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

34
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.470
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly in the running man for exactly that.</v>

35
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.750
<v Speaker 1>And then to see how you've been treated.</v>

36
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

37
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

38
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.230
<v Speaker 1>it just makes my jaw drop.</v>

39
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>You know that your dis,</v>

40
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.920
<v Speaker 1>especially what Brandeis did,</v>

41
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>it was Brandeis right where you were offered an honorary phd and then they</v>

42
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:28.034
<v Speaker 1>revoked it.</v>

43
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.203
<v Speaker 1>That just,</v>

44
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.470
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the,</v>

45
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that was almost as reprehensible,</v>

46
00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:37.541
<v Speaker 1>inactive cowardice as the West's basic abandonment of Solomon Rushdie after the</v>

47
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:38.911
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

48
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:41.780
<v Speaker 1>what was put on his head and about equally dangerous.</v>

49
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

50
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 2>it was multicultural.</v>

51
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

52
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.673
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>

53
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

54
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.781
<v Speaker 2>my message,</v>

55
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 2>my life story,</v>

56
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:49.694
<v Speaker 2>who I am,</v>

57
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a defiance of the prevalent trends of today.</v>

58
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.950
<v Speaker 2>It's against the law.</v>

59
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 2>I believe that Western values as superior to Islamic law and Islamic values,</v>

60
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 2>not to say that is to blast being in the temples of multiculturalism today.</v>

61
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.273
<v Speaker 2>And so I think,</v>

62
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 2>I hope we did a lot of people because it wasn't about what they think should</v>

63
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 2>happen for victims of misogyny.</v>

64
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all about the dissonance that my words and my,</v>

65
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.130
<v Speaker 2>my life and my beliefs,</v>

66
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.610
<v Speaker 2>the kind of decisions they put these women in.</v>

67
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're going or I'll say,</v>

68
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.540
<v Speaker 2>well it's horrible to be an American woman and then the surgeon in America is</v>

69
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:36.374
<v Speaker 2>worse than that.</v>

70
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.190
<v Speaker 2>No it's not right yet.</v>

71
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

72
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of interfering with their,</v>

73
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.443
<v Speaker 2>with their worldview.</v>

74
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>The claim that you're making there is something like this and it's really,</v>

75
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a really vicious claim in a sense and it's something like the western</v>

76
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>feminists who are possessed by postmodernism and cultural relativism are willing</v>

77
00:02:57.391 --> 00:03:02.391
<v Speaker 1>to sacrifice the freedom and equality of third world women in places like Saudi</v>

78
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Arabia to maintain the sanctity of their multicultural notion because that</v>

79
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>justifies their attack on western patriarchy they're willing to use.</v>

80
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

81
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.811
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

82
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:15.140
<v Speaker 1>that's an absolute pause.</v>

83
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh immigration.</v>

84
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.160
<v Speaker 2>There are so many men who are coming from these societies that at us men that</v>

85
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.690
<v Speaker 2>they're not used to the equality of</v>

86
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.140
<v Speaker 2>women inside the West.</v>

87
00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:30.030
<v Speaker 2>First of all they're all women,</v>

88
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.260
<v Speaker 2>child marriages,</v>

89
00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:32.880
<v Speaker 2>female genital mutilation,</v>

90
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.773
<v Speaker 2>honor killings.</v>

91
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.930
<v Speaker 2>But now we have these crepes and sexual harassment of non Muslim women and these</v>

92
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:45.561
<v Speaker 2>women keep on arguing for more integration and they didn't hear anything</v>

93
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.680
<v Speaker 2>negative about some of the negative impacts of immigration.</v>

94
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't consider them feminists anymore.</v>

95
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are so much more uh,</v>

96
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.290
<v Speaker 2>committed to preserving their world view,</v>

97
00:03:57.291 --> 00:04:00.480
<v Speaker 2>their post modernist worldview than they are to the heights of</v>

98
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.360
<v Speaker 1>well that's what it looks.</v>

99
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think like that,</v>

100
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:08.690
<v Speaker 1>that's how it looks to me is like this is the situation with Saudi Arabia is the</v>

101
00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:10.490
<v Speaker 1>one is the test case is like,</v>

102
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.350
<v Speaker 1>so you might say are the postmodern feminists types are the ones who present</v>

103
00:04:15.351 --> 00:04:15.980
<v Speaker 1>themselves as that,</v>

104
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.940
<v Speaker 1>are they more concerned with the rights of women or are they more concerned with</v>

105
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.430
<v Speaker 1>bringing down the so called tyranny of the West?</v>

106
00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:25.190
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is they're more concerned with the ladder than they are with the</v>

107
00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:25.551
<v Speaker 1>former.</v>

108
00:04:25.551 --> 00:04:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Because when you put them head to head,</v>

109
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.860
<v Speaker 1>those dispense with the rights of women across the world.</v>

110
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.850
<v Speaker 1>As long as they can maintain their moral justification for the radical bleeps.</v>

111
00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:37.430
<v Speaker 1>And I do think that is why they go after you because you're,</v>

112
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>you're exactly the reprehensible exemplar of what it is that they're attempting</v>

113
00:04:43.401 --> 00:04:44.234
<v Speaker 1>to deny,</v>

114
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.193
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

115
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.720
<v Speaker 1>and I think that does show their true motivations.</v>

116
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.123
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

117
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Out of time.</v>

118
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a lot of signals here that I should,</v>

119
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 2>I should hang up now,</v>

120
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.741
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

121
00:04:55.741 --> 00:05:00.170
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed talking to you and I hope that in some way I've contributed to</v>

122
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.270
<v Speaker 2>to the message that you want to get out of there.</v>

123
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

124
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll stop with this.</v>

125
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll give one 30 seconds.</v>

126
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:06.934
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell you what,</v>

127
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 1>what are doing with this?</v>

128
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have arranged with a group of moderate Muslims in Canada and some in</v>

129
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>the u s as well to start a series of dialogues like the one that we had today</v>

130
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>because this isn't really viciously important problem and so I want to use this</v>

131
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>as the opener for that.</v>

132
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I would like to go after this issue of whether or not a real dialogue could be</v>

133
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:31.711
<v Speaker 1>begun between the Judeo Christian West and the Islam world with some hope of not</v>

134
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>having all of this devolve into endless and continual warfare.</v>

135
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Because as far as I can tell,</v>

136
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>that's where it's headed.</v>

137
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

138
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.261
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's headed.</v>

139
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

140
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

141
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I hope we'll get a chance to talk again.</v>

142
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

143
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.790
