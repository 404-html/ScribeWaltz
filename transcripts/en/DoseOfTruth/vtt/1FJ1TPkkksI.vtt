1
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing</v>

2
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of going through these</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories is that</v>

3
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which there are about</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals is quite remarkable and I</v>

4
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:24.130
<v Speaker 1>think that's really telling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons I prefer Dostoyevsky</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tolstoy because Tolstoy is more of a</v>

6
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:32.560
<v Speaker 1>sociologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's more interested in the relationship</v>

7
00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 1>between groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an oversimplification because</v>

8
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>obviously Tolstoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a great author,</v>

9
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:40.060
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Dostoyevsky better because he</v>

10
00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>really delves into the souls of</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals and I think it's remarkable</v>

11
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which all of the stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've covered so far in genesis are</v>

12
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 1>about individuals and they're quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic,</v>

13
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.030
<v Speaker 1>which is quite remarkable too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not really romanticize to any</v>

14
00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 1>great degree because all of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are regardless,</v>

15
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say as patriarchal or matriarchal</v>

16
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:07.990
<v Speaker 1>figures in genesis have no shortage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical,</v>

17
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no shortage of ethical flaws and also no</v>

18
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:14.470
<v Speaker 1>shortage of difficulties in their life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the difficulties are realistic</v>

19
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

20
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>They're major league problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:22.291
<v Speaker 1>like familial catastrophes and famine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and war and revenge and hatred and all</v>

22
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:23.680
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>

23
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>it's not a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a pretty book and that's one of</v>

24
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:31.120
<v Speaker 1>the things that makes it great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the things that</v>

25
00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>characterize this great literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

26
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:34.540
<v Speaker 1>is that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't present you with a</v>

27
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.790
<v Speaker 1>whitewashed view of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

28
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 1>of humanity or of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really a relief I think,</v>

29
00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Speaker 1>because as you all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're alive,</v>

30
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as a whitewash</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence like your to be alive is to be</v>

31
00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 1>in trouble ethically and existentially.</v>

32
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I've been reading this book recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk about it a little bit later.</v>

33
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:05.451
<v Speaker 1>It's called better never to have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was written by a philosopher in</v>

34
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>South Africa in Cape Town named Ben</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atar,</v>

35
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>that's his last name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he basically argues,</v>

36
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a specious argument and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's artificially constructed,</v>

37
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>but he basically argues that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is so full of suffering,</v>

38
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>even good lives are very much full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

39
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>That it's wrong to bring children into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world because the suffering</v>

40
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>outweighs the good even in good lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually wrong.</v>

41
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>It would also be better not to exist for</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same reason.</v>

42
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>And my sense in reading the book is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came to that conclusion and then</v>

43
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>wrote the book to justify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually the reverse of the way</v>

44
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>that you should write a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you should do when you're writing a</v>

45
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>book is you should have a question and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>

46
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>it should be a real question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

47
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 1>It should be one you don't know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to.</v>

48
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>And then you should be studying and</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing like mad and reading everything</v>

49
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>you can get your hands on to see if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually grapple with the problem</v>

50
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>and come to some solution and you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk the reader as well through your</v>

51
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>process of thinking so that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to the,</v>

52
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessary to the same conclusion,</v>

53
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>but it at least track what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that's what he did.</v>

54
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I think he wrote it backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then an a and so I was thinking</v>

55
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:26.131
<v Speaker 1>about it a lot because that's actually a</v>
<v Speaker 1>question that I've contended with in my</v>

56
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.680
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are Memphis to Ophelia and are</v>

57
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 1>satanic figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

58
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>in girth is Faust and also Ivan in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

59
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>in the brothers Karamazov who basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the same case,</v>

60
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that existence is so rife with trouble</v>

61
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>and suffering that it would be better if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't exist at all.</v>

62
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 1>And the problem I've had with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of them,</v>

63
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>but one of the problems I've had with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what happens if you start to</v>

64
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>think that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what I've observed is that</v>

65
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>people who begin to think that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't where they stop.</v>

66
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get angry at existence,</v>

67
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>which is what happened to Cain as we saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Cain and Abel Story.</v>

68
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>And then the next step is to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking revenge against existence.</v>

69
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>And that cascades until it's revenge</v>
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>

70
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 1>While I think the best way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it as revenge against God for the</v>

71
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>crime of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I think the deepest sort of</v>

72
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:20.840
<v Speaker 1>hatred that you can entertain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

73
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're in the grip of a really</v>

74
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>deep emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a really profound emotion,</v>

75
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>right at the bottom of emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in something that's like a quasi</v>

76
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>religious state.</v>

77
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's more or less independent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your belief,</v>

78
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>say in a transcendent deity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

79
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>you can be in a profoundly emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>state that's as deep as it can be and it</v>

80
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 1>can have religious significance without</v>
<v Speaker 1>that necessarily signifying anything</v>

81
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>about a transcendent be it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I was thinking,</v>

83
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that argument is you</v>

84
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 1>can gerrymander it endlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

85
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:53.500
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you measure suffering and how do</v>

86
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>you measure happiness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how do you assign weights to</v>

87
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God,</v>

88
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 1>there's just no way of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do it arbitrarily.</v>

89
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>And so you can make an argument that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering outweighs the happiness.</v>

90
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>You just wait the suffering more heavily</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you wait the happiness.</v>

91
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

92
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

93
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's a deeper problem.</v>
