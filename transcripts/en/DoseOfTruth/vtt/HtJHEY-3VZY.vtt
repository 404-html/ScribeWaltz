1
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.323
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.003
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.940
<v Speaker 1>so Sarah dies.</v>

4
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Abraham makes a bargain with the</v>

5
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>hittites to purchase a burial place for her and they offer it as a gift and he</v>

6
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>insists upon paying for it.</v>

7
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a little story that basically indicates two things that Abraham was the</v>

8
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>kind of guy that you trust pretty much when you see him and that even if</v>

9
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>something is offered to them as a gift,</v>

10
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>he's going to do everything to be reciprocal about it.</v>

11
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not a massively important part of the story,</v>

12
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's in keeping with the same narrative flow.</v>

13
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>And so if Ron,</v>

14
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>who's a hittite,</v>

15
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>offers a burial place as a gift and Abraham says,</v>

16
00:00:58.951 --> 00:00:59.161
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

17
00:00:59.161 --> 00:00:59.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>you have to let me pay for it,</v>

19
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>and everyone says he will.</v>

20
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>And that works out very well.</v>

21
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>And so he has a good burrito place for his wife.</v>

22
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.953
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

23
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Abraham decides that Isaac needs a wife.</v>

24
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.020
<v Speaker 1>And so he sends his eldest servant to miss a potassium.</v>

25
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.780
<v Speaker 1>You have to find a wife for Isaac.</v>

26
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:24.614
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

27
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>there's this strange ritual that's performed.</v>

28
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:32.961
<v Speaker 1>So it says in the story that the servant places his hand under Abraham's thigh</v>

29
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:33.894
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

30
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>to swear,</v>

31
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't really what it means.</v>

32
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:41.931
<v Speaker 1>It means that he places his hand don't know exactly how to say this properly.</v>

33
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>use your imagination.</v>

35
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:45.054
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

36
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that as far as I can tell that he's swearing on the future,</v>

37
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>he swearing on future people.</v>

38
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

39
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:54.041
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

40
00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>that sort of what testified means,</v>

41
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:56.334
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Think about the route while I'm not kidding,</v>

43
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.113
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

44
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>That is what that is the derivation,</v>

45
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:02.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>If it is the derivation.</v>

47
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.093
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

48
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.581
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

49
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:06.414
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.081
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

51
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>this is a serious issue.</v>

52
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And so that servant has to go and find Isaac,</v>

53
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>a good wife and he wants him to find Isaac,</v>

54
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:19.461
<v Speaker 1>a wife who is willing to accept the same fundamental belief system,</v>

55
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>which is something like the belief in a God that's a unity rather than a</v>

56
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:24.354
<v Speaker 1>plurality.</v>

57
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that young was very insistent upon was that there was a</v>

59
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>relationship between</v>

60
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.990
<v Speaker 1>polytheism and psychological confusion and monotheism and psychological</v>

61
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:39.020
<v Speaker 1>unification.</v>

62
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that idea too,</v>

63
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>that you know that that what you're trying to do,</v>

64
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:45.200
<v Speaker 1>because you are a plurality,</v>

65
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:48.170
<v Speaker 1>that that's one of the things the psychoanalysts were really good at figuring</v>

66
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 1>out that the cognitive scientists haven't touched yet as far as I can tell</v>

67
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:55.310
<v Speaker 1>they're way behind the psychoanalysts and that element of thinking is that you</v>

68
00:02:55.311 --> 00:03:00.311
<v Speaker 1>are composed of sub personalities which all have their own desires and their own</v>

69
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:01.010
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint,</v>

70
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>their own thoughts and their own perceptions and they're in a war with each</v>

71
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>other constantly,</v>

72
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe even a Darwinian war.</v>

73
00:03:08.851 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It's been.</v>

74
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.280
<v Speaker 1>It's been portrayed that way by certain neuroscientists and that that one of the</v>

75
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.220
<v Speaker 1>goals of life is to integrate all of that plurality into a hierarchical ethical</v>

76
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>structure that has some canonical ethic at the pinnacle.</v>

77
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

78
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>We've talked a little bit about that and it's not obvious what should be at the</v>

79
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:31.331
<v Speaker 1>pinnacle,</v>

80
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>but we can guess at it.</v>

81
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.081
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

82
00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>It's that which we admire.</v>

83
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

84
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>It's that that describes fairplay across a sequence of games.</v>

85
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 1>That's another good way of thinking about it.</v>

86
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:43.260
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

87
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 1>It's the heroic ideal.</v>

88
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it,</v>

89
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's combined with generosity,</v>

90
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.880
<v Speaker 1>because the hero,</v>

92
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>the mythological hero goes out into the unknown and slays the dragon and gets</v>

93
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.333
<v Speaker 1>the gold,</v>

94
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>but then it comes back to the community and distributes what's found.</v>

95
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>And so it's courage plus generosity and um,</v>

96
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>and so all of your,</v>

97
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.670
<v Speaker 1>all of that interior struggling that you're doing is an attempt to bang yourself</v>

98
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>against the world with challenge constantly to hit everything together.</v>

99
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Like you're beating on a piece of iron to,</v>

100
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

101
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

102
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>to cure it,</v>

103
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.174
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

104
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>so that you don't,</v>

105
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>you're not an internal contradiction.</v>

106
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>You're not massive competing God,</v>

107
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 1>something like that because it's just too psychologically stressful and hard on</v>

108
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>everyone else and impossible for them to get along with you,</v>

109
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:33.431
<v Speaker 1>with your one thing,</v>

110
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>one moment and another thing,</v>

111
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 1>another moment.</v>

112
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

113
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.981
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

114
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:43.981
<v Speaker 1>Abraham insists that Isaac find a wife from among people who are likely to carry</v>

115
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>off forward the monotheistic tradition.</v>

116
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not sure that the monotheistic tradition is actually indistinguishable,</v>

117
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>is actually distinguishable from the individualistic tradition.</v>

118
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I think they might be the same thing at different levels of analysis,</v>

119
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>so because the individual means and divided in some sense,</v>

121
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:03.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

122
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:08.791
<v Speaker 1>To be an individual means to be one thing and the other thing that mitigates</v>

123
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:12.760
<v Speaker 1>against the idea of life is happiness is it isn't obvious to me that it's</v>

124
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:13.421
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

125
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 1>That is what molds you and shapes you.</v>

126
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:16.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

127
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>it's something more like optimal challenge voluntarily undertaken.</v>

128
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

129
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.761
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

130
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's echoed in the idea that everyone has a moral obligation to</v>

131
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>raise their cross,</v>

132
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

133
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>to accept the fact of their mortality voluntarily.</v>

134
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I believe that that's the case and I do actually think that that's a</v>

135
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>prerequisite to proper psychological development because if you're not willing</v>

136
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>to take your mortality on voluntarily,</v>

137
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 1>like if you're kicking and fighting about it constantly and you have every</v>

138
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>reason to don't get me wrong,</v>

139
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>then you can't act forthrightly in the world.</v>

140
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.731
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

141
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be afraid and when you're afraid,</v>

142
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>then you can't voluntarily take on a.</v>

143
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>and then if you can't take voluntarily take on a challenge,</v>

144
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>then you can't develop.</v>

145
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>And so again,</v>

146
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 1>the life seems to be something like if it's a proper life,</v>

147
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:10.751
<v Speaker 1>is the voluntarily voluntary taking on of great challenges and maybe that's</v>

148
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 1>better than happiness.</v>

149
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>I can certainly more noble,</v>

150
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>it's not a word we use very much anymore.</v>

152
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 1>The idea of nobility because we're so obsessed with happiness.</v>

153
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>But I think happiness is a,</v>

154
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 1>like if it comes along,</v>

155
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:23.421
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

156
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:23.800
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

157
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>

159
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.723
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

160
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>don't take it lightly or for granted because it's fleeting.</v>

161
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.620
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that that's what you should be for in some sense to seems to me if,</v>

162
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>if that's what life is for than maybe it shouldn't be.</v>

163
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's correct because that isn't what life is,</v>

164
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>but it also doesn't.</v>

165
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.950
<v Speaker 1>It isn't obvious to me that that's what life should be,</v>

166
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.830
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

167
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

168
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.140
<v Speaker 1>if you really love someone like,</v>

169
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.941
<v Speaker 1>like your son,</v>

170
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:50.774
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

171
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.861
<v Speaker 1>would you say,</v>

172
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:53.450
<v Speaker 1>well I hope he has a happy life,</v>

173
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.463
<v Speaker 1>or would you say,</v>

174
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I hope he accomplishes great things.</v>

175
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that that's better than the accomplishing of great things.</v>

176
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>And because that's admirable,</v>

177
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like a happy person is a happy person,</v>

179
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:10.190
<v Speaker 1>but a noble person has an admirable person and,</v>

180
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

181
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 1>that's better man.</v>

182
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe there are better things than happiness.</v>

183
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't judge being on the basis of the ratio of suffering to pleasure,</v>

184
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.011
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

185
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

186
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think we do that.</v>

187
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe we do that.</v>
