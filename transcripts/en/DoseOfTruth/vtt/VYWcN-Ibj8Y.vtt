1
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.311
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:10.520
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about Heterodox Academy because you set that up,</v>

3
00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:15.110
<v Speaker 1>this organization that you should tell everybody about it precisely to deal with</v>

4
00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:15.591
<v Speaker 1>this issue.</v>

5
00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:16.424
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd like,</v>

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.690
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know about,</v>

7
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.290
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

8
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.130
<v Speaker 1>how it's growing,</v>

9
00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:19.821
<v Speaker 1>what it's doing,</v>

10
00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>what your aims are,</v>

11
00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:21.271
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

12
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.270
<v Speaker 1>So I gave this talk in 2011 laying out the fact that we have no more</v>

14
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>conservatives and social psychology and why this makes it hard for us to find</v>

15
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:30.884
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

16
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

17
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>in the months after that,</v>

19
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:35.090
<v Speaker 1>a few social psychologists resonated with the message.</v>

20
00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:35.391
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

21
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:35.661
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

22
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:36.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

23
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.741
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

24
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:37.574
<v Speaker 1>I have some data on this.</v>

25
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 1>So the five of us,</v>

26
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>six of us,</v>

27
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.953
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.250
<v Speaker 1>wrote this paper.</v>

30
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>It came out in behavioral and brain sciences.</v>

31
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

33
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.911
<v Speaker 1>Charlotte is stern.</v>

34
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:47.151
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

35
00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>what's the sixth one that I forgot to add in before?</v>

36
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.033
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.370
<v Speaker 1>we got this paper published and behave and brain sciences.</v>

38
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.330
<v Speaker 1>It came out,</v>

39
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of online in 2014.</v>

40
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

41
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>but it came out for good in the summer 2015,</v>

42
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.670
<v Speaker 1>which coincidentally was the same summer that my article came out with Greg</v>

43
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Lukey on off of the coddling of the American mind.</v>

44
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 1>That was about things going on with undergrads.</v>

45
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.480
<v Speaker 1>But our concern was entirely faculty.</v>

46
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:11.180
<v Speaker 1>It was just the nature of the academic community,</v>

47
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>the research community.</v>

48
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.640
<v Speaker 1>So we've got these two things going on.</v>

49
00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Summer of 2015.</v>

50
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 1>and then that summer I hear from Nick Rosenkranz,</v>

52
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.890
<v Speaker 1>a law professor who says we had the same problem in law,</v>

53
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.870
<v Speaker 1>lost worse in law.</v>

54
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>it's really bad Canada.</v>

56
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

57
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

58
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>and as he points out,</v>

59
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.870
<v Speaker 1>we're training all these students,</v>

60
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.820
<v Speaker 1>they never meet a conservative.</v>

61
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Then they have to go argue cases in front of judges,</v>

62
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>half of whom were appointed by Republicans.</v>

63
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea what a conservative thinks.</v>

64
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:39.740
<v Speaker 1>This is malpractice.</v>

65
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:40.401
<v Speaker 1>We got a train.</v>

66
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

67
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Speaker 1>and I hear from a sociologist Chris Martins,</v>

68
00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:43.970
<v Speaker 1>same thing in sociology.</v>

69
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>So the three of us said,</v>

70
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:45.261
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

71
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.680
<v Speaker 1>this is a big problem for the whole account.</v>

73
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Have you looked at faculties of education?</v>

74
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.771
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

75
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>my job.</v>

76
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Those are the worst by worst.</v>

77
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the numbers,</v>

78
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.740
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of the vindictiveness that the incredible pressure put on any</v>

79
00:01:57.741 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>nonconforming opinion.</v>

80
00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

81
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.261
<v Speaker 1>my impression,</v>

82
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:00.741
<v Speaker 1>I don't have data,</v>

83
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>but my impression from the letters I get is that,</v>

84
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>education schools and social work schools are the worst.</v>

86
00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:09.170
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly in keeping with my,</v>

87
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.460
<v Speaker 1>my understanding as well,</v>

88
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell which of those two or worst,</v>

89
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's the faculties of education because they have a direct pipeline</v>

90
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>to kit and in terms of their effect,</v>

91
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

92
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>farmer pernicious.</v>

93
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

94
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.971
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

95
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:20.241
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

96
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.720
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

98
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 1>but equally equally warped let's say,</v>

99
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:23.360
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

100
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.780
<v Speaker 1>but more pernicious and the things that are happening in the Canadian education</v>

101
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:29.210
<v Speaker 1>system as a consequence of that or so reprehensible,</v>

102
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.910
<v Speaker 1>we should get to that because it's happening here too with these ideas filtered</v>

103
00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:32.744
<v Speaker 1>down to high school.</v>

104
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I've been so focused on college now we're discovering the problem is actually</v>

105
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:37.401
<v Speaker 1>baked in.</v>

106
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>The liberal attitudes are often baked in by the time they arrived.</v>

107
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.600
<v Speaker 1>And purposefully,</v>

108
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:41.991
<v Speaker 1>like in,</v>

109
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:42.651
<v Speaker 1>in Canada,</v>

110
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:44.230
<v Speaker 1>increasingly the,</v>

111
00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

112
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.840
<v Speaker 1>the radical leftists have control over curriculum development and they're</v>

113
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>starting to develop social justice curriculums,</v>

114
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.110
<v Speaker 1>which is what they call them for kindergarten kids.</v>

115
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's really,</v>

116
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.770
<v Speaker 1>let's finish up with heterodox academy that we'll get back to the earlier</v>

117
00:02:57.771 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 1>grades.</v>

118
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.711
<v Speaker 1>So a,</v>

119
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>so originally three of us decided to put up a website.</v>

120
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>I invited all the other authors from the,</v>

121
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:03.351
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

122
00:03:03.351 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>the bbs paper.</v>

123
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>We invited a few other people working on this.</v>

124
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.780
<v Speaker 1>And so for the first year we had this project,</v>

125
00:03:08.781 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>it was called heterodoxacademy.org uh,</v>

126
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>we put the site up on about September 10th,</v>

127
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:19.021
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 2015 and it was just a community of researchers who are studying</v>

128
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>the problem of the lack of viewpoint diversity.</v>

129
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

130
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>five days later,</v>

131
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>the protest start at Missouri.</v>

132
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:31.531
<v Speaker 1>So these are racially motivated protest or protest about racial insensitivity</v>

133
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>and racial problems at Missouri.</v>

134
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

135
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>and at first it seems like this is just a Missouri Prom.</v>

136
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>But coming in the wake of course of of Ferguson and all the videos we saw of,</v>

137
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>of unarmed black men being killed by police,</v>

138
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

139
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these concerns spread to other universities.</v>

140
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>The purchase aren't just about race,</v>

141
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 1>but it was that fall of 2015,</v>

142
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>especially the Yale protest.</v>

143
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.811
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

144
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>when the president of Yale validates their narrative that Yale's are racist</v>

145
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:56.951
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

146
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>we have to reform Yale.</v>

147
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

148
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>then it spreads nationally and now suddenly this is not just a faculty issue</v>

149
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

150
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.820
<v Speaker 1>So even though it Heterodox Academy,</v>

151
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 1>we're mostly focused on the faculty,</v>

152
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>we're now seeing it's a complex ecosystem with all kinds of forces acting on</v>

153
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:10.504
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>

154
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 1>So that between 2015 and 2017,</v>

155
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>the danger of speaking honestly about what you think about an academic</v>

156
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>intellectual proposition has skyrocketed the risk of being mobbed,</v>

157
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.793
<v Speaker 1>ostracized,</v>

158
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.890
<v Speaker 1>formally investigated by title nine people for Headline People here,</v>

159
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>we're sitting here at Nyu,</v>

160
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>go to any bathroom.</v>

161
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you a on this floor,</v>

162
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>go to any bathroom.</v>

163
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a sign telling students exactly what number to call to report you or me</v>

164
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 1>if we say something that is that someone takes to be a bias act.</v>

165
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

166
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>so you have bias,</v>

167
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 1>you have bias investigation teams here.</v>

168
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.560
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

169
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.751
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

170
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>we haven't gotten to that point,</v>

171
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 1>that particular point in Canada yet.</v>

172
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>So I think we're farther ahead down that path in some ways,</v>

173
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:54.750
<v Speaker 1>but not quite as far and others.</v>

174
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.091
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

175
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:55.691
<v Speaker 1>that's really,</v>

176
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>that's really unbelievable.</v>

177
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 1>So things are changing very,</v>

178
00:04:57.971 --> 00:04:58.631
<v Speaker 1>very fast.</v>

179
00:04:58.631 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not at all schools.</v>

180
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

181
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>things are changing so fast.</v>

182
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:02.531
<v Speaker 1>We don't really know.</v>

183
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 1>We don't have good data on what's going on.</v>

184
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>What I can tell you though is that at Heterodox Academy,</v>

185
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>when we started out in 2015,</v>

186
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.680
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of suspicion.</v>

187
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people on the left were afraid like,</v>

188
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.231
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

189
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 1>is this some right wing group?</v>

190
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

191
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>very few of us are actually on the right.</v>

192
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

193
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 1>but because we end up mostly speaking up for Libertarians and conservatives who</v>

194
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>are attacked or silenced,</v>

195
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:25.391
<v Speaker 1>people will think,</v>

197
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:25.511
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

198
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:26.291
<v Speaker 1>we must be right wing,</v>

199
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:26.801
<v Speaker 1>but we're not.</v>

200
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:27.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

201
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

202
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I've never voted for a Republican in my life.</v>

203
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I'd never given money to Republican campaign.</v>

204
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

205
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm now increasingly calling myself a liberal now that we see illiberalism</v>

206
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:36.784
<v Speaker 1>flourishing.</v>

207
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

208
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.010
<v Speaker 1>but so when we started out,</v>

209
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of suspicion of us from many professors,</v>

210
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 1>but now that it's clear that the problems,</v>

211
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 1>these are not just a few anecdotes.</v>

212
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:50.730
<v Speaker 1>This is the new normal and it's not just in the university.</v>

213
00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>So as you pointed out,</v>

214
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.353
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

215
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.353
<v Speaker 1>It's spreading.</v>

216
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just in the U S it's spread in 2015 I it was uniquely American</v>

217
00:05:57.981 --> 00:05:58.341
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

218
00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

219
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Employee.</v>

220
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>It's in Canada and the UK and Australia.</v>

221
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.061
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand.</v>

222
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

223
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.210
<v Speaker 1>It is a uniquely anglosphere problem.</v>

224
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.971
<v Speaker 1>This is really interesting.</v>

225
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not on the continent very much at all.</v>

226
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>What about in the Nordic countries?</v>

227
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

228
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have,</v>

229
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>so political correctness,</v>

230
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.970
<v Speaker 1>you have lots of places that unique thing that identifies this new culture is</v>

231
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>linking the political correctness with the sense of fragility.</v>

232
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 1>And this is something America's pioneered,</v>

233
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>the idea of that.</v>

234
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.721
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

235
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

236
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.771
<v Speaker 1>in Britain,</v>

237
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>they've always had a no platforming.</v>

238
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>They call it.</v>

239
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>So if there's an end,</v>

240
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 1>there was an Afro British national parties and Actual Fascist party,</v>

241
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 1>so if,</v>

243
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 1>if a BNP member is going to speak on campus,</v>

244
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.171
<v Speaker 1>you mob him,</v>

245
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:36.831
<v Speaker 1>you shut it down,</v>

246
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 1>no Plat,</v>

247
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>don't give him a platform.</v>

248
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

249
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

250
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>you've had passionate politics certainly since the 60s.</v>

251
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:43.311
<v Speaker 1>So that's not new.</v>

252
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:44.144
<v Speaker 1>And that's everywhere.</v>

253
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

254
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>what's newest,</v>

255
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.800
<v Speaker 1>the American idea that if someone says something and it could be a sincerely</v>

256
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:51.741
<v Speaker 1>expressed idea,</v>

257
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 1>not a racist rant,</v>

258
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.013
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

259
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

260
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:54.681
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

261
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that maybe hormones do affect gendered behavior.</v>

262
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Can you say that?</v>

263
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

264
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>what if someone takes that as,</v>

265
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 1>as somehow essentially using gender and then saying that women are inferior or</v>

266
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:08.841
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

267
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>if they know what happened to James Damore for exactly.</v>

268
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

269
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

270
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

271
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

272
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 1>so that's what's new is the idea that if someone says something that someone,</v>

273
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>a member of a protected or marginalized group is offended by,</v>

274
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:22.610
<v Speaker 1>that person is harmed.</v>

275
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 1>If that person is harmed,</v>

276
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>we must protect that person and more ominously just in the last year or two.</v>

277
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that they're harming their suffering,</v>

278
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 1>it's that this was violence,</v>

279
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

280
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

281
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:35.470
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the postmodern narratives that</v>

282
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.821
<v Speaker 1>is so dangerous.</v>

283
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:37.950
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

284
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.231
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

285
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 1>the crossing the line into,</v>

286
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.393
<v Speaker 1>into violence.</v>

287
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.031
<v Speaker 1>It just occurred to me,</v>

288
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:41.571
<v Speaker 1>just like yesterday,</v>

289
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this,</v>

290
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

291
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 1>the state is supposed to have a monopoly on violence,</v>

292
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

293
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 1>But if speech,</v>

294
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:50.150
<v Speaker 1>especially his speech and her speech and the people,</v>

295
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 1>the speech of those people in that academic movement or on the,</v>

296
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:54.670
<v Speaker 1>and that if their speeches,</v>

297
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.101
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

298
00:07:55.101 --> 00:08:00.101
<v Speaker 1>well the state is supposed to have a monopoly on their speech then and um,</v>

299
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>and if it's violence,</v>

300
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 1>well then we have a right to use violence back.</v>

301
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 1>The state doesn't have a monopoly on violence cause our violence is,</v>

302
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

303
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 1>more and motivated.</v>

304
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.650
<v Speaker 1>So just the,</v>

305
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>the Orwellian and authoritarian implications of this move.</v>

306
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Once you say that speech is violence,</v>

307
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you're unlocking,</v>

308
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>you're opening Pandora's box.</v>

309
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:19.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

310
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

311
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 1>your five steps down the road to hell.</v>

312
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 1>And I'd say we're about seven steps down the road too.</v>

313
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

314
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.700
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

315
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.311
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

316
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:26.540
<v Speaker 1>you're that concerned about it.</v>
