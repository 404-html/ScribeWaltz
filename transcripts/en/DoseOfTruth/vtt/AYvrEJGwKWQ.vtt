1
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 1>There was one very important thing that had happened to me when I was 16 years</v>

2
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:12.111
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

3
00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Even though I was almost an unpopular kid in my school.</v>

4
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.340
<v Speaker 1>They voted me for two years in a row,</v>

5
00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>the chairman of the programming committee,</v>

6
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>which means I ran student assemblies five days a week and I program to a week.</v>

7
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.340
<v Speaker 1>so I was the emcee for these things.</v>

9
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>And one day that you,</v>

10
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>did you manage that and simultaneously be unpopular?</v>

11
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.060
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

13
00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>I think my school had verily very,</v>

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>my stool was school,</v>

15
00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:39.650
<v Speaker 1>was founded by an Acolyte of John Dewey and he was behind the scenes are</v>

16
00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 1>actually setting the school up and it,</v>

17
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>schools have their popularity positions,</v>

19
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:45.471
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

20
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:46.340
<v Speaker 1>vice president,</v>

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.031
<v Speaker 1>secretary,</v>

22
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>treasurer,</v>

23
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

24
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>But my school was clever enough to start putting functional teams committees</v>

25
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>together in your very first days at school,</v>

26
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>your very first days of your freshman year.</v>

27
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Now when you,</v>

28
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.510
<v Speaker 1>when you have kids vote for president and vice president the garden and vote for</v>

29
00:01:04.511 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>the most popular kid in the school as the precedent,</v>

30
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.440
<v Speaker 1>the second most popular kid,</v>

31
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>his vice president,</v>

32
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 1>the most popular girl as secretary,</v>

33
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>and the most popular Jewish treasurer.</v>

34
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way it goes.</v>

35
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.253
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>so I was never a line for any of those positions.</v>

37
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>I had no popularity whatsoever.</v>

38
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:21.151
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

39
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>one of my classmates actually fired with remarkable accuracy from only 23 of the</v>

40
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>way a soccer ball directly into my face.</v>

41
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.153
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

42
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>it has a lot of force.</v>

43
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.983
<v Speaker 1>So 20 feet.</v>

44
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

45
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.680
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to functional positions,</v>

46
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>like how do we run these school assemblies?</v>

47
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>The popular kids don't have a clue.</v>

48
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.640
<v Speaker 1>So if you bring them into a room,</v>

49
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>if there arbitrarily,</v>

50
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:45.381
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

51
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>assigned to a committee,</v>

52
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>they will all piss on their little piece of territory.</v>

54
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>They'll all stake out a position of some kind just to establish their status in</v>

55
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.214
<v Speaker 1>the room.</v>

56
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And after 15 minutes of this,</v>

57
00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>when they've all said their piece and it comes time to actually do something,</v>

58
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.651
<v Speaker 1>they're clueless.</v>

59
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:03.431
<v Speaker 1>They're silent,</v>

60
00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:04.660
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what to do.</v>

61
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>And if there's an unpopular geek like me,</v>

62
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>who at that 20 minute mark all of a sudden has an idea,</v>

63
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>they will glom around you even if they don't like you.</v>

64
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.091
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

65
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

66
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.590
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

67
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.041
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

68
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>so competence can,</v>

69
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.361
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

70
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

71
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 1>can step in where we're popularity cannot go.</v>

72
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.331
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

73
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:21.920
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>

74
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a very well put fray.</v>

75
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:23.511
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

76
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>so there I was the head of this programming committee and one of the,</v>

77
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.560
<v Speaker 1>it became,</v>

78
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the juniors came to me and said,</v>

79
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a dance.</v>

80
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

81
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>we're setting up a dance and could you advertise it for us?</v>

83
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't realize just how absurd that statement was.</v>

84
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>If there's a dance or a party of any kind in buffalo,</v>

85
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:42.811
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

86
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things you have to realize about it is I am not just</v>

87
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.023
<v Speaker 1>disinvited.</v>

88
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I haven't decided to stay as far away as humanly possible.</v>

89
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.640
<v Speaker 1>And yet they want me to advertise this dance.</v>

90
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.570
<v Speaker 1>So Jordan,</v>

91
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I can't dance.</v>

92
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

93
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I can't do a box.</v>

94
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't do a Fox trot.</v>

95
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>I can't do a waltz.</v>

96
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I can't do any of those things,</v>

97
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.250
<v Speaker 1>but I went on stage and put some music on the turn table and danced and I saw</v>

98
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>the pupils dilating of the audience,</v>

99
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>350 people who hated me and hated me for two and a half years.</v>

100
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:15.844
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>

101
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>their pupils were dilating,</v>

102
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>their faces were melting.</v>

103
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I felt that pseudopod at the energy coming to me and through me as if I were a</v>

104
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>pipe.</v>

105
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I felt it going up to something inside of me more or less,</v>

106
00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>that had level that utterly transmogrified it.</v>

107
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>And I felt the energy being sent back through every Lou that I was making and I</v>

108
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>had an out of body experience.</v>

109
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>

110
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was on the ceiling.</v>

111
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I watched all of this from the ceiling and apparently it looked like a loony</v>

112
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>toon drawn on Lsd</v>

113
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>as if Chuck Jones had been doing Tom and Jerry after taking a very big hit of</v>

114
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>acid.</v>

115
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the strangest,</v>

116
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>weirdest things you've ever seen and when it was all over.</v>

117
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>So that was my ecstatic experience.</v>

118
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>When it was all over,</v>

119
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>the audience did something.</v>

120
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:03.660
<v Speaker 1>It had never done in my days,</v>

121
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>so that school and would never do again.</v>

122
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>So long as I was there,</v>

123
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>it surged to the photo on the stage and as if it had practiced this act all its</v>

124
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

125
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>it picked me up off the stage.</v>

126
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>It put me on its shoulders,</v>

127
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>it carried me out of the auditorium,</v>

128
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>and it carried me up the pathway to the building above where we had our classes.</v>

129
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>So that was my introduction.</v>

130
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

132
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.130
<v Speaker 1>but this is stats,</v>

133
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>crazy story,</v>

134
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.600
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

135
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.600
<v Speaker 1>And this is three years after I'd gone off after the ecstatic experience,</v>

136
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>knowing that it was something vital.</v>

137
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:34.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

138
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I'd heard at the age of 14,</v>

139
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>two years earlier,</v>

140
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I had heard that there was a book called the varieties of the religious</v>

141
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:40.564
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

142
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>And in those days we had no Amazon.</v>

143
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

144
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>we had local bookstores and local bookstores in Buffalo.</v>

145
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:47.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

146
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:48.754
<v Speaker 1>give me a break.</v>

147
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

148
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>but I finally found a copy at the University of Buffalo Bookstore.</v>

149
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:57.841
<v Speaker 1>And it felt as if William James had been laying out a series of examples of the</v>

150
00:04:58.091 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>ecstatic experience,</v>

151
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

152
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.580
<v Speaker 1>with all of its delusions and hallucinations and all the rest on the laboratory</v>

153
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>bench.</v>

154
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 1>And then saying to me,</v>

155
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.771
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

156
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:09.461
<v Speaker 1>you're coming along,</v>

157
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>70 years later you're going to have scientific tools that I did not have.</v>

158
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 1>This is your job.</v>

159
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>And it was my job,</v>

160
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 1>not just as William James was giving it to me,</v>

161
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>cause something deep inside of me was crying out to understand it.</v>

162
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.230
<v Speaker 1>And it probably was that the privilege of social disconnection,</v>

163
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>the privilege of social deprivation because that privilege made me sensitive and</v>

164
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>it's always made me sensitive to group behavior.</v>

165
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.250
<v Speaker 1>So when I was in Moscow in 2005 lecturing a group of quantum physicists from all</v>

166
00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>over the world,</v>

167
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>and why everything that you know about quantum physics does wrong.</v>

168
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>It's because there is no such thing as an isolated particle.</v>

169
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Every particle is part of our herd,</v>

170
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>a mob,</v>

171
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>a group of some kind.</v>

172
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

173
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.413
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

174
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 1>a lot of quantum physicists based on the idea that when you,</v>

175
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>when you treat a Photon,</v>

176
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>a single photon in a certain way,</v>

177
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:05.650
<v Speaker 1>when you split it into here's how it's going to be,</v>

178
00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:06.484
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

179
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>but if it's being measured,</v>

180
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to happen.</v>

181
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

182
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:10.851
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

183
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly taking each other's measure.</v>

184
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Photons are constantly taking each of those measure because they move in groups,</v>

185
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>crowds and herds.</v>

186
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>That's why I beam of sunshine comes through your window,</v>

187
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>not a photon of sunshine.</v>

188
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>And when I finished the speech,</v>

189
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I was sure they were going to throw me out of the conference because these are</v>

190
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 1>all people committed deeply.</v>

191
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a quantum physics.</v>

192
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.510
<v Speaker 1>And instead they sat there beaming like proud uncles and I could not figure out</v>

193
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:38.301
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

194
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 1>And three years later,</v>

195
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>my collaborator in quantum physics,</v>

196
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

197
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>at the university,</v>

198
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 1>at the college and the of log mathematics,</v>

199
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 1>so the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow,</v>

200
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>an email and he said,</v>

201
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.110
<v Speaker 1>doctor,</v>

202
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

203
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 1>use your cough.</v>

204
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Who ran that conference and gave you such a hard time about your credit card has</v>

205
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>just published a book.</v>

206
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a new approach to quantum physics.</v>

207
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 1>It's called constructive physics.</v>

208
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>You have to get it immediately.</v>

209
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 1>So I downloaded it from arcs of org.</v>

210
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I listened to it that afternoon on my hour and a half walk through the park on</v>

211
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 1>my way to the cafe where I do all my work and I got all excited.</v>

212
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Every social concept.</v>

213
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:20.140
<v Speaker 1>That means every concept that I had given in this talk was in this book.</v>

214
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>So Jordan,</v>

215
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I've had the privilege of proceedings through life with this enormous advantage.</v>

216
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Social deprivation.</v>
