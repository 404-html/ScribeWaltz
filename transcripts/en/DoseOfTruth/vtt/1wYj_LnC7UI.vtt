<v Speaker 1>shows</v>

4
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.463
<v Speaker 1>this was</v>

5
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

6
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

7
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.023
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

8
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>would you be interested in hearing about</v>

9
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>is basically the story</v>

10
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

11
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.283
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

13
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.080
<v Speaker 1>whole thing</v>

14
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.083
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

15
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 1>as you were saying,</v>

16
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

17
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.430
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

18
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.990
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East.</v>

19
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.103
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

20
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.103
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

21
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.493
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

22
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Because we can give them the composition of</v>

23
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.150
<v Speaker 1>each side.</v>

24
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.180
<v Speaker 1>One of them accepts it,</v>

25
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 1>gets rid of,</v>

26
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.370
<v Speaker 1>he understands that the man</v>

27
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.810
<v Speaker 1>is the same because she,</v>

28
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.963
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

29
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.373
<v Speaker 1>Houston</v>

30
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.100
<v Speaker 1>being the case,</v>

31
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 1>he more about</v>

32
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.280
<v Speaker 1>the history of</v>

33
00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.573
<v Speaker 1>failed.</v>

34
00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.330
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>

35
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.713
<v Speaker 1>if you</v>

36
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.070
<v Speaker 1>take me off this,</v>

37
00:13:08.071 --> 00:13:08.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 1>you get rid of this pain.</v>

39
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.430
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

40
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.340
<v Speaker 1>God's love taking us to taste,</v>

41
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:24.070
<v Speaker 1>to safety hospital.</v>

43
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.990
<v Speaker 1>The parameters of human three,</v>

44
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.580
<v Speaker 1>there were a whole bunch of philosophy</v>

45
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:36.830
<v Speaker 1>because he raises the idea of free</v>

46
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:39.343
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

47
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:45.923
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

48
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.990
<v Speaker 1>you may be a way for people like origin in the first century,</v>

49
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.990
<v Speaker 1>spoke about the restoration.</v>

51
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Eventually we'll find a way to say,</v>

52
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:03.723
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

53
00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.013
<v Speaker 1>the Church</v>

54
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.880
<v Speaker 1>and some of the 20th century people said,</v>

55
00:14:10.881 --> 00:14:11.714
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

56
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you tell the model versus God is love</v>

57
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.700
<v Speaker 1>because love sometimes has to anchor,</v>

58
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.250
<v Speaker 1>shout the,</v>

59
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>the wealth to community and help</v>

60
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.163
<v Speaker 1>us</v>

61
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.083
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

62
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.610
<v Speaker 1>See someone suffering and to</v>

63
00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:57.683
<v Speaker 1>people</v>

64
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.863
<v Speaker 1>were</v>

65
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:31.603
<v Speaker 1>secondary</v>

66
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.870
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

67
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.863
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

68
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.833
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

69
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.183
<v Speaker 1>said</v>

70
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:18.953
<v Speaker 1>to</v>

71
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.360
<v Speaker 1>come up with,</v>

72
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.570
<v Speaker 1>he's never been</v>

73
00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:52.340
<v Speaker 1>in Wister.</v>

74
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Wisdom tends to focus on the ag and now this one shows</v>

75
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a real difference</v>

76
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.993
<v Speaker 1>to the table.</v>

77
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:42.603
<v Speaker 1>The table,</v>

78
00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.640
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

79
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.380
<v Speaker 1>show us what's called the pit.</v>

80
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.320
<v Speaker 1>It's happening</v>

81
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:04.953
<v Speaker 1>for some reason,</v>

82
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.970
<v Speaker 1>angels with the flaming sword standing in front of the garden</v>

83
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.553
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

84
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.930
<v Speaker 1>mythical perception is mainly</v>

85
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.520
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

86
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.003
<v Speaker 1>conversation</v>

87
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:35.933
<v Speaker 1>need</v>

88
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.680
<v Speaker 1>to this deductive reasoning,</v>

89
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:40.520
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

90
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:46.603
<v Speaker 1>immediately</v>

91
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.380
<v Speaker 1>basically</v>

92
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.430
<v Speaker 1>refers to</v>

93
00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:05.970
<v Speaker 1>the process and there's a whole refuge or</v>

94
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.580
<v Speaker 1>anthropology and psychology,</v>

95
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.550
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychology</v>

96
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:19.810
<v Speaker 1>over the centuries that deals with the process by which we can purify,</v>

97
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.163
<v Speaker 1>which means visual.</v>

98
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.400
<v Speaker 1>You can see by saying,</v>

99
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.030
<v Speaker 1>but you can see like Phil said,</v>

100
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.310
<v Speaker 1>c</v>

101
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.420
<v Speaker 1>is deeply ingrained in the human language.</v>

102
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.220
<v Speaker 1>You see what I mean?</v>

103
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Until late June</v>

104
00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:07.610
<v Speaker 1>because it was to see talks about the eye of the soul.</v>

105
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:11.863
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

106
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.470
<v Speaker 1>soul is also called Moose.</v>

107
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.413
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

108
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the eye of the soul or spirit.</v>

109
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:26.563
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

110
00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:28.883
<v Speaker 1>He has parents</v>

111
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.173
<v Speaker 1>pay attention.</v>

112
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Somebody films and shows.</v>

113
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.633
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

114
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Why that phrase,</v>

115
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:06.643
<v Speaker 1>contemplation.</v>

116
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.880
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of paintings in the house</v>

117
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.040
<v Speaker 1>or just speak in different places in North America,</v>

118
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:23.960
<v Speaker 1>standard places.</v>

119
00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:26.850
<v Speaker 1>One was in front of the year,</v>

120
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:36.290
<v Speaker 1>he painted first of all to I would say the sacrifice that area</v>

121
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.183
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

122
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:46.310
<v Speaker 1>in some sense can control or at least to give it your active director.</v>

123
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.340
<v Speaker 1>And then the gays element of this problem is trying to make it a point in the</v>

124
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:55.350
<v Speaker 1>bay that even these day to day realities are winning more worth paying attention</v>

125
00:26:56.551 --> 00:26:56.721
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

126
00:26:56.721 --> 00:26:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Then you didn't think or even,</v>

127
00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:03.990
<v Speaker 1>and so he spends 40 hours is just somewhere on his own,</v>

128
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's an injunction to</v>

129
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.203
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

130
00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.273
<v Speaker 1>So what you think</v>

131
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.170
<v Speaker 1>things that are</v>

132
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.410
<v Speaker 1>beyond the superficial</v>

133
00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.200
<v Speaker 1>mum communication.</v>

134
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:36.923
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

135
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.290
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

136
00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.093
<v Speaker 1>the colors,</v>

137
00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.573
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

138
00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.050
<v Speaker 1>positioning</v>

139
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.310
<v Speaker 1>this whole convention</v>

140
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:17.503
<v Speaker 1>without</v>

141
00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:21.993
<v Speaker 1>serious</v>

142
00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:27.090
<v Speaker 1>not fulfill the Ozarks division,</v>

143
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.020
<v Speaker 1>they close.</v>

144
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a huge</v>

145
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:39.500
<v Speaker 1>transfiguration in the second Sunday</v>

146
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.110
<v Speaker 1>we remember this man here.</v>

147
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.800
<v Speaker 1>He was magnificent theologian,</v>

148
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

149
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.480
<v Speaker 1>theologian</v>

150
00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.690
<v Speaker 1>according to the definition of John's Damascus.</v>

151
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.010
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

152
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.490
<v Speaker 1>if you pray you will be a failed login.</v>

153
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Now he has a theologian,</v>

154
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:25.110
<v Speaker 1>said he,</v>

155
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.700
<v Speaker 1>because at that time there was a lot of</v>

156
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.640
<v Speaker 1>interaction between these.</v>

157
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:33.150
<v Speaker 1>The list in terms of fields,</v>

158
00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:33.984
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.620
<v Speaker 1>a month reading background from Calabria came to Constantinople and begin to</v>

160
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.020
<v Speaker 1>share some of these scholastic,</v>

161
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

162
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:48.603
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

163
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.260
<v Speaker 1>ideas from,</v>

164
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:51.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

165
00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:51.883
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

166
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.730
<v Speaker 1>acquires and also from a peer</v>

167
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:59.830
<v Speaker 1>rationalistic kind of stuff.</v>

168
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.360
<v Speaker 1>And he</v>

169
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.900
<v Speaker 1>formulated the traditional eastern view that,</v>

170
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.453
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

171
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:15.610
<v Speaker 1>the grace of God is</v>

172
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.903
<v Speaker 1>the aim.</v>

173
00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.700
<v Speaker 1>The acquisition of grace is the aim of life.</v>

174
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:26.830
<v Speaker 1>And actually there is a story like that where I come from is called the</v>

175
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:28.510
<v Speaker 1>conversation of sensor for,</v>

176
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:29.141
<v Speaker 1>with motto,</v>

177
00:30:29.141 --> 00:30:29.974
<v Speaker 1>Viva,</v>

178
00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:30.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

179
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.000
<v Speaker 1>concerning the meaning of</v>

180
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Christian life is about acquiring the Holy Spirit,</v>

181
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:40.960
<v Speaker 1>the grace of God,</v>

182
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:41.780
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

183
00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.613
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

184
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.270
<v Speaker 1>it's not impersonal.</v>

185
00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.850
<v Speaker 1>It is the Holy Spirit.</v>

186
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.583
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

187
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the life of the church is hard.</v>

188
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:54.843
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

189
00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

190
00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:55.810
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>

191
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:56.591
<v Speaker 1>in our liturgy,</v>

192
00:30:56.591 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 1>we focus,</v>

193
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a distinction between say the</v>

194
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.280
<v Speaker 1>traditional understanding medieval,</v>

195
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:06.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

196
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.593
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

197
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:08.463
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

198
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.370
<v Speaker 1>in the Eucharist,</v>

199
00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the priest access Christ and he says,</v>

200
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:14.820
<v Speaker 1>this is my body.</v>

201
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.670
<v Speaker 1>This is my blood out of the day of the key words.</v>

202
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Whereas your narrow understanding the priest,</v>

203
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 1>the priest is a</v>

204
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.060
<v Speaker 1>real person is Christ</v>

205
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.580
<v Speaker 1>does this through the Holy Spirit.</v>

206
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.133
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

207
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:35.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

208
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:36.301
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

209
00:31:36.301 --> 00:31:40.870
<v Speaker 1>the prayers or the risk to love the file to send his Holy Spirit</v>

210
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.750
<v Speaker 1>on us along the gifts.</v>

211
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:45.761
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

212
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:50.761
<v Speaker 1>so that's what that is to divinization or feels</v>

213
00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.200
<v Speaker 1>so that he is</v>

214
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.360
<v Speaker 1>the Christian.</v>

215
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

216
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

217
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.520
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of not realizing our potential,</v>

218
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:08.410
<v Speaker 1>not potential.</v>

219
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.150
<v Speaker 1>God has given us so much and they're not using it.</v>

220
00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:12.910
<v Speaker 1>When you were saying why,</v>

221
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:13.840
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

222
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.770
<v Speaker 1>why do we lazy?</v>

223
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.193
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

224
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.610
<v Speaker 1>because why?</v>

225
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Because the</v>

226
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.370
<v Speaker 1>what's called the lure of seeing normous.</v>

227
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:29.450
<v Speaker 1>These are my peers as Saint Paul writes is like the force of that.</v>

228
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.940
<v Speaker 1>It feels like</v>

229
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:34.383
<v Speaker 1>I talked about that.</v>

230
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

231
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.713
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

232
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

233
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.113
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen him.</v>

234
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.073
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>

235
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.150
<v Speaker 1>my son Ross is a big</v>

236
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.583
<v Speaker 1>fan.</v>

237
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:12.440
<v Speaker 1>That isn't the case.</v>

238
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:14.183
<v Speaker 1>What do I know?</v>

239
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.033
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

240
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a quotation from the,</v>

241
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:22.661
<v Speaker 1>the fees,</v>

242
00:33:22.661 --> 00:33:23.494
<v Speaker 1>the fees,</v>

243
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.700
<v Speaker 1>the pesto ration or some job was awesome.</v>

244
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Qcs intentions,</v>

245
00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.223
<v Speaker 1>good intentions.</v>

246
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.490
<v Speaker 1>You have</v>

247
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.480
<v Speaker 1>this beautiful place.</v>

248
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I realize that so many people want to</v>

249
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.373
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

250
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:04.820
<v Speaker 1>should I be taking,</v>

251
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.033
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

252
00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Another question for you and I don't understand it.</v>

253
00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:22.641
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

254
00:34:22.641 --> 00:34:24.250
<v Speaker 1>so it's easier to go down the hill.</v>

255
00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.213
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

256
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.180
<v Speaker 1>That's that's,</v>

257
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:30.621
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

258
00:34:30.621 --> 00:34:33.480
<v Speaker 1>there's some delight in bitterness of going down the hill too.</v>

259
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:37.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just easy shows that there's terrible.</v>

260
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:37.873
<v Speaker 1>The trach</v>

261
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.413
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

262
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:44.510
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's a lot.</v>

263
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.433
<v Speaker 1>So you're here.</v>

264
00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.413
<v Speaker 1>Here's the idea.</v>

265
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I had this strange idea two weeks ago,</v>

266
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.561
<v Speaker 1>three weeks ago,</v>

267
00:34:51.561 --> 00:34:52.400
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

268
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:58.070
<v Speaker 1>So I was trying to reconcile it with the idea that I think this is more Western</v>

269
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.963
<v Speaker 1>Christian idea thing.</v>

270
00:34:59.460 --> 00:34:59.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

271
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:03.800
<v Speaker 1>people are already human beings on the face of Christ.</v>

272
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.620
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that they don't,</v>

273
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.560
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be a problem.</v>

274
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell him that and say</v>

275
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.900
<v Speaker 1>that's the question.</v>

276
00:35:19.901 --> 00:35:20.510
<v Speaker 1>The question.</v>

277
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.110
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

278
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.170
<v Speaker 1>here's the thought of that.</v>

279
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Of course that's true,</v>

280
00:35:23.511 --> 00:35:25.070
<v Speaker 1>but we still have to be the work.</v>

281
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

282
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.403
<v Speaker 1>That's a very strict,</v>

283
00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.160
<v Speaker 1>you have to think about the same time.</v>

284
00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the conjunction.</v>

285
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:31.703
<v Speaker 1>We determined</v>

286
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.700
<v Speaker 1>that the nation is</v>

287
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 1>my senior counselor,</v>

288
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

289
00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:43.140
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the fourth century.</v>

290
00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:46.860
<v Speaker 1>He says things like,</v>

291
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.370
<v Speaker 1>God cannot say you without you.</v>

292
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Now is that sticking point of interpretation between the Eastern and the Western</v>

293
00:35:57.271 --> 00:35:57.960
<v Speaker 1>church?</v>

294
00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Because it seems to me,</v>

295
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems paradoxical,</v>

296
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.040
<v Speaker 1>both in Catholicism and the pastor.</v>

297
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Most of the activity seems to be taking place on the part of God.</v>

298
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:08.101
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

299
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:12.450
<v Speaker 1>that's because you always want somebody else to do with him,</v>

300
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:14.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

301
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:14.881
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

302
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:15.560
<v Speaker 1>you'll do.</v>

303
00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

304
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

305
00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll say I pray to be on the basis of hitches,</v>

306
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.410
<v Speaker 1>criticism up the Western church.</v>

307
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.393
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

308
00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.613
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>

309
00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:25.573
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

310
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:27.710
<v Speaker 1>where's my implement,</v>

311
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:28.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

312
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 1>How can I feel the have become a human limb?</v>

313
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.820
<v Speaker 1>One idea that is d in</v>

314
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.280
<v Speaker 1>anthropology is that we have yet to become human beings.</v>

315
00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

316
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.020
<v Speaker 1>when policies,</v>

317
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:47.120
<v Speaker 1>behold a man that he is the first film for me.</v>

318
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

319
00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Then those kinds of things around the way to do that.</v>

320
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.660
<v Speaker 1>You think that's what you wrote,</v>

321
00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.570
<v Speaker 1>that's what you wrote.</v>

322
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:01.613
<v Speaker 1>That</v>

323
00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.990
<v Speaker 1>same division tuition.</v>

324
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:10.703
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strong</v>

325
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.360
<v Speaker 1>synergy</v>

326
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.270
<v Speaker 1>versus a presence of sinners.</v>

327
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.173
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

328
00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 1>give me an African divine</v>

329
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.940
<v Speaker 1>and the human difference is real.</v>

330
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.220
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

331
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 1>It's what's written.</v>

332
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it can't make sense of history.</v>

333
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:35.743
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

334
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.473
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

335
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.193
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

336
00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.120
<v Speaker 1>as we see people suffering,</v>

337
00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.910
<v Speaker 1>and thank God he sent me a real simple,</v>

338
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I know</v>

339
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.140
<v Speaker 1>chemotherapy and stuff like that.</v>

340
00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.663
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

341
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:04.350
<v Speaker 1>that use you on insulin</v>

342
00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:07.903
<v Speaker 1>except</v>

343
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.480
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't think that would be good site you would get from it.</v>

344
00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:16.870
<v Speaker 1>But I guess the alternative to that inside this to become biff,</v>

345
00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:21.240
<v Speaker 1>it looks like to me and that's not helpful.</v>

346
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.843
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

347
00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.230
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that</v>

348
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:27.211
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

349
00:38:27.211 --> 00:38:28.044
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

350
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.190
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

351
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:35.603
<v Speaker 1>all</v>

352
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:44.780
<v Speaker 1>the clothes,</v>

353
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a big teacher.</v>

354
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.470
<v Speaker 1>How much is ego?</v>

355
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.083
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

356
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.080
<v Speaker 1>That tall.</v>

357
00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:01.140
<v Speaker 1>He's mainly about the attempt of human beings to self assertive.</v>

358
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.640
<v Speaker 1>That's called crime.</v>

359
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.720
<v Speaker 1>You know crime is the,</v>

360
00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.180
<v Speaker 1>just to assert yourself over.</v>

361
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Other people know this is</v>

362
00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:21.070
<v Speaker 1>sort of non religious people talk about no self worth self esteem.</v>

363
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.160
<v Speaker 1>That's when I feel great about myself.</v>

364
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:30.930
<v Speaker 1>But if you throw the way to say I feel bad about it,</v>

365
00:39:30.931 --> 00:39:34.570
<v Speaker 1>go then say I don't care.</v>

366
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I can do anything right because it's not me doing it.</v>

367
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to stress out what I do,</v>

368
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.373
<v Speaker 1>what I say,</v>

369
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.310
<v Speaker 1>but he's chosen</v>

370
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Les Pauls.</v>

371
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.433
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

372
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Because he loves us.</v>

373
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Seems a strange way to get things done.</v>

374
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.280
<v Speaker 1>How many people come here?</v>

375
00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.693
<v Speaker 1>It varies.</v>

376
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.240
<v Speaker 1>They all trouble.</v>

377
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:16.223
<v Speaker 1>Is</v>

378
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.353
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

379
00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Anglican Priest told you that the church being the C O v stands for Christmas at</v>

380
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:27.383
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>

381
00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

382
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:31.010
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

383
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.550
<v Speaker 1>They're really sort of did my job.</v>

384
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:35.430
<v Speaker 1>It's this effect of life.</v>

385
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 1>The church has always been a semester and that's okay</v>

386
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.080
<v Speaker 1>on a Sunday,</v>

387
00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.700
<v Speaker 1>which is not very much these figures here</v>

388
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:08.560
<v Speaker 1>on a visa.</v>

389
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:11.613
<v Speaker 1>That's the</v>

390
00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:16.750
<v Speaker 1>social voice</v>

391
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:23.580
<v Speaker 1>is actually taking</v>

392
00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.880
<v Speaker 1>leaves of assaults.</v>

393
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

394
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.210
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

395
00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:38.043
<v Speaker 1>They uh,</v>

396
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.030
<v Speaker 1>what the level of the land</v>

397
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.340
<v Speaker 1>this is the actual</v>

398
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.840
<v Speaker 1>human beings don't have to be perfect.</v>

399
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:30.783
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

400
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 1>You can go</v>

401
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.473
<v Speaker 1>to fictions.</v>

402
00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.453
<v Speaker 1>Lots of papers.</v>

403
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:50.720
<v Speaker 1>That trajectory was the critical issue.</v>

404
00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:56.940
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

405
00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.600
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of the revitalization of Christianity in Russia?</v>

406
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:10.163
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

407
00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:11.900
<v Speaker 1>is real.</v>

408
00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.790
<v Speaker 1>It's going through a process of system because when the first</v>

409
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.480
<v Speaker 1>four just before the full</v>

410
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.190
<v Speaker 1>became fashionable as well,</v>

411
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:32.360
<v Speaker 1>because the church was cursing,</v>

412
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.710
<v Speaker 1>people just did it for the wrong reasons.</v>

413
00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate Christianity was a legal is made into the state religion,</v>

414
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.080
<v Speaker 1>the great</v>

415
00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:53.610
<v Speaker 1>general life.</v>

416
00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.880
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of people</v>

417
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:01.830
<v Speaker 1>came to church for the wrong reason.</v>

418
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Eventually things change.</v>

419
00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.770
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about goodness relationship with the church?</v>

420
00:44:12.771 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's anything about that that's real?</v>

421
00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

422
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.250
<v Speaker 1>if one were to be completely and it say,</v>

423
00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:24.860
<v Speaker 1>well he's a really shrewd politician,</v>

424
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.730
<v Speaker 1>understands that the churches are a real source of power.</v>

425
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be the right side</v>

426
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:32.963
<v Speaker 2>of the church.</v>

427
00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Burned them all down.</v>

428
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

429
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.530
<v Speaker 2>How much did Constantine,</v>

430
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:48.710
<v Speaker 2>when he decided to kind of see as well with the church,</v>

431
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.810
<v Speaker 2>he didn't make me want to get baptized until he's dead.</v>

432
00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.590
<v Speaker 2>He saw,</v>

433
00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

434
00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:29.340
<v Speaker 2>so as a matter of fact,</v>

435
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:56.723
<v Speaker 2>yes</v>

436
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:03.410
<v Speaker 2>we should talk to them all.</v>

437
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:03.780
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>

438
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:08.780
<v Speaker 2>it was it kind of like a pagan reaction against Christianity and against the</v>

439
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.433
<v Speaker 2>West Deans</v>

440
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.513
<v Speaker 2>was</v>

441
00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:18.533
<v Speaker 2>Christianity</v>

442
00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:27.540
<v Speaker 2>and also during the cultural revolution because then we live just the full</v>

443
00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.890
<v Speaker 2>peripheral Gushi again.</v>

444
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.720
<v Speaker 2>But some of</v>

445
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:42.390
<v Speaker 2>the kids have a fully out of the mouth go hanging with Khrushchev,</v>

446
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:50.120
<v Speaker 2>promote giving him the ball and other stuff in India and also in was helping</v>

447
00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:51.020
<v Speaker 2>India.</v>

448
00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:51.853
<v Speaker 2>India.</v>

449
00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think what's the point of that very political</v>

601
00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:43.323
<v Speaker 2>structure</v>

602
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:47.330
<v Speaker 2>you see that's very</v>

603
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:54.613
<v Speaker 2>personal.</v>

604
00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:56.253
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

605
00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:03.730
<v Speaker 2>20th century was super strongly in an agricultural country because of that.</v>

606
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>

607
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.930
<v Speaker 2>we connect it to the village</v>

608
01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Louis Parish</v>

609
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:39.343
<v Speaker 2>received</v>

610
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:48.290
<v Speaker 2>in the last couple of years have been talking about</v>

611
01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.470
<v Speaker 2>the episodes</v>

612
01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:56.003
<v Speaker 2>as</v>

613
01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.990
<v Speaker 2>malls to do this</v>

614
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:07.450
<v Speaker 2>think humanism room.</v>

615
01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:10.110
<v Speaker 2>There's no measurable.</v>

616
01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:20.690
<v Speaker 2>So it's important for the revolutionaries to destroy traditional worldviews.</v>

617
01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:27.540
<v Speaker 2>And he was a key factor in the traditional perception after that became Verizon</v>

618
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:31.783
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

619
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Because see the simple,</v>

620
01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:36.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

621
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.310
<v Speaker 2>dozens of the basic source of thought to themselves,</v>

622
01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.173
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

623
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:42.640
<v Speaker 2>we've got [inaudible],</v>

624
01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:46.280
<v Speaker 2>we've got local people,</v>

625
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:48.390
<v Speaker 2>some of them who are some not so good,</v>

626
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:52.020
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately there is truth personally.</v>

627
01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 2>So if suddenly he's destroyed</v>

628
01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:01.993
<v Speaker 2>your rights</v>

629
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.340
<v Speaker 2>as a collapse of a whole view.</v>

630
01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.093
<v Speaker 2>If people</v>

631
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:19.150
<v Speaker 2>have the education and experience in with,</v>

632
01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:20.483
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

633
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:21.383
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of</v>

634
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:25.530
<v Speaker 2>different ideas.</v>

635
01:02:25.531 --> 01:02:26.364
<v Speaker 2>But when you,</v>

636
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:29.910
<v Speaker 2>you come from a very holistic</v>

637
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.730
<v Speaker 2>kind of singular view of the universe,</v>

638
01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:38.880
<v Speaker 2>something very big as,</v>

639
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.920
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

640
01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.920
<v Speaker 2>well maybe like if he allowed that sort of stuff.</v>

641
01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.510
<v Speaker 2>So how long until the rest of his painting,</v>

642
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.090
<v Speaker 2>the two,</v>

643
01:03:12.091 --> 01:03:12.924
<v Speaker 2>three years</v>

644
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:03.570
<v Speaker 2>using two weeks to fly,</v>

645
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:08.400
<v Speaker 2>do we use to cover their faces?</v>

646
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:11.640
<v Speaker 2>The Majesty of God</v>

647
01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:15.693
<v Speaker 2>cannot</v>

648
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:46.510
<v Speaker 2>represents class</v>

649

<v Speaker 2>You've got the hospital</v>

652
01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.550

674
01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:40.040

682
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.390
<v Speaker 2>ancient Christian,</v>

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.690
<v Speaker 2>the Holy Spirit.</v>

684
01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think,</v>

685
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.870
<v Speaker 2>how do you explain the fact that some of the people don't step away from the</v>

686
01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:06.723
<v Speaker 2>church</v>

687
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:46.260
<v Speaker 2>because the people who were getting all</v>

688
01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.520
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.013
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Why is that</v>

691
01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:04.613
<v Speaker 2>you think?</v>

692
01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything you told me,</v>

693
01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:11.503
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

694
01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.113
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

695
01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you</v>

696
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:23.743
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

697
01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:26.050
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of</v>

698
01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:32.360
<v Speaker 2>in the first 300 years,</v>

699
01:10:38.010 --> 01:10:38.843
<v Speaker 2>people</v>

700
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:46.803
<v Speaker 2>love</v>

701
01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:52.430
<v Speaker 2>these people can,</v>

702
01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.490
<v Speaker 2>we would pull up</v>

703
01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 2>something has to change</v>

704
01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:09.380
<v Speaker 2>to tell you everything.</v>

705
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:26.933
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

706
01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:28.123
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

707
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:36.770
<v Speaker 2>difficult to live the life when things are okay because that forces,</v>

708
01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.830
<v Speaker 2>it forces us down.</v>

709
01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:48.530
<v Speaker 2>When you have really,</v>

710
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:51.360
<v Speaker 2>really sensitive to mobilize</v>

711
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:56.490
<v Speaker 2>to fall,</v>

712
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.593
<v Speaker 2>there's a rush.</v>

713
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:04.750
<v Speaker 2>The transverse like this</v>

714
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:08.810
<v Speaker 2>collapse the peasant,</v>

715
01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.390
<v Speaker 2>we get the juice</v>

716
01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.370
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>

717
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:22.070
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult circumstances that people really know where they're in anguish.</v>

718
01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.680
<v Speaker 2>The matter of fact today people come because they</v>

719
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:41.050
<v Speaker 2>know people can be an English</v>

720
01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:54.590
<v Speaker 2>movies and stuff like that.</v>

721
01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Take my attention.</v>

722
01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

723
01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:05.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

724
01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:09.450
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that struck me because you know,</v>

725
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.630
<v Speaker 2>after people</v>

726
01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:19.570
<v Speaker 2>waste their life worth</v>

727
01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:33.030
<v Speaker 2>something like</v>

728
01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.240
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

729
01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:45.390
<v Speaker 2>most of the spots always,</v>

730
01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.480
<v Speaker 2>always the same thing.</v>

731
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:47.460
<v Speaker 2>We never talked,</v>

732
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:49.333
<v Speaker 2>especially</v>

733
01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:52.610
<v Speaker 2>something about a seeking sad,</v>

734
01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:53.753
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>

735
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:59.260
<v Speaker 2>They don't think each</v>

736
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:01.783
<v Speaker 2>cares,</v>

737
01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.033
<v Speaker 2>they have</v>

738
01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.640
<v Speaker 2>be infectious.</v>

739
01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:26.240
<v Speaker 2>We need people to communicate the basics because</v>

740
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:30.160
<v Speaker 2>you cannot understand what I'm talking about.</v>

741
01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.233
<v Speaker 2>The one on</v>

742
01:14:33.690 --> 01:14:34.730
<v Speaker 2>maybe</v>

743
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:46.420
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

744
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:51.940
<v Speaker 2>they got to get back to that babysits</v>

745
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.333
<v Speaker 2>my children.</v>

746
01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.813
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

747
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:58.363
<v Speaker 2>Because</v>

748
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.700
<v Speaker 2>he's a good representative of very smart,</v>

749
01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:30.110
<v Speaker 2>a CP</v>

750
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:40.490

<v Speaker 2>Computational systems cannot do complex things.</v>

758
01:16:38.741 --> 01:16:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Fire this roof.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We don't know what</v>

763
01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.000
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about.</v>

764
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:57.460
<v Speaker 2>The funding,</v>

765
01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:01.590
<v Speaker 2>different quality architecture can be facing store growth,</v>

766
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.903
<v Speaker 2>which is also something</v>

767
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:10.933
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

768
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:13.303
<v Speaker 2>specific.</v>

775
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a calming force.</v>

776
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Interpret everything under a particular rubric and disciplines as a consequence.</v>
