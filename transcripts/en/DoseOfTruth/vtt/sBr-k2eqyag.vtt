00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.363
<v Speaker 1>Peterson</v>

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.440
<v Speaker 1>in your lectures,</v>

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you used the term postmodernism interchangeably with cultural Marxism,</v>

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.390
<v Speaker 1>nihilism and moral relativism.</v>

6
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you've considered or heard alternative beliefs at the term</v>

7
00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism is not necessary,</v>

8
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:26.570
<v Speaker 1>is necessarily always congruent on a one to one scale with these other terms and</v>

9
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 1>in some limited circumstances is positive.</v>

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Specifically the idea that wouldn't,</v>

11
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 1>you'd use the term postmodernism to vilify is by some others referred to as</v>

12
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>pseudo modernism where as some would call what you endorsed to not be modernism</v>

13
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:44.741
<v Speaker 1>but in fact Metta modernism post millennialism or post postmodernism,</v>

14
00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:46.730
<v Speaker 1>which unfortunately has a terrible name.</v>

15
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 1>And then I have very brief just definitions of those words.</v>

16
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>If you need me to know,</v>

17
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.360
<v Speaker 1>as I said tonight,</v>

18
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.610
<v Speaker 1>you have to give the devil his due</v>

19
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.860
<v Speaker 2>and so we'll do that.</v>

20
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:01.910
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

21
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 2>there was a very large number of ways of interpreting the world.</v>

22
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that.</v>

23
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.993
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

24
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.930
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

25
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.930
<v Speaker 2>People use biased interpretive lenses to as means of interpreting the world to</v>

26
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:16.430
<v Speaker 2>put their own</v>

27
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.913
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

28
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Priorities forward without necessarily knowing that they're doing so and that</v>

29
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 2>that can corrupt them.</v>

30
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 2>And Society.</v>

31
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Psychoanalysts figured that out way before the postmodernist.</v>

32
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 2>So they don't get any credit for that.</v>

33
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Like really none.</v>

34
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.043
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

35
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.050
<v Speaker 2>So it's useful to keep those things in mind.</v>

36
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.390
<v Speaker 2>It's when they're put,</v>

37
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's when they're put forward is absolute truth that disturbs me.</v>

38
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:46.311
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

39
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:46.850
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

40
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.320
<v Speaker 2>people are probably racist.</v>

41
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 2>They might even be implicitly racist,</v>

42
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 2>although we don't know what that means and we don't know how it's related to</v>

43
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 2>their explicit behavior.</v>

44
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 2>And we can't separate it from in group preference or necessarily from reaction</v>

45
00:01:59.301 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 2>to novelty.</v>

46
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 2>So it's a tricky business.</v>

47
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:02.024
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

48
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.030
<v Speaker 2>and we don't know how to separate stereotypical racial perceptions from</v>

49
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.790
<v Speaker 2>perceptual heuristics.</v>

50
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how to do that.</v>

51
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're always oversimplifying the world because you're not smart enough to</v>

52
00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 2>live in the world as it is.</v>

53
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:16.910
<v Speaker 2>You have to oversimplify it.</v>

54
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.800
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

55
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:21.290
<v Speaker 2>there are times when postmodernism is useful,</v>

56
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.890
<v Speaker 2>are used it quite usefully tonight to deconstruct postmodernism.</v>

57
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:25.724
<v Speaker 2>In fact.</v>

58
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.840
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

59
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.673
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

60
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.521
<v Speaker 2>but wait,</v>

61
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:30.380
<v Speaker 2>it's when it's turned into an absolute,</v>

62
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:32.060
<v Speaker 2>especially a moral absolute that it,</v>

63
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.550
<v Speaker 2>and when it aligns itself with Marxism,</v>

64
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:34.881
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

65
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:35.571
<v Speaker 2>sorry guys.</v>

66
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:36.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

67
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 2>you don't like grand narratives.</v>

68
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:39.380
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to go there while that's where you,</v>

69
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.570
<v Speaker 2>that isn't where you went,</v>

70
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 2>that's where you came from.</v>

71
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:43.310
<v Speaker 2>You never,</v>

72
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 2>you never left there.</v>
