1
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is capitalism compatible with your</v>

2
00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>definition of good if it requires every</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing uses of the finite resources</v>

3
00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:18.110
<v Speaker 1>of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where once depleted would mean our end?</v>

4
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say capitalism isn't compatible</v>

5
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:25.130
<v Speaker 1>with my definition of good if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>requires every increasing uses of the</v>

6
00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:29.360
<v Speaker 1>finite resources of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's by no means self evident even</v>

7
00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 1>though the Scuttlebutt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

8
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:36.110
<v Speaker 1>especially among the environmentalist</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented types who might have some</v>

9
00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>sympathy for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

10
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to ocean</v>
<v Speaker 1>depletion.</v>

11
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge argument and there has</v>

12
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:44.420
<v Speaker 1>been for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years between the economists and</v>

13
00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 1>the biologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a really important thing to</v>

14
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:50.780
<v Speaker 1>know and he economists' point out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>human ingenuity is such that we're</v>

15
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:55.781
<v Speaker 1>continually able to make more with less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And certainly over the last well,</v>

16
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>500 years that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the last 150 years,</v>

17
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:01.850
<v Speaker 1>that's just absolutely evident.</v>

18
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people say we're going to run out</v>

19
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:06.410
<v Speaker 1>of energy and I think that's absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>

20
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:08.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is craziest thinking we're going to</v>

21
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:10.630
<v Speaker 1>run out of matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>

22
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>we're going through a bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottleneck right now because you know,</v>

23
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.820
<v Speaker 1>the population is going to increase to</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 9 billion and then it's going to</v>

24
00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>decrease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

25
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.760
<v Speaker 1>that's the most reliable projections and</v>
<v Speaker 1>9 billion isn't a lot more than we have</v>

26
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

27
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.130
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be some environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>disruption as a consequence of that.</v>

28
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think there's any reason to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume it all that capitalism</v>

29
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 1>necessarily requires ever increasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses of the finite resources of the</v>

30
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also not obvious to what degree the</v>

31
00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:43.331
<v Speaker 1>resources of the planet are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>finite because we can continually think</v>

32
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>up new uses for things that nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought had any use at all.</v>

33
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>And so it depends to some degree on</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you're willing to bet on</v>

34
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.650
<v Speaker 1>human imaginativeness or you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a Malthusian pessimists.</v>

35
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.660
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that there aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for both.</v>

36
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that it is by no means</v>
<v Speaker 1>self evident that things are getting</v>

37
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>like I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

39
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last,</v>

40
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>in the last 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the millennium goal for the UN was to</v>

41
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:16.070
<v Speaker 1>have world poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like absolute poverty.</v>

42
00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>So that's less than a dollar 50 day by</v>
<v Speaker 1>50% within 15 years.</v>

43
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.760
<v Speaker 1>That was actually reached ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule.</v>

44
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:26.390
<v Speaker 1>And we've lifted hundreds of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people into the middle class over the</v>

45
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:29.750
<v Speaker 1>last 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there is an increasing inequality</v>

46
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:34.400
<v Speaker 1>in the west because the working class is</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the brunt of that say that</v>

47
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>redistribution to third world countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

48
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no starvation in the world</v>

49
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>anymore except really for reasons of</v>
<v Speaker 1>misdistribution and,</v>

50
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.193
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

51
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>and political purpose.</v>

52
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Speaker 1>And people are becoming richer and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated all the time.</v>

53
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 1>when we are waking up to our planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your responsibilities,</v>

55
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>once people stopped starving to death</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having to burn like dirt and,</v>

56
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 1>and eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>substandard food that they've scraped</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the Brown,</v>

58
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>they do start to turn their attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that might be more aesthetic.</v>

59
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

60
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any reason to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic.</v>

61
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Not Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess the reason that capitalism</v>

62
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>is compatible with my definition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

63
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that I don't see an</v>

64
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>alternative that has manifested itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have far more negative</v>

65
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a minimal pessimism issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

67
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the best devil that we have.</v>

68
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.760
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe it is because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>the successful societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by any stretch of the imagination,</v>

70
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>by virtually any metric are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalist societies.</v>

71
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

72
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>that the Soviet Union demolished far</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of its natural resources to far</v>

73
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:47.910
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>productive consequence than the Westin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's evidence,</v>

75
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>there's suggestions that between 10 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>15% of the total area of the Soviet</v>

76
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Union has been rendered more or less</v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently uninhabitable.</v>

77
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to what.</v>
