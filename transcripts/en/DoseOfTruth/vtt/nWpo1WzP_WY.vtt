00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson,</v>

2
00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm really hoping you can share your thoughts on the day.</v>

3
00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:11.524
<v Speaker 1>Just shooting.</v>

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.911
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>what I would do is recommend the biblical lecture I did on Cain enabled,</v>

7
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.681
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

8
00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:25.681
<v Speaker 1>because I think that that's a good summary of the state of mind that somebody</v>

9
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:29.740
<v Speaker 1>has to be in in order to do what was done at Los Vegas.</v>

10
00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:32.020
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be very,</v>

11
00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Speaker 1>very embittered by life in order to do that sort of thing.</v>

12
00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:38.770
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be searching for revenge,</v>

13
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:39.341
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

14
00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's not,</v>

15
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:41.381
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

17
00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:41.561
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>it's only revenge on other people because you've developed a hatred for people.</v>

19
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:46.900
<v Speaker 1>But it's deeper than that.</v>

20
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not just hatred for people.</v>

21
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's hatred for being itself and,</v>

22
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:57.220
<v Speaker 1>and the desire to take revenge on being for the outrage of the tragedy and</v>

23
00:00:57.221 --> 00:00:59.200
<v Speaker 1>suffering that's associated with being,</v>

24
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.910
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the tragedy and suffering that's been part and parcel of your own</v>

26
00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:04.670
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

27
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>And that makes you embittered.</v>

28
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And then past embittered becomes outraged and past outrage becomes well</v>

29
00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>homicidal or even genocidal.</v>

30
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's a terrible state of mind to begin.</v>

31
00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a hellish state.</v>

32
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the best way to conceptualize the state of mind that someone has</v>

34
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:26.920
<v Speaker 1>to be at in order to do something like the Columbine shootings for example,</v>

35
00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>or what happened in Las Vegas is that you're really an hour.</v>

36
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>You have to speak about it and religious languages.</v>

37
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.820
<v Speaker 1>You're really out for revenge against God,</v>

38
00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>for the outrage of creation.</v>

39
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

40
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's a state of mind that's truly hellish and you could get there by</v>

41
00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:42.670
<v Speaker 1>broody long enough.</v>

42
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Now it's also possible,</v>

43
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy didn't have any previous history,</v>

44
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 1>criminal history or anything like that and he's pretty old.</v>

45
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

46
00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 1>there's also all also the possibility of some kind of neurological pathology</v>

47
00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:57.580
<v Speaker 1>that that might be characteristic of him.</v>

48
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

49
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:00.130
<v Speaker 1>some degenerative neurological disease.</v>

50
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:04.960
<v Speaker 1>There was a kid years ago at the University of Texas in Austin who climbed up on</v>

51
00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 1>the tower there and shot a number of people with a high powered rifle and he had</v>

52
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:13.831
<v Speaker 1>a fast growing tumor on his hypothalamus and had reported like these being</v>

53
00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:16.930
<v Speaker 1>overcome with extreme feelings of rage.</v>

54
00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another possibility.</v>

55
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.970
<v Speaker 1>But I would say the,</v>

56
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.050
<v Speaker 1>embitterment hypothesis is the strongest one.</v>

58
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.550
<v Speaker 1>I would also say too,</v>

59
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I noticed the Steven Pinker tweeted this today,</v>

60
00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:34.360
<v Speaker 1>is that one of the ways of controlling this sort of thing would be for the press</v>

61
00:02:34.361 --> 00:02:35.194
<v Speaker 1>to agree,</v>

62
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.600
<v Speaker 1>not for there to be a blanket agreement,</v>

63
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>not to publicize the name or any other identity markers of the people who do the</v>

64
00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:43.271
<v Speaker 1>shooting.</v>

65
00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Because there's also this really,</v>

66
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.560
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

67
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.693
<v Speaker 1>Arrogance.</v>

68
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of arrogance and pride last ditch,</v>

69
00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:56.941
<v Speaker 1>arrogance and pride that that is associated with the fantasies that drive this</v>

70
00:02:57.041 --> 00:02:57.880
<v Speaker 1>sort of behavior.</v>

71
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>And the fantasy is like,</v>

72
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>after I do this,</v>

74
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.210
<v Speaker 1>everyone will sure know the who,</v>

75
00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>who the hell I was.</v>

76
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.931
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

77
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>even though maybe I was ignored or unhappy when I was alive after I'm get,</v>

78
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:11.120
<v Speaker 1>everybody's going to know who I was and what idea,</v>

79
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>so there's this underground desire for fame,</v>

81
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's notoriety,</v>

82
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>but notoriety might be preferable to being ignored.</v>

83
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.123
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

84
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of talk about gun control,</v>

86
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>and that's understandable,</v>

87
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to automatic rifles.</v>

88
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

89
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.820
<v Speaker 1>although I also understand why the people who are gun owners are afraid of,</v>

90
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

91
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

92
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>of allowing what they regarded as one of their fundamental rights to be</v>

93
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 1>infringed upon.</v>

94
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>But it would certainly be useful if we stopped giving people who do this sort of</v>

95
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:44.871
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

96
00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>not $100 million worth of free publicity and all the notoriety they can manage.</v>

97
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

98
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>that's another way of thinking about controlling it.</v>

100
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
