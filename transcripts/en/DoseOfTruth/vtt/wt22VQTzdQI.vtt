00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>for those who are very creative but high in neuroticism,</v>

3
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>how should one work to gain emotional stability in order to go out into chaos to</v>

4
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>do more creative things?</v>

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question.</v>

6
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>You know what I learned about that by reading Young's works on Alchemy,</v>

7
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.421
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough.</v>

8
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 1>And so back again in graduate school when I was writing starting to write maps</v>

9
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>of meaning and really tearing myself apart psychologically,</v>

10
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to understand evil I suppose the evil of the Cold War and the evil of</v>

11
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>the individuals who compose Nazi Germany and Stelling this Brusha.</v>

12
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I was reading Carl Jung because he,</v>

15
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

16
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>he wrote his tracks on alchemy where a lot about self transformation and he</v>

17
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:40.434
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to explain his works on Alchemy,</v>

20
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>but suffice it to say that his advice was something like,</v>

21
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>the advice he derived from the alchemist was that if you are going to make mess</v>

22
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>around with very complicated and dangerous matters,</v>

23
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way of putting it.</v>

24
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>That you should really put your life together.</v>

25
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say the right way to deal with your neuroticism is to increase</v>

26
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>your conscientiousness.</v>

27
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Because we also know that the higher your conscientiousness,</v>

28
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>the lower your neuroticism conscientiousness does seem to keep neuroticism and</v>

29
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:09.721
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>

30
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say,</v>

31
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>and have said this to many people,</v>

32
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.583
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.603
<v Speaker 1>clean your room,</v>

34
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>organize your life,</v>

35
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>like get a routine,</v>

36
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>get up everyday at the same time,</v>

37
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>go to bed at the same time.</v>

38
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Establish discipline habits.</v>

39
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And that will help a lot.</v>

40
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Schedule like,</v>

41
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>and here's how to use a schedule.</v>

42
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Use it.</v>

43
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Use a calendar.</v>
