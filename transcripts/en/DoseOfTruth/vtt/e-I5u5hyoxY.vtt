00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>You have written an article on how to write,</v>

2
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>can you do the same on how to speak?</v>

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I suppose I could,</v>

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I could tell you a little bit about it.</v>

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to speak about something,</v>

8
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>you need to know a lot about it.</v>

9
00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:28.720
<v Speaker 1>You need to know three or four times as much as you're going to speak about at</v>

10
00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:29.111
<v Speaker 1>minimum.</v>

11
00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:29.801
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

12
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>you have to do your background research.</v>

13
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>You have to have multiple stories at hand that you can use to illustrate your</v>

14
00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:38.290
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

15
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 1>And you have to have a point,</v>

16
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.180
<v Speaker 1>you have to organize what you're talking about around a problem.</v>

17
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:47.710
<v Speaker 1>So before I go on stage to speak on my tour,</v>

18
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I always sit for half an hour,</v>

19
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>some of which involves usually about five minutes of anxiety.</v>

20
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.101
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

21
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:54.934
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

22
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem I'm trying to address tonight,</v>

23
00:00:57.881 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>a central problem or a theme.</v>

24
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:00.101
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

25
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 1>it might be courage,</v>

26
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 1>it might be responsibility,</v>

27
00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>it might be meaning.</v>

28
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that serves as an organizing principle.</v>

30
00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:09.040
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the point.</v>

31
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>And then basically I organize say a dozen stories around that and I can kind of</v>

32
00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:17.410
<v Speaker 1>arrange them in it as a journey.</v>

33
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's a journey that circles the main point.</v>

34
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm trying to explore it to say what I think about courage,</v>

35
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:25.691
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

36
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:29.860
<v Speaker 1>but to take what I'm thinking farther than I've taken it already.</v>

37
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>And so then I can plot out,</v>

38
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:37.060
<v Speaker 1>little five minute stories that I have that are associated with courage.</v>

40
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>And then I can talk to the audience and I would say talk about what you know,</v>

41
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Speaker 1>use your personal experience because that's not something that you're actually a</v>

42
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:50.381
<v Speaker 1>master of.</v>

43
00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:51.850
<v Speaker 1>You can bring in other material,</v>

44
00:01:51.851 --> 00:01:56.140
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be tied to the real world through your own experience.</v>

45
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's not real.</v>

46
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
<v Speaker 1>It's also very good to speak directly to the audience,</v>

47
00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 1>to the individuals in the audience.</v>

48
00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm always looking at a single person,</v>

49
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>one after another and focusing on them and talking to them just like you'd have</v>

50
00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>a conversation with someone.</v>

51
00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:13.540
<v Speaker 1>And that way I can see if they're following along.</v>

52
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:15.910
<v Speaker 1>And I'm always listening to the audience.</v>

53
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 1>What I really like to hear from the audience is no noise at all.</v>

54
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:20.524
<v Speaker 1>Silence.</v>

55
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Because if the audience,</v>

56
00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:22.391
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

57
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:22.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:24.910
<v Speaker 1>if it's a couple of hundred or a couple of thousand people,</v>

59
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.250
<v Speaker 1>if the audience is dead silent,</v>

60
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 1>then I know that I'm on the right track.</v>

61
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.043
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

62
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.590
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I would say is you're telling stories.</v>

63
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.160
<v Speaker 1>So every fact that you relate or every set of facts has to be tied to his story.</v>

64
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.990
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a meaningful output,</v>

65
00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>which is something like why is it important to your life that you know this</v>

66
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.510
<v Speaker 1>fact?</v>

67
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.140
<v Speaker 1>How is it related to how you're going to conduct yourself moving forward or how</v>

68
00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see the world.</v>

69
00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>So cause that's kind of essence of meaning.</v>

70
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>How does this fact change the way you perceive the world or act in the world?</v>

71
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the meaning of the fact.</v>

72
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>And facts without meaning are dull.</v>

73
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>So you need to know that.</v>

74
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>You need to tell the truth.</v>

75
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

76
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.950
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

77
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.783
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

78
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

79
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and I mean for me,</v>

80
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>my talks are really,</v>

81
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>they're an attempt to explore a set of ideas in the most truthful way that I can</v>

82
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>manage.</v>

83
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's also an adventure because letting yourself speak freely about a</v>

84
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:29.711
<v Speaker 1>topic,</v>

85
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't always know where it's going to go.</v>

86
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

87
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>but that also hooks in the audience because they're not,</v>

88
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>they're along for the ride,</v>

89
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:36.551
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>And there's a risk.</v>

91
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>The risk is you might forget where you are,</v>

92
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>you might lose the thread.</v>

93
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>You might say something you regret,</v>

94
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>you might get confused.</v>

95
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.033
<v Speaker 1>And it's this,</v>

96
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>the talk should be a process of exploration,</v>

97
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>like a journey that you're taking the audience along on.</v>

98
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>It's the same when you're reading a novel,</v>

99
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:57.181
<v Speaker 1>like a great novel isn't exactly plotted out from beginning to end to begin</v>

100
00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

101
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.820
<v Speaker 1>The author is taking himself or herself and you on an intellectual adventure</v>

102
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>through the,</v>

103
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>through the character development and the characters have to be allowed to live</v>

104
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 1>and to express themselves and the novel needs to unfold.</v>

105
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like a color coy between the conscious mind and the unconscious source of</v>

106
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:17.764
<v Speaker 1>inspiration.</v>

107
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.010
<v Speaker 1>And the novel is actually a journey through a characterological landscape.</v>

108
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 1>And the author's shouldn't know where he or she is going to end up at the</v>

109
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

110
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Same with an artist and who's who's writing a song or,</v>

111
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

112
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>or a piece of music or a piece of visual art.</v>

113
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>There has to be play and exploration along the way.</v>

114
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.170
<v Speaker 1>And so you also don't want to deliver an overprepared talk in my estimation,</v>

115
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 1>or at least that's not how I do it.</v>

116
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>You want to have a theme,</v>

117
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a body of knowledge from which you can draw on and then you</v>

118
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>want to be actively exploring the idea in front of the audience.</v>

119
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's very gripping for everyone,</v>

120
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:56.584
<v Speaker 1>including you.</v>

121
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.251
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

122
00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 1>and you should learn something from the talk.</v>

123
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>It's an opportunity to think on your feet.</v>

124
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.741
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>

125
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 1>that's my style of lecturing.</v>

126
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

127
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

128
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a trapeze act without a safety net,</v>

129
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:09.911
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

130
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of what makes it gripping is that there's a high probability of</v>

131
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

132
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>And I would say with any performance that's going to be</v>

133
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.473
<v Speaker 1>gripping,</v>

134
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 1>that on the edge of the seat gripping,</v>

135
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 1>there has to be a high probability of failure.</v>

136
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I don't speak with notes.</v>

137
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

138
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>if you speak with notes,</v>

139
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 1>which you might have to,</v>

140
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 1>if you're a beginning speaker,</v>

141
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 1>then you can not fail because you can always read the notes.</v>

142
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.663
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a,</v>

143
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a net you'll fall in the net but you won't die,</v>

144
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>but you'll never do anything spectacular.</v>

145
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing is if you're going to do something spectacular,</v>

146
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>you have to take the risk.</v>

147
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to take the risk,</v>

148
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>you have to think on your feet.</v>

149
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 1>And then you also have to have something to think about.</v>

150
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:54.551
<v Speaker 1>You have to be,</v>

151
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>have been working on this material.</v>

152
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:56.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

153
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on stuff I talk about for 30 years,</v>

154
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>for tens of thousands of hours.</v>

155
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>And so have that reservoir of knowledge I suppose.</v>

156
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:06.801
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

157
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>whenever I read something new,</v>

158
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm slotting it into the node structure that I use to generate my talks.</v>

159
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>And I'm reading all the time.</v>

160
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 1>And lots of the things I read,</v>

161
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>

162
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>They're not relevant to my central mission,</v>

163
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 1>whatever that happens to be.</v>

164
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it looks something like the delineation of the relationship</v>

165
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 1>between responsibility and meaning and,</v>

166
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 1>and maybe responsibility meaning and perception.</v>

167
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

168
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 1>And so I have a central concern or deeper than that in some sense.</v>

169
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

170
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.340
<v Speaker 1>my central concern was how to ensure personally that if I was tempted in a</v>

171
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>situation like the situations that arose in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany,</v>

172
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:53.831
<v Speaker 1>that I wouldn't fall prey to those totalitarian systems and act in the re</v>

173
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible manner that so many people acted in.</v>

174
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 1>That's really been a driving concern of mine.</v>

175
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.420
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

176
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.490
<v Speaker 1>and that bleeds over into the relationship between meaning and responsibility</v>

177
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:05.324
<v Speaker 1>and perception.</v>

178
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 1>So there's a core set of problems that I'm working on in every talk is an</v>

179
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>attempt to further develop those.</v>

180
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.590
<v Speaker 1>So you also have to have a problem.</v>

181
00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:13.424
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

182
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.891
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

183
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:16.011
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

184
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to have a problem.</v>

185
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:17.391
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

186
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:17.571
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

187
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:17.991
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

188
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>

189
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>

190
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 1>you've got problems anyways.</v>

191
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.551
<v Speaker 1>If you're alive,</v>

192
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 1>you've got problems.</v>

193
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Pick one of them.</v>

194
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 1>It can be your problem.</v>

195
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And that can be the problem.</v>

196
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 1>You try to address whatever that happens to be.</v>

197
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>And then you have some to talk about how am I going to address this problem?</v>

198
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>How can this problem be addressed?</v>

199
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 1>So you need to have a problem too.</v>

200
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:38.660
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to talk just like you need to have a problem if you're going to</v>

201
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>write because the writing is an attempt to solve the problem.</v>

202
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 1>And so as they're talking,</v>

203
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.420
<v Speaker 1>if you're not trying to solve a problem,</v>

204
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you doing talking?</v>

205
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Why should anyone care?</v>

206
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a real problem to like,</v>

207
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

209
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 1>a nail biter of a problem,</v>

210
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 1>a dragon have a problem.</v>

211
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:54.930
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

212
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>if it's a problem that everyone else shares so much,</v>

213
00:07:56.961 --> 00:07:57.794
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>

214
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.963
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

215
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.260
<v Speaker 1>and then you grapple with it.</v>

216
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
