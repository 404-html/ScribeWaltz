1
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.373
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.553
<v Speaker 1>What time is it?</v>

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Eight 50 I started when [inaudible] sorry.</v>

4
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:19.194
<v Speaker 1>It's been</v>

5
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.503
<v Speaker 1>six 30.</v>

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I should stop them.</v>

7
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

8
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go for five more minutes and then I'll wrap this up.</v>

9
00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:46.270
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about intersectionality and and white privilege a bit.</v>

10
00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:47.104
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.613
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

12
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.670
<v Speaker 2>so I first said,</v>

13
00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:55.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

14
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 2>we analyzed Marxism.</v>

15
00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 2>We out,</v>

16
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I analyze postmodernism.</v>

17
00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

18
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I suggested that postmodernism was a way for the Marxists to keep going under a</v>

19
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:05.084
<v Speaker 2>new guys.</v>

20
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I suggested that Marxism was fundamentally based on hatred rather than sympathy</v>

21
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.323
<v Speaker 2>and empathy.</v>

22
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I suggested that the carbs is where the,</v>

23
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.500
<v Speaker 2>the evidence for that.</v>

24
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

25
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I told you why I think postmodernism is fundamentally wrong.</v>

26
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.333
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

27
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Now I want to talk to you a little bit about white privilege.</v>

28
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing that I can,</v>

30
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't got this quite figured out yet,</v>

31
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I can't quite figure out why the postmodernists have made the canonical</v>

32
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.101
<v Speaker 2>distinctions.</v>

33
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 2>They made race,</v>

34
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.920
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity,</v>

35
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 2>sexual proclivity,</v>

36
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 2>sexual gender identity.</v>

37
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's say those are four dimensions along which people vary.</v>

38
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 2>But there's a very large number of dimensions along which people vary,</v>

39
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.131
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

40
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:53.964
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

41
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 2>given that there's an infinite number of ways of interpreting the world,</v>

42
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 2>you can immediately point out if there's an infinite number of dimensions along</v>

43
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 2>which people vary.</v>

44
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 2>And so then the postmodern question is why would you privilege some of those</v>

45
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 2>dimensions over the other?</v>

46
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.881
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>

47
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:09.121
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

48
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 2>because it sustains your bloody Marxist interpretation.</v>

49
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:12.211
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

50
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:14.700
<v Speaker 2>But you're not going to say that cause it marginalizes,</v>

51
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

52
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 2>You've marginalized that so you can ignore it.</v>

53
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the fun things about postmodernism.</v>

54
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

55
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.073
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

56
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 2>I have a very vulgar image in my mind,</v>

57
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.713
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

58
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I won't share that with you,</v>

59
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 2>but you can infer it.</v>

60
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Here's some ways people differ.</v>

61
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:34.921
<v Speaker 2>Intelligence,</v>

62
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:35.491
<v Speaker 2>temperament,</v>

63
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 2>geography,</v>

64
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 2>historical time.</v>

65
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 2>You live now and not a hundred years ago.</v>

66
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Attractiveness.</v>

67
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 2>That's a big,</v>

68
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.083
<v Speaker 2>that's a big one.</v>

69
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.433
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

70
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Would you imagine?</v>

71
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

72
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.803
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>

73
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.620
<v Speaker 1>You won't.</v>

74
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 2>We won't go there either.</v>

75
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.700
<v Speaker 2>You eat it's advantages to be young.</v>

76
00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 2>You've got potential disadvantageous to be old.</v>

77
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:54.820
<v Speaker 2>You've got wealth,</v>

78
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.361
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

79
00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:56.194
<v Speaker 2>that's a good one.</v>

80
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Sex women have advantages.</v>

81
00:02:58.841 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Men advantages.</v>

82
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Maybe one has more than the other.</v>

83
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not self evident.</v>

84
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Women live about eight years longer.</v>

85
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 2>They're multiorgasmic,</v>

86
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 2>athleticism,</v>

87
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:12.551
<v Speaker 2>wealth,</v>

88
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:13.440
<v Speaker 2>family structure,</v>

89
00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:13.981
<v Speaker 2>friendship,</v>

90
00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:14.814
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

91
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Well then there's the classic,</v>

92
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

93
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.091
<v Speaker 2>postmodern once,</v>

94
00:03:20.091 --> 00:03:20.511
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

95
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:21.051
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity,</v>

96
00:03:21.051 --> 00:03:21.884
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

97
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Why not those other dimensions of variation,</v>

98
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.490
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence that they're less important.</v>

99
00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:28.881
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

100
00:03:28.881 --> 00:03:30.980
<v Speaker 2>there's quite a bit of evidence that they're more important,</v>

101
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.960
<v Speaker 2>so like why not consider them?</v>

102
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Then you get intersectionality.</v>

103
00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:36.470
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that's really comical,</v>

104
00:03:36.471 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 2>I think because the postmodernists identity politics types actually realized</v>

105
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:40.761
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

106
00:03:40.761 --> 00:03:41.510
<v Speaker 2>They thought,</v>

107
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.691
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

108
00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:41.931
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

109
00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:42.890
<v Speaker 2>race and gender.</v>

110
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.913
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

111
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 2>What if you're,</v>

112
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 2>what if you're a black woman?</v>

113
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 2>But that's a problem because well now you've got two dimensions of</v>

114
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 2>differentiation.</v>

115
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 2>What the hell are we going to do about that?</v>

116
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:55.294
<v Speaker 2>And what if you're,</v>

117
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 2>what if you're gay and black and female?</v>

118
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

119
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 2>then what if you're not very bright and gay and black and female,</v>

120
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>and then what if you're ugly and not very bright and gay and black and female</v>

121
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 2>and like you can keep playing that game.</v>

122
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 2>You can keep playing that game and infinite number of ways because there's an</v>

123
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 2>infinite number of ways to categorize things.</v>

124
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 2>As the postmodern authority pointed out.</v>

125
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 2>And so the intersectionality theorist came along to plug the hole,</v>

126
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know where they're going.</v>

127
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand that the logical conclusion of intersectionality is</v>

128
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:28.771
<v Speaker 2>individuality because there's so many different ways of categorizing people's</v>

129
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 2>advantages and disadvantages that if you take that all the way out to the end,</v>

130
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:33.461
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

131
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 2>well the individuals,</v>

132
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate minority.</v>

133
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly right.</v>

134
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what the West discovered.</v>

135
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 2>And you know the intersection lists of get there if they don't kill everyone</v>

136
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:42.604
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

137
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 2>So on to white privilege.</v>

138
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's really interesting to find out where these ideas come from cause it's</v>

139
00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:57.770
<v Speaker 2>usually the scholarship is so awful,</v>

140
00:04:57.771 --> 00:04:59.690
<v Speaker 2>you just cannot possibly believe it.</v>

141
00:04:59.691 --> 00:05:01.130
<v Speaker 2>It's just absolutely,</v>

142
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.743
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't.</v>

143
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.270
<v Speaker 2>At the University of Toronto in the psychology department,</v>

144
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 2>the original paper on white privilege wouldn't have received a passing grade for</v>

145
00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:14.900
<v Speaker 2>the hypothesis part of a undergraduate honors thesis.</v>

146
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.550
<v Speaker 2>We're not even close.</v>

147
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.050
<v Speaker 2>There's no methodology at all.</v>

148
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.160
<v Speaker 2>The person who wrote it,</v>

149
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.520
<v Speaker 2>it was called white privilege and male privilege.</v>

150
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 2>A personal account of coming to see correspondences through work in women's</v>

151
00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:29.084
<v Speaker 2>studies.</v>

152
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

153
00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:30.591
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

154
00:05:30.591 --> 00:05:31.550
<v Speaker 2>personal account.</v>

155
00:05:31.551 --> 00:05:31.881
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

156
00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:32.391
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

157
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:33.224
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

158
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:38.421
<v Speaker 2>so she,</v>

159
00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.970
<v Speaker 2>she listed a bunch of ways that she thought.</v>

160
00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:45.200
<v Speaker 2>She says these are personal personal examples of her unearned privilege or</v>

161
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.820
<v Speaker 2>unearned privilege that she saw as she experienced in the 1970s 1980s so this,</v>

162
00:05:49.821 --> 00:05:50.241
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

163
00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:50.410
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

164
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.310
<v Speaker 2>so this idea is the opinion of one person who wrote one paper that has</v>

165
00:05:55.311 --> 00:05:56.840
<v Speaker 2>absolutely no empirical backing,</v>

166
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>which is a set of hypotheses which had never been subject to any statistical</v>

167
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:03.164
<v Speaker 2>analysis.</v>

168
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Like if I ask you a bunch of questions,</v>

169
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not obvious how many questions I'm asking you because I could say,</v>

170
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 2>how tall are you?</v>

171
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.671
<v Speaker 2>Or I could say,</v>

172
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 2>if you're laying on the ground,</v>

173
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 2>how extended would you be?</v>

174
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.091
<v Speaker 2>It's like that.</v>

175
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Two questions.</v>

176
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.471
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

177
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:15.651
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

178
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 2>it's one question.</v>

179
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>It's just as two ways and the way you figure out if you ask someone a bunch of</v>

180
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:21.441
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>

181
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 2>how many questions you're asking them is by doing something called a factor</v>

182
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:25.071
<v Speaker 2>analysis,</v>

183
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of an an elementary form.</v>

184
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

185
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Now of social science investigation.</v>

186
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 2>If you make a questionnaire you have to subject it to a factor analysis cause</v>

187
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 2>you got to find out how many questions you're asking because you might think</v>

188
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 2>it's 60 but it's probably not.</v>

189
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 2>It's probably five.</v>

190
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the big five by the way.</v>

191
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

192
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 2>who cares about that?</v>

193
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as methodology.</v>

194
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

195
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 2>that's all part of the oppressive white male European patriarchy,</v>

196
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 2>so we can just not bother with that and we can pen a few notes about how we</v>

197
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 2>think the world is constructed and then we can screw up the entire political</v>

198
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 2>system two decades later.</v>

199
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.851
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

200
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 2>so here's your white privilege lists.</v>

201
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:04.221
<v Speaker 2>Some of it,</v>

202
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 2>there's like 50 things I can,</v>

203
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 2>if I wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race most of the time if</v>

204
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:11.091
<v Speaker 2>I should need to move,</v>

205
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I can be pretty sure of renting or purchasing housing in an area which I can</v>

206
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 2>afford and in which I would want to live.</v>

207
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a wealth thing by the way.</v>

208
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.980
<v Speaker 2>I can be pretty sure that my neighbors in such a location will be neutral or</v>

209
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:22.814
<v Speaker 2>pleasant to me.</v>

210
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I can go shopping alone most of the time,</v>

211
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 2>pretty well assured that I will not be followed or harassed.</v>

212
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.890
<v Speaker 2>I can turn on my television or open to the front page of the paper and see</v>

213
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 2>people of my waist race widely represented.</v>

214
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

215
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.950
<v Speaker 2>When I am told about our national heritage or about civilization,</v>

216
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.370
<v Speaker 2>I am shown that people of my color made it what it is.</v>

217
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

218
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

219
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 2>there's 50 of those I think.</v>

220
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:44.624
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

221
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.583
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

222
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

223
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Is that white privilege?</v>

224
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Is that like majority privilege?</v>

225
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

226
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.061
<v Speaker 2>It's the same tree.</v>

227
00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:52.721
<v Speaker 2>You go to China,</v>

228
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:53.381
<v Speaker 2>you're Chinese.</v>

229
00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:53.891
<v Speaker 2>It's the same.</v>

230
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:54.111
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

231
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:55.000
<v Speaker 2>If you're Chinese</v>

232
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 2>does the majority privilege and if it's majority privileges,</v>

233
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 2>like isn't that just part of living within your culture?</v>

234
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you live in your culture.</v>

235
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 2>You're privileged as a member of that culture.</v>

236
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:08.451
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

237
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:11.000
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's what the culture is for.</v>

238
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's for.</v>

239
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Why would you bother building the damn thing if it didn't accrue benefits to</v>

240
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:16.550
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

241
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.241
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>

242
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:17.421
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

243
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:21.620
<v Speaker 2>one of the consequences that it accrues fewer benefits to those who aren't in</v>

244
00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:22.454
<v Speaker 2>the culture.</v>

245
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

246
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 2>but you can't immediately associate that with race.</v>

247
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 2>You can't just do that.</v>

248
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Say It's white privileged.</v>

249
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.030
<v Speaker 2>There's many things it could be certainly could be wealth and the intersection</v>

250
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 2>people have already figured out that there's many things that could be.</v>

251
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

252
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.820
<v Speaker 2>so like what the hell?</v>

253
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

254
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:38.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

255
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 2>what's going on while we left these pseudo disciplines into the university</v>

256
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:44.780
<v Speaker 2>because we're stupid and guilty.</v>

257
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Seriously,</v>

258
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.050
<v Speaker 2>and they have no methodological requirements and plenty of power and plenty of</v>

259
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:56.051
<v Speaker 2>time to produce nonsensical research and produce like resentful activists and</v>

260
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 2>now we're bearing the fruits of that.</v>

261
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 2>It's not pretty so white privilege.</v>

262
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:01.981
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

263
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:06.981
<v Speaker 2>the other thing you might notice is that to attribute to the individuals of a</v>

264
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:08.334
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

265
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:13.430
<v Speaker 2>the attributes of that community on the basis of their racial identity is called</v>

266
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>

267
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 2>That's what racism is.</v>

268
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way of defining it.</v>

269
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.520
<v Speaker 2>It's attributing to the individual the characteristics of the group as if the</v>

270
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 2>group was homogenous.</v>

271
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Now the intersectional people have already decided that's not a fair game</v>

272
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 2>because there's so many differences between people.</v>

273
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 2>But the postmodernists don't care about logical coherence because they regard</v>

274
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:36.450
<v Speaker 2>logical coherence.</v>

275
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Here it comes again as a creation of the white,</v>

276
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 2>European male patriarchal structure that's designed to oppress the oppressed.</v>

277
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's technically the case.</v>

278
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.120
<v Speaker 2>So logical incoherence,</v>

279
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.051
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

280
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:49.651
<v Speaker 2>And you could say,</v>

281
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:50.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

282
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.220
<v Speaker 2>if you act out your logically incoherent ideas in the world,</v>

283
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 2>you're going to run face first into a brick wall.</v>

284
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.880
<v Speaker 2>And the postmodern answer to that is there's actually no real world.</v>

285
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.290
<v Speaker 2>It's all interpretation.</v>

286
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.700
<v Speaker 2>So there's no,</v>

287
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 2>there's no having that discussion,</v>

288
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 2>but the postmodernists don't care because they don't believe that discussion</v>

289
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 2>between people of different power groups as possible.</v>
