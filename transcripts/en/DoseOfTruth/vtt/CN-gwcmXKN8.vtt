George gabriel on drug since Jordan,

2
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:11.961
please help me.

3
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:16.400
I'm 99th percentile and openness and zero with percentile and conscientiousness.

4
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.643
Yeah.

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.870
Well how old are you?

6
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:21.710
That's the first thing.

7
00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:22.100
If you're,

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.940
if you're young,

9
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.360
that's um,

10
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.290
because younger people are less conscientious.

11
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:29.270
So that's one thing to keep in mind.

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.340
If you're very open like that,

13
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:33.110
you need to be doing something creative,

14
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.720
but you're going to have to learn how to discipline yourself.

15
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.220
There's just no way around it.

16
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:39.620
And I would say go do the future authoring program.

17
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:40.460
That's a good start.

18
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.560
And you'll have to learn how to schedule your time and how to get up at the same

19
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:46.311
time every day.

20
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:47.600
And it's going to be a real struggle.

21
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.590
But you know,

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.670
you,

23
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.391
you can do it.

24
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:53.720
I've had students who are very high in openness and low in conscientiousness as

25
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:55.550
graduate students and they disciplined themselves.

26
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:57.710
You need to find something that you're really interested in,

27
00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:00.710
that you're willing to pursue and then you have to hit it hard.

28
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.093
Um,

29
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.100
so that's what I would say.

30
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:07.430
But do the future authoring program and get yourself a plan and start to

31
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:08.031
implement it.

32
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:10.360
And every time you fall astray,

33
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.990
then get back at it.

34
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.801
And you know,

35
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:17.300
you may have to build up your conscientiousness over a number of years and,

36
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.740
but it's worth doing so.
