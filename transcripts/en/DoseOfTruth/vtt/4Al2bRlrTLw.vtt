00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.250
<v Speaker 1>What is my opinion on open</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

2
00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>polyamory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other forms of non monogamy?</v>

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that as a medium to longterm</v>

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're completely untenable because</v>

5
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

6
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>are fundamentally pair bonding and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

7
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>if you're just talking about casual sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

8
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I think casual sex is a contradiction in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

9
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything about sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's casual and I think that people</v>

10
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>are deceiving themselves badly whenever</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think so they might like to live in</v>

11
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:28.420
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>19 seventies playboy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent fantasy.</v>

13
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen that work under any</v>

14
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>circumstances whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think people get hurt badly.</v>

15
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>It's also a bad medium to longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy because,</v>

16
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pair bonding is a,</v>

17
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>is the most stable arrangement we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>of at least so far.</v>

18
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't even put it that way.</v>

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>It's the only stable a mode of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we know for the long run and that's</v>

20
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>especially the case when you bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>children into the equation.</v>

21
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's delusional fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that people who are,</v>

23
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>who believe that such things work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

24
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're open people in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative and their exploratory and all</v>

25
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>of that and fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often they're just unconscientious</v>

26
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>and they don't want to take any</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and they want to live in</v>

27
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 1>this wish fulfillment fantasy where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody can have all the sex they want</v>

28
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>all the time and it's always wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one gets hurt and it's like,</v>

29
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just doesn't work in the real</v>

30
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
