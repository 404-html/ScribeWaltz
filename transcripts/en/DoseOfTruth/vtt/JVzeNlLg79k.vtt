1
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Plays a circuit.</v>

2
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>So there's a guy named Jaak,</v>

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Panksepp,</v>

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.631
<v Speaker 1>Panksepp,</v>

5
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:12.931
<v Speaker 1>p,</v>

6
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:13.081
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

7
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:13.261
<v Speaker 1>n,</v>

8
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:13.591
<v Speaker 1>k,</v>

9
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:13.861
<v Speaker 1>s,</v>

10
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:14.011
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>

11
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:14.221
<v Speaker 1>p.</v>

12
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:14.521
<v Speaker 1>P,</v>

13
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:19.521
<v Speaker 1>who I would roundly recommend that you read if you're interested in in</v>

14
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>behavioral neuroscience.</v>

15
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a genius.</v>

16
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>He's sort of on par with gray as far as I'm concerned.</v>

17
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>And on par with Swanson and peg,</v>

18
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>except I believe discovered the play circuit in mammals.</v>

19
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:30.211
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

20
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>two thumbs up for him.</v>

22
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.431
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

23
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of like discovering a continent from the psychological perspective.</v>

24
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>And it's a search,</v>

25
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a circuit that separate from exploration,</v>

26
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of interesting cause you think about play as a form of exploratory</v>

27
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.124
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

28
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's sufficiently different from,</v>

29
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>from standard exploratory behavior that it has a circuit that's devoted to it.</v>

30
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of primary circuits,</v>

31
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>and they're networked in with the rest of the brain.</v>

33
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>And obviously circuit is a,</v>

34
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:00:57.871 --> 00:00:58.704
<v Speaker 1>a metaphor.</v>

36
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>So I could say there's a lot of primary subpersonalities,</v>

37
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>they're like one eyed monster.</v>

38
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>There's only one thing thereafter,</v>

39
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>and there's a whole bunch of them.</v>

41
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>And so roughly speaking,</v>

42
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>they regulate the things I already mentioned that the hypothalamus regulates</v>

43
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>defensive aggression,</v>

44
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>sexual behavior,</v>

45
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.211
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>

46
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>regulation,</v>

47
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 1>food and water intake,</v>

48
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>excretion,</v>

49
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>while then there's one for breathing,</v>

50
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>then there's another for pain,</v>

51
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>then there's another for anxiety.</v>

52
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.653
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>and there's another for exploration and there's others.</v>

54
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>There's sensory modules as well.</v>

55
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a visual circuit and an auditory circuit and the olfactory circuit and</v>

57
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>the circuit that's devoted to taste and,</v>

58
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:45.201
<v Speaker 1>and there's a circuit that keeps track of how your body is localized in space.</v>

59
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a parietal circuit.</v>

60
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

61
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>what else is important?</v>

62
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

63
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:55.671
<v Speaker 1>There's a circuit that you can use to abstractly model perceptual structures and</v>

64
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior before you implement them in the world.</v>

65
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be a higher cortical function fundamentally.</v>

66
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>And you'd associate that with the contents of your consciousness.</v>

67
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a language circuit,</v>

68
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.593
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

70
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.211
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

71
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>There's an empathy circuit that mediates maternal behavior.</v>

72
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a hunting circuit that mediates predatory behavior.</v>

73
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a circuit to check dominance and subordinate subordination.</v>

74
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.573
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

75
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a circuit that mediates creativity and human beings.</v>

76
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a circuit that mediates social activity.</v>

77
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

78
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.601
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

79
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:33.271
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

80
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>the positive reinforcing nature of social activity.</v>

81
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's quite tightly expo x associated with the exploratory circuit.</v>

82
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

83
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.663
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

84
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.271
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

85
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:44.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:45.920
<v Speaker 1>that's not too bad for the beginning.</v>

87
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I've missed some and I'll remember them.</v>

88
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:48.310
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

89
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>and each of those subsystems is important enough so that there's a neuro</v>

90
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:53.330
<v Speaker 1>architecture devoted to it.</v>

91
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Now some of those neural architectures are flexible enough so that if they don't</v>

92
00:02:58.581 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>develop one brain area,</v>

93
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>they'll develop an another.</v>

94
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

95
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly as if the location of these functions is specifically</v>

96
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>determined in advance before development.</v>

97
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

98
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>if you have a baby and it has,</v>

99
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:13.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy and the epilepsy is really bad,</v>

101
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they'll take out the whole left or right hemisphere.</v>

102
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>And if they do that early enough doesn't really seem to have much consequence</v>

103
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:23.104
<v Speaker 1>for the baby,</v>

104
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty weird.</v>

106
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:24.671
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>

107
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:24.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>half the brain that problem fairly useful.</v>

109
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:31.921
<v Speaker 1>But in some sense it's as if the cortical elements of the brain are territory</v>

110
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>that can be inhabited in colonized by the lower levels of the brain.</v>

111
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say that the lower levels of the brain,</v>

112
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>including the visual input systems,</v>

113
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.140
<v Speaker 1>would just as soon call a nice,</v>

114
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>what we call the visual cortex.</v>

115
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>But if there's no visual cortex because it's being removed,</v>

116
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>then they'll just go call tonight as part of the auditory cortex.</v>

117
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

118
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:57.840
<v Speaker 1>and what you see in other situations sometimes is that people have high,</v>

119
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.080
<v Speaker 1>high hydrocephaly.</v>

120
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that their cerebral spinal fluid builds up in their</v>

121
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:03.514
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

122
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>And so the ventricles get very enlarged.</v>

123
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take an x ray or an MRI or other sort of scan,</v>

124
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:10.301
<v Speaker 1>if these people,</v>

125
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:15.301
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that their entire skull is full of water except for like a half inch</v>

126
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>thin slice of cortical tissue around the water,</v>

127
00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:20.201
<v Speaker 1>like a balloon.</v>

128
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:21.930
<v Speaker 1>And one of the guys who was like that,</v>

129
00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>they had a phd in mathematics from Cambridge,</v>

130
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>5% of his brain tissue is intact.</v>

132
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.671
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

133
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty active that 5% and you could also be sure that it would not have</v>

134
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>been very resilient to damage.</v>
