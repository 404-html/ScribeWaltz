1
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.640
<v Speaker 1>The meaning that sustains you in life and responsibility,</v>

2
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.200
<v Speaker 1>which is not a case that's made very effectively but needs to be made.</v>

3
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Because most of the meaning that people experience in their lives that's</v>

4
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:19.030
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile is a consequence of,</v>

5
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>of adopting voluntary responsibility.</v>

6
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.913
<v Speaker 1>How do you mean?</v>

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>you think about the people you admire,</v>

9
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:27.041
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

10
00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:29.320
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you get out of bed on a hard day,</v>

11
00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>it's because you have worthwhile things to do that you think are necessary and</v>

12
00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:33.701
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

13
00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:37.570
<v Speaker 1>And those usually involve at minimum taking care of yourself.</v>

14
00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:38.404
<v Speaker 1>But if you're,</v>

15
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.573
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

16
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 1>if you're developed in a reasonable manner,</v>

17
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>then you have a family to take care of and you have a community to set,</v>

18
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:45.521
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:50.380
<v Speaker 1>And you have things that need to be done to reduce the amount of unnecessary</v>

20
00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:54.100
<v Speaker 1>suffering in the world and to constrain the amount of malevolence that you</v>

21
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:59.101
<v Speaker 1>manifest or that you encounter and you need that sort of meaning to offset the</v>

22
00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>fact that life is difficult.</v>

23
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.183
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

24
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 1>the title of your book is at 12 rules for life,</v>

25
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>an antidote to cows and I come to chaos laser.</v>

26
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>But the 12 rules as you read them,</v>

27
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 1>standup state,</v>

28
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>just shoulders back,</v>

29
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>don't get children,</v>

30
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>do anything that makes you dislike them at set your house in perfect order</v>

31
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>before you criticize the world app.</v>

32
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.803
<v Speaker 1>Get kind of,</v>

33
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.570
<v Speaker 1>they sound like common sense,</v>

34
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.741
<v Speaker 1>common sense.</v>

35
00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 1>But if people forget why common sense is common,</v>

36
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.300
<v Speaker 1>it's common for a reason or and and in,</v>

38
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.670
<v Speaker 1>in then if those common sense dictums are challenged,</v>

39
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.970
<v Speaker 1>people don't necessarily know how to defend them because they're,</v>

40
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>they seem self evident.</v>

41
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:48.400
<v Speaker 1>So partly what I've done in the book is to take things that people know,</v>

42
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

43
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.530
<v Speaker 1>and purposefully so,</v>

44
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>and to outline why they're true and conceptually and philosophically,</v>

45
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:59.170
<v Speaker 1>but also why they're necessary to apply practically.</v>

46
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>And to do both of those at the same time cause abstract conceptions aren't much</v>

47
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.640
<v Speaker 1>use unless you can nail them down to something that's practically implementable.</v>

48
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.490
<v Speaker 1>And so I made sure I bridged the gap between those,</v>

49
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.683
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

50
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.790
<v Speaker 1>what extremes in the book.</v>

51
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.953
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

52
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>what do you think makes you so controversial?</v>

53
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a,</v>

55
00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:20.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

56
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean many things are controversial in today's politically polarized climate.</v>

57
00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>And everything gets politicized.</v>

58
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I am controversial.</v>

59
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I became embroiled in controversy in part because of,</v>

60
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:32.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.890
<v Speaker 1>because I'm no friend of the collectivist left wing.</v>

63
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.110
<v Speaker 1>And I've made that very clear and I objected to some legislation in Canada that</v>

64
00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:44.350
<v Speaker 1>was passed that compelled speech in a manner that had never been,</v>

65
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>never been attempted in any system that utilizes English common law and which I</v>

66
00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:54.940
<v Speaker 1>thought and still believe it was an absolutely appalling piece of legislation.</v>

67
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 1>But to push it simply for our listeners,</v>

68
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>that's me patronizing the listeners.</v>

69
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

70
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>you talk about these things at length,</v>

71
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>it has to do,</v>

72
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.471
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

73
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>you tell me what it has to do with,</v>

74
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

75
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.810
<v Speaker 1>it has to do as far as I'm concerned with the attempts by a coterie of</v>

76
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:18.481
<v Speaker 1>relatively radical left wing collectivist to establish linguistic dominance in</v>

77
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>certain conceptual spheres.</v>

78
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.371
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

79
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:26.371
<v Speaker 1>we have the idea that gender expression and gender identity are purely socially</v>

80
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>constructed and also,</v>

81
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

82
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>independent of biology.</v>

83
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>That's basically be written into the legal fabric in Canada now.</v>

84
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's preposterous.</v>

85
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>It's factually incorrect,</v>

86
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly factually incorrect.</v>

87
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>And it's purely ideological stance.</v>

88
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>But people do w trans as they say,</v>

89
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:49.290
<v Speaker 1>and he put a Stencil,</v>

90
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>really are female do become male and vice versa.</v>

91
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that they very independently things can be linked in</v>

93
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.753
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

94
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm still variation.</v>

95
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Well the overwhelming majority of people who are biologically male identify as</v>

96
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>male.</v>

97
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>It's more than 99.9% and the overwhelming majority of people who are</v>

98
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 1>biologically female identify as female and are heterosexual.</v>

99
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that those things are independent is insane.</v>

100
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>They're not even close to independent.</v>

101
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean there aren't,</v>

102
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>there aren't exceptions.</v>

103
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And when you're crafting laws,</v>

104
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's associated with scientific facts,</v>

105
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>you have to get your terminology right.</v>

106
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>The claim of the social constructionists is that all of these areas,</v>

107
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

108
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 1>biological sex,</v>

109
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>gender expression,</v>

110
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

111
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

112
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>so sexual preference vary independently and it's all a consequence of</v>

113
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>socialization.</v>

114
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>

115
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong at every single level of analysis.</v>

116
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's important.</v>

117
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>there are biological influences play a major role on people obviously.</v>

119
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

120
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 1>as your societies become more egalitarian,</v>

121
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>and this has been demonstrated clearly in the Scandinavian countries,</v>

122
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 1>as societies become more egalitarian in their social policies,</v>

123
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 1>the differences between men and women get bigger,</v>

124
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>not smaller.</v>

125
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 1>How well,</v>

126
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>because it turns out that if you flatten out the socio cultural structure,</v>

127
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that make men and women the same as it turns out the</v>

128
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>biological differences maximize.</v>

129
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So the biggest differences in personality and interest,</v>

130
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>which partly determines occupational choice.</v>

131
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:26.651
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

132
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>the biggest differences are in the Scandinavian countries and they've grown.</v>

133
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Has the Scandinavian countries,</v>

134
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian countries have become more egalitarian.</v>

135
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>And how does that manifest?</v>

136
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>What manifests itself and occupational choice for example,</v>

137
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>but and but also in in personality.</v>

138
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>How do you mean in occupation or choice?</v>

139
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are fewer women in the stem studies as societies in the stem</v>

140
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 1>fields,</v>

141
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.531
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

142
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:48.191
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

143
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:49.240
<v Speaker 1>engineering and mathematics.</v>

144
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>As societies become more egalitarian,</v>

145
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 1>fewer women go into the stem fields,</v>

146
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>not more.</v>

147
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 1>And it looks like it's a consequence of their free choice.</v>

148
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Partly because the personality differences between men and women,</v>

149
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>between men and women grow as societies become more equal.</v>

150
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And so do the differences in their interest.</v>

151
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>It's because men and women are actually biologically different to some degree.</v>

152
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

153
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.160
<v Speaker 1>men and women are quite the,</v>

155
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.213
<v Speaker 1>quite similar.</v>

156
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

157
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a trait like aggression,</v>

158
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>if you pick a random man and a random woman out of the population and you had to</v>

159
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>lay a bet on who was more aggressive,</v>

160
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>if you bet on the woman,</v>

161
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 1>you'd be right 40% of the time,</v>

162
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 1>which an yes.</v>

163
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>And so that's quite an overlap,</v>

164
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

165
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>But then if you go out to the extremes and if you had to pick the one in 100</v>

166
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 1>most aggressive person,</v>

167
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 1>it would almost always be male.</v>

168
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's why so many men are in prison.</v>

169
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's 10 to one males to female in prison.</v>

170
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.701
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

171
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:47.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because you can have very much similarity in population</v>

172
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 1>overlap in the middle,</v>

173
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 1>but quite a lot of difference at the extremes.</v>

174
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.483
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

175
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.030
<v Speaker 1>It was alleged that you made very controversial remarks following the m Harvard</v>

176
00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>events in Toronto where a man who's at,</v>

177
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 1>I presume we'll do life killed,</v>

178
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:11.681
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 10 people and drove insurable and wanted to do more and arising</v>

179
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:13.154
<v Speaker 1>from that,</v>

180
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.490
<v Speaker 1>it was implied that somehow that this had to do with the fact that he couldn't</v>

181
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 1>have sex with a woman.</v>

182
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

183
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.190
<v Speaker 1>you said it was alleged that I make controversial comments.</v>

184
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.180
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

185
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:27.680
<v Speaker 1>You got the terminology right there.</v>

186
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:32.681
<v Speaker 1>What I pointed out was that social in enforcement of monogamous norms is one way</v>

187
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:34.400
<v Speaker 1>that societies around the world,</v>

188
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 1>male aggression at bay,</v>

189
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 1>and that's an absolutely solid finding from a hundred years of anthropology,</v>

190
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:42.410
<v Speaker 1>one that's often cited by people on the left.</v>

191
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>So what happened in the New York Times article that you're referring to was that</v>

192
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>that was taken radically out of context and their old reporter knew that</v>

193
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:51.411
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well.</v>

194
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:53.210
<v Speaker 1>She was very intelligent young woman.</v>

195
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 1>She knew exactly what she was doing when she did that,</v>

196
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>and to make the case that monogamous social norms,</v>

197
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 1>which are pretty much universal around the world,</v>

198
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

199
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.510
<v Speaker 1>even though people have some tendency towards multiple partners,</v>

200
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.110
<v Speaker 1>the reason that monogamous social norms emerge is partly to keep male aggression</v>

201
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:10.973
<v Speaker 1>under control.</v>

202
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>That's not controversial.</v>

203
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who knows the anthropological psychological literature understands it's,</v>

204
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 1>that's the purpose of it.</v>

205
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

206
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of purposes,</v>

207
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 1>but that's definitely one.</v>

208
00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Polygamous societies are way more violent,</v>

209
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 1>not a little bit more violent,</v>

210
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 1>way more violent.</v>

211
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:28.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

212
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 1>so that's part of the purpose.</v>

213
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>There's a variety of purposes.</v>

214
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>You want people to have longterm stable partners because that's probably better</v>

215
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>for men and women in general.</v>

216
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.353
<v Speaker 1>Now the,</v>

217
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

218
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.211
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

219
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:38.981
<v Speaker 1>that would be good if,</v>

220
00:08:38.981 --> 00:08:39.341
<v Speaker 1>if it,</v>

221
00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:41.280
<v Speaker 1>if it can be managed in how,</v>

222
00:08:41.281 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 1>I think on many situations that's a luxury.</v>

223
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

224
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 1>people have hard lives,</v>

225
00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:47.150
<v Speaker 1>have had hard lives throughout history,</v>

226
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>and they've made decisions for,</v>

227
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.050
<v Speaker 1>for very basic economic reasons.</v>

228
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:51.530
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

229
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 1>if your relationship is also characterized by love,</v>

230
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

231
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

232
00:08:56.791 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 1>life is very difficult for people and has been for a very long period of time.</v>

233
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.540
<v Speaker 1>The primary reason that monogamy is enforced socially is for children as far as</v>

234
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:06.451
<v Speaker 1>I can tell,</v>

235
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 1>because of course obviously children are dependent for very long periods of time</v>

236
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 1>and we know even in western societies,</v>

237
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:15.150
<v Speaker 1>which are relatively prosperous,</v>

238
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 1>people who serve as single parents tend to plummet down the economic hierarchy</v>

239
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 1>because it's very,</v>

240
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.080
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to have a fulltime productive job and take care of children by</v>

241
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:25.914
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

242
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 1>And we also know the literature on child development indicates w beyond the</v>

243
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>shadow of the doubt,</v>

244
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 1>the two parent families are far more effective with regards to the outcome of</v>

245
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 1>children than single parent families,</v>

246
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.770
<v Speaker 1>which is an imagine many people we'd be ringing in to say not to,</v>

247
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:42.250
<v Speaker 1>not to handle,</v>

248
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:42.751
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>

249
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:46.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a literature developed on this that's developed over decades that</v>

250
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:47.820
<v Speaker 1>indicates this extraordinarily clearly.</v>

251
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:49.380
<v Speaker 1>So fatherlessness for example,</v>

252
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:52.350
<v Speaker 1>is a very potent predictor of negative outcomes among children.</v>

253
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that every person who's a single parent is doing a bad job.</v>

254
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Those are not the same claims.</v>
