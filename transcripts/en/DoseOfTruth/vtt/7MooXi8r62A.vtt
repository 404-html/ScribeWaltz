1
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.280
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

2
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.000
<v Speaker 1>let's say you go into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this in a room,</v>

3
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.970
<v Speaker 1>it's quite fun to do it just when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in a room like a room,</v>

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe your bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sit there and just sort of</v>

5
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>meditate on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>

6
00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:22.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I wanted to spend 10 minutes making</v>

7
00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:25.540
<v Speaker 1>this room better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would I have to do?</v>

8
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:27.250
<v Speaker 1>And you have to ask yourself that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:29.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not a command.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like our genuine question and</v>

10
00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>things will pop out in the room that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

11
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>you like there's a stack of papers over</v>
<v Speaker 1>there that's kind of bugging you and you</v>

12
00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>know that maybe little order there would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a good thing and you know,</v>

13
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:40.990
<v Speaker 1>you haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some rubbish behind your</v>

14
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 1>computer monitor that you haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>attended to for like six months and the</v>

15
00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:47.920
<v Speaker 1>room would be slightly better if it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little less dusty and the cables</v>

16
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:49.480
<v Speaker 1>weren't all tangled up the same way.</v>

17
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.280
<v Speaker 1>And like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you allow yourself just to consider</v>

18
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 1>the expanse in which you exist at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

19
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.840
<v Speaker 1>there'll be all sorts of things that'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop out in it that you could just fix.</v>

20
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might say,</v>

21
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were coming to see me for</v>

22
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:08.860
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this easiest thing for us to do first</v>

23
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>would just be to get you to organize</v>
<v Speaker 1>your room.</v>

24
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.681
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>is that psychotherapy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

26
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you conceive the</v>

27
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:21.661
<v Speaker 1>limits of your being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say start where you can</v>

28
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:22.990
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something announces itself to you,</v>

30
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.640
<v Speaker 1>which is a strange way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

31
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>as in need of repair that you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>repair,</v>

32
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.130
<v Speaker 1>then hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it.</v>

33
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>You fix 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like that.</v>

34
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Your life will be a lot different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

35
00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I often tell people to fix the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you repeat every day because people</v>

36
00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 1>tend to think of those as trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>You get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you brush your teeth,</v>

38
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.000
<v Speaker 1>you have your breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.280
<v Speaker 1>you have your routines that you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through everyday.</v>

40
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those probably constitute 50 percent of</v>

41
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>your life and people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there Monday and I don't need to</v>

42
00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

43
00:01:58.541 --> 00:01:58.871
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

44
00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:01.360
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things you do every day,</v>

45
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 1>those are the most important things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do hands down.</v>

46
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.350
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is do the arithmetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You figure it out right away,</v>

47
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>so 100 adjustments to your broader</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of being and there's a lot less</v>

48
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.380
<v Speaker 1>rubbish and there's a lot less rubbish</v>
<v Speaker 1>around at a lot fewer traps for you to</v>

49
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:25.381
<v Speaker 1>step into and so that's in keeping with</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] idea about erasing the dis.</v>

50
00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Once you've got your mind and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions together and once you're acting</v>

51
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:34.630
<v Speaker 1>that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can extend what you're willing</v>

52
00:02:34.631 --> 00:02:39.631
<v Speaker 1>to consider yourself and start fixing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that are a part of your</v>

53
00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:40.930
<v Speaker 1>broader extent.</v>

54
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes you don't know how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

55
00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 1>so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're walking down bloor street</v>

56
00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:48.820
<v Speaker 1>and there's this guy who's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic and schizophrenia and has been</v>

57
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>on the streets for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sorta stumbled towards you and you</v>

58
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:53.770
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incoherently mutters something.</v>

59
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.480
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem and it would be good if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could fix it,</v>

60
00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>but you haven't a clue about how to fix</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

61
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>You just walk around that and go find</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you could fix because if</v>

62
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>you muck about it that not only is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely that you'll help that person,</v>

63
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>it's very likely that you'll get hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

64
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because while you're experiencing</v>

65
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>things announced themselves as in need</v>
<v Speaker 1>of repair,</v>

66
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You write that in there that should</v>

67
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>repair them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have some humility.</v>

68
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't walk up to a helicopter that</v>

69
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>isn't working and just start tinkering</v>
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>

70
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>You have to stay within your domain of</v>
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

71
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>But most of the time if people look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives,</v>

72
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting thing to do.</v>

73
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I liked the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the idea of the room because you</v>

74
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:42.840
<v Speaker 1>can do that at the drop of a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

75
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 1>we go back to where you live and sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and think,</v>

76
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make this place better for</v>

77
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should I do it they have to ask and</v>

78
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>things will just pop up like mad and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's partly because your mind is a very</v>

79
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you give it a name,</v>

80
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>a genuine aim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll reconfigure the world and keeping</v>

81
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>with that aim that that's actually how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see to begin with.</v>

82
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>And so if you set it a task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have to be genuine</v>

83
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:11.080
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you have to bring your</v>

84
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and emotions together and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get them into your body so</v>

85
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>you're acting consistently.</v>

86
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>You have to be genuine about the aim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you aim the world will</v>

87
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.880
<v Speaker 1>reconfigure itself around that aim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very strange and,</v>

88
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:26.400
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

89
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>it's technically true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

90
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>the best example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have all seen this video where you</v>

91
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>watch the basketballs being tossed back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and forth between members of the white</v>

92
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>team versus the black team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while you're doing that,</v>

93
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>a gorilla walks up into the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video and you don't see it.</v>

94
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you thought about that experiment for</v>

95
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>about five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be about the right amount of</v>

96
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>time to spend thinking about it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it shows you is that you see what</v>

97
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>you aim at and that man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can get one thing through your</v>

98
00:04:57.341 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 1>head and as a consequence of even being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in university,</v>

99
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>that would be a good one.</v>

100
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>You see what you a map and so because</v>
<v Speaker 1>one</v>

101
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>inference you might draw from that is be</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful what you aim at.</v>

102
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Write it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you aim at determines the way the</v>

103
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>world manifests itself to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if the world is manifesting</v>

104
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:21.790
<v Speaker 1>itself in a very negative way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing to ask is,</v>

105
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>are you aiming at the right thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

106
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm not trying to reduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's problems to an improper aim.</v>

107
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>People get cut off at the knees for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of reasons.</v>

108
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>You know they get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have accidents.</v>

109
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a random element to being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure,</v>

110
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>but and so you don't want to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

111
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Even that particular phrase too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to bind it with the fact that</v>

112
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.240
<v Speaker 1>random things do happen to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still a great thing to ask.</v>

113
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so rogers was a phenomenologist and he</v>

114
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:50.284
<v Speaker 1>was interested in.</v>

115
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.650
<v Speaker 1>He didn't start his philosophy from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of subject versus object or</v>

116
00:05:56.561 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>from the idea of psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of inside you,</v>

117
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>your mind with its layers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how we looked at it and so</v>

118
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.130
<v Speaker 1>let's go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

119
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll introduce you to rogers I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll talk about it more next</v>

120
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start though with something</v>

121
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>that I learned from him that I think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was of crucial importance and so we'll</v>

122
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>set the stage for the further discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this and I'm going to read it to</v>

123
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to</v>

124
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>be in contact and to receive</v>
<v Speaker 1>communications.</v>

125
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 1>We may say that the greater the</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

126
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>the communicated congruence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

127
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>awareness and behavior on the part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>one individual,</v>

128
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 1>the more the ensuing relationship will</v>
<v Speaker 1>involve a tendency towards reciprocal</v>

129
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>communication with the same qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually accurate understanding of the</v>

130
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>communication's improved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological adjustment and functioning</v>

131
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 1>in both parties and mutual satisfaction.</v>

132
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>In the relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a mouthful.</v>

133
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.130
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to</v>

134
00:06:58.131 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 1>be in contact and to receive</v>
<v Speaker 1>communications.</v>

135
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're having a conversation.</v>

136
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

137
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 1>That's different than how people</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally communicate because usually</v>

138
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 1>when they communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing something like,</v>

139
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have a conversation and</v>

140
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you why I'm right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all win.</v>

141
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 1>If you agree or maybe you're having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation where I don't know what</v>

142
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're trying to impress the</v>

143
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>person you're talking to so you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to them at all.</v>

144
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 1>You're just thinking about what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna say next.</v>

145
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's not this.</v>

146
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have something to tell me and</v>

147
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to listen on the off chance</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll tell me something that would</v>

148
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:44.090
<v Speaker 1>really be useful for me to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you could take about it as an as</v>

149
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>an extension of the Piagetian.</v>

150
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Piaget talks about the fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamentally important element of</v>

151
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 1>knowledge being to describe how</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is sought,</v>

152
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 1>the process by which knowledge is</v>
<v Speaker 1>generated.</v>

153
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you agree with me and I find that</v>

154
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:02.540
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know nothing more than I knew before.</v>

155
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 1>I just know what I knew before and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy about that because it didn't</v>

156
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>get challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm no smarter than I was before,</v>

157
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.480
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you're different than me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so while I'm listening to you,</v>

158
00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 1>you'll tell me something I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like.</v>

159
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's something I find contemptible</v>
<v Speaker 1>or difficult,</v>

160
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:19.730
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll find you'll tell me</v>

161
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 1>something I don't know and then I won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be quite as stupid and then maybe I</v>

162
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>won't run painfully into quite as many</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

163
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really useful thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

164
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you live with someone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to make longterm piece</v>

165
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>with them as they are not the same as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and they're away.</v>

166
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.510
<v Speaker 1>They look at the world and the facts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they pull out of the world aren't</v>

167
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:43.511
<v Speaker 1>the same as your facts and even though</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be overwhelmed with the</v>

168
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 1>proclivity to demonstrate that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

169
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 1>it is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two brains are better than one,</v>

170
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.730
<v Speaker 1>and so maybe nine of the 10 things they</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you are dispensable or maybe even</v>

171
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>49 out of 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one thing all you need to get out of</v>

172
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>the damn conversation is one thing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

173
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a good psychotherapeutic session</v>

174
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>is that the whole conversation is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all you're doing is trying to</v>

175
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:17.610
<v Speaker 1>express the truth of the situation as</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly as possible.</v>

176
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.760
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now rogers' proposition,</v>

177
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you why he derived it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that if you have a conversation like</v>

178
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 1>that with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will make both of you better.</v>

179
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.610
<v Speaker 1>It'll make both of you is</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically healthier.</v>

180
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.790
<v Speaker 1>So there's an implicit presupposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the exchange of truth is curative.</v>

181
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very cool idea.</v>

182
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very deep idea.</v>

183
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the most profound idea.</v>

184
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.210
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea upon western civil upon</v>

185
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:54.840
<v Speaker 1>which Western civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although not only Western civilization,</v>

186
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:58.680
<v Speaker 1>is actually predicated the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth produces health.</v>

187
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.080
<v Speaker 1>But for Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the entire purpose of the</v>

188
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 1>psycho therapeutic alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come to see me because you want to</v>

189
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:08.220
<v Speaker 1>be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what that means</v>

190
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 1>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither do I.</v>

191
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 1>we're going to figure that out together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you come and you say,</v>

192
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are not acceptable to me and</v>

193
00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:17.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something I could do about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

194
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:20.400
<v Speaker 1>So that's the minimal precondition to</v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in therapy.</v>

195
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to talk about it</v>

196
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:25.230
<v Speaker 1>truthfully and you want it to be better.</v>

197
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Without that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the therapeutic relationship does not</v>

198
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 1>get off the ground and so then you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>

199
00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:33.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what relationships are therapeutic and</v>

200
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.520
<v Speaker 1>answered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be if you have a real</v>

201
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's therapeutic.</v>

202
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.260
<v Speaker 1>If it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have is not a relationship.</v>

203
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.660
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a slave,</v>

204
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.780
<v Speaker 1>they're a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're both butting heads with</v>

205
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:48.180
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a primate dominance hierarchy</v>

206
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:49.560
<v Speaker 1>dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

207
00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two cats in a barrel or two people with</v>

208
00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>their hands around each other's throats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you have is not a relationship.</v>
