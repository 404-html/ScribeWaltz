1
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm really curious about your views about,</v>

2
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.291
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>what postmodernism is.</v>

6
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I know you've,</v>

8
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you've identified it with the,</v>

9
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>with the general tricksters,</v>

10
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Derrida and Lakota and Sukkot and from coal in particular you've talked about,</v>

11
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like to know what you think about postmodernism and also why you think</v>

12
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>it's been so attractive to people.</v>

13
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

14
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 2>my explanation is that there is no authentic 1960s point of view in any of the</v>

15
00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:36.580
<v Speaker 2>elite universities.</v>

16
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

17
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.750
<v Speaker 2>But rather,</v>

18
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.330
<v Speaker 2>the most liberated minds of my generation were 1960 did not go onto graduate</v>

19
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:43.871
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

20
00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:45.190
<v Speaker 2>I witnessed this with my own eyes.</v>

21
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 2>I saw genuine Marxist.</v>

22
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.411
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

23
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:48.191
<v Speaker 2>At my college,</v>

24
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:51.130
<v Speaker 2>which was the State University of New York at Binghamton,</v>

25
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.290
<v Speaker 2>upstate New York Harbor College,</v>

26
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 2>which had a huge cohort of very radical downstate New York Jews.</v>

27
00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.711
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

28
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Who in fact the Harper would,</v>

29
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Speaker 2>we used to be called Berkeley East.</v>

30
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.750
<v Speaker 2>So I saw genuine,</v>

31
00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:06.820
<v Speaker 2>passionate marks this with my own eyes.</v>

32
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 2>They were not word choppers and they were not snide postmodernists right.</v>

33
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.400
<v Speaker 2>They were in your face aggressive.</v>

34
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 2>They use the language of the people.</v>

35
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 2>They had a populist and energy.</v>

36
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

37
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.610
<v Speaker 2>They dressed working class.</v>

38
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 2>They were non materialistic.</v>

39
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:23.261
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

40
00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 2>these are people who lived by their own convictions.</v>

41
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.570
<v Speaker 2>They were against the graduate school.</v>

42
00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 2>So when I,</v>

43
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.123
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

44
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.103
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

45
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.870
<v Speaker 2>went on to graduate school and it became known that I was going to go to Yale,</v>

46
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I was confronted by a leader of the radicals on campus.</v>

47
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm in broad daylight in front of everyone who denounced me for is the new Grad</v>

48
00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 2>school is not where it's happening.</v>

49
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:45.491
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

50
00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 2>you don't do that.</v>

51
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.160
<v Speaker 2>If you have to go to graduate school,</v>

52
00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 2>you should go to buffalo.</v>

53
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

54
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I had applied to these students as SUNY buffalo because the great leftest</v>

55
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 2>critic,</v>

56
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Leslie Fiedler was there who had a huge impact on me.</v>

57
00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:57.041
<v Speaker 2>He's part,</v>

58
00:01:57.041 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 2>he created,</v>

59
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 2>created identity politics,</v>

60
00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:01.180
<v Speaker 2>but without it's present distortions,</v>

61
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.910
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

62
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

63
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.020
<v Speaker 2>and Norman Holland,</v>

64
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.450
<v Speaker 2>the psychoanalytic critic was there.</v>

65
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I would have a very happy to have gone on to Buffalo,</v>

66
00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 2>but I needed the library Yale.</v>

67
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:08.501
<v Speaker 2>So I continued on to,</v>

68
00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:09.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

69
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.641
<v Speaker 2>the word,</v>

70
00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 2>no radicals in the,</v>

71
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.420
<v Speaker 2>in the graduate schools,</v>

72
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:13.900
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

73
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.420
<v Speaker 2>From 1968 to 72 when I was there.</v>

74
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Only one radical Todd Gitlin.</v>

75
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

76
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Went on to have a career success.</v>

77
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

78
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

79
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.720
<v Speaker 2>the actual radicals in the 1960s either when off dropped out of college and went</v>

80
00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 2>off to create communes or they were taking acid and destroyed their brains.</v>

81
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Now I have also written about that the destruction of the,</v>

82
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.400
<v Speaker 2>of the mines.</v>

83
00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

84
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Alpha,</v>

85
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 2>the most talented members of my generation through Lsd,</v>

86
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 2>it was going on all around me,</v>

87
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.600
<v Speaker 2>right towards what's happened is the actual legacy of the 60s got truncated.</v>

88
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 2>The idea that these poststructuralism postmodernists are heirs of the 1960</v>

89
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:54.820
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] revolution is an absolute crock.</v>

90
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

91
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 2>What they represent as Fuko shows,</v>

92
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 2>shows Foucault said,</v>

93
00:02:58.871 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

94
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.290
<v Speaker 2>The biggest influence on his thinking was Samuel Beckett's waiting for Godot.</v>

95
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.661
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

96
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Which wasn't post World War Two play written in Paris.</v>

97
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 2>That was about the disillusionment and nihilism experienced.</v>

98
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 2>After Hitler went through occupied France and all of Europe was in ruins.</v>

99
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.010
<v Speaker 2>It had nothing to do.</v>

100
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 2>What's in when you were going to go has nothing to do with the authentic legacy</v>

101
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 2>of the 1960s which was about genuine multiculturalism,</v>

102
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 2>a movement toward India,</v>

103
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.780
<v Speaker 2>toward Hinduism.</v>

104
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I a transformation of consciousness through psychedelics,</v>

105
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 2>which I did not take,</v>

106
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 2>but which identify with totally through the music,</v>

107
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:37.170
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

108
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

109
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 2>It was a turn toward the body.</v>

110
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.260
<v Speaker 2>It was a turn toward sensory experience.</v>

111
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

112
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not this,</v>

113
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 2>this word shopping thing and it's like cynical removal from actual experience.</v>

114
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

115
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 2>That French import.</v>

116
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:49.961
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Came in.</v>

118
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.921
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

119
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:51.121
<v Speaker 2>It should,</v>

120
00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:52.070
<v Speaker 2>the graduate schools,</v>

121
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 2>it did not affect any genuine 1960s person,</v>

122
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.700
<v Speaker 2>the real 19 six,</v>

123
00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 2>his revolution was about young.</v>

124
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 2>It was about a way of seeing the cosmos in mythological terms.</v>

125
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

126
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.790
<v Speaker 2>And the union contribution went on into the new age movement of the 1970s.</v>

127
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Aside from the universities.</v>

128
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 2>So who took over the universities were these careerists I saw them with my own</v>

129
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.561
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>

130
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 2>I saw what happened.</v>

131
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 2>I saw I was at Yale when dairy dye was being shipped over and to,</v>

132
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:23.021
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

133
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 2>to address the,</v>

134
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:24.431
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

135
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:24.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.891
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

137
00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:27.660
<v Speaker 2>the students or Grad students and the faculty and I,</v>

138
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 2>and I said to a fellow student after hearing one of these guys speak,</v>

139
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.750
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't dairy died,</v>

140
00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:33.401
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

141
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't another one of the theorists.</v>

142
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

143
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 2>they are like high priests murmuring to each other.</v>

144
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

145
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.691
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

146
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 2>this was an elitist form from the start.</v>

147
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

148
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 2>It was not progressive.</v>

149
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 2>It was knocked revolutionary.</v>

150
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 2>It was reactionary.</v>

151
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 2>It was a desperate attempt to hold on to what had happened before the 1960s</v>

152
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 2>sensory revolution.</v>

153
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

154
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

155
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 2>this postmodernist thing.</v>

156
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

157
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.960
<v Speaker 2>This trashing,</v>

158
00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.300
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

159
00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Of,</v>

160
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 2>of the text.</v>

161
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 2>This is this encouragement.</v>

162
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

163
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Have I superior and destructive attitude toward the work of art we're going</v>

164
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:08.381
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

165
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

166
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Primly with red pen in hand.</v>

167
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Finding all the evidence of sexism.</v>

168
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.340
<v Speaker 2>Check racism,</v>

169
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 2>check homophobia.</v>

170
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Check.</v>

171
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.870
<v Speaker 2>That is not the impact.</v>

172
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Thick emotional.</v>

173
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

174
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Sensory based.</v>

175
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

176
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 2>A revolution of the 1960s.</v>

177
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:23.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

178
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 2>I am sick and tired of these people claiming any kind of mantle from the 1960s</v>

179
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 2>they're frauds.</v>

180
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 2>These people are,</v>

181
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.950
<v Speaker 2>what happened in the 1970s was a collapse of the job market in academe.</v>

182
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

183
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden jobs were scarce and this thing was there.</v>

184
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 2>The new and improved and shiny thing.</v>

185
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

186
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 2>To be a theorist,</v>

187
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 2>people seized on it.</v>

188
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

189
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 2>It was institutionalized.</v>

190
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

191
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.991
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

192
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 2>it's an enormous betrayal of the 1960 [inaudible].</v>
