Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Joe, welcome to the show. Tim. Thank you so much buddy. Then I'm so excited to finally have you here. So thanks for flying out. Of course. My pleasure. Here we are in Tay Hos and where to begin. I mean we've had the opportunity to get to know each other over the last while, which has been super fun, fed some unique peak experiences, which I'll leave nebulous just so everyone's really uncomfortable with that statement. And, and uh, where to begin? We were talking about this, I was having excessive numbers of Macchiatos earlier while I was watching you eat your French toast. And uh, I think the question to start with is what is your first memory of causing trouble or getting into trouble?

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       Well, um, let's see. To go back, I think it would probably be around second grade has a second grade. Well, you have to understand, when I was young, I was really into art, into drawing and around the second grade, the teenage mutant Ninja turtles came out, right. And like big deal, big deal. I was totally hooked on Tele. Michelangelo, Raphael, everybody like I was, I was in it. And so I started drawing them and I just had such a good time drying. Then I would show them to my classmates. I remember the second grade and my classmates started to want to buy them from me. And so I would mount them on this like really special poster board. And I'd come into class and like I would be selling these for the total of $1. If you want to get a big one, I would sell you the bigger ones for $2.

Speaker 2:          00:01:39       And so I was having a ball. I'm doing what I loved, making drawings, the classmates and like make an extra, you know, allowance every week. A dollar is a lot of money when you're in second grade, we deal, it's a big deal. And so, uh, I at one point that my teacher pulls me aside and she says, I need to talk to you. And she begins to explain to me that students were so interested in these drawings that they were asking their parents for extra lunch money and their parents were like, what are you next to lunch money for? And they traced it back to me. And the, the teacher shut me down. Like you can't be doing this.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       All right. So already signs of looming misbehavior.

Speaker 2:          00:02:19       Uh, yeah. And, and the signs of, of, uh, you know, spotting an opportunity and doing something about entrepreneurship. Yeah. Yeah. It was also, you know, you can say my first brush with regulation.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       Yeah. First brush that, that, that may or may not come in handy later, maybe. And where were you at the time? Just the places geographically. Where did you grow up?

Speaker 2:          00:02:43       Uh, my parents are from New York. Uh, Wa my grandfather's heritage back in Italy and Ireland, grandfathers in Brooklyn, parents grew up in long island, moved to Georgia right before they had me. So I grew up in the deep south and I was in, you know, the town of Warrensville, which is next to Snellville, which is near Lilburn, which is not far from Norcross. We just kind of close to Atlanta. So if you went, you know, an hour in one direction, you'd, you'd be in, you know, farm fields and you know, horse ranches and um, it'd be, uh, you know, it was, it was, it was a south in every kind of way.

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       So you're selling these drawings now, where did that impulse come from? And I ask, because I've had the chance to spend some time with your dad. Awesome guy. It's true. We were together at a date with destiny event and you had the very good idea of basically creating animal house by renting a house together on Joe Bnb, otherwise known as Airbnb. And Your Dad's awesome. A also seems to be very entrepreneurial. So that's why I'm asking. I'm not implying it came straight from your dad, but, uh, could you maybe talk about that and then also what were, what were some defining characteristics of your childhood?

Speaker 2:          00:04:11       Well, certainly in both of my parents and quitting. My Dad were very entrepreneurial. They both worked for themselves growing up. So I had this, um, you know, environment where I saw my parents forging their own path, sort of their success was fully dependent on how hard they worked and how ambitious they were in their, their careers of what they were doing. And my dad certainly was entrepreneurial, you know, he was always coming home with something on the weekend saying, I've got this new product idea, I've got this new service I found and, and um, you know, or basement was full of these different attempts at different things. Um, and so there was this, this spirit of trying things out by all means in our household.

Speaker 1:          00:04:51       What were some of the things that you're done trying?

Speaker 2:          00:04:54       Um, I don't know. Some early Internet things and the mid nineties, as the Internet started to come out, um, you know, I, I don't actually remember

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       what were some of the things that caught, what did he, what did he end up doing?

Speaker 2:          00:05:08       Um, well, he ended up working with my mom and, uh, they both were in the health food industry. So when you go into whole foods and you see enough vitamins and supplements in the vitamin aisle, they were the representative between the manufacturer of those products and getting into the shelf of those stores. What was interesting was to tag along with with them on business trips where they'd drive around the south from South Carolina to Tennessee to Alabama and getting to see how they interacted with these store owners because it wasn't just whole foods, it was the also the mom and pop vitamins tours as well. Right. Independence, independence. And so, um, it was really fascinating watching them interact with the store owners and it's just seeing how far they would go to serve people. You know, I remember one time specifically we're in Tennessee and it was really late at night.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Uh, all the other store employees have gone home. It's my dad and myself and the store manager and we're sitting there stocking shelves were like, this is Tennessee. Yeah, we're doing somebody else's job. But for my dad, it was just about creating a connection with, with the store owner and really I guess going above and beyond what was required of you. And so I really took away from that, those, you know, observations of watching how your parents treat people. Um, you know, there's just, it was really nice to see and it definitely planted a seed in me of like, you know, going out of your way for those that you're serving your customers.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       Was it your, was it your dad's idea to bring you along? Did you ask to be brought along or something else? I don't know. Yeah. I remember the, the very first morning in the House that we rented Florida, we had heard of date with destiny being nicknamed by some people date with death because the schedule is so intense, right? I 1216 God knows how many hours it's up to, up to the powers that be the big man and so on. And it can be very hard to get, food can be very hard to get a break. And even if you do get a break, maybe there's a line of 300 people from 60 countries waiting to get a chicken wrap so you're not gonna get your chicken wrap it. So we had stocked up with bars and mixed nuts and yogurt and jerky and everything imaginable and it was scattered all over the place and got up in the morning and the entire collection of food had been rearranged, like a point of sale display.

Speaker 1:          00:07:45       It was in perfect order. It was ready for a storefront. And I was just like, did you do that to my two of my friend Avi? And he's like, no, I definitely didn't do that. I, and then I knew Emilia hadn't done it. I was like, who did? I was like, oh. Then Joe Sr like, you'd be like some eggs. I'm happy. I'm making some eggs. Would do like some side. I was like, wow. Yeah. So it makes sense. It makes sense. That attention to detail. You got a little taste of, oh, it was great. I was thrilled. Uh, what else did you, what else did you experience in childhood that, that stuck with you? And I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll lead with one thing that I originally asked you all about and when we initially spent time together also related to Tony Robbins, Tony's the glue that holds us together, which I didn't expect to really be verbalizing that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       It seems at least up to this point that he's been a, a, a, a consistent character in the background or in the foreground. He's a big dude, hard to mess. But we began talking about tennis because I had just taken my first ever tennis lessons, uh, with Jim Lair and Lorenzo Beltrami, an incredible coach down to Florida. But you were wearing a, uh, Nicole Terry or bold Cherry Academy shirt and I knew just enough having read the open autobiography by Andre Agassi to recognize the name. So I asked you about it. Uh, so it seems like tennis was certain, certainly something that was also, oh my God, what are the families? So maybe you could talk to them. Yeah. You had a

Speaker 2:          00:09:23       tennis family, you could say. I think that's what they call that, a time where every member of the family plays tennis. We did coaching together, we played in Alta and Usta together. We did and competitions together. And it was a truly a family sport growing up. Um, and so tennis was a huge part of my life as a kid amongst a lot of other sports. I think that's the things that stood out to me of, of childhood and things that, one of things I'm really grateful for us is that whatever my interest, where my, my parents would support it. Um, and I think they learned this lesson the hard way. Um, how so they, they got me into a violin when I was really young when I was like about four or five years old, which you were interested or not interested in it, right? I mean, no, and so I was taking violin lessons and there's a recital that I, I don't remember how old I was, maybe six.

Speaker 2:          00:10:21       And I'm at this recital. It's in Savannah, Georgia. I'm sorry, Augusta, Georgia. And I'm definitely out of my depths here. Like all the kids are bigger than me. Um, I'm not being able to keep up with everyone else's plane and apparently I sat down on the front of the stage and just put my violin down and there's my parents in the back, probably the terrified look in their face. And after that experience they switch their perspective and said we're going to support whatever his intrinsic interests are. Right? And so I was really grateful for that. You know, throughout my, my childhood sports, music and art are the three things that, uh, anytime I throw my weight behind something they were right there to support me. Whether it was, uh, you know, practice law, a sports practice or sports equipment or um, musical lessons or art supplies, whatever the thing was, they were there to support me in it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:18       What if not violin? Where did you gravitate towards me in music is in the violin lessons. I do remember this, this part I was so eager to finish the vine lessons, violin lessons that I could go bang on the piano that was in the same music room. And sure enough, I started taking piano lessons and I've, I've played ever since. Cool. So you still play? I do, yeah. I've got a piano at home and it's like one of those things, you know, it's the first thing I do when I get home at the end of the day is I just go jam on the piano. I either play some of my favorite music from felonious monk, Dave Brubeck or I just make stuff up and kind of riff.

Speaker 1:          00:11:57       What other entrepreneurial experiences do you recall from elementary school or high school after you got the kibosh thrown on the teenage mutant Ninja Turtles?

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       That certainly wasn't the end. You know, I, I distinctly remember a whole bunch of things from part of the common stuff, right? Like I started a long line business in my neighborhood, so I put her on flyers on people's doors and my neighborhood and offered 1 million car washing. And so, you know, I'd Go Wah Milan for 20 bucks. Um, no, that was quick money in my pocket as a, as a kid. Um, kind of getting into high school, there was a one moment where senior year came around and the senior year tee shirt that did, did my high school, it was, it was pretty uninspiring, let's just call it that. And I thought, you know, I bet I could do something better than that at this point. I just got my first Mac, my first apple computer and it had Photoshop on it and illustrator and graphic software that you needed to, to make you know, visuals. And so, um, that's when it was actually warm introductions to Photoshop was I just redesigned the t shirt and I didn't have any money really other than the lawn lane money that was coming in. And um, I figured out how to get these tee shirts made. I went to a local printer, um, figure out how to do all the, transfer the files to them and suddenly I'm sitting on about 300 tee shirts and I realize I got to go sell these things.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       Okay, got it. So you took it upon yourself to redesign the, was it the highschool tee shirt?

Speaker 2:          00:13:39       Yeah, like this, the senior, the senior at like the senior teacher,

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       the senior tee shirt, and then went out and now you have a bunch of inventory.

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       I got a bunch of inventory and I gotta go sell him. Um, which will come up again later in another story. Um, but yeah, it was, it was, it was fun. And actually I remember, uh, I did better than break even on those and people were really happy to have a, a really memorable what the shirt, you know, it was a riff on the, the tide logo. The tide detergent. Sure. And so instead of Saint Titus had seniors class of 2000 Brookwood high school and um, it didn't really, well

Speaker 1:          00:14:14       see, so you didn't, you didn't bet the farm and lose the farm yet, at least broke even.

Speaker 2:          00:14:20       Yeah. Yeah, it was, it was, it was fun to, to learn, you know, how did you, some of the, the graphics programs like Photoshop and then also figure out like how do you turn that into something, right. How does it leave your screening, become some of the physical, and so it was a great lesson. If anything.

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       Where did you think, now this was senior year in high school? Yeah. What did you think you were going to do when you grew up per se at that point?

Speaker 2:          00:14:41       Well, or what did you want to do? So every year from elementary, middle and high school, the art teacher would tell you need to take more art classes because it was a talent that I had that stood out and then they recognize it and were telling me about it. And so you're, every year I would invest more into art classes and I, at one point I was driving downtown to the land of College of art and weekends to take figure drawing classes. Sometimes on weeknights I drive down for painting classes and, and then something really incredible happened. I applied for this program called the governor's honors program in high school where they take students from around the state of Georgia across all disciplines, math and science and languages and art. And they pick about 30 students or the state for each discipline. And then if you get in, you go to a college campus for the summer.

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       And he actually said he college level coursework in whatever the discipline is. So I went for art and had an incredible time here. It was surrounded by some of the other, you know, the best artists in the state of Georgia and other high school students. And I had teachers who were co collegiate level, uh, challenging us the same way they would a college student. And I freaking loved it. And there was one woman in particular, her name was Donna and she was like one of those people in life that you have along your journey who helped you. It helps, it helps you see something else about yourself that maybe you don't quite realize yet. And so she sat me down one day during this program and really kind of laid out what it might look like if I pursued art after, after high school. And she was one of the first persons that got me really excited about, she made it realistic for me to even think about it.

Speaker 2:          00:16:26       Was that even a practical idea? Right. And she's like, there's one school you have to go to. It's the Rhode Island School of design. And I'm like the what, where's that and so something to Bahamas? Yeah. She put a [inaudible] on the map for me and I was during that, that program during that, that summer, um, I really dove into painting. I did this painting that was about eight feet by four feet wide, stretch their own canvas and really like threw myself and understand materials and paint better than ever ever before. And we had the show at the end of the program so you know everyone in art, the discipline got to have like a gallery show and there was my painting on the main wall when you walked in and it was really like, it was a moment for me to realize that a people are appreciated.

Speaker 2:          00:17:17       The images that I made and my art and seconds, I loved it. Like I really felt challenged. I felt creative. It was, it was allowing me to fulfill all these, these desires that I had to, to create things. How much of that was the environment versus the medium do you think? I think the, probably the environmental a bit more cause the medium could have been anything. Right. I mean, we did wreck wreck, who, pottery and firing. We figure drawing and painting. We were exposed to all kinds of different mediums and materials. I think the environment is what I fell in love with the being challenged, challenge being surrounded by the creatives. And um, and really that's what triggered me to say, Huh, this Rhode Island School of design thing. So the next summer I did their high school program and got to spend six weeks on campus basically as like a, you really act like a freshmen, right?

Speaker 2:          00:18:08       They give you again, college level courses and afters do at Risley. I fell in love with the campus, fell in love with the people and you know, as it, as a junior in high school, I'm like, I gotta go here. This is, this is where I feel challenged. So then what happens? Well, so before I leave, um, high school, there's a, there's another story about, um, entrepreneurial Joe. Um, so I haven't told the story in a while. Uh, but so when I got to high school as a freshman, the senior class right before me had pulled off as amazing senior prank. So at our high school, the mascot was a bronco horse. This was the Brookwood Broncos, and they went down the street to this, uh, like a country Western store where you get cowboy boots and cowboy hats. It's called horse town east. And on the top of their sign, which was pretty tall, it was a couple of store, a couple of stories tall, was this giant full sized plastic horse.

Speaker 2:          00:19:15       And somehow the senior class figured out how to get the horse down from the sign and then they'd put it on top of our school. And so the last day of class, everyone came in, there's a giant full sized plastic horse on top of Brookwood. And so when I showed up as a freshmen, everybody was talking about it. I, everyone's like, yeah. Did you hear what the senior class did last year? But for the graduated, yeah, and it, I just started to think to myself, I can, I want to outdo that. I've got four years to think of something. I'll keep it. Surely I can come up with something better than the horse on top of the school. So I set myself a challenge, uh, frank, um, by senior year. So the years go by, it's not senior year. Um, and we have about four months ago and I still haven't thought of anything.

Speaker 2:          00:20:07       And the clock's ticking. It's now three months ago. I still haven't thought of anything. It's now two months to go and I uh, I get on a Google, I search, you know, high school senior pranks just to see like what else is out there because I'm still committed to figure something out. And so I keep coming across the same stuff. You've got a super guru, the locks, the doors, you've got Philip Cups with water and the gym and put them all next to each other. They like knock over and then you've got three pigs out in to the school and label them one to four so everyone thinks there's the third pig pigment around. So you know, it was like the repetition of how many sites were covering these banks is like these are not original. And that was one of my cards here. Like this needs to be something original.

Speaker 2:          00:20:54       I'm not going to just like copy another prank. And so we're now like three weeks until graduation. Don't have any prank. I haven't figured it out yet. And my sister was a cheerleader and so she'd have this cheerleading practice after school and normally I'd have to hang around and take her home. And so, um, outside after school one day, and she's nowhere to be found, this is before cell phones. And the way that you track somebody down at that time was to, um, they'd make some announcement over the intercom system. They like called her names. So I go into the front office and by the way, I went to high school in Georgia. That was one of the largest, we had over 4,000 people in a high school, right. So this is one of the biggest high schools in the state. And I thought that to access the inner calm would be some, you go in some room, there'd be some big system.

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       It'd be super complicated. So I'm in the front office and I'm looking at the secretary and I go, Hey, I'm just trying to find my sister, Kim, can you, can you Pedro over the Intercom and the start? He goes, oh, sure. Just a minute. She picked, she picks up the phone and she hits lb zero zero on the dial pad and then she talks into the phone, Hey Kim, Kim Gebbia, your brother's here, please come to the front of the building and everything she said into the phone came out over the intercom system and I'm watching this and I'm going, it's that easy to get into the intercom system of the largest high school in the state of Georgia. All you have to do is have access to the phone line and hit pound zero zero. I'm like, oh my God. It was this big Aha moment. As I'm watching this unfold in front of me and I go, all I have to do is get one of those splitter jacks, plug it into the same phone line, and then I can run a cord of another phone somewhere else in the closet or something.

Speaker 2:          00:22:46       And then I could call in and have access to the whole intercom system. So for a week I'm toiling on this. I'm like, how am I going to route a phone cord without anybody noticing it? And then finally it dawns on me just get a cordless phone. You can be anywhere in the school and have access to the inner call. So this point I recruit one of my buddies, Mark Eisenhower, who looking back, probably wasn't the best accomplished for this position because he played on the basketball team, was about six foot four with bright blonde hair, right? Not In conspicuous conspicuous at all. Um, and so we go, we go to the school that weekend and we have this grand plan that um, we'll, we'll maybe trick one of the janitors until letting us into the main office. And when he leaves somehow will like plug in this cordless phone in school.

Speaker 2:          00:23:41       Um, it, it definitely was not a well thought out plan at this point, but, um, we didn't have a lot of times, so we hit, we just went for it. And so we went to the school, it was on a Sunday afternoon, I think the janitor saw right through us do not let us in the office. And so we left a bit empty handed, but we weren't given up. This was too good. So I employed another friend, her name is Chelsea Hughes. And so the three of us came up with a better plan that we'd go up on a week, uh, on a, on a, on a weekend. And there was a community school office that we knew would be open on weekends and that office connected like he's inner chambers to the main office. And if we could just get into that one we thought was you could go through the sequence of other doors to get into the main office.

Speaker 2:          00:24:30       And so Chelsea went up and tried to figure out where that principal was that that um, community school director. And so she, she identified him on the far side of campus. She signaled to mark, mark signaled to me, and I'm outside in like a black Hoodie with my backpack full of the phone, a flashlight. And mark gave me the signal following Mr. Robot. Totally. I go running in through the lobby of the school right into this community director's office and then it's pitch black and I'm, I'm like going, going through all the doors. It's like chamber by Chamber until you get to the main office, the front desk I'm getting, I'm there and I moved the desk to the side and there's this giant jumble of chords underneath it. I'm trying to figure out which one, what the hell is the phone line. And then I trace it back to the wall.

Speaker 2:          00:25:19       I pull up the splitter piece, I put it in, and then I plug in the cordless phone and the phone from the desk into the same line. And I'm trying to bury the cord base underneath the pile chords. And this point, I'm sweating, my heart is racing. I'm like, oh my God. In the darkness of this office, definitely not supposed to be there. And all of a sudden there's a tap on my shoulder. My heart jumps a torn around it. It's more like hovering over him. He goes, Joe, me, we got to go. Mr Choke is on his way. And I'm like, all right, I'm done. So we pushed the desk back. We go out the back entrance into the parking lot, we meet up with Chelsea, I pulled the cordless phone out of my bag, I turned it on and we get a dial tone.

Speaker 2:          00:26:01       We have access to the intercom. So the next question is what do you do with that access? Right. So the next day I decided that I was going to make a tape mix of different songs deploy over the intercom system and I play, I put together a mix of pink Floyd. We don't need no education and Alice Cooper's schools out for summer and I haven't got so detailed about this that I am. I had my mom help out at home. She didn't know she was helping me, but we had two phone lines in the house, went for their business, one for personal use and I would call one phone line to the other and have the tape player next to it to figure out the right volume on it, the right distance from the phone, and have my mom on the other end and telling me if it was loud enough or not.

Speaker 2:          00:26:55       She helped me calibrate the right uh, the right volume for the tape player. So the, the phone is embedded. Um, the tape makes tape, mixes is made. It's now the last day of school and I woke up that morning and I was nervous. I'm like, ah, got to do this today. All right. Prank is happening. So I go to school a little bit late on purpose. So as it works, um, I parked, I parked my car in the parking lot and in one pocket I've got the phone, the other pocket, I've got this tape player, I can't help it, like on Sony Walkman and I'm walking through the parking lot. It's just just me, there's nobody else. And then all of a sudden our school police officer shows up on his golf cart and he turns the corner and he's coming straight towards me and there's nobody else around.

Speaker 2:          00:27:50       It's just him and me and he's coming at me and I'm staring at him and I'm like, just be cool. Just be cool. He doesn't know. And like as you're getting closer to my heart's racing faster and I'm like, Oh my God, I've got this, the bolt is in my pocket of the phone and the tape player and he makes eye contact. I mean the golf cart goes by like, okay. So I walked to the front of the school and there's like this overhang area where the buses pulled up and um, there's the benches and then the, these glass doors before you go into the main lobby. And so everything's cleared out except for this one kid, he must've been like a freshman or a sophomore or something. And he's sitting there and I'm like waiting for him to leave cause I didn't want anybody to see what I was about to do and he's not going anywhere. And think to myself, I have to do this now. Like I can't wait any longer. So I just run up to him. I get right in his face and I go, look, you can't say anything about what you're about to see. And he was just totally freaked out. And he goes, oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       And so I go behind one of these, these brick columns that was holding up the, the overhang and around the column you could see into the glass doors and end where the officers were the phone basis. So I pulled the phone out, I pulled the tape player, my hands are shaking and I'm like, I'm just thinking stuff. All right, let's go time. I turned the phone on, get the dial tone, I hit pound zero, zero. My hands are shaking even more. I think this deep breath, and actually this beep comes over the whole school to signal there's an announcement and I can actually hear myself breathing through the inner calm and I'm like, all right, this right now say it playing the tape player. I set the two down next to each other and as I'm doing it, I flicked the volume all the way just to be safe cause I'm thinking of itself.

Speaker 2:          00:29:37       I don't want to come across as too soft and the volume. So I'm like, I got to throw the volume the way up. So I said to Tina next to each other and I walk into the building and that's when all hell broke loose. I opened the lobby, I go into the lobby doors and the music is blasting out of the intercom system. Schools out full. So it's like the speakers are about to explode. It's like so freaking loud. And um, when you get to school late, he had to go to like a checking line to sign in. And so I'm in the checking line. There's like two people in front of me and this is, this is the scene I'm in this like, you know, kind of high school lobby to my left are all the offices, including the one where the phone is to my right is the gymnasium, add them gymnasium.

Speaker 2:          00:30:26       Two of my buddies combusting out while this music's blasting. They're laughing so hard because they realize that it was me. The coach comes out of the gym, starts yelling at him, you get back in here. We don't know what's going on. What are you going to get back in here? I'm just sitting there with a straight face, not packing a smile. I sign in and then to get to my class, I have to walk past all these offices. Right? And so while I'm doing that, I hear what's going on. They're yelling at each other. People were sticking their head out of the office. Who's it coming from in there? No, I don't know where it's coming from there. I got the phone in their hands. You can hear all the Datacom then hitting me like numbers on the phone, trying to shut it off. They had no idea where the heck it was coming from.

Speaker 2:          00:31:07       And so as I'm walking past these sequence of offices, I catch a glimpse into the principal's secretary office and then into the principal's office, which has even a deeper layer. And I see, I catch her face and it's bright red and she's yelling at somebody. While this music's still playing it. Right? Right now we're on to pink Floyd. At this point we don't need no education and so I've just been going on, but it's like three, four minutes. Then at this point I'm walking through my classes in the very back of the campus. I'm walking through the halls, I'm totally by myself while the music's playing and every time I walked past the classroom, there's a little skinny like glass window and you can kind of get a glimpse into it. And as I walked patsy classes, I take these double books and people are like on top of their chairs and on top of their desks and people were dancing and I get to my classroom right as the tape ends.

Speaker 2:          00:32:05       And look, I thought for sure they're going to shut this off in like 20 seconds. So I didn't make a tape very long. It was like a couple minutes and I need a and a tape. It probably would have played for 20 minutes. Right. So I get there right as a tape ends, I opened the door. People are staying on top of their desks. People were dancing. The teachers at her desk with her head in her hands, like totally lost control of her class and it's like the record stops. I walk in, everybody turns and looks at me and goes, Joey was at you, and I'm like, no, I don't know what that was. And so finally the teacher gets control of the class again. We sit down and everyone's looking at me like, Oh wow, that was awesome. What was that? I'm like, I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:32:49       And so not two minutes later, there's a knock on the door and administrator walks in. She walks over to the teacher, the class goes dead silent. They whisper something to each other and then they both turn and look at me. The administrator comes by my desk. She goes, Joey, get your stuff. You're coming with me. And I'm like seeking him. Desole I'm like, oh no. She gets outside. She slams the door, we're in the hallway and she goes, you want to tell me what's happened to back there? I go, I don't know. You're talking about, she's like, we've got mark in the office. We know what happened and I'm like, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about. And she goes, you can make this hard, you can make this easy on yourself. When I was like, ah. So we walk all the way back to the front of the campus and the whole way she's berating me, chewing my head off of all the damages that I caused and all the issues that were created with the phone system.

Speaker 2:          00:33:41       And we go to the secretary's office and we walk through and I see mark there and he's got his head in his hands. And Mark is, you're very tall, very tall, very blonde, very blonde, very obvious accomplice. Yes, yes he was. He was a good buddy and a good friend. And I appreciate his help in this endeavor. And so he's, he's down like this. He's like totally crushed and he sees me and he looks at me and he goes, and I couldn't tell what he was saying. So it's just trying to mouth the words analysis of the to me. And so what are you saying? He goes, it was the janitor. So we get through the secretary office into the principal's office, Connie quarterly. Never forget her name. They slammed the door and I'm staying there with my backpack or in a green izod shirt.

Speaker 2:          00:34:30       I will never forget this. I mean my brown khaki pants and a green izod shirt with my backpack and there's Connie quarterly at her desk with their arms like this kind of huffing and puffing face is bright red. She's got the phone and the tape player and the phone cord and the phone base on her desk and around her or the 20 administrators, including the school police officer. It's the biggest school in the state of Georgia. We had on a police officer. And so they're all like this, like arms crossed, huffing and puffing, right? And I'm like, Oh fuck. Like what? Heart's racing. I'm like, what is going on here? Every one of them took a turn, it may just to yell at me about something. Connie coy starts the army. How did you get to the office? You broken energy and she's like, like really angry.

Speaker 2:          00:35:19       And I'm like, ah, like, like I'm starting to feel a little bit bad about this. Like, like I'm not sure what this is going to go. Like is this, am I going to get off on this? Or like, oh there's some consequences here. I have no idea. And so from that they lead us into this like negotiation room, which I've never seen. It was this long wooden table, but he's like leather chairs are on the whole side of principal corlies at the head of the table. Mark and I are now senior across from each other. We get administrators standing over us with their arms crossed, like we're going to make a run for it or something. And she likes charts like negotiating with us. And um, this is the part that it actually pissed me off the most is that she started to threaten our scholarships and she looked at marsh, she goes, mark, you know, I know you've got, I'm a basketball scholarship to this, the school in Georgia that you go into.

Speaker 2:          00:36:11       I hate to have to call the coach and tell him about this, this incident she gives me, cause Joey, I know you're going to that art school in Rhode Island. I hate to have to call the admissions office and tell them about this incident. And that point I was like, there's no way you're getting in the way of either of our dreams because we tapped into the high school in your home system. Like right. So she made an offer, she goes, um, we could press charges for breaking, entering and tampering and school property and some other things. Or you can do this list of things which included, um, wiping down computer screens and the library, you know, during the summertime, um, ironically setting up and taking down the sound equipment for graduation. I like if you were the chores and like manual labor basically. Um, and so mark and I, obviously we say, well, we'll do the chores and the need of labor so that we can graduate pressing charges somehow equated to not being able to graduate and get your diploma.

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       And so from there we go into the school police officers office. His name was officer Harrelson and it's a good cop. Now this guy. Yeah, right. This guy had the deepest kind of grizzly voice that you could imagine a office officer Harrolson here. Brookwood high school. So we're in the office and he calls her parents and this is, this is like probably where the worst part of the whole story. He did not know the update that we opted in to do the manual labor. He thinks that we're not graduating high school now, so he calls my mom. He goes, Miss [inaudible]. This is officer Harrelson here at Brookwood high school. Yes ma'am. I've got your, your son in custody here. Yeah. Yes. Right man, it doesn't look like he's graduating this year. Oh No. Yeah man. And he's right here. He hands me the phone and I heard this tone of voice in my, from my mom.

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       I've never heard since. I never everyone here again. She goes, you could ride home after school. I can't believe you click. I'm like Mamba League. We're going to graduate. So she thinks her son's not graduating high school. Um, I'm like, thanks officer house and it was really kind of view, um, and does the same thing at the mark and we're walking out of his office and this is the best part. He pulls us to the side and he goes, Mark Joey, I've been at the school for over 20 years and you need to know that was the best damn prank I've ever seen.

Speaker 2:          00:38:42       Officer Harrelson. So we go through graduation. Um, one little funny spent Levy does it, you know, he had your honors cords and a different club cores that you were on your neck. Mark and I were phone cords to honor the it senior prank. People were raving about it. Um, and we came back, you know, two weeks later, did you wipe computer screens in the library? And I'll never forget, we're outside on meet the same overhang, like dusting off our rags and all these buses pull up and all these bus drivers start pouring into the school passed it. So it has like some bus driver, you know, end of year celebration or something. And one of the bus drivers actually walks over to us and she goes, are you the two boys? It pulled that prank with the intercom system and mark and I looked at each other and we're like, yeah. She goes, you know, you are, you two are our lens in this county. And Morgan are like, what? Like how did they hear about it? Like all the bus drivers and the county that we moved in. So, um, it was this incredible moment of having an idea. I have this ambition to do something that was original. In this case, there was no property damage. Nobody got hurt, which is to me the essence of a great prank. And, um, that was part one of the story, part one of the story.

Speaker 3:          00:40:04       Well, all right, I'll bite. I'll fight.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       What's part two of the story? It's a part to the story. Um, I'm in college, this is about two years later and one of my roommates comes home one day and he says, Hey, have you heard of that show? It's on MTV. It's called, um, uh, high school stories, pranks in controversies. And I go, no, no. It was about, he's like, yeah, I was, I was just watching it. It's like they showed this, this, uh, some high school, they had this high school was prank. I was like, I sat up in my chair. I go, really? You tell me about that? And he goes, yeah, they film these guys who get this. They super glued the locks on the doors of this high school. And I'm like, you have to be kidding me. The oldest trick in the book [inaudible] making a show about high school pranks and they're doing a super glue in the Loc Prank.

Speaker 2:          00:40:56       I'm like, I have to get in touch with the producer. So I get online and I tracked down the producer of the show and I sent them an email that was a teaser of the story, but not the full one. And basically said, if you wanna hear the rest of it, here's my phone number. Probably about 30 minutes later, my phone rings for the 200, two area code. And when I see NYC and I get on the phone with this producer and he's like, I really intrigued by your email, are always looking for good stories. What does it, what he got? And I told them the abbreviated version of what you just heard. And he's like, oh, I love this. I'm gonna Pitch this to my executive producer. We're to get back to you. It's about three or four days later you get another phone call from a t one two hey, this is Leslie from MTV.

Speaker 2:          00:41:40       I'm the executive producer here. Really loved your story. Want to hear more about it from you. So by the end of the call, she's in love with the story and she's like, you know what we're going to do? We're going to send a crew down to Georgia. We want you to come back this summer. We're going to reenact the whole thing and included in the next season of a TV show. So that summer we got to go back to Georgia and reenact the whole thing. Now, however, this is only two years later, the same administration and principal is still there. And they did not have a lot of friction.

Speaker 1:          00:42:10       I was going to say the wounds have healed over quite yet.

Speaker 2:          00:42:13       Definitely not healed. They definitely had a grudge. Um, because if anything we just embarrass them like right. They had no idea how to turn it off. I'm like, yeah, there's no damage or anything that was really done that's permit. And so they declined reenacting a school. So ironically went to one of my rival high schools and refilm the whole thing there. And even more ironic is that the principal, the new principal there, it was a former administrator when I pulled a prank at my other school. So he was intubated, familiar what had happened at that point. He was, he could laugh about it. Um, so that summer we reenacted the whole thing. Um, Chelsea and mark and I got a couple of their friends to be extras in the background and it aired later that year. And MTV.

Speaker 1:          00:42:55       Amazing. So it seems like your brushes with mischief just seemed to reinforce your appetite for mischief of sorts in a way. Perhaps. Perhaps now when we were hanging out earlier today, I ask a question that that I often ask of friends I'm going to sit down with and it was in effect. Can you give me any cues? I don't want to hear the story, but can you give me any cues that might lead to a fun discussion and and one of them I said, I don't want to know the story because I want to hear it fresh and when we're recording and one of them was NBA time worked with or in NBA and I have no idea what this refers to, but that's a cue.

Speaker 2:          00:43:52       Tim. I think this story starts by telling you a fun fact. I seen Michael Jordan naked in person.

Speaker 1:          00:43:59       Okay, this is a good start. Now we're talking about locking room, hotel room barbecue. My job,

Speaker 2:          00:44:09       I had a high school job where I worked as a ball boy in the NBA for the Atlanta Hawks and that was my job in high school. Okay. I love basketball. I played my whole life and I was reading these, I used to read the newspaper every morning when I was growing up over breakfast, whatever. I would just consume the newspaper. And so, um, one day I'm in the sports section and there's an article about a bat being bat boys for the Atlanta Braves and being ball boys for the Atlanta Hawks. At the very end of the article it said, if you're interested in becoming one, send a letter about yourself to this address. And I'm like, oh my God. Yes. Like that would be so cool. Right? So I send a letter, but actually I sent it on the day of the deadline once it passed and I sent them the day of the deadline and I kind of forgot about it until that next summer I get a phone call and this guy introduced himself as Chris Tucker, the strength of the head strength coach of the Atlanta Hawks.

Speaker 2:          00:45:12       And he goes, yeah, we got your letter and we really liked it. We want you to come down to interview for one of our board, our ball ballboy positions. I go, this is awesome. I'll be there. So we get down to, um, at the time it was a the Omni, um, but for the head Philips arena and I'm interviewing with them, you know, tell them about my life and my love for basketball and these things and I get a call back a few days later that I got the job. So this, I'm like a freshman in high school, right? I'm like barely like 16, maybe 15. I'm 15 years old and I start working, you know, in the locker rooms of the Atlanta hawks. And actually my very first game, I'll never forget this was the hawks versus the Toronto Raptors and they threw me onto the, the visitors because the ball boys for the home team and the business.

Speaker 1:          00:46:04       Can you explain what a ballboy doesn't basketball because I'm an idiot when it comes to group sports or team sports. I know the ball boy or ball girl does in tennis, but in basketball I have no idea. It's a bad, there's different tiers right at the entry level. Tier is you're wiping the sweat on the fort. When a player falls down in the middle of the game, all right, right.

Speaker 2:          00:46:24       People go out with the mop and the towel and you're just wiping the sweat. So the players and slip on the court, it's like the entry level position. And I did plenty of that. Um, as you work your way up the tier, then you work on the side of the court and you'd actually run and grab the players, warm up pants and jacket. When they went to check into the games, he'd be at half of like sitting on a half court with them and you can't have a towel when they came in, you know, sit back down on the bench and then the next year was he'd worked behind the bench and actually assist the trainer. And so you'd be handing the Gatorade over their shoulder. Oh, cool. And they sit down and give him the towel, get them their, their, their warm up, their, uh, their jacket with a Hoodie.

Speaker 2:          00:47:00       And then the highest level was doing that for the visiting team. Right. And so, um, and whatever they needed to set up the locker room before the game. You've run any errands that need to get done, you break the, lock him down at the end of the game, the whole thing. So you get to the game like three hours early and do all this. Um, you end up running errands for the players. Sometimes you'd be like a nice tip or horse grant one time, give me a hundred dollar bill, it's a big deal. Take us back to the bus. And it was pretty cool. And so they threw me my very first game. They throw me to the visitors side, Toronto Raptors, tar afters. And um, it was my first experience, right of like being around some amia greats. Marcus Camby. I remember it was on the team at the time.

Speaker 2:          00:47:39       This guy watched play, uh, at Umass in college and like really admired and um, uh, it was my first exposure to professional sports locker room too. And everybody comes in and they just take the clothes off to get changed in. Like nobody gives a shit. It doesn't matter at the end of the day. Um, but for me it was like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Where am I? Lots of negative pressure athletes. It was my first experience. Of course, you get used to that. It's no big deal at a certain point. Um, so I'm, I'm in the MBA and I did it for three seasons. I got to work alongside the Lenny Wilkins, the head coach to Kevin Mutombo, Steve Smith, uh, some of these NBA greats. Um, and there were some really incredible moments that happen. Um, one of them, one of them was when the hawks played the Chicago Bulls. Jordan's still playing. This is 1999, um, one of his last seasons.

Speaker 2:          00:48:38       And, um, I'll never forget this, so you have to imagine the scene ruin Philips arena and, uh, the hawks are actually winning, which is amazing. And the place is going nuts. You can't even hear yourself think it's so loud. People are screaming. They're, they're playing music over the loud speakers. And I'm working the bowls bench, right? Which is like, you've got Scottie Pippin and Steve Kerr, Dennis Rodman, uh, Michael Jackson, Phil Jackson, Michael Jordan, like the whole, the whole rostered help rostered and some work in the bowls bench there down. Phil Jackson called a timeout and the place goes nuts because the hawks are up and in front of me. Jordan pops down Rodman's on the left. Pippins on the right. Phil Jackson. It's like right here and he's furious. Like this guy's using xsplit as like you'd never believe he's yelling things. I feel like I can feel his soul like his spit, like hitting my face.

Speaker 2:          00:49:43       He's just like, and I'm like right behind Jordan. He's right here and the places again, so loud, people screaming at the top of their lungs and um, I'm doing my job right. I give the guys a towel and then I'm getting the Gatorade. So I'm like, I'm going to start with Jordan. Obviously he's right in front of me. So I reached around. I, you're on this side. Um, so left, left hand, like over the shoulder, left hand over the shoulder. Jordan is facing this way, talking to pip and who's right next to him. I reached around and Rodman, who is to my left, turns quickly bumps my elbow. The Gatorade quickly goes upside down and straight into Jordan's lap.

Speaker 2:          00:50:26       There were only few in my life. I've been as terrified as that moment. Phil Jackson's yelling at me, Michael Jordan spins around and he goes, hey man, watch it. And I'm like, oh my God, like my heart's racing. I'm like Jesus Christ. So I did what anybody would do in that moment. If you spill something, you tend to wipe it up. So I grabbed the towel and I'm patting down Jordan's thigh. Like now I'm like in the huddle, right? Rodman's laughing at me because he realized what he'd done had done. Phil Jackson's like right here, like spitting. He's yelling so hard and I'm like, I'm sorry Jordan. I'm like trying to like dry as leg up with his Gatorade spill that went right to his lap and oh man, I'm like sweating profusely. Right? Cause like you're going to get like the TV crews are like in the huddle to the camera's in your face.

Speaker 2:          00:51:14       It's like high stress moment as a ball boy. And so are you had one job. Don't pour the Gatorade on Jordan's balls. Well obviously unfortunately Robin and made that quick spin knocked me not your fault. So I'm like, the, the buzzer goes off and it's like time to get back on the court and I'm still like patting down like Jordan's leg and he's like, oh, come on man, get up. And um, I think right after that he actually had like a whole bunch of points. He three on the slam dunk or something. I think the moral of the story there is a, you know, when he, when I spill Gatorade on Jordan, make sure you clean it up.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       What it seems like there's another pattern here, which is getting comfortable with uncomfortable situations. Right? Or exposing yourself to discomfort. Yeah. So that you're comfortable sphere of action expands. Right. Uh, what, what was your next brush once you get to visit these, you're in [inaudible]. Were there any formative entrepreneurial experiences that come to mind?

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       Absolutely. Were.

Speaker 1:          00:52:39       And I, she'd explain also if I may interject just for a second that, okay. One of the reasons I wanted to explore a lot of these stories is that it's easy and I think typical for people to take a single chapter in someone's life and isolate it and view it as the whole story. Right? But there's so much backstory and so much development and so many experiences that lead up to the small piece of the puzzle that people tend to think is the whole puzzle. Right? Right. So just for people listening and watching, that's, that's, and I just enjoy your storytelling. So that's another piece of it. But the [inaudible], right. So this is, this is a level up, I mean risky, you have a lot of talented people are his name,

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       uh, any entrepreneurial memories or experiments that come to mind from risky? Yes. So I decided to go to busy, to study fine arts, to be a painter and I didn't really know what that meant. I had this vision of maybe one day, you know, being able to exhibit in New York or something, like do the gallery scene. I couldn't actually picture it, but, um, really wanted to go to study art and painting. So when I got to campus, they have this week of orientation and you get your class schedule and you get to meet upperclassmen. And um, some talking to this guy and fellow students, fellow fell student upperclassmen and he's saying, Oh, who do you have for your courses? And freshman year they give you the foundation stuff like drawing two dimensional design, three dimensional design, liberal arts, art history, and some going through the list of teachers.

Speaker 4:          00:54:16       And I say this one teacher's name that makes his eyebrows go up. I go, I've got Gareth Jones for three d. And he goes, you've got Gareth Jones. Oh Man. I go, what is it, what it is, this guy? And he goes, just wait for the chess set project. And I go, what's the Jess said project? And he goes, you'll see. So my very first class is with this Guy Gareth Jones teaching three dimensional design. And picture this, we're in this art studio with these concrete fours. He's like rickety metal stools, plaster covered kind of work surfaces. It's a little bit cold, it's September, New England. And you know, it's a very first class. And I'm sitting around with 18 other freshmen, we're all trying to make sense of where we are in the world and what this thing's all about. And this is about to be our first impression of what does it like to be a student at risky.

Speaker 4:          00:55:12       And so we're sitting there and all of a sudden this guy wearing all black with this big poofy had a hair comes out and he stands in front of us and he's got this Welsh accent and he goes, I just want you all to know that half of you are going to fail my costs because he won't finish the chess set project. I don't think it's off. Oh my God, that's what this is going to be like here. Like half the people I with my left, I looked to my right, one of them is going to be gone because going to fail out. I'm like, oh my God. And we're all looking at each other like is he serious? And he goes on to explain the chess at project. And so in addition to your weekly assignments, the chest at project is this semester long project that takes place outside of the classroom on your own time where you have to choose a three dimensional artist, like a sculptor like Henry Moore and architect like Frank Lloyd Wright furniture designer, a fashion designer, and you had to find a book about them.

Speaker 4:          00:56:21       And from that you had to select of their work to recreate and you did it in the format of a chess set, which means it didn't have to look like actual chess set pieces, but you take one of their creations and replicated eight times for your pond and had to look exactly like the picture in the book. You took another one of their creations and yet her replicate twice for the rooks in three d in three d and Yet to do it at 12 inch scale God and just looking at a picture, you'd figure out what it's made of, what's the backside look like, what's the underside of the like? And at this time I had a growing interest in furniture, furniture design. And I came across this furniture designer from the 1920s and thirties, named Garrett Rietveld. He was a Dutch architect and designer. Um, and he did these really beautiful chairs that are actually in the museum of Modern Art. They're classics. And I thought a couple of things. One is, as I got to know Gareth Jones, the professor room, it became very clear that this guy was super opinionated. He would argue to the death to make sure that he was always right. I would watch him like, just are you students? Like, like relentlessly to make his point. And out of that, I just had this growing thinking of like, wow, like I'd love to prove this guy wrong at some point.

Speaker 4:          00:57:42       And so, um, I also thought I'm going to throw myself into this project. There's no way I'm failing. In fact, I wanna, I wanna I want to complete this project and if I'm going to commit so much of my time to this and I'm going to make chairs from this designer Garrett, refilled at the end of it, I want to come out with something I can use. I don't want 12 inch chairs. I actually want full functional chairs. And so I'm like, this is a really great idea. I'm going to share this with Gareth. So I call him over and I'm like, Gareth, I want to make full size functional chairs. And My expectation at this time was that he's going to, you know, give me a high five and say, Joe, you can do it. You got this, I believe in you instead, Tim.

Speaker 4:          00:58:25       He goes, Joe, I really don't think you can do it. Really focus on the smallest scale. And he walks away and I'm like, no fucking way. Like, all right buddy, now you really have to do it right. All right pal. Like you just lit every fire that you needed a light. We forgot how to do this. The thing is I didn't know how the hell to make a chair. I've never worked with wood before. I never heard power tools like, like actual machine shop tools. And um, I was really stepping into unknown on this and I had a semester to figure it out. So I just committed every, all of my time to making this project happen on, on weekends, Saturday nights my friends would be going out to parties on campus and I was in the studio trying to figure out how to make chairs.

Speaker 4:          00:59:14       And so I started by going to the furniture department and talking to upperclassmen and actually sat with the head of the furniture department name is Rosanne Somerson. And I told her about my ambitions and she looked at me with kind of a crazy face. It's like, you're never going to figure this out. But she was encouraging and she pointed me to some upperclassmen who then started help me understand wood and machines and the tools, table saws and band saws and leads in the things that you need to make furniture. And so piece by piece I started to figure out how to make these chairs I was sourcing would, I had access to the shop that they were giving me. And the thing is I never told Gareth where it was in the projects. So every check in and be like how's it coming? I'm like, it's all right.

Speaker 4:          00:59:59       And I would downplay my progress. Meanwhile in my dorm room is starting to fill up with these chairs everywhere. And so I like, I worked my butt off and I just, I, that whole semester I was like hacking my way through it and I get to the the pawn so I have to pick, pick one of his chairs and make it eight times. He made this beautiful bench out of just four pieces of wood and I'm thinking to myself, wow, these benches is really big. That's a lot of wood. I can't afford this. I don't know. I'm just a freshman in college and so I'm out. You had to cover all your material costs. Oh yeah. Okay. No, no. That's an important detail. Right? So study job. At the time, I was trying to like find this harder. I could. And so I'm in the quad one day outside the freshman dorms and um, I make an observation.

Speaker 4:          01:00:49       Everyone's standing around smoking here in the quad and there's actually newer to sit, Huh, I've got this bench design that I'm going to make. What if I approached the school, get them to pay for the wood, I'll make the benches from or project, then they can have them afterwards to put in the quad for people to sit on. So I go to the, the head of resident's life. I pitched him the idea, he gloves it, they fund a few thousand dollars worth of this inch thick plywood. And in doing so, I get access to the schools, wood shops and this school's craftsmen like who work on campus. And so now I've got their help to help fabricate these, these benches. Amazing. And they paid for all the wood, which I definitely could never have afforded. And so, um, by the end of the semester I've amassed 16 full size functional chairs and Gareth had no clue and actually finished the last chair at about two in the morning, the night before the final crit, the day before the final crit.

Speaker 4:          01:01:45       Chris, his critique, right? A critique. In art school you have these critiques where you put your arm, your workout, and then the professor and the class critique you and that's how you learn how to improve as an artist or designer. And so it's like now December, it's freezing cold outside. It's providence and I specifically chose the slot right after lunch to present because I figured when everyone's out getting lunch, I'll get my roommates, a couple buddies to help me carry all these chairs and assembled them in the space. When people come back, there'll be this great reveal moment because nobody has any clue except a couple of friends. Exactly what I've pulled off here. It's him. My only regret from this project is that I did not have a camera in my hand to take a picture of Gareth's face when he entered the studio.

Speaker 4:          01:02:37       I'm swear, I'm standing there and he comes marching in and he picks his head up and he looks at the room suddenly and you can see him counting and his head is 15, 16. And he looks at me and he goes, Joe, you've done it. You've proved me wrong. And I'm like, the rest of the critique, we all send my chairs and we talked about that, the project. And um, I got very hard marks obviously. And um, it was one of those breakthrough moments where you have somebody that you look up to tell you can't do something and you are literally tasked with something you've never done before and somehow you persevere through it. You asked for help, you, um, you figure it out. And on the other side of that, I was sitting there in this chair's thinking, wow, like if I could figure this out, what else could I figure out?

Speaker 4:          01:03:34       Yeah. Like this seemed like an impossible feat before this whole thing started. And here I am, I'm sitting in these chairs, the professors like beaming at me like, and it was just like one of these, these moments. It did one has in life where you sort of crossed a threshold of, of understanding your limits. And at that point I had a new, a new bar or a new set of limits. How did you feel for, from the point that he said that for the rest of the day, what, what did, what did the rest of the day look like? I mean, well first of all I was so tired. I'd been up for, um, actually I hadn't slept for about three days before that. So over 48 hours I was without sleep. Um, so I was delirious a B I was just so relieved. And then third I was like, there's the six excitement inside of me was like, I just, I just proved myself wrong.

Speaker 4:          01:04:34       Well what else can I prove myself wrong on? And suddenly it's like there was so much possibility of anything at this point forward that I come across. It feels impossible. I probably need to take a second look at that and rethink that based on this experience. Because again, like how do you make a chair and then how do you make 16 full sized functional chairs at the end of the pro over a course of a semester. And so what's cool is that the bench has gotten stalled. Students are sitting in them for, they lasted for a couple of years after that. And so the legacy of it, not we'll only went to the benches, but the, the story of what had happened became his story that he told every class after that. So that's, that's really powerful and a bunch of levels,

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       right? I guess, uh, not only, and I have to, I don't know the guy of course at all, but I have to give the professor credit for being willing to say, Hey, like you proved me wrong. Maybe as also just in that moment, the power of that reinforcement for you as it is a big deal. I mean, that's a really big deal. Potentially. Life-Defining influction point of sorts. Secondly, the few things occurred to me. You created eight. You also created a, a product, an outcome that people could use, right? Versus a scale model. And you created a story that would then set the bar infinitely higher, not necessarily the past fail mark, but the, you can fucking do this mark four students for generations to come. Like many, many classes to come. That's a big deal. I've said big deal a lot cause I think you're a big deal Joe.

Speaker 1:          01:06:17       Ah, it's true. And uh, one question that occurred to me while I was listening to this was related to the moment when he said that you couldn't do it or you thought you couldn't do it and how you responded to that. It made me think of a story that I heard from Alexis Ohanian Co founder of Reddit when they went in early, some relatively early in the development of Reddit to meet with Yahoo. And they were showing traffic numbers and analytics to this Yahoo Exec. And the Yahoo exact made this comment, which probably to him or her at the time didn't seem like a big deal, but they said, oh well this is a rounding error for us. And to my recollection, Alexis and his team, in fact the office and they put you are a rounding error up on the wall to motivate the team, but not everybody responds to what you could view as a deathblow that way. So where'd you get that from? Is that from sports, from your parents? Is it from somewhere else? Is it just your programming? Where do you think that comes from?

Speaker 4:          01:07:32       Just one source. I think sports is definitely a way to, to, if I had to point to something and played so many sports growing up from tennis to baseball to basketball, the track and field and cross country. Um, like some of those are team sports, some of those are individual sports. And in all of those, I mean in any sport that's competitive, you're trying to ultimately compete with yourself to do a better performance than you did the last time. Right. Um, and so I looked at sports as this constant. Um, I was, I was in a game with myself and like cross country was a great example. That sport, like for me was I feel like where I honed my goal setting and was able to practice pushing my limits. So every, um, I would, if I cross the finish line and I could still really like walk and had energy to me that was energy I could use on the course through run a faster race.

Speaker 4:          01:08:25       Huh. And so eventually I got to this point where I literally would collapse after the finish line and it became so well known that like the medics would be waiting for me in that have the ice bags and like they'd have like the, the ivy just in case and like the parents would be there to like pick me up. And um, um, in the last, you know, 800 meters to the finish line, I'd always try to find somebody who was running a little bit faster than me and I th I just would try to accelerate to catch up with them, draft them a little bit. And then sometimes I'd be neck and neck with them too, like in the finish lines with insight so close. And I would just say out loud to them, I'd say, you're not beating me. You're not beating me. And I'd, I'd use that to motivate myself just to try to run faster to get a better time.

Speaker 1:          01:09:12       That's amazing there. I'm glad you brought up the sports because Paul, part of the reason I asked is that it in, it's a slightly different lesson maybe or one lesson that I took from sports. I went to two different high schools. The second high school I went to had mandatory sports, which I felt was really in retrospect, important for a lot of kids and by being forced to do various sports, primarily wrestling in my case, if you want to get better, you're going to train with people who are better than you. Yes. By definition, you are going to be beaten by other people. And at least to my experts, I started to view any type of failure in that capacity being beaten as feedback, right? I mean you're, it's like a crit, right? It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sports based crit. And, uh, that's why oftentimes when a, and if you have a good coach, they're also going to be pushing you beyond what your perceived limits are.

Speaker 1:          01:10:19       100%. Right. So you get into the habit, perhaps subconscious or otherwise of asking, is this impossible? Really impossible because I never thought I would break whatever, six minute mile and I just did that. And then I never thought I was gonna break at five 30 mile and my coach just helped me to do that. Or I figured out this hack, which is chasing the fastest person in front of me and then saying, you're not going to be me, are not going to beat me. And then I collapsed on him. Big Mess of a heap at the end button on the last, hey, I just be five 30. Exactly. Or whatever it is. Uh, and you, you feel like you've, you've expanded it, like you've, you've pushed the limits of what you thought was possible within myself and that, that for me it was like one of the greatest feelings yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:58       That I had at that time, which strikes me is that for me I didn't have many vehicles for expanding that capability. That was, that was as tangible sports. But design is super tangible, right? I mean you're building these chairs and these benches and a should, I should also just mention as a side note that I want to, I want to come back to [inaudible] that I don't think it's ever too late. People might be listening saying, well hey, I didn't have a great cross country team or wrestling coach in high school. So kind of up Shit's creek. It's like no actually you can still develop that, right. With physical training and, and other outlets to expand your capabilities and your perception of what's possible.

Speaker 4:          01:11:46       Sure. And it's so funny cause that was a piece of advice I got in seventh grade when I started playing basketball. The basketball coach said, Joe, Joe, if you want to get better at basketball, you need to play with people who were better than you. Yeah. And so when I used to go to the, to the wide shoot hoops in the weekend, I wouldn't play with people my age or younger. It actually play with the high schoolers who were much bigger, much stronger, much more talented than I was. And of course I got pushed around and I'm like, you know, you get bumped around by guys who were, you know, um, playing on the varsity team. But man, my skills, the learning curve that year, I feel like that was, that was like a, another kind of threshold moment of like, I'm not very good at basketball too, actually. Okay. I've got some skills now. And so I think since that, since that moment, I've always sought to try to find people to play with who's better than me and that'll certainly come up back up when we talk about airbnb.

Speaker 1:          01:12:39       So the, so the Welshman yes. And seeds, defeat gas, so to speak.

Speaker 4:          01:12:46       Um, I, I by the way, I, um, I caught up for him with him, caught up with him for a coffee about 12 years later and I had to ask them, I'm like, here's my experience of that conversation. Like what the hell were you thinking? Why didn't you get behind me? And he goes, Joe, come on. I knew that if I told you you couldn't do it, he would.

Speaker 1:          01:13:13       Oh you,

Speaker 4:          01:13:16       we have a great relationship. And I seen him when I get back to campus and it's very cool. So,

Speaker 1:          01:13:22       so phase shifts, you have that experience, that experience

Speaker 4:          01:13:24       and is a great segway of sports into my wrist experience. I love basketball as we've been talking about. And I, I walked into the office of student life one day and I go to the guy at the front desk and say, I want to play on the basketball team. And he gives me this funny face and he goes, we don't have a basketball team. And all of a sudden there's this like this awkward silence. It was just staring at each other and he breaks his silence by saying, you can start one. If you want to and you go, really what's involved in that? And he goes, well, if you collect a list of 12 other students that want to play, bring it back to me. I'm like, that's it. And I'm like, okay. So I run off and they spent a week putting a post up posters up around the dorms and I gathered names of, you know, 11 other people play basketball.

Speaker 4:          01:14:14       It wasn't actually that hard. And I come back to him like, okay cool. Now when he goes, okay, fill out this form, take this to the student government meeting on Wednesday to get recognized as a student organization. I'm like, okay. So I go to the meeting, I present the concepts, might have a basketball team, here's the paperwork, here's the names, here's the like what we think we might need for a budget. It gets pre approved from the student government because then I'm like, I go back to Mike, what's the next step? He's like, okay, well you need to find a gym. And, and so one of these, one thing led to the other. And that year we, we started [inaudible] first basketball team in 40 years and we started this, this team, it was like Hodgepodge Group of other students and we would rent gym space at a private high school in Providence to go practicing.

Speaker 4:          01:15:02       And at this point we're just practicing. Like we literally have, there's no season and there's no games, there's no other competition is just us scrimmaging each other. And, um, we made some really basic uniforms and just got things off the ground. The next year when I came back to campus, um, was, was different. I'm like, okay, this year we're going to make a season, we're going to play the teams. Like, let's turn this into something. Um, and so I get on the phone, I start calling colleges in New England, I'm calling community colleges and you know, junior, junior varsity schools. And, um, I get on the phone with some of these coaches and I introduced myself, hey, this is Joe Gabby calling from the [inaudible] on the school basketball team and I'd like to, hello? Hello. Pretty much everybody's hung up on that in the first couple of phone calls. But then there was one college that took my call on the ever forget it because I had to sneak out of my graphic design class to take the call.

Speaker 4:          01:16:02       It was a car key University of Massachusetts and I'm on the phone with their head coach. He's like, yeah, okay cool. Well we're not going to send down our varsity team but I'll send my JV team and I'm like, perfect, we'll take it. So on December 4th, 2001 we had the first risky basketball game Rizzy versus Clark University and at this point like it's so informal for us, we've got these basic meshed jerseys that are like reversible, basically a practice uniform for anybody else. And I'm a player coach leading the team at this point and we're in not even her own gym cause we don't have one in some private high school gym around the corner. And the Clark University bus pulls up and they're players start to get off the bus and I'm going, oh my God, their shortest guy is taller than our tallest guy. And they get it. They had coach three assistant coaches and a trainer comes off below.

Speaker 4:          01:16:54       It's just like 12 scrappy art school students on the court with like Basic Mesh practice jerseys. And I think what's the, what's the coach came down to the court, you kind of recognize what he got itself into and he's like, oh boy. And we had a few, I think about 150 fans Rizzy students show up. That first game. I say we got blown out. It was [inaudible] 94 to 49 but in my mind that was a huge win because we establish something like we got a team established and off the ground. It's a real milestone at Rezidor. Yeah. And it was an incredible experience next couple of years because it was like running a startup, you know, you had to put a team together, you had to raise funding, you had to create a brand in a market, that brand yet to get people into the games. And one of the things I was most proud of is that at Risley, the work, the work loads are incredibly difficult.

Speaker 4:          01:17:47       And once you get into your majors, they, you know, they say like sometimes you never see anybody again because they're just so focused on, on the workload. And, um, other than graduation, the basketball games became the only other time really during the year where you'd have the full cross section of campus under the same roof. At the same time, students, faculty, administration, um, uh, professors, alumni, people from brown who were just curious and want to come over and see what this crazy Rizzy basketball team is doing. And so it was this really cool moment where you just bring people together. And that was, I think really the, the, the, the undertones, the undercurrents of what the teams really about. Sure. It was about sport and competition and staying in shape and the comradery of being on the team. Second to that was also about bringing people together.

Speaker 1:          01:18:33       Uh, thematically makes sense if we're time traveling, looking forward. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:18:38       So that was a great experience. Um, I think a lot of people ask what the name of the team is and um, you know, because we're an art school, we didn't have to have traditional names, you know, Rizzy and any art school is all about self expression and I'm not holding back. And so there was a legacy of names on campus that all had a particular theme to them. And so the hockey team on campus, it's called the Nads. So when you cheer it's go gonads. And so when we started the basketball team, we had to sort of fall in line with the theme. So the team's called the balls and both the nads in the balls are supported by the jock straps versus the cheerleading team. And, um, there's a whole theme. I probably, maybe we won't go into it here, but there's like a whole theme of, of sports at Rizzi that adds to the, I think the, the levity and the humor of it. Are they all testicle related? Um, there was a, there was a, um, I think there was a rowing team at one point called the, uh, the shafts.

Speaker 1:          01:19:43       It might have been though the Lacrosse team, I think it was called a shaft. So it's a side note, side note mix. I'm all caffeinated. Do you know where the, the word avocado comes from? And I don't, I'll tell you, it comes from, I believe it's, I want to say an older Mayan language, but someone can correct me on the Internet. I'm sure they will. Comes from a word, a Hakata t l at the end. I'll cuddle and avocado grow on trees hanging one lower than the other and hairs. And uh, that means testicles. So if you want to make a risky, current Rizvi students who might want to start another team, you could go with the Avocados, but it requires a bit of explanation. What would that support be? The most boring juggling team and intramural juggling. Remedial Juggling team juggling two, the first and only juggling team in college. So I have to ask, because I've been wanting to debut this question for a while. We talked about crit, we've talked about balls, which I think is a, it's a bit of a reach, but we can segway to buns. When does CritBuns enter the picture here? All right,

Speaker 4:          01:21:01       so it's freshman year at Risley. I'm in a drawing class and the way it works again is like he'd come in and it'd be an eight hour class in the morning. You'd pin your work up on the wall, you're drawing assignment from the week before, and he'd, what do we spend all day critiquing it? We're having to Kristen and people would ask afterwards, how'd your crit go? Oh Man, my crit was so hard and my teacher was so rough on me. Or like it didn't go well or it was great. And about four hours in your picture that the environment you're in, an art studio, hardwood floors, metal stools, wooden benches for hours and have sitting on these hard, uncomfortable surfaces, your butt starts to feel it and everyone's wiggling around trying to get comfortable. So by the end of the day, you're incredibly sore. And I watch as my classmates exited the art studio with this bun print on the seat of their pants because all the charcoal does paint and ink that's on these studio surfaces rubbed off onto her pants. And sure enough, I look on mine, my pants were ruined too. So walking back to my dorm room and thinking there's gotta be a better way

Speaker 4:          01:22:11       if we're going to enter these credits for the next four years, what have you had a seat cushion that you could sit on to make you comfortable and to keep you clean. And so I got back to my dorm room, I pulled up my sketchbook and I drew that same bun print shape on the seat of our pants and gave it some dimension and I called it crit buns. And you know at this point I had no idea how to make a product. That's just your first year of design school. So I tucked the sketch away. Now fast forward to five years later, I've now done a dual degree in graphic design and industrial design. And at this point I know how to make a prototype. I know how to translate something from a sketch book into, you know, a real working prototype. And so I make buns out of hard foam.

Speaker 4:          01:23:00       You can actually sculpted out of the special foam. And I have this full size hard, you know, representation of the shape, which is like, you know, two buns that come together and there's a handle suits for portability. I take that hard model, I cast it in rubber and then I pour into the cast a expanding polyurethane foam. So when I took the lid off there was looking back and meet the first soft crippen's seat cushion and it was great because now I could walk around into my classmates, I could say, hey, where do you guys think, how much did you pay for this? What kind of colors would you want? And people of course had a cracked a smile and they saw it and they had a good laugh. Um, but I really hit a wall because I had a one off prototype, but I didn't know how to get it to the next stage.

Speaker 4:          01:23:45       And I certainly didn't have the money or the funds to do that on my own. It was around this time my senior year where I notice a poster on campus that says, competition for the design diploma. Submit your ideas here. And at Risley they give you your degree and paper to degree and they also give the graduating class at different object every year. So I submit CritBuns for the competition and it wins. It gets selected to be given out to every graduate from the [inaudible] classes. He hasn't five which is like freaking incredible. However, they tell me this on May 1st graduation is on June 1st that's not all the time between that I have to deliver two thesis projects for graphic design and industrial design. I definitely don't have time to take on anything else is how many students are in the graduating class. It's about 600 600 so I'm like, I'm so exuberant and excited that like, oh my God, they'll pay for the, the the manufacturing of a couple hundred cushions at the same time.

Speaker 4:          01:24:50       I'm like, how the hell am I gonna get this done? Like there's absolutely no time. And so I start, I get onto Google and I researched. I searched foam manufacturers, Tim, I called every single search result for the first 15 pages I was calling people in India. I was comfortable in England. I was called people in Texas. I was calling people in California and everybody said the same thing. Uh, well son, um, you know, it's going to take you about six weeks just to make the metal mould and about another four weeks for production. Sorry, quick. And I just went through everybody who's getting no, no, no, no, no. So then I went to my professors in industrial design and they also said this is never going to happen in time. Now I'm at this point, the school is getting a little nervous because the clock is ticking here.

Speaker 4:          01:25:35       And they call me and they say, how's the project coming? And I'm like, it's cool, don't worry. And they go, uh, so it was going to happen. And I'm like, probably. And they go, well you have until Friday at five o'clock to tell us if it's a go or none. So I'm like, okay, and what is this on a Monday, on a Tuesday of this is like Monday. Alright, so fast forward, it's four o'clock on Friday afternoon. I have no options. Everybody's telling me no, it's never going to happen. It's impossible manufacturing and take many, many weeks if not months. And I'm like, I don't have that many weeks. We've got three now. And so I go outside the industrial design building, it's like a sunny afternoon and I'm laying on the grass right on the, on the river in Providence. And I feel the breeze on my face, the sound of the birds. And I'm looking up at the sky and I'm thinking to myself, I have to figure this out. I can't, I'm not going to give up on this. What haven't I thought of yet?

Speaker 5:          01:26:31       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:26:32       And I realized that the guy that runs the metal shop in the industrial design building, this Guy Steve, I haven't talked to him yet. So I run back in the industrial design building. I go, Steve, here's what's going on. And he goes, I've got this friend Sam up in Cumberland, Rhode Island. He's got a tool shop. Why don't you give him a call? Maybe he'll help you up. So I get on the phone with this guy, Sam, and I just pour it out to him. I'm like, Sam, this is what I want to do. I give them every ounce of enthusiasm that I have. And at the end he goes, oh, you really want this, don't you know, like yes, whatever you can do. And he goes, all right, here's what I'll do. I'll move a couple of projects around. If you send me the three d cad file today, I can make the tool this weekend and send it wherever you need me to send it on Monday.

Speaker 4:          01:27:18       And I'm like, Oh my God, I'm going to call you right back. Because I remembered there was a pool float company that I spoke to the week before in Connecticut who pool float. So it's like they make like water wings or whatever you would lay in and you pull the noodles and the things that float in water made out of foam. And the guy told me, he said, well, I remembered something. He goes, you know, we can't make the mold in time, but he finds somebody else, we can produce the cushion. And the other thing is it had to have a silk screen on the top that said [inaudible] 2005 on him. And so I call back this Guy Christoph at like 4:50 PM right on a Friday. He should have been gone. Like, I don't know how I caught him still in the office and I go, Chris, off, it's Joe at rusty.

Speaker 4:          01:28:01       Like I found somebody to make them old. He'll have it to you by Monday. Can we make it work? And he goes, you really want this, don't you as whatever you can do. And he goes, all right, here's the address to send it to. So I literally call the school back. We might as well been five o'clock and I'm like, we got it. Here's where to send the Po, the purchase order that, ah, two weeks later, the day before graduation, 600 CritBuns showed up on campus with a silkscreen on top that said, Rizzy class in 2005 the day before it was impossible of how do you make 600 CritBuns 300 read 300 blue with a silkscreen on top in such a short amount of time. And everybody's telling, you know, like everybody just stared at me and was like, this is never going to happen.

Speaker 4:          01:28:53       Um, I was exhausted. It's gonna happen. However, it was so fun to see my classmates running around with crit buns. Everybody had a pair and like, um, it was really fulfilling and it was worth all the effort and all the energy. And I finished my two thesis successfully on time and I got to graduate and everything. And while a lot of my classmates went off to great jobs at some NASA doing industrial design and summit, um, some of the big design firms like ido and others, um, I made a decision. I said, you know, Rizzy and just design school in general does such an exceptional job of helping you come up with a creative process to, you know, think of really original creative ideas there. They usually hit a wall though, which is that you stop it at the prototype and then you move on to the next project.

Speaker 4:          01:29:44       And for me, it built up this incredible desire to figure out how did, how did, how do you get to the shelf of a store? Like, how does your idea to transition from that one off prototype all the way to the shelf of the store? And so I thought, well, I want to, I want to decode this black box. I have to figure this out. So I made a decision that I was going to use CritBuns to help figure out how you get a product from an idea in your head to a sketchbook, the shelf of the store. So the day after graduation, I started my first company to make and sell CritBuns. And the beauty of it is that I didn't get paid for the graduation project, but they gave me the metal mould afterward, which is a few thousand dollars. So with the biggest expense out of the way, I was off off the run.

Speaker 4:          01:30:29       So what happened? What happened? A crypt punks, why aren't you making crimp wants today? So that summer I started to develop the brand. I filed the patent, which is design, has a design patent on it, filed the trademark and everything. And I went back to the school that summer and I said, you know, that was so fun for the graduating class. What if we did this for the incoming class is a welcome to receive gift. And they loved the idea and they placed their first order. And so on top of that order, I, I tacked on my own inventory. So I did this production run of I think a thousand cushions, right? And two things happen. The first is that there are now 400 students running around campus with CritBuns actually using them in the studios. I give the talk to them, I could take photos of them, I could actually start to build stories and narratives around how they use the product.

Speaker 4:          01:31:18       And second thing that happens is on there, forget in my apartment in Providence, in the basement of like this really old kind of early 19 hundreds apartment. Um, I had about 10 boxes of hundreds of CritBuns like filled up this entire room. And I'm sitting there staring at it. I'm thinking, oh boy, nobody's coming to my basement to buy these things. I have to go to Allen's of the world and Africa, how do I sell these things? So I put together a sale sheet, um, and, and I put on my best shirt in my best shoes and like just the best kind of like professional look that I could have. And the first story I walked into was the Brown University bookstore and I asked for the store manager and we sit down in this little conference room and I started to go through my spiel and I put the, the sales sheet in front of her and a sample of cushion and going through the whole thing and a Mike, you know, given all my enthusiasm and about 30 or so seconds in, she looks at me, she goes, no thanks and gets up and leaves the room.

Speaker 4:          01:32:22       And I'm just sitting there, this tiny little fluorescent lit conference room by myself with my cushion and my sales sheet and no sale, like actually pretty horrible rejection. Um, so I walked back to my apartment, very slow walk, kind of like a Charlie Brown, you kind of walk and, and Athena myself. That sucks. I'm like, how the hell am I going to sell these cushions if that's the reaction I'm going to get? And it was in that moment where I remembered this sales equation that I had heard at this entrepreneur weekend at Brown university that I snuck into one time and the guy's talking gave this equation for whenever you introduce a new idea to the world. It was an equation for receiving rejection and how to move pass rejection. And the equation was sw squared plus WC equals m. Oh wow. Hell of a memory here. I'll give myself zero seconds. I already forgot it. All right, so most time sw square sw squared must have seen SWC equals emo. Alright, so sw squared is some will love your idea. Some waltz plus who cares equals move on.

Speaker 4:          01:33:48       He was the bucket. I like equation. So I'm telling myself, okay, STB screw, who cares? I just got to move on. And so I did. I'm like, all right, I'm just going to find another story. Some people are going to love it, some people aren't. It doesn't matter. I just got to keep going. I can't get hung up in one person saying, no, I need to go keep going until I find it can find somebody that says yes. So I went to the next door, they said to him, went to third store. They also said no. I went to the fourth store, which was this little tiny gift boutique store on Thayer street in providence sign affair. Yes. Had a Halloween, aren't there? It's a hell of Halloween. It is. That's crazy. Street of young for Halloween. Um, so I go into the store, I give them the pitch, the sales sheet.

Speaker 4:          01:34:28       Now at this point I'm, I'm tweaking everything. I'm iterating as I go. And the woman goes, I'd love to bike. I love to buy some cushions from you. And I'm like, oh my God. She goes, I'd love to buy for, and I'm like, Themis, I hell yeah, she could have bought one and I would have been Abby. So she starts to go to the thing, well here's, you can ship them to, and here's the address. And I go, oh no, no, no. I'll go pack them up and my house and bring them back to you today. She's like, really? I'm like, yeah. I ran home. I packed up my cushion. I was so excited. I gave them serum. I went back later that night after they closed, it's like it's dark on Thayer street. I go to the front of the store and I press my face against the cold glass and I can kind of see my, my breath in the glass and there's a dim light on in the back of the boutique that they're closed and I'm scanning the store am squinting and there it is.

Speaker 4:          01:35:20       I can see CritBuns on the shelf of the store. I'm like, yes, like I did it. Like everything after that point was downhill like I, it was like I knew how to walk into a store and you had to talk to him downhill, downhill. Good sense, like you're pushing the ball downhill. Right? Right. Before I was like trying to climb up hill against all these obstacles. Now it was just like coasting downhill. Now, was that because you had the skills or because you did proven to yourself that you could do it? It to myself, I could do it. Is that like one proof point for cushions, for cushions on the shelf of the store. I'm like Hallelujah. Somehow it happened. Um, now I have like even more confidence to walk into a store and meet with a buyer and ask the question now what's the process to get a new product into your store?

Speaker 4:          01:36:05       And they could sit down with them and talk about the products, how original it was. Um, so I make trips to Boston and talked to stores there. I go down to New York. I talked to Pratt and he talked to um, school, visual arts, talked to Parsons. Um, um, I talked to more stores and Providence who was the furthest away you traveled to? Soccer Ponds? When I go home to Atlanta for the holidays, it's all that stores in Atlanta. I mean everywhere I went I was always carrying a cushion with me. I talked to anybody about it. Right? It was like everybody I talked to, I just practicing the sales pitch. And just as to get comfortable with it. Um, so at that product, in that concept, just, you know, it was never meant to be anything huge. It was just meant to be Grad school in essence to help teach me like the whole stack of product development because I was doing everything out of my apartment from the distribution, the packaging, the fulfillment, the website, the press, like everything was run for my desktop computer next to my bed in my bedroom.

Speaker 4:          01:37:06       Um, and so I got like in a very micro, very small scale, I get the full, you know, ecosystem of what it means to run something. Obviously the, a very small manageable scale, which is perfect. Um, and so one of the, one of the defining moments was I set a goal for myself. I said, what's the store shelf that would be the pinnacle for me. Like what would I just be the most proud of? And one of the most heralded shelves for any designer to get on is a shelf at the design store, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Huge, huge. I mean there's legends are there like you can get IEM stuff, you can get George Nelson stuff, you can get like the greats of the greats, right. Along with modern things of course. And so I set my goal. I'm like, I'm going to figure out how to get crit buns into the Moma store. And after two years of just not giving up, I finally got my first order for Moma. I will never forget that phone call.

Speaker 1:          01:38:06       Okay. Now you are clearly gifted or you've developed and cultivated gifts with art and design. You've also had a lot of practice pitching right through good and bad, experiencing rejection and acceptance. So what, what got you the acceptance

Speaker 4:          01:38:30       and what was the, what was the, what was the, what was the pitch? What was the process? At a certain point I think they realized I wasn't going to going to go away. And you're like, all right, let's just, just easier to let this guy, he knows. I never, I never asked him, but the product that I'm stolen out of their store. Did you sell? Did you sent people there to buy them? I didn't have to, but I remember going, I definitely made a trip down to New York after I shipped him the order and I walked in and there it was in the shelf for the moment. I took a picture and I just thought like, wow, like this seemed if you, if you, if I had told myself three years earlier that I would have made a product that would be on the shelf of the Moma store, I would have said you're crazy. Like, that's impossible.

Speaker 1:          01:39:10       So what gave you the, the Chutzpah to pursue it for two years? And was it the fact that you'd, I think it was just so many impossibles that you'd prove impossible yourself? Was it something else?

Speaker 4:          01:39:28       It was just wanting to experience it. That feeling like what I imagined it might feel like if I were to ever accomplish something that was so, it's such a stretch goal for me. Um, I don't know, like I just the dough off the relationship with the buyer at the time. And I think that just evolved into an order eventually in, um, you know, at that point like, wow, what was next, right.

Speaker 1:          01:39:52       Was that, now I'm going to prompt one thing because it just popped into my head. Was Moma before or after? I want to say trade show in Japan. It was before. It was before. Yes. We can't, I only remember bits and pieces of this, but can you describe? Yes. Japan.

Speaker 4:          01:40:14       So the product ended up taking me around the world and this was still for colleges? Well, no, I mean this is for any kind of gift fair or any kind of event where there's other designers selling their things. So I got connected with this website called design boom.com, one of the biggest design blogs in the world. And they had this thing called the gift, the Gift Mart. Um, and they basically would invite designers from around the world to come sell their things at these big design week events where it'd be really hard to afford access to it as an independent young designer. They would kind of create that opportunity for you, pay for the booth where they actually have the entire span of small fee to pay, but nothing like the actual costs. And so they subsidize it to make it possible. And so I got involved in that and it took me all over the place.

Speaker 4:          01:40:59       I traveled Sydney, Australia where I sold the cushion. Um, I traveled to New York and I traveled to Tokyo for design week one year. And this was fascinating because I got to experience what it was like to sell the cushion in person to directly to consumers. It's one thing to sell to a store manager than it is to sell to actual customer. Very different. The other thing was [inaudible] has these events where the alumni can come together and sell their creations with its ceramics or furniture products. And so at this point I had figured out after hundreds of interactions with people face to face, you know, I designed my stand with the cushions and a big sign said CritBuns, you know, supporting creativity where others can't.

Speaker 4:          01:41:47       And um, I actually have seen it so many times at this point. I was able to break the sales process down into five steps. There were five stages to the crip on sales process. The first stage is what I call the, what the hell is that stage where people are walking by and they do this doubletake and they look at it and they're like, what is that? But the shape and the color is interesting enough to draw them in. And so then they get to stage two, which is called the touch and feel phase. They grabbed the product off the stand, they squeeze it, they realize it's soft. The first smile, because also my dating process, by the way, please continue. They, they kind of get a smile on their face and they flip it over and they interstage three which is the story phase.

Speaker 4:          01:42:36       So on the back of the package, I tell them the story, you know, in a couple of wines, you know how the product was concepted how has created who made it and she sees him reading the story, ah, and then they smile and they make the connection of why the thing is the way it is. Then they're stage four. Step number four is tried and true. I've seen this everywhere. They immediately started going like this with a cushion. They're here, they're looking around cause they want to try it out. Does it deliver what it says it's going to do? Does it make any hard surface more comfortable. So I always have a demo chair nearby for people to try it out. And so people sit down on it and as they're sitting on it, I had a chair next to them and I had s we never did them.

Speaker 4:          01:43:19       And I figured out the question to ask, I asked somebody, how do you see this fitting into your life? And what's amazing is that people told me all kinds of different uses that I never even imagined for the cushion was actually 35 different uses for it. People use it for camping trips, people take it to baseball games. Soccer moms love it for their kids. Um, pregnant women love it cause it takes pressure off your tailbone and he sit down cause it's got a dip in the middle people with sky article of it because again, the dip in the middle, it takes pressure for tailbone. I went so many uses for the thing just by asking people that question and the minute that people could connect it to something that's important in their life, there's a very high percentage that they bought it in 1999 it like it wasn't, you know, huge commitment bank breaker.

Speaker 4:          01:44:01       So that was stage four, stage five I never could have predicted. And this was really the magic of learning what, it's not only about a product but it's about a story as well. I would literally watch people buy my product. They'd stand up, they turned the next person in line. He'd say, what the Hell is that? And the person who just bought it would literally tell them verbatim the story of on the back of the package, he would sell the product for me. I would just sit back and watch this happen and I'm like, this is amazing. And I realized the power of story in that moment, that design is more than just a product. It's more than just you know, digital experience. It's that cushion is 50% foam in 50% story. It was a really valuable lesson and so I used like I learned from that every time that I went to these different events.

Speaker 4:          01:44:53       So here we are in Japan, we're in Tokyo and it's really exciting. My first time to Japan, unlike thrilled like my senses are just like overwhelmed with everything about Tokyo. And I'm at this five day design events for design week. This is back in late 2008 2007 and so I go out there with 40 cushions, which are these two giant boxes like these, they take up a lot of volume, right? And I'm like, I take those things on the plane and then I take them through the Tokyo subway system and like it's really awkward because you can't carry, you have to like drag them. And it's like, I'm like this

Speaker 1:          01:45:35       know for those people who haven't been to Tokyo, every once in a while we all encounter a subway car that has lots of space. That is not the default. Uh, particularly if you're going during any busy period, there are in fact certain stations where they have attendance. Wearing white gloves will push people into the cars so that the doors can close and it's sardines in a can. So I'm just imagining you dragging these

Speaker 4:          01:46:01       judge. I've got my big backpackers backpack. I've got these two giant cardboard boxes of 20 CritBuns each that are like heavy and awkward and trying to navigate than the narrow subway system of Tokyo. And I get to my setup at the, at the design fair and I've got this little tiny folding table to my left and Ryan all around me or other designers as part of design boom. And I'm so excited as people come walking up on day one, I started talking to them to try to tell them the story and nobody speaks English. And by the end of day one, I sold a total of zero CritBuns and we're thinking to myself, oh my God, this is, this is not good. I'm definitely not going home with 40 cushions. I need to change my strategy here because this is not going to work. The story's not translating the power of the story that works so well, has no impact here whatsoever.

Speaker 4:          01:47:01       So thankfully through the young designer next to me is Japanese and we struck up a friendship that's going to be together for the next couple of days. And I'm like, I, I'm have a problem here. I need to translate these things. She's like, well, I can help you translate if you want to make any written materials. So it designed this poster overnight, this giant poster that is all in Japanese with pictures of CritBuns. Um, I had a picture of a stadium seat with an Arrow pointing to it and you know, stadium seat seating in Japanese and then, um, and somebody kneeling in a garden, um, I had somebody meditating on it and um, she was so kind that to translate for me. I ran to Kinkos at night, got it printed in downtown Tokyo. Uh, and the next day I had this beautiful poster that did all the explanation and had demo chair printed out in Japanese on the demo chair.

Speaker 4:          01:47:54       And one by one somebody actually made a sale and I was like, oh my God, okay, this is going to work. And then I had another guy who actually happened to be a [inaudible] Grad who was there just visiting. He spoke Japanese and he's like, if you will help translate, I'm happy to do this for you. So, uh, bless his heart. He was amazing. He actually would like draw people over to my little folding table with my stacks of CritBuns everywhere. And he would tell the story in Japanese and I'll never forget the last day. It was like towards the end of the day, I mean he's Sorta kind of closing down and we sold the last pair of buns and there's this picture of him and I sitting there at this empty table being like, oh my God, I can't believe he did it. So I was able to pay for my trip basically when the sale, these crit ones.

Speaker 4:          01:48:38       Um, and it was just a great lesson in like having to figure out how to translate your story beyond just, you know, English speakers in my case. Um, that, that was a role into an experience. So man, that, that project took me all over the place. I got to meet the guy who invented the foam finger. Sure. Gerald Foss, who's here in Texas, um, uh, to see if he wanted to do manufacturing at one point. Um, he'd go into his lobby and he's got like the original foam finger from the 1970s in the glass case. Right. Totally random. Um, I got to meet the late Billy Mays. Oh, infomercials. Oxyclean so I applied at one, many, many more. Hey, I'm Billy Mays. We'll cover, we're going to show you this right now. And um, there was, uh, the reality show at 1.4 inventors and people that made products, for some reason I was inspired to submit CritBuns.

Speaker 4:          01:49:37       Um, and so I flew to la when one weekend and I'm in this like lobby for the casting with all these other inventors and everybody like really stuff like we'll have stuff for cats. I feel like pet cats like running around and, and like, it's like a lot of pet stuff and there's me like in one of my best shirts holding my coupons, like really proud. And the priest comes over and they mic me up and they're like, okay, we want you to walk down that hallway and go through those double doors. And that's all they said. And so I'm like, okay. So like on my products, proud entrepreneur here, I walked down the hallways to stick dark, the lights were off this dark hallway, all he can see, he's like these two eliminated doors at the end. And I opened the doors and they're, this huge conference table is Billy Mays and one other Costar.

Speaker 4:          01:50:21       And then there's like all these cameras and all these lights pointed at you. He goes, Hey, I'm Billy. Nice. Come on in. And I sit down in the chair and suddenly among this like pitch session, it was like shark tank before shark tank. Right? Right. Like I'm having to pitch him on why my product so great. And um, it wasn't going so well until he tried it out and he like how she got up and he sat down and 40, he goes, oh yeah, that's what, this is a pretty good. And, and then they said, okay, thanks. And like I walked out, it's like, it's like blitz of like five minutes of just pitch mode and what was like getting peppered with all these questions and all these lights on you and this camera's, I did not get on the show, but it was just one of these crazy moments of like these unexpected things that this product, these experiences that this project brought me see soon. Why are you not, why are you not the the Titan of the CritBuns empire? Why did you stop? So coupons, this goes back to [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          01:51:24       I switched from being in painting to being in industrial design largely in part because I learned about Charles and ray Eames, two designers from the mid 20th century that were a couple raves. The wife, Charles is the husband and they produce design that it's legendary. It's still referenced today. It's in the, it's in the Moma and the permanent collection. It's iconic and they dedicated their lives to producing the best designed to the most people for the least price. And they were really celebrated for democratizing good design and making it accessible. I'd also add that the chair project with Garth Jones and fell in love with making things and realize that I wanted to switch from this more um, uh, creative pursuit of painting, which was more about, you know, the expression of, of ideas through that medium into the expression of ideas through industrial design, which was cool to me because you can make something objects and it can be replicated thousands, hundreds, thousands, millions of times. You could actually touch millions of people with your designs just like the Eames had. And so this was my motivation to switch into industrial design. You could use design to improve people's lives and it can be done at scale. You could touch a lot of people all at once.

Speaker 4:          01:52:44       And so [inaudible] and the industrial design department did something brilliant. Our first year in the program, they put us all in in the the school vans and they drove us out to the Rhode Island state landfill. And here we are driving through these canyons of trash. Like you have your faces pressed up against the bus window and you can't even see it at the top, well of the landfill for, for the state. And you get out to the top and you're, you get out of the vans and you're looking back over this just in a landscape of garbage. And for me it hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm like, wow. Like I do not want to spend my life making things that contributes to making the landfill better, bigger. That is not interesting to me. It was like a really impactful moment where I just, I started to feel a slight sense of guilt that I was now studying.

Speaker 4:          01:53:43       Um, a discipline that is about making more stuff and so it really kicked off this enthusiasm or consciousness around how do you make stuff that's environmentally considered cradle the cradle cradle to cradle. Yeah. I build Mcdonald's book, which was also came in around this time was hugely influential. National capitalism kind of came around in this time. These, they're starting to be this, this other way of thinking about how we consume things in the planet. And certainly I've, you feel a responsibility as a designer because you're pretty close to the origins of those things. Sometimes you don't decide the strategy of hey, we need to make this product, but you're definitely in it in the field of view of being able to decide what kind of materials to use, what's the whole life cycle of a product. And so, um, with CritBuns I actually delayed the launch of that for six months because I was trying to find a phone that was environmentally considered and I called everybody.

Speaker 4:          01:54:40       I sh I was talking to people in the Midwest making foam out of soy beans. At one point I found a woman in England who started making plastic at a bubble gum that you scrape off of the sidewalk. Um, but I couldn't find anybody that made a phone that was perfect for the product. So I decided to go forward the products and that sparked this other idea, which was, okay. Um, I've learned two things from this. A, the foam doesn't exist and be, there's wasn't even a good source to try to find the film in the first place. Right? Like Amazon was starting to really emerge at this time and it was so easy to find a book on Amazon or like content. I was like, why isn't there a site where you can find sustainable materials? I talked to some of my classmates that we had graduated this point and um, became very clear that whether you're an architecture or fashion design or package design or industrial design, there was a growing consciousness around we want to feel good about the things that we're making.

Speaker 4:          01:55:38       And so I realized I'm not a material scientist. Maybe I'm not going to invent the foam. However, I know how to make a website. So what if I started a site that would allow any designer to connect with the sources of Siena materials with his bioplastics or you know, reclaimed class or you know, organic cotton. And so a classmate and I partnered up together, but he named Matt and we created this website to help solve our own problem of having access to sustainable materials. And um, you know, the site started in, it was this combination of ecology and in intellect. So we called it, he collect and it was basically Google for sustainable materials and we'd find manufacturers around the world and we plug them into the system. And I was basically like a really high in search engine and community for people who cared about this topic.

Speaker 4:          01:56:31       So slowed down crit buns to work on this website. You know, the thing is that the, the product remained. I had figured out manufacturing abroad. Um, the [inaudible] website was up, is getting press at this point from around the world is getting blogged about I shipping orders out of my garage this at this point and moved to San Francisco. My garage became CritBuns headquarters and it got into some of the big catalogs in the u s when it was called solutions catalog. Just went out to like, I don't know, hundreds of thousands of homes. And I had these orders flowing in like my garage. I had to employ some friends to come help pack up CritBuns these orders of hundreds at a time. It was insane. Um, great learning experience and um, you know, in fact him something

Speaker 1:          01:57:17       Brock for you today. You kidding? Have the original pair. Oh my God. [inaudible] for you, my friend. Amazing. This is incredible. Thank you so much. Oh my God. Look at this very welcome. Critbuns a seat cushion for artists and designers for the love of the crit. And then on the back we've got buns TM. These buns approved for use on hard surfaces.

I can see how the chairs already pretty soft, but it is already pretty soft. I think I'll, I will save this for my traveling hard surface experiences. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          01:59:19       You're very welcome. So Crippen's sorta is slowing down but um, it's funny. Every so often I still get an order. I still get down to the garage still still. I still pack it up and ship it out and you know, life's changed quite a bit since then, but it's, it's a great reminder for me of like those early days and I have just hustling. I was trying to get stuff done of like the enthusiasm and the exuberance of, of bringing an idea to life. Like it was a rush.

Speaker 1:          01:59:53       And then you go from physical to digital. What did you learn from the he collect

Speaker 4:          02:00:01       experience? Well, equal like launched at a time, and this might be hard to understand now, but if you go back 10 plus years around 2007 web 2.0 it's happening on the Internet and revenue is not cool. Right? It's crazy thing. The new economy. Webster point in our revenue was a cool eyeballs, bought some cool traffic, was great, but the revenue didn't matter. And so unfortunately we subscribed to that as well with equal act and our service is free and um, we didn't make any money on it. We bootstrapped the whole thing and never took investment on it. And the one thing that we did innovate on that actually did make money for us is we call it the green box. The green box was basically like a physical magazine that we shipped out on a quarterly basis that allowed people to build an actual materials library for themselves.

Speaker 4:          02:00:53       So we sip ship actual samples with these beautifully designed placards that gave you all the information about it with a special integrative hook. So you can imagine a whole wall of materials that you'd have in your design studio or your design team in house or consultancy, whatever. The thing was that even at design school for materials, our brain and that did all right, except it was so laborious. I'd be down in the garage, like zip tying things together and have design all these cards. And then get the stickers and then like it just, it took way too long versus on how much we made. Um, and so around this time I also have a day job. What's Your Day job? My Day job was I got a fellowship, um, from a book publisher called Chronical Books. Yes. And they had a fellowship, which is a six month program for recent graduates.

Speaker 4:          02:01:41       Typically for graphic designers, they introduced one for industrial designers. I'm thinking, oh my God, this is perfect. I've got a graphic design background as well. Conoco makes beautiful, beautiful books. They're books are like objects, right. They really, what I learned there was a about the importance of detail and craft. Now by fellowship, I mean that sounds like you're given a stipend to pursue your art, but are you also, it was like a glorified intern, glorified intern guy. Much more attractive when you call a fellowship. It is much more desirable and it worked. And I got that role for six months and um, had a great time there. Um, really got to work a long sentence and worldclass graphic designers. So that's how you're paying the bills. While you're offering this free service. And um, I eventually get in a full time offer to take it.

Speaker 4:          02:02:32       And so I'm there doing industrial design work, working on, on packaging for, for high end books. So they did the book for George Lucas and star wars and I got to design the, you know, the really high end case of this book was huge. We'd like, you know, it was like 20 pounds. It's like one of those really thick coffee table books. Did the package for Hugh Hefner. He did a book on the centerfolds every center fold since 1954 I believe, starting with Marilyn Monroe. And so I got to design this custom leather briefcase that this book came in with the blind and boss of the, um, the playboy bunny on the front. Anyway, there's a lot of cool projects there, but at certain point equal collected was growing and I realized it needed my full time efforts. And so I made a decision. I said, you know, um, I need to either stick with this job, which is getting very comfortable at that time, or I need to take this plunge insert to really doing the startup full time.

Speaker 4:          02:03:27       And so, um, I quit my job since 2007, 2008 [inaudible] job equal x and CritBuns full time. And around this time the rent goes up in her apartment and it's around this time that my former classmate, Brian Chesky museum with me, you'd be my roommate and this is for shadowing another major event in my life, but we won't get there just yet. All right. Um, so make this plunge of stepping into equal act and CritBuns. Now all of this, while I'm now living in San Francisco and the thing is since high school, since the first.com when I was living in Atlanta, I would come home every day and I would be enthralled at the stories that I was reading about of all these Internet companies that were starting. You had, um, you know, Ebay and Amazon and Yahoo and excite.com and Lycos and like there was so much entrepreneurial spirit and I had this, I had the sense that one day I wanted to run my own thing.

Speaker 4:          02:04:35       I didn't know what was going to be maybe as a gallery or something, who knows if it was like what kind of business it would be. It's a chronicle was my path out to San Francisco, which is where I always wanted to be because the first.com all paths lead back to the, to the bay area. Oh for sure. Right. And I'm like, well that seems to be the place to go if you want to get it off the ground. And so I finally move out there. I bring crit buns with me. I bring the equalize concept with me and I'm living in San Francisco and during [inaudible] I had this, this radar on in the back of my mind that people that I met with, friends that I made, I sort of like trying to find somebody else who had similar aspirations that I did. Somebody else who may want to co found something with me in the future one day and I can be a partner in a business of some kind.

Speaker 4:          02:05:25       And so at the end of [inaudible] there were very short list of people that I felt I would just absolutely love to start something with. The guy at the top of the list was this guy named Brian Chesky. We got to know each other through sports on campus because I ran the basketball team, he ran the hockey team. So we got to know each other via sports. And there was one project that we had together in industrial design were um, it was for a client in the haircare space and we got to reinvent haircare products like blow dryers and curling irons. And for the final presentation, Brian and I went in with this team and our concepts were so wildly different than everybody else's that I remember looking at him being like, wow, like this guy, when we're in a room together, we can do really creative things.

Speaker 4:          02:06:13       And as the year went on and before we graduated, I just had this growing feeling that like, there's something special about this guy. He knew how to rally people together. He knew how to get them excited. Uh, he had his own project around fitness that he got people to volunteer their time to help do design on and marketing on. And I just remember being really inspired by him. And it's the night before graduation, he's about to move to Los Angeles. I'm about to, you know, um, I was gonna stay in providence to work on crit buns and I decided to invite him out to dinner to tell him how I feel about this. And so over a slice of pizza on Thayer street. I tell him, and Brian, I go, Brian, I just want you to know, I think we're going to start a company one day. I think they're gonna write a book about it.

Speaker 4:          02:07:00       And he kind of laughed it off, Huh? Yeah, yeah. And um, he ends up going to Los Angeles. I ended up finding my way to San Francisco via chronicle books and very quickly, once I'm in San Francisco, recognize that it is in fact an epicenter for entrepreneurship. There's so much activity going on around me. Web 2.0 is like the web is back and I'm start calling them like, Brian, I know what's going on in la, but you gotta get up here. Like there's so much activity, so much action happening here. And he's like, yeah, yeah, I got some stuff going and like this one on for at least a year of trying to recruit him to get up to San Francisco. And so at a certain point, the roommates that I was living with moved out and I'm left with this three bedroom apartment and I call him like, Brian, I've got a room available.

Speaker 4:          02:07:45       It's now or never, if you're going to move, this is the perfect window to come up here. I've got a room waiting for you with your name on it and have to give him a lot of credit. He made a courageous move. He quit his job, he packed his life into his Honda Civic. And he drove from Los Angeles to San Francisco, became a roommate, asks, sorry Tim. There was this incredible excitement in the air. Like it's like the band is back together. All right, what are we going to do? Like what could we possibly create together? And this is the same week that I quit my job at chronicle. I've got CritBuns and he collected in the background. We're going to come up with something big together. Uh, Brian and I, and that's when I opened the mail. One day, that same week he arrives as a letter from my landlord and it says, Dear Joe, your rent is now 25% higher.

Speaker 4:          02:08:38       And I run to my online bank account and I see that, um, I should not have enough money in the bank because I have no paychecks coming in to make rents. Brian has the same problem and suddenly our backs are against the wall. This is like this dark, stormy cloud that forms of her apartment. All the enthusiasm's gone. Now it's just terror and fear. How are we not going to get evicted next month? We need to make the rent check. And that's what I'm sitting in my living room. One day that week I've got my laptop open and I'm looking at the website for a design conference for industrial designers coming to San Francisco, you know, two weeks later and it says in big red letters, hotels are sold out in San Francisco. I'm thinking, Oh man, what a bummer for somebody who wants to come last minute. They've got nowhere to stay.

Speaker 4:          02:09:19       And I glance over the top of the laptop screen into the vast space of the living room and start to think, what if I pull my air bed out of the closet and blowed up on the four? We could host a designer for less than the cost of hotel and maybe make some money to make our rent check. So email Brian, and he loves the idea. We actually get to more airbeds and we start to think through this experience. What if we offered airport pickup? What if we gave them a map to San Francisco in a bart pass at subway and we cooked them breakfast in the morning. And so we created this concept called the air bed and breakfast.

Speaker 4:          02:10:04       We made a website, air bed and breakfast.com it was four pages, pictures of us pictures of their beds. We talked about the neighborhood and we were so proud of her website except who the hell on earth knew who to go to? Air Bed and breakfast. Not exactly a high volume search term. Right. So one night we realized that we have a marketing problem. The conferences coming up pretty quick, I mean you get the word out. So we email the design blogs, the top design blogs that were covering the conference and neither of us had really been on design blogs before other than equal act and crit buns and it was kind of a hail Mary. We just sent these emails out to like press tips at [inaudible] dot com the next morning we came down, we opened our computers and Tim, it felt like Christmas there. We were at the top of the design blogs with headlines like need a place for the conference this weekend crash with Joe and Brian and there's some a loft.

Speaker 4:          02:11:02       Amazing networking. Your jam jam is on an air bed and breakfast. And this idea that we had a week or two earlier was now being blogged about to the world in the design community. And so they responded. We had emails from all over the world, from Brazil, from England, from Japan, of people dying to have one of these airbeds in our living room. People started sending us their linkedin profiles and this design portfolios and the resumes being like, I was trying to convince us to pick them to be one of the lucky three guests. Amazing. At one point, my phone rings with an area code that was unfamiliar. I didn't answer it. Suddenly have a voicemail, I'm listening to the voicemail and it's this guide named a mole who's telling me he's going, my name's mole. And I just saw the air bed and breakfast concept and I have to stay with you guys, call me back.

Speaker 4:          02:11:50       Uh, I, I have to stay at the air bed and breakfast. Here's my phone number. And then in my inbox I've got like two emails from this guy. I'm like, how did he find me information? Um, so I called him back and he sends his design portfolio checks out. He's a Grad student at Arizona State University studying industrial design and he becomes our first guests and then we accept two other people. One woman named Kat and another gentleman named Michael. All were over the age of 30 cat was a single soul traveler from Boston. Michael was a 45 year old husband and father of five from Utah and there was all this excitement when the guests arrive. It's like, you know, we made sure the bed, the air beds were properly inflated. There was a mint on the pillow. Like we cleaned the place up in advance, we stock the fridge with Oj and bagels and you know, fresh eggs.

Speaker 4:          02:12:43       And we had everything ready to go as to tell you Tim, the next couple of nights were just some of the most exciting cause this thing unfolded that we didn't expect, which is that, yeah, we made some money on it, but more than that week we became friends with them and we really get to show them San Francisco through the lens of, of us through our favorite things to do, our favorite places to eat. Imagine the difference of this yard, a conference, and at the end of the day you can retire by herself to a hotel room that maybe is so much generic or lacks and general personality or why they came back to our apartment, which was lively. We're cooking dinner together. We're sharing stories from our days at the conference. It was like night and day for them and they had such a good experience. We took her to her friend's house parties after the conference some nights.

Speaker 4:          02:13:36       We took them to the best burritos in the mission district to the farmer's market at the ferry building one morning. And, um, at one point we gave during great place to take visitors very building. There was a Pechakucha talk during the conference, Eric, who's a Woah at what chocolate you, it's that, it's that format where you have 20 slides in like four minutes I've right. And so I just moved and you got to give a quick presentation and so we gave a presentation about air bed and breakfast in the moment that we're hosting people in air bed and breakfast and we had our guests up there with us and talked about this concept that came together, you know, two weeks ago is now actually unfolding in front of us right now. And it was just like really met a moment where the guests are now part of the presentation about themselves and it was totally insane.

Speaker 4:          02:14:25       Let's step five of the CritBuns Aka airbnb sales process. You're the story. So I'll never forget when saying goodbye to them. The door click closed and I look at Brian and I'm like, did we just get paid to make friends? And that Tim is when the gears began to turn, maybe there were other people like us who would also enjoy sharing their extra space with people coming to their town and want who want a local experience. And so we told my previous roommate Nate, who I found on craigslist, he was a computer science graduate from Harvard who when he moved out, Brian moved into his room. And now Nate story with him is we lived together for a couple of months and at night we come home from our day jobs and we were working on our own projects in the living room. I was working on CritBuns. Nate was working on his own startups and it was remarkable.

Speaker 4:          02:15:22       I'm looking over my shoulder thing and wow, this guy loves to work. We have similar work ethics. And I'm like, if I ever need a computer programmer, I'm going to call a neat little did I know that Nate was thinking the same thing about me. Pretty designer McAllen, Joe. So Nate moves out, Brian moves in and after this one weekend, um, yeah, a couple months actually passed and we didn't move on the concepts. We went home for new year's that year. This is 2007 so it happened in October. We go home for new years in, in 2007 and in their invariably people ask you, hey, how's it going? What are you working on? What's going on in San Francisco? Um, and like were entrepreneurs and they go, great, what are you entrepreneurial? And I didn't really have a lot going on. Coupons is kind of their eclipse kind of, you know, uh, struggling along.

Speaker 4:          02:16:15       Um, there's no funding at this point. But I did tell people about this crazy weekend where he had these three guests on airbeds in our apartment and it was remarkable what happened next. People either leaned in and he went, oh my God, that's amazing. I would love to travel and stay with the vocal. And the other half of the people went, oh my God, you're crazy. You had a stranger in your home. What were you thinking? And this lake visceral reaction that the cause people in these conversations was like, wow, like this really gets people fired up and either direction, maybe there's something here. It's a Brian. And we come back in January. Brian comes back, he's from New York, upstate. He comes back and um, we sh we had similar experiences. He's like, yeah, I told people about it. Any of that loved it or hated it.

Speaker 4:          02:17:04       And we're like, yeah, like maybe we should, maybe this is the idea that we should expand on. So we're like, okay, we know we need a real programmer. So I'm like, well, I'm going to call an Natan. So get a drink with Nate. I tell him about this crazy weekend with these three guests. Nate loves the idea. He's like, wait, we can use the Internet to get people offline back into the real world with each other. It's like, I would love to spend my time on this. So at this point we think the big opportunity is a website for conferences, for people to sleep on airbeds and living rooms. This, it turns out as a very narrow market. We did not know this at the time. So our logical next step is what's the next big conference coming up? We're hotels will sell out. Well, it turns out that right here in Austin, every march, it was quite a large conference called south by southwest.

Speaker 4:          02:17:58       It also happens to be the place where some preeminent tech companies went to launch and took off like rocket ships, including four square and Twitter and some others. What year was this? 2008. It's, we're like, we're going to build the next version for south by southwest and this going to take off just like the others. So Nate hunkers down with us, we start to code out of the next more robust version of the site becomes more than just four pages and we pull all nighters for like two weeks. And we watched Justin time for south by South West and all this excitement, all of this energy. Tim, we've got a total of five hosts, two reservations. I'm no mathematician, but that ratio doesn't sound favorable. Well, one of the reservations was us.

Speaker 4:          02:18:50       It's actually Brian. Um, and, um, Brian stayed with this guy here in Austin, Mtn Dung and he had everything laid out and he had the pillow and the towels and the men's and some like, um, some soup cooking in the background. And he's a great host, right? He's taken really seriously here at this time. Like [inaudible] it was just a classified service. Right. And you came and you paid somebody on a rival and Brian, um, Brian tells the story that he forgot to go to the ATM machine and so he gets there and he goes through the whole night and wakes up the next day and the host has to awkwardly ask him, by the way, where's my money? And runs like, oh no, shoot, I forgot. I'll go to the ATM today. Brian Forgot to go to the ATM. Another night goes by this point. The host is like, what kind of joke is this?

Speaker 4:          02:19:48       These guys just make a website to freeload accommodations when they travel. And so, um, Brian eventually got to the ATM and paid him, but he said that experience was incredibly awkward. Paint somebody cash and person inside their home as like just not a great experience. So afterwards, you know, it was not a successful launch whatsoever. I think we got one mentioned on Mashable, like it was dismal and we debrief on the whole thing and we, we realized two things because we are getting emails from people who are like, Hey, I want to stay in a home but there's no conference in the city. How do I use your service? And so we realized something, well maybe this is more than a conference website made. This is just a travel website. And what if we got rid of the awkwardness of payments in person and allowed people to pay with a credit card in advance online?

Speaker 4:          02:20:41       And we just removed that whole awkwardness from the customer experience. And in doing so, we're like, wait, if we did the trans, the transaction line, we could take a small transaction fee and a business model was born. Um, and so at this point, uh, Nate needed a little bit more enthusiasm to get back involved in, in, in the, in the concept. Um, uh, of the three of us, we all balance each other out really well. Nate's the pragmatist of all three of us. So he, you know, helps ground us in reality and, and progress and shipping things. Well. Sometimes Brian and I can be, have her head in the clouds and, and, and really dream, um, it's a perfect balance. And, uh, Nate needs some convincing that this can actually work. So in the summer of 2008, we realized that we could use some kind of event to give this thing a spark for this thing to take off.

Speaker 4:          02:21:36       And if you remember back in 2008 when everybody was talking about, especially in the summertime, the year of a presidential election, John McCain versus Barack Obama and Obama was attracting these historic record breaking crowds. He spoke in Portland to 75,000 people. And it was identified in June that the DNC, the Democratic National Convention later that August, um, there was going to be a bit of a problem because they moved the venue from the basketball arena of 20,000 seats to Invesco Stadium, which had 100,000 seats to attract more people to come to Denver to see Obama speak. Therein lies a problem with the amount of housing that exists in Denver. They have 20,000 hotel rooms. Most of them were already taken up by delegates. And the headwind started to read housing crisis in pending on Denver. The mayor started holding pressure press conferences to say he might open the city parks for people to pitch tents cause there was nowhere to sleep.

Speaker 4:          02:22:41       So we recognize and say, wait, what if we relaunched in time for the DNC so we can ride the coattails of all this press to gain awareness for our, the next iteration of, of air, bed and breakfast. So Nate love the idea, we hunker down, we spend the summer rebuilding the site with online payments and the ability to travel anywhere at anytime. So this was the carrot for Nate, was Nate needed to know that there was some reliable, you know, mechanism to create awareness on the horizon because to build a marketplace without any awareness is like, you know, the difficult civil, the least difficult to say the least. Um, so we hit the ground in Denver. We, I remember we built a website, this shiny new version of air bed and breakfast and began on the phone with press trying to pitch them like we had no idea what we were doing.

Speaker 4:          02:23:30       I'm on the phone with ca like CNN and they basically hang up on me, but I've experienced with that from some other projects in the past. Um, so I'm like, I'm just gonna keep going. And sw scared. Plus WC goes, I'm all beautiful memory. So what we learned, what will we started to do is actually contact a local bloggers in Denver. Like CNN is not gonna answer a call, but a local blogger loved the story because it was of their neighborhoods. And, um, it was very human oriented of Denver residents opening their homes to support other fellow Obama supporters. Um, and so these blogs would write about it and it turns out that's where like the newspapers look for story ideas. So in the newspapers wrote about him and turns out that's where the local TV broadcast, it looks for story ideas. So then we get a call from NBC local affiliate and when NBC does a story CBS and ABC short we follow.

Speaker 4:          02:24:24       So then we've got the Denver press covered. It turns out that's what the boulder press looks to you for story ideas and be started to become a regional story and turns out when you have regional story, that's what CNN looks to you for story ideas. So within a matter of about two to three weeks, we went from zero listings in Denver to 800 people sharing their homes just to this awareness through press. Again, we had no money like there was, we could hire like a PR firm, we can like go buy online ads. Like this is all just word of mouth, like the press talking about us. And then we get the call from CNN and there was this funny moment where Brian and I are doing a live interview in her living room on a laptop through like Skype or something. And we have, we're sharing like earbuds, what it looked like were conjoined to each other because they're sitting so close and we're doing this live interview with this Guy Errol Barnett on CNN and talking about this website and what it means to people to be able to stay in a home, uh, for anybody going to the DNC.

Speaker 4:          02:25:23       And it was, and then when he'd have a CNN story, that's what international press look to, to create stories. Then Lamond picks us up and the Guardian, um, and press out in Europe. And it's just amazing to see what happens when an idea or a story starts at the smallest nugget and works its way up this chain, right, to becoming an international story in a matter of three or so weeks. Amazing. You know, I have to give credit to, um, to Seth Goden because I remember during Crippen's I read his book, all marketers are liars. And I remember something that he says in there, which I never forgot, which is to make something people want to talk about. Right. It's like purple cow. It's like make something that's distinct enough that people want to talk about it and it's differentiated enough. And I feel like that concept was imbued into like the early days of the company, certainly decrypt buns and he collected and definitely to air bed and breakfast at the time. And certainly if I watched it happen in front of me making something that people want to talk about, go from a local Denver blogger story to international

Speaker 1:          02:26:31       press soon as it, is it safe to say, would you consider that the, the first or one of the first major successful milestones for urban breakfast? Yes, because we had um, a few hundred people staying on the site that weekend, including us. We got to go to Denver. So Nate was busy. Hey, Nate was really busy so we had divide responsibilities. It's just three of us needs to do in all the coding. Brian's handling all the press and I'm handling all the design and the customer service. So let me hit pause and let me ask you, would it make sense? And we can, we can certainly decide on the fly here, but we've got about probably like close to three hours. Would it make sense to have this be part one and then follow up with a part two? Oh, what do you think of that? We don't have to, we don't have to, but we could. What are your thoughts? Um, I'm open to it and recorded another time. Yeah. I'm just thinking like, this is totally, yeah. We, let's get people on a cliff hanger. This is, I think this is a good cliffhanger. Okay. So then I'll say, yeah. Okay. Go. No, no, no, no, no. Go for it. Yeah. I mean, because this like, this deserves around too. So, so we had it.

Speaker 4:          02:27:41       It's, we had a few hundred people actually using the service. Brian and I split up responsibilities. Nate doing doings, coding, Brian's Zuni held the press. I'm doing all the customer service from my cell phone

Speaker 1:          02:27:52       and we have this incredible weekend

Speaker 4:          02:27:54       where our marketplace is working. But you won't imagine what happens next.

Speaker 1:          02:27:59       Ooh. dot.dot. Okay. Amazing. No, this is perfect. This is absolutely perfect. Uh, so to be continued, uh, in the meantime, as sort of a, a temporary, uh, tie of, of part one, is there anything that you would like people to take from this, this first chronology that we've walked people through? Any ask of the audience or recommendation, suggestion, uh, that you would like parting words of any type?

Speaker 4:          02:28:43       I think anytime that you introduce a new idea into the world, there's, there's bound to be somebody or many people who rejected. I think rejection is inevitable. Anytime you're trying something new. In fact, I'd say if you're not getting rejected, you're probably not trying to anything new. Like you're probably not even pushing hard enough on something new. And my advice would be look at rejection in a different way. That equation for me was, was just a way to reframe rejection as an opportunity to keep going, move on. And so my advice for everybody watching right now is that, you know, the gift of an entrepreneur's reframe things. And anytime there's a rejection that you face, turn it into an invitation, turn it into an invitation to keep going and you can say yes or no. You don't have to be at least create this opportunity to, to persevere, to get, to continue going forward. And for me, every, all the stories I've shared so far from the senior prank that the intercom system through decrypt buns through to the beginnings of Airbnb are reframing every know into a cool, that person didn't like it. I'm going to keep going until I find somebody that does.

Speaker 1:          02:29:50       And also something at least that I see from the outside looking in when you're sharing all of these stories and experiences is that you are also over time by exposing yourself to rejection and reframing, learning to in some way seek out discomfort as opposed to avoid discomfort and that that's one thing that also comes up for me. And on top of that, the fact that and why I, I'm so excited that we were able to get together to talk about some of these many of these stories just of course, just a, a portion of your many life experiences is that people are already familiar at this point with Arab air BNB and all caps, right. Magazine covers, uh, one of the most successful startups in the world, uh, one of the fastest growing startups of all time, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. And I think it's, it's easy because as humans we want to take shortcuts and create stories that are easily graspable to think of that as idea, execute success. I didn't like it. It just came out of the balloon was this overnight success. But there's so much contributing to that and so many diverse experiences that yes, you had, but in some ways you also help to engineer. And, uh, I think that's inspiring to know that it wasn't, it wasn't the byproduct of this immaculate master plan that required you to be Elan Musk times 10, that you executed over two week period and then you have an empire. No, that's not, that's not how it unfolds it all

Speaker 4:          02:31:36       a people think we woke up in Airbnb was just created out of thin air that couldn't be further from the truth. And I hope if any, there's any takeaway from the stories that we've talked about today is that there's just a long lineage of trying things, bumping into walls, getting rejected, like failing, reframing, failure until learning and trying to continue forward. And so by the time airbnb came around, it was like I'd been in the gym of entrepreneurship for many years. So it's like you don't wake up and just run a marathon all of a sudden that no does that. You train for it. And so by the time it's ready for race day, your body's conditioned for it and your muscles and your system, your nervous, like everything's ready for you to go run 26 plus miles. And I think entrepreneurs that entrepreneurship is the exact same way.

Speaker 4:          02:32:26       And I think it's a misconception when people look at the magazine covers and they read the stories of a successful company, they think, wow, like the people that started that, it just, they built it and everybody came that couldn't be further from the truth. And like I think feel the dreams is probably the worst movie ever happened. Entrepreneurship because it created this idea like, oh wow, if you build it, they will come. I can tell you if you build it, they don't come. Um, and it, it, it takes us incredible perseverance and sometimes irrational belief in yourself to bring something to life in the face of a lot of diversity. And a lot of people saying it can't happen. Um, and so I hope if there's any takeaway from the stories that I shared today, it's that the simple act of spotting an opportunity, coming up with the original solution and then taking that third but hardest step of putting something into the world of trying something to putting your idea into practice. It doesn't have to be the big idea. It's just about being in the gym and doing a Rep, the gym of entrepreneurship, you're doing like a curls or something like it's just getting in the habit of those three things. You spot an opportunity, you come up with a regional solution and you put your idea into the world and the more you can do that, the better you are at spotting the next opportunity. And airbnb just happened to be a part of the lineage of all the things I've told you that happened before it.

Speaker 1:          02:33:48       So can you lay out the equation one more time and what each letter stands for?

Speaker 4:          02:33:55       Absolutely. Sw squared plus WC equals emo. And what the stands for is that when you introduce a new idea to the world, some will love it. Some Malt plus who cares equals move on. Keep going until you find the people that do love your idea.

Speaker 1:          02:34:20       All Right, Gel. Amazing. Where can people say hi to you online, find you, where can they learn more about the company and anything else that you might want to mention?
