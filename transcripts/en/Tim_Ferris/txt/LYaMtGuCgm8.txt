Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hello, you sexy people out there. This is Tim Ferriss and this episode of the Tim Ferriss podcast has a very special guest, Josh Waitzkin, whom I met in 2007 after reading his spectacular book, the art of learning. Josh, you may know from searching for Bobby Fisher, he was the subject of both the book and the movie he's thought of as a chess prodigy. Although that term prodigy I don't believe applies to him well at all because he has a method for learning, mastering, refining any skill, whether that is chess, whether that is Tai Chi in which he's multiple time world champion Brazilian Jujitsu in which he's a black belt under the phenom, the Michael Jordan of the sport Marcella Garcia and he's worked with people ranging from mark [inaudible] six time Stanley Cup winner to cal Ripken Jr to the top hedge fund managers in the world. He is a performance specialist and also very dear friend of mine now at this point and I ended up loving his book, the art of learning so much that I acquired the rights to his audio book. If you want to find that it's read by Josh himself and a you can just go to for our blog for h o U R B l o g.com and search for Tim Ferriss book club or go to Google and do the same. So without further ado, let's get straight to the meat of the interview. I hope you enjoy it.

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       Optimal. And then my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue. So Josh, I figured we might as well start

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       at the top and do a little retrospective. What led you initially to write the art of learning? And of course that's how I was in many ways introduced to your work and then through our mutual friend Max ended up connecting. But what was the, what was the reason you decided to write that book?

Speaker 3:          00:02:12       Um, so I transitioned into meditating and just studying East Asian philosophy and then I started getting into each one and ultimately into the Marshall application of it, pushed him and I started to experience this very interesting transition from, from the principals my level. And Chester's began to translate directly over into the martial arts. And I think, I think it was primarily one experience I had, but it was something around two years into my tattoo training, I was giving a simultaneous chest exhibition in Memphis, Tennessee at a fundraiser razor for muscular dystrophy and I was playing 45 or 50 boards at once. I was at someone walking down the middle of this big square of chess. Paypal's everyone's playing one game. I'm playing each of them and about 40 minutes into the Simon I had this experience that was so interesting. I began to feel like I was riding the energetic wave of the game.

Speaker 3:          00:03:01       Like I was in my push hands training. I wasn't playing chess, I wasn't thinking in chest language, I wasn't calculating variations. I was feeling the flow, filling the space behind, like they wouldn't have martial arts. And I had this realization, you know, I was playing beautiful chess, but I wasn't consciously playing chess. But the barriers between these two different or to dissolve in my mind and that's when I started to conceive of the idea of the book and a lot of the process of I spent five years taking notes, me four, 500 pages of notes in the book before I actually sat down and wrote it. And a lot of that process was deconstructing what I'd been doing rather intuitively. Um, so essentially what it felt like before his translation of parallel learning. These are two rather abstract terms of that's the language that I was using internally when I was first thinking about the book because it felt like I was just taking the essence of one art and translate it over into another. And in the process of writing it involved, deconstructing what I'd been doing, um, somewhat abstractly and is something that can be replicated more systematically.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       Simon, you 10, 20, 30, 40 boards simultaneously. I'll try to ask a better question then. How does someone do that? But at what point, what happens to a chess player when they go from an inability to play multiple boards simultaneously to being able to play multiple boards simultaneously? What is the sort of framework or thinking or, or, or experience and so in bolts up that allows them to do something like that, which to the average person seems like a rain man, like feet

Speaker 3:          00:04:38       know. I think it's different for every chess player. I mean, one of the beautiful things about chess is that you can approach it so many different ways and to be world class, what you need to do essentially is expressed the core of your being through the art. I think that's just, this is true of many arts and that's probably something that we'll get into more deeply. Um, so you can have a very mathematical person who plays chess. Mathematically, you can have a very musical person who plays chess music. Someone might be much more kinesthetic like myself and sort of a feeling for flow and hidden harmonies and, and almost a physically energetic relationship to chest. Um, when I first learned to play chess when I was six years old in Washington square park, it was, it was a battle. I love the feeling of, of the, of just going to into a fight with someone and finding these hidden harmonies and finding where these animal pet passions and mixed with this technical complexity.

Speaker 3:          00:05:27       And when I get late much later when I got much better playing Simos um, it was sort of a higher level manifestation of that same kind of dynamic. I mean for me playing Simos was something akin to juggling a lot of balls and, and all of the, to each chest. I wasn't playing 40 different games for example, separately, the flow of all 40 games would sort of coalesce into one larger sense of flow. And it was actually really interesting whenever, as often when I give a Simon and there'd be a youth competition and the winners of the youth competition would play against me. And so sometimes kids would would cheats, they'd really want to be and these two they would sheets. I've, you're walking around this big thing. And then I get to the table and it shifted the position to try to win because they're getting when it would be a big thing.

Speaker 3:          00:06:12       And my experience when that happened was as if you had, imagine you would like 40 balls up in the air and suddenly then it all crashed into the floor. And I would know that they had changed the position, not by reaching the board and remembering what the position was and then seeing they changed it. It would initially be this feeling of the energetic flow has been interrupted. Um, and then I'd have to reverse engineer myself back to that one, what one game, that one component of the flow. And then I remember the game and then I would remember exactly division had been, and then I'd say that this was the position. Um, and then would take me two or three times going back around and they get that all the balls back up in the air and they get back to the energetic flow. So actually for me, giving Simos sort of felt similar to playing chess one Cheskin. Um, but that was my own relationship to it. I think that probably if you're adding 10 different, very strong chess players that all give somewhat different answers.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       Spending time with a friend of yours when we went to Washington square park and seeing him play game at least for the first portion without looking at the board. And I'm not gonna I won't give away too much of the two. Most of the punch lines since we, uh, we captured it all on a film. It was pretty amazing. But just his ability to track the board, uh, it seemed like by chunking portions of the board into sort of larger, um, like distal pieces. I, I don't know if that's the best way to express it, but it seemed like his ability to seemingly remember all these disparate pieces was because he had it broken, the, the board broken down into sort of a component chunks as it were. But, uh, I don't want to take us to down that, that fine line. Um, let's, let's shift gears. I want to, what I'd be very curious to know is, um, you know, at this point what, what, because I know of course a little bit of the background, but, uh, I want to dig into the details. What type of people do you personally work with these days and why do they work with you? What type of things do you do with them?

Speaker 3:          00:08:18       Yeah, three major dimensions to my creative life. I guess the most important one is my son Jack, who I use it a little over two years old and loving my life. So that's maybe the most important part of my life. No question about it. Um, I run a nonprofit educational foundation and we have, um, a couple of JW foundation and the art of learning projects. Um, and we have a couple of hundred programs in schools around the country and internationally as well. And so this is integrating these principles that have been developing in, in, in schools, working with teachers, parents and children around this individualized and automatic relationship to learning and development. So this is one dimension. The other one is I own a martial arts school. Of Brazilian Jujitsu to school with um, Marcello Garcia, who's the nine time world champion. You know, I'm well Tim, he's just make really the Michael Jordan of the grappling world.

Speaker 3:          00:09:09       Um, so there's this world class athletes training there and then I run a consulting business where I'm training people who are at the cutting edge of the finance world. And this is really interesting work cause we're focusing on that last one or 0.1% of the learning process, which is really my specialty. It's highly individualized, this cutting edge work on their learning process that their idea generation, their creativity, that performance psychology, their resilience. Um, fascinating work. And you know what I discovered, it's interesting because I, I wrote this book called the art of learning years ago and so people are always coming to me to speak about learning, but much of what I've been focused on in recent years has been learning when I think, when I think about that last, that last movement, you know, from the equivalent of being say number 10 to number one in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:09:53       And number five being number one in the world. It's much more about finding subtle obstructions, finding friction points, releasing, um, identify and cognitive biases and make blocking your way. It's sort of, it's the movement towards unobstructed self expressions. Every think about about your creative process as a hose with a, with a big crimp in it. If you're released it just unbelievable pressure can be released. Um, and a lot of what I'm doing with people is trying to move them from, from very good to great or from great to truly elite, um, just deeply individualized work and helping them really find ways to express the core of their being through their art, which is, as you know, a big theme in my life from when I played chess at my highest level. That's what I was doing when I had a period of being really locked up in my check his career, which we can go into in more detail if you want. I was doing the opposite. I was trying to fit into someone else's mold. And then ultimately when I transitioned away from Chason to the martial arts, I returned to that experience of, of self expression. And that's what I really start to understand it very deeply. I think it was the crisis towards the end of my chess career, which really literally the foundation for the work that I used today with, with brilliant mental performance who are just trying to make that movement to the equivalent to a world champion.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:11:15       And you've, you've gone to war with him and I've watched you,

Speaker 1:          00:11:17       I've gone to war with him, which I, if there's anything at stake, I don't recommend

Speaker 3:          00:11:25       you guys got to be a lot of pain.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       He's a tough guy, but also a sweetheart of a guy and he's so fluid. Uh, what I'd love to hear from you, of course, because in the, the, in the art of learning, which, which some people might be familiar with the read about your experiences and chest, your experiences in Tai-chi, the parallels between them and this sort of over arching a framework for optimizing mental and physical performance, if that's a fair way to put it. Uh, which is, you know, the, the, the art of learning these different techniques and strategies. What, what have you learned through this third art or Brazilian Jujitsu? What are, what are some insights or strategies that you've had since moving from Tai Chi, which is in some ways similar but also very different from Brazilian Jujitsu, which a lot of people would be familiar with through the UFC and mixed martial arts

Speaker 3:          00:12:28       learning ends with the 2004 world championship. It ends with it. It was just absolutely hiring crazy experience. Um, I won't give the punchline but, but it was, it was really intense. And after this I just started, I decided I wanted to be a beginner, getting to put on a white belt, um, literally and figuratively. And so I took on this third major mountain in my life, preserving, you should sue. I was training out in the west coast for about a year when I was actually writing the art of learning. I was training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu twice, a twice a day. Um, this was after I'd spent five years taking notes. Then I had the 2004 worlds when I was writing it. Um, I started training with John Machado out there. Then I came back to New York. I started training with Marco Austin does here, and I started to develop this relationship with Marcello, who's just the greatest grappler to ever live.

Speaker 3:          00:13:17       And we were doing a lot of private lessons. Um, I was, we developed a friendship, then he moved to Florida and I would travel to Florida to work with him. And ultimately I made the decision, I wanted to bring him to New York mostly because I, I was at that point planning to make a run for the world championship and this art and there was no better way to do it then to get my ass kicked by the very best to ever live in the sport. And he's just a wonderful guy. Um, and he's just unbelievable martial artists. And so we opened up the school together and [inaudible] I've been on the mass with him, you know, other than when one of us has been injured and it's been a lot of injuries in these sports just all the time. And it's been a fascinating experience and more solar was so profoundly different from me. I'm a really conceptual guidance. I think abstractly, of course my foundation and chest Marcello is one of the most, well he's the most kinesthetically overdeveloped person they've ever met. And of course over development under development tend to come hand in hand conceptually. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:15       an example of that would be an example

Speaker 3:          00:14:18       of overdevelopment own development,

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       uh, of kinesthetic. What it means to be kinesthetically

Speaker 3:          00:14:24       his physical intelligence is mind boggling. And then when he'd come fishing with me, you know, you throw him on a standup paddleboard in three foot shop and everyone just flies off of paddle boards and they should just stand up on them and he's just beautiful. I'm just, you just find the balance points I've never seen one soon. Someone learn so quickly how to handle um, waves, boats, handling, fishing lines being, you know, free diving, being on riding waves on paddle boards. You know, when you, when you're in the marsh. I've been a stand up fighter for many years. I mean throwing as my core, my core when I'm doing standup training with Marcel, I caught him with most of the throws of my repertoire one time. I don't think I've ever caught him with a throw twice. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:15:09       As you were world class while I was training with, you know, I catch them thousands of times. This is a guy, he, he just, you almost never see Marcello get caught more than once with something. Um, and it's amazing to see how he relates to the world through is kinesthetic intelligence. So for example, if you're looking, when we were looking for spaces for our school, we'd walk into a big room and I be thinking about the dimensions, you know, the square footage where this would be, where that would be more so it would know if it felt good or felt bad. If he meets you, he's going to know whether he feels good about you or he feels bad about you and his intuition is incredibly dead on. But he navigates the world through this Kenneth Static intelligence. And it's been a really fascinating having the school with him and diving deep with them.

Speaker 3:          00:15:50       Um, because we've been having conceptual dialogue these three and a half years or so, and he's really deepened, um, conceptually, but I've learned even more deeply in the importance of the lesson that there are many paths to greatness. And to take a guy like Marcello and to try to fit them into a chess players, you know, hyper conceptual molds would be terrible because you'd be killing is shine. And he is so great because of his just unbelievable commitment to doing it his way. And he's done things in extraordinary ways. I mean, for example, you know how in these competitive arts, everyone's very secret about the repertoires. Yep. Um, well we have this program which you know well called Mgu inaction where people, just two guys from around the world log in to watch all of our sorrows training sessions, his sparring sessions, his lessons, everything when he was competing it not with Dobie submission, grappling world championship. And when jobs, which is the Brazilian Jujitsu world championship, we were spoiled. We were streaming is sparring sessions every night. So he was basically showing these competitors what he was about to two weeks. In three weeks, four weeks. And his attitude about this, which is completely unique, if you're studying my game, you're entering my game and I'll be better at it, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:17:04       Yeah. I'm the opposite of what most chess players would do and most of your district guys would do. And so he's wide open to constant learning and they look at, the beautiful thing about Marcello is, you know, if people call him the king of scrambles and if you watch his training style, he's always in transition, which is a really interesting idea to think about in a cross disciplinary manner because most people get their egos involved in their training and they're trying to dominate all the time and to dominate. And almost anything you find a position of dominance and you keep it. But Marcello always led to the opponent's move. And so he's constantly playing in transition. And so if you think about what worldclass martial arts means, and you brought up, for example, Merissa Ashley and it playing chess and Washington square, it's similar. If you're at a much higher level than someone, you can always seem mystical because you're things which are outside of their conceptual scheme.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       The way that operates in the martial arts is if you think about it through the lens of frames, right? If you and I are looking at a position and in your mind there's this position, this position, this position. Um, so there's three positions in my mind. If I'm constantly training at the transitions between these petitions, these actually expand in these transitional frames become positions to me. And so if I'm seeing a hundred positions when you're seeing take two, then I can play in your blind spots and they could see mystical to you because you haven't trained there. And that's what Marcella does, like spending all of his time in transition. He's cultivated the art to play in the, in between, which is really what level is all about. Um, or one of the core things that highlight the worldclass martial arts is all about playing in transition and gaps in your opponents. Syep pattern

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       just blew me away because if you look at it as an uninformed spectator or even just a moderately informed spectator, you're blown away by how fast he is, how effectively he is. But the, the nuance of sort of eliciting movement, allowing space to open manufacturing space by let's say, applying pressure and then leaving it is so subtle and so incredibly effective. I mean, then you start to notice it from these, these principles of carry over to many, many hundreds of possible, uh, positions. Let's just say. Um, it's really, yeah, it's really amazing. I mean, it reminds me of something I heard once from a musician, which was, uh, I don't know who the original quote is from, but he said that, you know, music is the space between the notes. And I was like, Huh, that's a really interesting way to look at it. Uh, but, but, but what were you gonna say?

Speaker 3:          00:19:44       I think that's just a gorgeous quote and I think that that are defined by that, that space in between.

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       Yeah. Well, it's like writing, writing is the same way, right? It's like, when in doubt, leave it out. It's just like, you know, it's uh, I think, uh, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:20:00       Beautiful, beautiful plan. Yeah, of course. It's, think about Marcello is that it can often seem initially that he's moving so fast, but what's incredible is that he can also move very slow and do things that you don't see. I'm just like a great side of sleight of hand artist who's just practicing the art of illusion when we're not practicing it. It's amazing what can be done with intention, with controlling someone's intention. Um, and this is a lot of my training and push hands related to finding ways to, to essentially control someone's intention so that you were ahead of them even if, if they were ultimately moving first. Um, you were there before they arrived. This is fascinating. Um, psychological component of really high level training in anything.

Speaker 1:          00:20:45       Well, I, uh, I remember an interview or it wasn't an interview, a window wasn't interview actually with, um, one of the top k one fighters back in the day. Yeah. Uh, and they were talking about Peter air, et cetera. If you remember the Dutch lumberjack, huge guy and he, he seemed fast. And I remember what people said. A number of opponents said, you know, he's, he's actually not that fast. He's kind of a big lumbering guy, but he's so good at predicting timing that he sees you telegraph before you even have the thought to throw the Punch and he beats you to the punch as a result of that. But it's because he's, he picks up on the cues faster than other people. And I thought that was very interesting to, uh, to try to bridge this to something else. I mean, what you work with, of course, I'm not gonna mention names, but you work with some of the most stunningly successful and famous traders and people in finance. I mean some real kind of masters of the universe type folks. What, what have you, what have you found unique about that group of people? Uh, let's, let's, let's just start with that. Um, I'm curious to know kind of what you've, what you've noticed being as observant as you are about that group of folks.

Speaker 3:          00:22:06       Oh, that's a big question.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       It is a big question.

Speaker 3:          00:22:16       I mean, each one of these guys who's really world class is doing it his way and he's harnessing that he's cultivating or his or her strengths as a way of life. Um, there's not an excessive focus on weakness. There's just an embracing of deep, deep study of the preconditions to someone's finest moments of expression and building lifestyle surrounded. And that's a lot of what I do is help people understand what makes them tick on a very, very deep level relative to, um, you know, the cognitive biases where they locked up and were there reasons has become, um, what kind of external conditions, what kind of internal conditions. And the ones who were really at the top are people who, who have mastered this art of deep introspection and taking the result of these interspective processes and turn them into training systems and into a way of life.

Speaker 3:          00:23:10       Um, and it's fascinating how, how, how the process works. And what I do with these guys is I, I, um, if after I do my initial diagnostic process, I have ways of revamping of the daily architecture, the way they live their life so that they're, for example, aligning their peak energy periods where there be creativity work. They're building lifestyles that are just relentlessly proactive, um, as opposed to reacting to inputs. They're building a daily architecture, which is based on maximizing the creative process. And if you think about this relative to most people, um, simple case in point is email checking, right? And most people when they finish a break, even, even top guys and industries, when they finish a break, whether they wake up first thing in the morning, what do most people do? They check their email when they come back from a workout, whether they check their email, when they come back from lunch ways, do they check their email?

Speaker 3:          00:24:01       And so what you see is this, whenever they're coming back from something after a break there soaking in inputs. And so they live this reactive lifestyle there. Their creative process is dominated by external noise as opposed to internal music. Um, and a lot of what I work on with guys is creating rhythms and their life that really are based on feeding the unconscious mind, which is really, which is the wellspring of creativity information. Um, and then tapping it. So for example, ending the workday with high quality focus on a certain area of complexity where you could use an insight and then waking up first thing in the morning pre input and applying your mind to it. Journaling on it. Um, not so much to do a big brainstorm but to tap what you've been working on unconsciously overnight, which of course is a principle the Hemingway wrote about when he spoke about the two core principles in his creative writing process where one ending the workday with something left to right.

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       Yup.

Speaker 3:          00:25:01       Right. So not doing everything he had to do, which most people do because they feel the sense of guilt if they're not working. Um, you and I have discussed this at length, but leaving something left to right and then waking up and then the second principle, release your mind from it. Don't think about it all night. Really let go. Have a glass of wine and wake up first thing in the morning, then reapply your mind to it. And it's amazing because you're basically feeding the mind complexity and then tapping that complexity our top and what you've done with it. And I mean this rhythm, you know, the, the, the large variation of it is overnight. Then you can do micro bursts of it throughout the day before workouts. Pose a question and do a workout, release your mind after workout, return to it, and do a creative burst before you go to the bathroom, before you go to lunch, before anything.

Speaker 3:          00:25:41       And there's a way of systematically training yourself to generate the crystallization experienced ah ha moment. That can happen once a month or once a year. A lot of what I do is work on systems to help it happen once a day or four times a day. Um, and when you're talking about guys who run by answer groups of 20 to $30 billion, for example, if they have a huge insight that can, that can have unbelievable value. And so if you can really train people to get systematic about nurture in their creative process, it's unbelievable what can happen. And most of that work relates to getting out of your own way. At a very high level. It's, it's unlearning, it's the constant practice of sure. Subtraction, reducing friction. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       you mentioned cognitive people who may not be familiar with that term, cognitive biases and how someone might work on them,

Speaker 3:          00:26:37       right? Well, there are a lot of cognitive biases that are, that are specific to certain disciplines like chess or finance or philosophy. Um, but if we just think about it in terms of everyday life, um, let's say we make a decision and we then feel the need to justify that decision. And so we make more decisions to justify that Mitchell decision. And then we basically get herself into this deep wormhole, which is caused by the attempt to justify.

Speaker 3:          00:27:08       Exactly. So this is in the financial group who were one of the world's talking about sunk cost fallacy, right? Um, but this is very interesting for, for example, a chess player who makes a certain decision and there's a certain emotional and intellectual and time component to the value we put into the thought process behind that decision. And what we often have to do is release it because the, the, the position changes shape. A very interesting way that this manifests in chest, which you can think about rather universally, is let's say that there is a certain evaluation to the position, right? You and I are playing, Tim and I have a slight advantage in the position that I'm nurturing that advantage of nurturing them nurturing and um, and a lot of complexity and make a spider. And suddenly the addition is equalized, right? So if I'm holding on to the past evaluation emotionally where I had the advantage, then what I'm going to do very subtly is I'm going to reject positions that don't give me that advantage.

Speaker 3:          00:28:01       But if that I no longer have an advantage that I'm going to be reaching too far, right? Um, and then I'm only rejecting things they should accept, which will make my position to slip more and more and more. And you fall into what I call it, downward spiral. So this relates to a lack of presence, which really connects to a cognitive bias and addiction to a past evaluation as opposed to a present one. Um, so that's a very simple example of, of a cognitive bias. Um, a mental addiction, I thought constructs something that we hold to be true because of some comp complicated twist in our mind. It's no longer actually true. And so of course a very simple antidotes, motion, most of us is presence. If we can look at a moment or chest position or an investment decision or any decision with very clean presence outside of kind of emotional inertia, um, then we can often slice through just amazing amounts of fat with just very, very simple decisions. If you think about the learning process, for example, and this is one thing that I love about your approach to learning, I language that you and I use is, you know, I call you a master of deconstruction. You look at the way people approach different sports and you find the biases, the false construct,

Speaker 1:          00:29:11       right?

Speaker 3:          00:29:12       And you find a way to learn a very straight path to learning as opposed to people getting mired and all sorts of tangled webs of complexity, which, which are, you know, essentially caused by cognitive biases, wouldn't, isn't how you'd put it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:31       I think you and I have very complimentary approaches and like you've said before, and I tend to focus on the 80 20 analysis as it, as it applies to people getting up and off the ground as quickly as possible to say, you know, top whatever, five to 10% in the general population. Whereas what's so cool about our conversations would I enjoy so much in part is that, you know, you're really focusing on that, that, that final leap. How do you go from being great to being the best? Right? And they're, they're very, they're, they're very complimentary skill sets. I think that, uh, yeah, but when I'm looking at, and this is a, is a, is a way to unearth cognitive biases. And just as a side note for people who want to look into this, you can just go to Wikipedia and search list of cognitive biases and there's, there's a long list which is pretty fun to read.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       Um, and, uh, there are a number of books about these types of things to think twice I think is another one. Um, the, the question that I ask myself, and I'm always interested in the questions that people ask themselves because I find it in to my mind that those, that internal dialog is what defines your day to day thinking and what you think you become. So it's so critical that you ask yourself the right questions. And in my mind what, or I should say, rather, when I'm trying to deconstruct, say, a sport, all I'll ask it is to start with, you know, what, what rules are people following that are not required? Right? So, you know, outside of the law and science, uh, and even within science and within law, reality's gonna negotiable. So I mean, a good instance, a of that is the high jump and, uh, the Fosbury flop.

Speaker 1:          00:31:16       So Dick Fosbury and it was really the first guy to go backwards over the high joke and up to that point there had been straddled kicks and all sorts of different approaches and he was ridiculed at first and then he was called a cheat because he won the gold medal. And now everybody uses that approach. And uh, so you know, having, uh, a list of questions, right, who's good at this, who shouldn't be is another one that I love to ask because you might find someone, for instance, you were talking about the different styles and in chess or Jujitsu or in chess, you know, as sort of a reference to your first book, uh, you know, you have attacking chessplayers, right? Then you have, you have very different stylistic differences and you've very quantitative players. Uh, and for the, for the, the TV show for the Tim Ferriss experiment, I did an episode on poker and I've avoided poker my whole life because of viewed it as a game of chance.

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       And I had a, a former computer science guy who said, no, no, no, I'm not going to teach you to be lucky because I can't teach you to be lucky. Uh, but I can teach you to run some probabilities and only bet when you have a good likelihood of a positive, a positive outcome. Right? And what what was so fascinating is you look at a guy like that and you'll find a highly quantitative, say, Hedge Fund managers for instance, or a or investors of different types, tech investors who, who go to the world series of poker and they run the numbers. That's how they play. And then there are other guys who were completely seemingly flying by the seat of their pants. I mean, they're very kinesthetic. They're playing intimidation game. They're very physical. Um, and, uh, so asking myself, for instance, who's good at this?

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       Who shouldn't be, if the assumption is you have to be very good at math to be good at poker, right? Who, who admits to using no math, which might be misinformation, but, and let me look into how they do it. And then the second question is, you have they replicated their results? Are there other people they've taught to do what they do to try to separate out the, the nature from the nurture where possible. But, uh, I want to come back to, you know, the, the finance guys just for a second and to ask you about a rituals and routines and I'm going to ask you about your own, but what are some habits, uh, and it doesn't have to be across the board with all these guys because they have such different personalities and approaches, but with some of these, uh, you know, really super high level finance guys who are managing tens of billions of dollars, what are some of the habits that you've observed that you find interesting? Uh, or rituals?

Speaker 3:          00:33:47       Let me answer that by describing some of the keystone habits that I recommend for people to internalize it and in the field. Um, what will mean first of all, meditation. I mean we're, we're speaking about this theme of cognitive biases or, or find it basically observing your mental dictions the moment that they said in meditation is as deep and as powerful a tool as, um, as I could possibly describe. I mean, it's, it's an, and maybe six or seven years ago when I was first talking about meditation with guys and the finance world, it seemed like some woo, strange thing for them to take on. Um, but as more and more people are integrating into the process, I mean, you wouldn't believe how many of the most powerful players in the world are meditating very deeply. Um, it's just an amazing way of deepening, um, deep into the creative process, deepening presence, um, expanding your energetic relationship to the world, gaining insight, um, and realizing that most of the thinking that we do basically springs from mental addiction and much of people's lives are spent in an emotional swirl, which is a reactive one.

Speaker 3:          00:34:55       And having a relationships presidents, which allows you to see through the kind of illusion of that emotional swirl or those mental addictions. I mean, meditation is an incredibly powerful tools. I know, you know, like deeply, I've been meditating since I was 1718 years old. You know, it's a big part of your life as well, Tim. So that's a very, very important habit. The idea of waking up first thing in the morning and turning your mind to creative work, pre input as opposed to checking email and getting reactive. Um, opening up your channel to the unconscious mind first. Then when you wake up in the morning doing the same, ending the workday with quality, hugely important. Uh, I remember why I went skiing with Billy Kidd, who is my recall at one of them, the Great Danielle ratios from back in the think the sixties Olympic ski team. Awesome dude.

Speaker 3:          00:35:39       Now he's, he's out in Colorado wearing a cowboy hat. Timeless guy. Brilliant Dude. And you know, he was saying to me years ago when I first skied with them, Josh, what do you think of the three most important terms of the ski run? And you know I've asked that question to a lot of people since and most people will say the middle cause it's the hardest, the beginning cause they're getting momentum really describes the three most important terms of the ski run in the last three before you got in the lift. And it's a very, very subtle point. And it, for those of you who are skiers, you know that you know, that's when the slope is leveled off. There's less challenge. Most people are very sloppy. Then they're taking the mussels off of um, they're taking the weight off the muscles. They've been using that bad form.

Speaker 3:          00:36:16       Problem with that is that on the lift ride up, unconsciously you're internalizing and bad body mechanics. As Billy points out, if you were here, last returns are precise than what you're internalizing. Lift right up his precision. So I kind of did this on to, you know, the guys who are trained in the finance world, for example, ending the workday with very high quality, which opens up for one thing. You're, you're internalizing quality overnight and were nurturing themes as well as skills, right? It's one thing to learn skills, but the hire artists to learn themes or, or Meta themes that will ultimately spontaneously opens to the amendment to the internalization of hundreds of, of what I would call local habits. Um, and, and so if you're practicing quorum or the, you're, you're deepening the muscle of quality and you're also focusing the unconscious mind them and Eric complexity, which will then tap first thing in the morning. So this is a core habit. Um, journaling certain postmortem procesees is reflecting on the, you know, doing the ending your day with a reflection on the quality of the work. Um, what are the core areas of complexity that you're, that you're wrestling with? Um, hugely important. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:37:26       if someone

Speaker 3:          00:37:32       I time at the end of the workday before the problem with doing these things and right before bed is it, then you're sort of consciously going to bed thinking about these things. At that point, I find you want to release it. So I'm in a very core idea is, you know, when you go home as best you can, unless you're red hot inspired, release your mind from the work. Um, it's very important to give your stress and recovery. Um, core habit, right? We want to be turning it on and turning it off and keep and teaching people people to turning it off is a huge part of teaching them to turn on much more intensely. And so stress and recovery workouts, interval training and meditation together, our beautiful habits to develop, to cultivate the art of turning it on and turning it off. So if you're undulating your heart rate, for example, between one 71 72, one 74 and say one 40 for the practice of lowering your heart rate over the course of say, 45 seconds is akin to falling asleep, releasing your tension. Um, and then as you're pushing your heart rate back up, you're learning and turn it on is you're using a physical metaphor to train at the art of turning on incredible intellectual and then turn it off Marcel with, see if we were talking about one of my most beautiful memories of him and you know, world championship fight before going into the semifinals. Bronchus bleacher, everyone's screaming, yell, and he's sleeping,

Speaker 1:          00:38:46       sleep, wake them up.

Speaker 3:          00:38:48       He sort of stumbled into the ring. You've never seen a guy more relaxed before going into a world championship fight. Um, and then he can turn it off so deeply in man, when he goes in the ring, you can't turn on with any more intensity than he can. And his ability to turn it off is directly aligned with how intensely you can turn it on. So training people to do this, have stress and recovery undulation throughout their day. Um, and then, you know, thematically this ties into again, this internal, um, proactive orientation and you know, building a daily architecture, which is around understanding your creative process as opposed to reacting to things, feeling guilty that you're not working, really teaching people to tap into their internal compass. Um, so those are some of the core themes and habits that I would, that I would bring up first, but I could go on, I could spend three hours talking about this. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       A little important to touch on for a second. I mean, as you know, I've been taking that very seriously for particularly, particularly last six months or so. And I received an email the other day from the, uh, the teacher that I used for a transcendental meditation. And there are many different types of meditation. I'm curious, I'm going to ask you about what, how you format your own meditating in a second. But there are many different types. I have my issues, my likes and dislikes as it relates to almost all of them, but, uh, received an email with a link to an article, uh, in the, the title is Bridgewater founder Ray Daleo credits transcendental meditation for his success. And for those who don't know, he's the founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater associates. They have what, 100 billion plus under under management, I think. Um, and his quote, his quote is meditation more than any other factor has been the secret to whatever success I've had, uh, that that is a hell of an endorsement.

Speaker 1:          00:40:41       So it's, for me, it's been, uh, getting over that resistance to what I perceived as sort of a woo new agey type thing. Um, and the, uh, the ability to sort of view it almost as just a warm bath for the mind. That where I'm taking a mini vacation from my own brain in a way, which may or may not depending on who you ask, be the most helpful way to look at it. But I found that a very, very kind of useful lens through which to view it. But how do you, uh, what, what, uh, if there is a particular type of, of meditation you followed, what is it or how do you personally meditate? I mean, what do you think of or not think of? How long do you do it, et Cetera?

Speaker 3:          00:41:30       Very simple, contemplative Buddhist sitting meditation. Um, or I would focus on my breath. Um, and you know, this is when I was a late teenager and then I started getting involved with Tai Chi and I started studying East Asian philosophy very deeply. And this is where I got increasingly into moving meditation, which, which is the most deep practice or the practice that I've personally done most deeply Tai Chi for meditation. I, so the medics data form of techy is sort of the, the essence of the art. And then the fighting application is what I was competing in. And so I spent many years meditating for five, six hours a day, three tight with techy. Um, today I combine my, my tattoo practice with sitting meditation again. Um, well most people when they, when they enter meditation, what I, what I suggested, they just practice very simple sitting meditation. I'm following the breath and it's a practice which doesn't have to be very complex.

Speaker 3:          00:42:34       They can for example, just sit either cross legged or comfortably in a chair and have their and follow their breath. And it's very interesting because they'll notice after one or two seconds of their mind starts racing off. And usually what happens when you have really driven guys who are trying to meditate for the first time and their mind races off, they get those, they get all pissed off, angry frustration. They feel like the failing at meditation. And one of the most important things to do is to embrace the fact that meditation isn't about perfection. It's about the return to breath. So when you find your mind racing, you observe that and you return to your breath. And that's a tough emotional hurdle for a lot of guys. And it's very interesting because over time, you know, you know, the metaphor of, of basically the mind is a, is a wild stallion that over time your attainment and you ultimately learn to still at its racing, it's fucking, it's pulling against anything.

Speaker 3:          00:43:25       You put it, you paint kind of line you put on it. Um, but ultimately the circles get smaller and smaller and you, you learn to observe when your mind is getting caught up in some kind of mental or emotional addiction more and more quickly and fluidly. And the returning to breath becomes easier and easier. And it's very interesting, by the way, as a competitor because I relate to the theme of, of channeling and emotion or fear, whatever is rising it. And you know, as a world class competitor in very much the same way we might speak about meditation. Um, you know, I spoke at a conference on grid, uh, recently and it was very interesting for me because for the most part when I listened, resilience trit yeah. Which is of course core educational principle and a lot of charter schools these days is hugely important.

Speaker 3:          00:44:13       Teaching kids to be resilient. Um, and it's very interesting because what, when I hear people speak about resilience, um, from, and this is sort of a, we're moving a little bit of size of meditation, but we'll bring it back. Um, the focus is on, for example, overcoming difficulty, um, suffering, learning to, to basically push through. What people don't realize is that world class performers, what they've done is they've reoriented their relationship to suffering or that to the point of versus since they've learned to embrace it, they've learned to see the beauty in these moments where there's pain. Cause that's incredible room for growth. And I think that a lot of what you learned to do in meditation is observe the addictive way. You might be defining something. And if you want to, you can simply alter that definition so you can change your relationship to pain or the rain or a huge storm or fear or anger.

Speaker 3:          00:45:09       So for example, people from the outside, we'll use the term fearlessness, right? But if you speak to any great soldier or a seal team member or a fighter or UFC guy, they'll tell you mixed martial law, right? You know, world class fighters, they'll tell you that they feel fear. They just know how to sit with their fear and how to work with it and how to channel it. So the idea of fearlessness is sort of a false idea which is imposed from the outside by a spectator. Um, and when you observe world class performers, what they've learned how to do is harness fear, nerves, anxiety, bring them in, embraced them, have a working relationship with them and channel them into intensity. And Meditation is an incredible forum or vehicle, which you can do this because you learn to observe where you have addictive relationships and you realize that they're not absolute and you can actually transform your relationship to any of these thought patterns, thought, Constructs, cognitive biases, what emotional patterns.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       But it's one of my favorite quotes, who, boxers like Floyd Patterson, you know, Jose Torres, most famously perhaps Mike Tyson. And he would say to the hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero of uses this fear of projects it onto his opponent while the coward runs. It's the same thing. Fear, but it's what you do with it that matters. And I, uh, I started meditating and gave up meditating many, many times because I had the, the response that you mentioned about type a personalities where I'd be sitting there and I thought the objective was to quiet my mind. And I'll come back to that in a second. And so when, so when I failed at quieting my mind because it would be ticking off the to do list or being Aiga, that fucker who said B and c to me the other day and it was just like harp on these ridiculous things and I'd get then pissed and then I'd get pissed that I was getting pissed and get up and have a cup of coffee and like storm out of the house, which didn't seem like a productive meditation session.

Speaker 1:          00:47:09       Um, I actually started doing it consistently when, uh, I kept it really short and a friend of mine recommended this where I would number one be comfortable. So I would, I would sit down, but to avoid back pain, I would actually lean against a wall, which is very commonly thought of as a big no, no. So it would lean against a wall to keep my back straight and I would listen to one music track. I listened to one song every morning, the same song as a Q. And I would just pay attention to my breath and focus on being an observer of my thoughts, but not trying to control them at all. So if all I did was think about my to do list the entire time, that's fine. As long as I'm paying attention to my breath and that non attachment to an outcome I controlling my thoughts was, was very helpful.

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       And the, the format that I followed subsequent to that. Um, and you know, we can have a longer conversation about why it finally clicked, but the short answer is accountability. I had a teacher who was going to give me a hard time if I didn't do my meditating and then report back, uh, was toy 20 minutes, let's just say 10 to 20 minutes twice a day. And when I found was by allowing the thoughts to occur and not judging myself, because let's say I'm thinking about email or the grocery shopping I need to do or whatever, just letting that happen. But getting good at observing it, I was able to then have more emotional awareness and later, which would prevent cognitive biases and bad judgments. So what I mean by that is, as a concrete example, uh, I'm a, I'm an impatient guy. I always have been ever since I was a little, literally little kid, like 12, 13 years old, if I was at the restaurant with my mom and dad and, and the server didn't come over and pour water after we'd been gone dry for like five minutes, I'd just get up and walk into the kitchen and like grab a picture and walk lockup.

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       And, uh, I'm really impatient and, uh, I get angry. I get angry about things that I view as deliberately slow and sloppy. So for me, uh, and, and that anger can be harnessed sometimes and do really productive aggression, but it's also, it wears you down and both ends. Um, and so what I've found is after meditating consistently for even a week or so, uh, when that anger would start, I was better at not just become, I was better at observing Tim as a third person, right? Like, oh, look at that. Like Tim's getting angry about something really small and stupid, uh, as opposed to simply becoming angry and then causing problems for myself, whether it's just internal or interacting with other people. So, uh, yeah, I agree with you completely on, on the meditation and

Speaker 3:          00:49:54       12 year old racing into the kitchen and bring up a metaphor for your life.

Speaker 1:          00:50:09       Let's, let's do a couple of rapid fire questions that are, that are all tied into this, this, this stuff. But we can just do short questions with a couple of short answers. Um, so complete the following statement. My favorite time of day is blank.

Speaker 3:          00:50:25       My favorite time of day is holding my son in my arms after I've done my woken up within a 20, 30 minutes journaling session. And I get my son, I can, I bring him downstairs and I give him his bottle of milk and I hold them. And I looked at him in the eye and I told them how proud I am of them and we talk about what he's thinking about and what he's working on. Willie I smell can. I think it's the most magical part of my day these days

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       in the morning.

Speaker 4:          00:50:51       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:50:51       Yeah, that's a, I wake up, I wake up about half an hour before him. I do a big creative burst. Um, this has been, as a parent, your sleep patterns change pretty dramatically, but I found this rhythm where I wake up and I do that personally. I just love that first morning energy Tom with him and we have this deep connection while he's having his, um, his milk.

Speaker 1:          00:51:15       What time do you wake up?

Speaker 3:          00:51:17       I usually wake up around seven seven oh five and he's usually wake up around seven 37 35.

Speaker 1:          00:51:25       I'm endlessly fascinated by digging. I'm digging into the minutia. But when you wake up, it sounded like you wake up and you have 30 minutes to journal before bringing your son downstairs. Do you brush your teeth, drink a cup of coffee, any of that before you journal or do you just roll out of bed, walk into the office and sit down to write?

Speaker 3:          00:51:50       I brush my teeth. I go downstairs and I sit down with my journal and I started writing and I immediately applied myself to two or reflection that I sort of targeted my mind at [inaudible] and evening or late afternoon before. Um, and then when I, when after and I just let it rip, I have a big creative search. Um, and then once I hear my son, I go get them. And then, then I have my breakfast, um, usually, uh, below, um, while he has his, you know, after he has his note and then I have a cup of coffee about half an hour after that

Speaker 1:          00:52:28       related to me, the happy guy. Obviously we all have our challenges then and again, uh, like a remodeled at the moment. I won't go into a diatribe at the moment. I'm very excited about it, but it's my, uh, you know, a 12 year old Tim wanting to go get the water pitchers is not being very helpful right now. The, what are three things? It can be two or three things that you believe you need in order to be happy. And that can be for you. Uh, it could be for people in general. I'm just curious. Uh, what, how you would think of that question or answer that question.

Speaker 4:          00:53:10       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:53:14       Being different and having these conversations is that you tend to be very good at thinking and bullets.

Speaker 1:          00:53:20       I can tell you the essence of how I really,

Speaker 3:          00:53:23       I'm not going to give you three bullet answer cause I just, that's just not how this brain operates.

Speaker 3:          00:53:31       Built a lifestyle around being true to myself. Largely. Maybe a big reason is because of, you know, my mom used to always tell me as a kid to follow my heart, follow my dreams. Um, I never made decisions for money or for external things. Um, and it was trusted. If I was true to myself, these things would follow. And so, you know, my professional life, my foundation, my school, I only work with people who I feel are ethically aligned to have a good energy, who I feel really good about intuitively. Um, I keep empty space in my life. Um, I rarely have more than one or two meetings a day. Um, my life is about quality and not quantity and it's about depth and not breadth. Um, I businesses based on doing very, very deep and very a excellent work, work with just a handful of people.

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       And so I really liked to cultivate quality as a way of life. And I believe that when you're not cultivating quality, you're essentially cultivating sloppiness. And so, you know, the idea of building the musculature of quality and being like a heat seeking missile form. And I take great pleasure in observing the beauty of the little moments in life. Um, and so for me, my lifestyle is based on, you know, I'm working out every day. I just focused on structured and data will allow for my creative process to be rich. I'm present with my son. I have my office is at home, I'm with them in the morning, I'm with him, I see him throughout the day. I'm with him, give him his bath and read them a story. And I, and with them I've eliminated almost all travel. That takes me away. Um, from, from my boy going to a conference this weekend, I'm taking my wife and my baby are coming with me. Um, and I, I really build a life around being true and I don't build it around anything material. And that's really the essence of how I personally relate to this question. Of course there's different solutions for everybody, but um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:22       works for me. I think it's a goal that most people have at least in the abstract. But I'd love to dig into some concrete details of that. Perhaps you could share an example of something you changed, like maybe where you got slightly off the path and made a correction to be true to yourself and what that looked like.

Speaker 3:          00:55:56       A very clear example is my public life. So I was a young kid, fell in love with chess when I was, I won my first national championship when I was a lead eight, early nine. Um, when I was 11, a book came out searching for I Fisher. Um, and then when I was 15 movie came out about my life based on the same book that my dad initially wrote. And so I was really thrust into the spotlight. And so I, you know, without me wanting to, I was just, you know, a young, passionate artist. I love playing chess and competing and chest. I was put out there and I had Paparazzi following me everywhere. I was, um, you know, I was really living in the, in, in the spotlight in a way I wasn't necessarily emotionally prepared for. And I felt in my teens how that challenged my love for this art cause my love for it was so pure initially.

Speaker 3:          00:56:44       Um, and, and that tension, you know, that that fight, that fight to stay true to my art, um, taught me some very deep lessons. And then I know after I finished high school, I took off and I left the country largely to study chess. Very deeply undistracted from publicity. I moved to Eastern Europe. Um, my girlfriend at the time was from Slovenia. Um, no one knew me out there and it was a beautiful life and I just left the public world. And since then have, you know, when I came back, I've had these periods where I've been exposed to publicity and I've been periods where I've been deep in the cave and moved away from it. And, and I think that this is a very clean example of, I mean, other than you

Speaker 1:          00:57:27       drag me out, you have a way of doing that to me,

Speaker 3:          00:57:37       but in a beautiful way. And I mean, I, I've found that the privacy of my life, I'm not doing things, not getting caught up in, in the swirl of fame or seeking external adulation is a very important thing for me personally. Everyone's different. But, but for me, I mean, I am amazed, maybe I have a little bit of a, um, an over sensitivity to this because of, of my, my youth, because I was out there so intensely as a young, as a young guy. And I think it really challenged my love for the game. Um, and this is an example of the kind of decision that I'll make. I mean, I think it's very important for me to, to, to live the vast majority of my life privately. I don't do very much that will allow me to be recognized in the street and living my life as a celebrity because I've gone down that path and I, I love my prophecy.

Speaker 3:          00:58:26       Um, and I also have built a career around my business is working with people who are similar, who are not seeking the limelight, who are not out there on television every day, who are world class, but her, no one around them. Um, other than people, you know, very close, had any idea that they have been so incredibly successful from a monetary way. They try to raise their kids, um, not to be spoiled. Um, the kids are gritty kids there, you know, great philanthropists, um, really good people. And you know, I love, I'm very drawn to people who have been enormous to successful, um, but don't get caught up in the external crap that comes with success and a real, you know, who were living their life, tapped into the love. Um, and that's how I try to lift.

Speaker 1:          00:59:16       What are the books either most gifted to other people or most recommended to other people. Uh, because there are many people listening to this probably who won't necessarily have the opportunity to interact with the types of, of high level folks, uh, that, that you and I are so fortunate to have the chance to interact with, but they can do that. Visa the books or narratives, uh, documentaries, et cetera. What are some books that have had a formative impact on you?

Speaker 3:          00:59:54       A huge impact on my life, on the road, Dharma bums. His books were initially kind of taps me into the idea that life could be ecstatically beautiful. And I moved into studying, um, that wasn't so loud to the Dao de Jing. Hugely. Um, just unbelievably deep for the course of translation of that book that you read will be formative. And I, my favorite translation is the GF who sang and Jane English translation of the diversion, um, Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. I think one of the most important books ever written by Robert Person who has become a very dear friend over the years. He, he, he, when my, when the order of learning came out and my publisher asked me, who would you love to read this book? And I said, well, the one person that really want to read that book is, um, Robert Person. And to me that it was just, you know, he, he lived like a deeply secluded life.

Speaker 3:          01:00:47       Um, but they somehow manage to get them a copy of the book. He got an a big Bushel from his publisher and he read it and he contacted me and wrote, I mean, I was so honored that he, that he was moved by it. And he and I, and over the years it developed really interesting dialogue. Um, is that his motorcycle maintenance is one, I think one of the most important books in the world. The focus on quality, dynamic, quality, um, finding art in learning the fine art in anything equally, deeply brilliant. Um, philosophical book. Um, shanter on one of the most beautiful novels I have. I never had Gregory Roberts. Also someone I've gotten to know very well. Um, just to ecstatically beautiful, beautiful book. And you know, of course I'm also a lover of fiction. I mean, Hemingway has been, he's probably the most important writer of my life. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       almost everything of his effort. Any particular novel stand out for you?

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       I mean, I think that for whom the bell tolls, just exquisite novel of Green Hills of Africa. Amazing. Um, his short stories are utterly magnificent. Um, I think green hills of Africa is one of the most, is one of the most underrated books that he's written. His is complete collection of short stories. I mean there's one magnificent gem after the next, um, of course old man and the sea is, everyone thinks about and beautiful book. Um, I guess if I had to have a favorite, it would be, it would be for whom the bell tolls

Speaker 1:          01:02:18       insight into his writing style. Uh, a moveable feast is okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:24       Magnificent book. Yeah. Yeah. Also really speaks to his writing process. So fascinating. Uh, there's a great book, by the way, Tim, I think you've read Hemingway and writing this book. I did read it. I also read that, yeah, you want it. If someone was just get to know a Hemingway to do, it's just a fantastic compilation of all of Hemingway's writing and letters in his books, in his articles everywhere. Um, put together thematically basically Hemingway on the writing process. I think it's one of the most important little collections of, of um, on creativity that I've ever run into. Absolutely brilliant.

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       I remember I read it, read it on kindle on a short flight that I had and just like jammed right through the whole thing. The uh, one of the recommendations was write drunk, edit sober and I realized that write drunk edit sober does not translate to podcasts very well. The last podcast that I did with a buddy Kevin Rose, if you record drunk and tried to edit sober, it doesn't really actually work the same way a man. What a, and we'll just do a couple more questions because this has been fun. The, but if you had to run out of your house and just take a handful of things with you, obviously your family is safe so that that's accounted for. Uh, what would you take and why

Speaker 3:          01:03:58       and what kind of situation in a very dangerous tuition

Speaker 1:          01:04:04       you don't have to fend for yourself with, with weaponry or, or create fire with Flint or anything like that. Um, there's a, there's a fire in your house, you just have to get out to the street and then you're going to obviously sort things out later, but assuming your family is safe, uh, what would you, what would you take with you? You just what you can carry basically.

Speaker 4:          01:04:26       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:04:36       How crazy it was. I was, um, there was, uh, I was studying chess with his brilliant Russian grand masters [inaudible] who actually wrote about my book. And there was a, I was in the fifth, fifth floor of a walkup through the old one bedroom. I had my first apartment. And um, and there was something that we were deep deep into chest study and there was a huge fire. I looked at, there were like five fire engines and dude screaming at us and we had it, did it go out the fire escape. And I ended up going back in and grabbing my computer with all my chest analysis, which is just a random thing. Yeah. And it ended up being, we had been seconds from being an updraft in bloom, the whole building on, um, yeah. So I wouldn't do that. Think honestly, when you asked me the question now I think that my family was safe. I have nothing material that I would, that I would grab.

Speaker 1:          01:05:35       Uh, all right. I'm going to ask you one more, uh, actually in, I'll give you a choice of two questions. So the first option is what did you want to be when you grew up, when you were a kid, and now how would you answer the question? What do you want to be when you grow up? That's, that's question one. Question number two is if you had a committee of three people living or dead to help you make decisions, who would you choose and why?

Speaker 3:          01:06:05       These are great questions, man.

Speaker 1:          01:06:07       Thanks. Um, by, by the way, I'm borrowing liberally from like every good interviewer I've ever come in contact. But, so it goes

Speaker 3:          01:06:17       and we answer them. Both of you have an answer, one of them, uh, you can answer very different questions. I mean, this is tough man.

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       Yeah. I mean if they, if they, uh, I'm just trying to be respectful of your time, but if you have time and you have some thoughts on both, let's, let's, let's go for it.

Speaker 3:          01:06:29       When I grew up, when I was a kid, I wanted to be a professional baseball player. I just love, I love them. So there's something about sports. Um, so I think that there was a, I'm going to, and I spend a lot of my life as a, as a competitor from age basically six until you know, 35. I was basically a professional competitor field, um, today and about, my mom always said to me that she felt like that was the phase and that I was a healer. I was holding her language. And a lot of what I do today is try to figure out how to help people express themselves in is pure way as possible artistically in a way that gives them joy. I mean, I think that my plan is sometime in the next four or five years now I'm 37 now. I'm thinking about it when I'm 40, 41. Um, I guess that'd be three, four years now.

Speaker 1:          01:07:24       Yep.

Speaker 3:          01:07:24       Turn my mind to everything. Taking everything I've been doing in these different laboratories and apply it to a, a world changing education initiative. Um, helping children in, uh, just fulfill themselves in a very deep way, I think is a central column, which I'm, that's, that's I'm not going to say is my end game, but that's the next, um, major chapter I think of my life that I'm building towards and running my foundation for for many years now. And we do beautiful work, but I have an allergy to scaling if it's going to dilute quality in any way. And so I've been sort of building up the foundation, the ground work to ultimately be able to, to do something hugely important in education. So I think that that's going to be, um, the core of how I would, I would, um, I'm building towards that in a few years. Um, in terms of the committee of three people

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       to interject for a second,

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       that's also, I think my calling and of course we've spoken at length about this. So if you need a coconspirator count me in for that one. Certainly years

Speaker 1:          01:08:33       sounds like a plan.

Speaker 3:          01:08:37       Taps that movement away from self as a competitor. You're, you're constantly, you're fighting and in many ways you're, you know, you're, there's something about the focus inward on oneself and I, and becoming a paradigm. I've definitely felt this movement. Um, it's away from that. I mean, my, my son is just my love for him, so transcend anything I ever, I ever felt before. It's been really, really important to experience when you become a dad man, then we're going to have some fun. What would you have sleepless nights?

Speaker 1:          01:09:07       Oh Man. You're going to see, what are your thoughts?

Speaker 3:          01:09:28       Well, one person who would be on that committee as someone who, um, who I know very, very deep friend of mine who happens to be in the, in the finance world, I can't speak about his last name is deeply meditative spirit, great wisdom, um, as insightful human beings I've ever known in my life. And I think that that he would definitely be on, um, on that list. Um, I mean, can we go, can we go into kick? Can I say outrageous? There's like, like Gandhi.

Speaker 1:          01:10:04       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:10:06       I mean I think of that Gandhi loud, the Buddha. I mean, my God, what, what, what am but if she needs to be is a certain, yeah. I don't know, man. I don't know if I can answer this question. Very intelligent. Like you could put it,

Speaker 3:          01:10:25       yeah. I don't know. And Tim, of course you, man, you give me, you give me so much crap in life you because you'd be the one just to, just to keep, definitely be wanting displays through all the nonsense yet. And my mom, that's the most important one. My mom, she has given me the most, um, deep advice in my life. I mean, my mom is the one person who has really embraced these crazy decisions that I've made when I've left arts, when I was at the tops of their field. If those fields and because of some strange calling ahead inside, I think, um, no, I'm gonna have to do the top of any of us like that. She's my hero. I'm the greatest person if your normal life,

Speaker 1:          01:11:07       awesome conversations. Uh, is there anything you want to, any parting thoughts, advice, suggestions, anything like that, the, that you'd like to impart? If not, we can, we can, we can call it a day. But, uh, the mic is yours. If you have anything you'd like to add.

Speaker 3:          01:11:33       Well, one thing that I've been doing in the last years, um, after, since writing the amount of learning is I've been exposed to know the most brilliant thinkers and these different fields. Um, and I've, I've studied the patterns behind them and I've studied the people who study them. And one of the things we have to be wary of in life is studying the, the people who study the artist as opposed to the artists themselves. Um, person who the other of them, they are the most cycle maintenance. As I mentioned. He uses this great term, the philosophers and the full philosophy ologists right? That's a lot of colleges are the ones who are basically philosophizing about the philosophers as supposed to do in philosophy. And the vast majority philosophers today actually are just philosophy ologists similarly, these, you know, you don't have to discuss, there's the writers and his literary critic.

Speaker 3:          01:12:21       There's the artist and the art critic. And I think that we have to be very careful when we, when we study excellence and we're thinking about our own path to excellence, um, that we're studying the, then we're tuning into the direct experience of people who've actually been there as opposed to the arms. You have professors who were talking about it, right? Because you know, it, if we spend our life in the trenches and we spend our life studying that last like 0.1% of the learning process, what we see is that, that that final passage to excellence is really about navigating that razor's edge where you have to be willing to go right up against a potential enormous blender. And you have to improvise, for example, trust your intuition and moments where all of the objective, um, mathematical faculties you've developed a telling you something else, but your intuition is operating at a higher level.

Speaker 3:          01:13:07       Um, you have to really be willing to go up to the brink of disaster, um, to, to succeed in moments where you're, for example, fighting in the finals of a world championship or in the very last second of the Superbowl or an NBA finals. And, and in navigating these things, the arms, your professors will often have the exact opposite of good advice, right? And so, so what I would say is, is for one thing, you know, listen deeply internally to, to the core of your being and build your game plan. From there, it trust your gut. And then build a lifestyle around listening to that and cultivate the love. And that's the other thing I'd say is that whether you're talking about at the beginning of the learning process or that were the very, you know, the very final surge or surges, it's about the love and we're thinking about parenting and cultivating resilience because of any excellence called the van. Creativity with the armature professors all forget about is the love. Um, and that's what I see consistently with people who have found the most pleasure, the most happiness, um, and created the greatest start is that they have a profound passion for what they do. Not only the big moments but the little moments, but the moments that others would call pain. They learned to love practice. They learned to love the point of resistance. Um, I said, don't forget about the love. I guess that's what I'd like to say.

Speaker 1:          01:14:36       I'm sure we will be talking next time. We'll have some wine and I hope everybody checks out. Obviously the art of learning and really keeps an eye on what you have come in when you decide to push stuff out of the cave.
