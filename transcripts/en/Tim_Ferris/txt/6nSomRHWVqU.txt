Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism. Living

Speaker 2:          00:00:23       episode is brought to you by a cent protein. I am really excited about this discovery. I became aware of these guys when I found out that they'd spent five years trying to manufacture a better version of whey protein and the result is something called native proteins, which represents cleaner, pure, less processed protein. So here's a mini tutorial. There are only a handful of companies worldwide that can extract native proteins directly from milk. Traditional whey protein. What you've probably bought before is a byproduct of making cheese. So a company must have the resources, knowhow and a large customer base to invest in extracting proteins directly from the milk without the ability to also profit from the associated cheese. That means that net net is native proteins are super rare. So a scent is the only us based company that offers native proteins both way and my seller casein directly to the consumer.

Speaker 2:          00:01:17       They're able to do that because the parent company Laprino is a huge cheese manufacturer. They've been filtering proteins for more than 30 years and there are few important things to take away from this. Number one, zero artificial ingredients. That is a solid claim. It's much stricter than all natural. Number two, they've done extensive testing, so the chocolate which I've been using after every workout and also in the mornings was finalized after 282 recipes were vetted and the perhaps most important, I talked about less processed. They avoid steps like bleaching and this is important to understand so it's, it's a very big deal but hasn't yet caught on for sports nutrition. Traditional whey proteins are a byproduct of cheese making. Like I mentioned, many of the proteins are therefore orange in color because they were sourced from say cheddar cheese production because companies can't sell orange powders, vanilla or strawberry, they have to bleach the proteins, wipe this, harms the proteins and leaves trace amounts of bleach in the product.

Speaker 2:          00:02:20       That is no window, no good infant formula companies, for instance, a banned the use of bleached proteins already in their products and that is why a sense parent company, Leprino foods is the number one supplier of protein to infinite formula companies. So all that said, if you want cleaner, pure, less processed protein, which I certainly do and I'm really excited to be using this protein and I just ran out of chocolate, so I need another bag, check it out.

Speaker 2:          00:03:17       this episode is brought to you by four sigmatic, founded by the Genius Fin's who lit the Internet on fire. And you may have heard of their mushroom coffee, which features Chaga and lion's mane, which has taken Silicon Valley by storm. I use it pretty much every day, either that or he chaga, which is decaf as a separate version, and I use both of these primarily for focus and productivity. They just get you going let you up like a Christmas tree. So definitely check it out. People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement and for right now this is the answer. I try to force this on all of my house guests. It is a hell of a thing if I have employees or people come over who are working on projects with me, I always try to feed it to them because I'm going to get the limitless effect and get a lot more out of them.

Speaker 2:          00:04:09       The first time I mentioned this product and four sigmatic on the podcast, their product sold out in less than a week, so you may want to check them out soon. If you're listening to this and the coffee tastes like coffee, it takes just seconds to prepare with hot water. And oddly enough, only includes 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you'd get in a regular cup of coffee. I don't get any jitters, acid reflux or any stomach burn, any of that. It's very unusual and very, very cool. So if you don't like caffeine, they also offer very strong, but caffeine free mushroom elixirs, which I will sometimes have in the evening. I find Chaga specifically to be very, very grounding and earthy. So that is another option. And I have a cupboard full of their products, uh, at the moment, which is right around the corner of my kitchen. You can try something. You can try a sample pack, which is great.

Have to define minx for your children and listening in the car during the drive to school, but so it goes. That's how the cards have fallen. It is my job to deconstruct world class performers on the show and we do that in many different areas. Whether they come from say the military, from entertainment, from research, from sports. You've can spot common patterns and my is to tease out the details, the philosophies, the habits that you can use. This episode features Bill Rasmussen at bill underscore ESPN on Twitter. I'll keep this short. He gives where we want to jump right into a bill is the founder of ESPN and the creator of the 24 hour programming cycle that all networks use today. I was really excited to be able to sit down with them and uh, we really recorded a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:06:25       We recorded three hours material and only one hour was used for my new TV show, which I'm going to get to in a second. And this podcast episodes is almost entirely new. Exclusive content that did not appear on the TV show.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       stage. We will be deconstructing world class performers of all types to uncover the specific tactics and strategies they've used, overcome doubt, tackle heart decisions, and ultimately succeed by show of hands. How many people here wait for say the morning paper to get their sports scores? It's a big fat zero. How many of you can remember when television wasn't available? 24 hours a day. Anyone of my generation are a little bit older. I've got a few hands. And when I say Bristol, Connecticut, what do you think of after meeting my guest tonight? You'll associated with one thing and that is sports against all odds. Heat set out to change the course of television and the status quo as we know it and in the process he created one of the most iconic and recognizable brands in the world. Please welcome the founder of ESPN, Bill Rasmussen.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:08:46       What was your grandfather like? Describe for us your relationship with your grandfather. He was literally a dyed in the wool, a white sox fan.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       He took me to Kaminski Park when I was very, very young and I can remember he lived, if you're familiar with Chicago, 35th Street, it was 35th and shields is where the Comiskey park was and he lived at 33rd and bell. I can remember these details like I can't believe that they're there and he would walk me to the street car and say, now when all of the people start getting off here at the Ballpark, like I would know where the ballpark was there. It is right in front of me and I can remember finding out early, and this was in the early 1940s the ballpark would open if it was one o'clock game and it was, they opened the gates at 11 o'clock in, my goal was always to be there to be one day, be the first one in the ballpark and one day I did do it and my grandmother would give me a sandwich and a little coke bottle with those little green bottles.

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       I would take that off under the rug, out of the streetcar, a nickel or whatever it was to go on the street car and get off Comiskey Park and being there one day they were worried. Red sox and white sox played a doubleheader first game when 13 innings and the second one went to the bottom of the ninth. Both games were seven to six and it took, you know, half a day to play all that. I didn't leave. I was there from two hours before the first pitch to the end of the second game and that my grandfather allowed us how at that point I became an official white sox fan. So anything allowed as long as it's white sox, as long as it was the one lane as well. And it was really, it's only a few blocks. Yes,

Speaker 4:          00:10:27       I you're reciting these statistics. The, for one of the first thoughts that jumped to mind was you'd make a really good intelligence officer and then I thought of something that I had heard, which was you played war games as a kid. Am I making this up or did you have,

Speaker 3:          00:10:40       yeah, we used to, well, everybody did. Okay. Every, I mean, when 1941 occurred, I was in the fourth grade and before, I think before Christmas, we're all talking about everybody. Everybody in America was talking about we all have to be together though, or no, right. Left up, down or anything. We were all on the same, same team and at the early part of the war, before they started saying, you couldn't do this. I can remember my father's shirts come back from the cleaners or the piece of cardboard in pretty much like they do today I suppose in some some places and we used to draw whatever we want it to do. If I was going to be a master sergeant for the games the next day we would draw it on a board, then color with crayons, you know, red and green and blue or whatever it was, cut them out.

Speaker 3:          00:11:26       And with rubber bands we put them on our arms and off we go the next day to do whatever battle we had decided we were doing and we did that basically all through the war. It was kind of crazy, but we had to start using other things because uh, hangars and cardboard, we're all confiscated. We went out. Oh yeah, they had everything went to the war effort. We, we picked up newspapers, everything went and was, we didn't use, they didn't use the word recycle then, but that's what it was. They were recycling and producing anything. It's pretty, pretty cool.

Speaker 4:          00:11:55       Do you remember where you were when you heard about Pearl Harbor?

Speaker 3:          00:11:58       Absolutely. What a picture. 55 south Mount Vida Avenue and Columbus manner, just south of 90 to today. Back then 95th street was highway 12 and 20 on the south side. Chicago, two lanes, one in each direction. Today is 12 lanes, six in each direction, but my happened and my father got us all around the radio and we sat. We sat literally on the living room floor watching the radio, listening to news reports, and we were not unique. Happened all across America.

Speaker 4:          00:12:35       Also, if we flash forward just a little bit to say high school and look at your experience in high school, you played baseball. Did you try any other sports?

Speaker 3:          00:12:43       Oh yeah. I tried football once because my father encouraged me to do that because I was really fast. Had football, go for it. Yeah, well I was so fast. One afternoon I intercepted a pass. You wouldn't even, maybe you would understand some of the football technology of the day. We had defensive halfbacks and we had, we didn't have all of these white outs and slots and safe with them with different things. Anyway, I was a defensive halfback intercept of the past and because I was so fast, I went around very quickly. I didn't see anybody in front of me and I thought, what a great, this is really going to be great. Touchdown was insight and I woke up under the bench.

Speaker 4:          00:13:21       Sweet. What happened? Somebody was faster than I was and when they were faster than I was and I, when it's not expected and you get tackled from behind, I was literally late, light out, game over football, career over that was it done. So did you, was it your choice to end the football or did you decide, okay, happen

Speaker 3:          00:13:46       and with baseball and, but then I did find out playing baseball one day in a practice. We were just doing an inner squad game and I turned around, you know what the cardinal rule is in baseball? Never ever take your eye off the ball. Right. And if you're playing in, never ever take your eye off the ball. I went like this one time and turned back and that's all it goes. And as I turned back, I get hit right in the face of the baby.

Speaker 4:          00:14:07       And maybe that's why. Well, no, we're not going to go away. That's why I look this way today. I think you look fine. I don't know. I think my nose is more quick. The nearest maybe I got hit by a baseball and don't remember it. Actually I didn't actually know I did. This is true because I remember my first day, uh, little league tryouts in deep in left field fly ball right in the middle of the face. That was the end of my baseball career. That would be embarrassing for an outfielder. Oh, it was embarrassing for anything fielder, especially as whatever I was a third or fourth grader is the runt of the litter as it was. And now I have lack of hand eye coordination to go with it. It was terrible. Uh, tell me about a little bit about high school. Uh, in doing research, I read about an essay contest, the ended up sending you ultimately to me suppose the, the president or soon to be president. Can you, could you describe that for us?

Speaker 3:          00:15:00       And I was a junior in high school in 1948. Started my junior year that September and there was a Chicago Sun Times, had an essay contest for all students. That six of from the city, we're going to be chosen to go to a president, Harry Truman, his inauguration. That was the famous selection where the Chicago Tribune and put out the headline, Dewey wins. And then Truman held up the paper the next day and his picture was in there holding up the picture of the newspaper. And of course do we didn't win. But uh, the deal was we'd write an essay and so on. And my father decided that I could write an essay on becoming a lawyer. I was going to become a lawyer and I must've done a really persuasive job on why I want it to be a lawyer because I was one of the six winners and we got to go to a Washington, we got to sit on the, the capital, whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:15:56       I'm not sure what they call it, but up there with all the dignitaries, a senator Dayas or whatever it might be. Well, you know, it's where the senators and the representatives were included in that. And uh, there was six of us and watched Harry Truman take his oath of office in 1949. I got this, watch them take the actual, uh, we were, we were right there in 1949 and we went that night. Of course, they have all these different parties and one of the things that stands out, we were all 16 year old kids. So we were chaperoned everywhere we went and we were standing at the Shoreham hotel and I turned to my left and General Omar Bradley was standing right there and he'd put his hands, said, hi, how are you? You know, what are you doing here in the General? Omar Bradley was a, an icon to the people of that era that was unknown. And I, I've never forgotten that.

Speaker 4:          00:16:43       So we were able to maintain your composure through all of that. I mean, you get flown to the president or it's going to be president being sworn in. Then you turn, you see an icon on the other side. Were you able to maintain your composure through all of that?

Speaker 3:          00:16:57       Yeah, I think I was just numb through it all. I didn't even, she didn't even register, you know. No, I mean obviously I knew who he was and then I was very, uh, we were all very honored to be selected.

Speaker 4:          00:17:08       So you get to college and were there any particular teachers? They're there too. I've read about a history and Econ, but were there any particular teachers we had a large impact on you?

Speaker 3:          00:17:20       Um, the, uh, the one professor in economics financial organization had investment was a, he was the head of the economics department, Doctor Joe me and he was an interesting channel one to say the least. And if you weren't paying attention and he had a great arm, he should've been a shortstop. I don't think these schools exist this way today, but we used to have blackboard all the way across the front of the room and all the way down the side of the room. And he would start at the class over here at the left hand side, putting things up and talking and on and on, lecturing. And his suit would get all covered with chalk dust and so on. And then he turned around out of nowhere and he'd say, Tim, what about whatever the question was, if you didn't get it, he'd take that eraser and he'd hit you in the forehead, hit you in the shoulder, and then your mark was, if you came out of the class with no chalk marks on it, who was a successful afternoon. And I can also, just to put it in a little perspective, I remember the day the Dow Jones average hit 3000 and you know how we used to get, there was no online follow button. Minute by minute he would bring in after the market closed, the, the Wall Street Journal would publish everything in printed form and he would bring that in the next day. And that's how we learned about the stock market. Crazy stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:18:41       And uh, was there another professor who did reenactments?

Speaker 3:          00:18:45       Oh yeah, Andrew Crandall. Dr Crandall. He was actually, he was a noted civil war expert in the country. And every year he would, the only place big enough to hold his lectures if you will, was um, what's the name, Mitchell Hall, the uh, chemistry laboratory with all of the, the theater types aits and down front. And he would set up huge tables and reenact the battle of Gettysburg or whatever it was. And he had little, it was like kids toys. Really. He was so engrossed and he too, he would start off with a shirt and tie and coat. And before long as the war, as the battle progressed, raging bull comes up and they were standing room only lectures. It was just amazing. People wanted to see because he was entertaining but so knowledgeable about the civil war. And He created an awareness in so many students about that period in our history that I can remember it very, very vividly. He was a, he was an enthusiastic and a very, very knowledgeable person about it all. And we talked about Pickett's charge or Robert E. Lee doing this and grant doing it. I mean it was, it was incredible. I never missed come on four years,

Speaker 4:          00:20:04       I seem to recall. And you can, you can shoot this down as a figment of my imagination. A stint as you had a lot of different gigs and part time gigs that seem as a collection to have really informed what you did later at the ESPN. Did you not have some experiences? A weatherman?

Speaker 3:          00:20:22       Oh yeah. Oh, is that fun? And you, and you started inserting things into the weather. Well, what, what happened? It's coming. Bear with us. So Mike, let's talk about being, yeah, yeah. I, well first of all, you had to understand why I ended up, why I even ended up at the station talking about being a weatherman. I, um, lived in Amherst, Massachusetts and there were, you have to remember now, this is in 1964, 1965. We had two stations once NBC station when ABC Station, that's all a television there was. And the entire western part of Massachusetts, the NBC station had news, weather and sports from 11 to 11 or seven to seven 30 and 11 to 1130. The ABC Station at 11 o'clock just did 15 minutes news and signed off. So I said, I'm not going to get the guy's job at the one that does 11 hours a half hour at 11 why don't I go talk to the station managers at the ABC station and tell him he needs a sports show?

Speaker 3:          00:21:30       It's part of the confidence, I guess. And so I went and met him, call for an appointment. He said, sure, come on down. He said, what is it you want to do? I said, well, the other guys are doing sports. You should be doing sports. Ah, we don't want under sports. So we talked a while and he said, well, all right. All right, I'll pay a $10 a show. I had to drive 40 miles to get there. 20 miles, 40 miles round trip. So taking that loss. So it's a net loss. So, and you can start Monday. Okay, well I knew I could do sports. So I get down there and I'm walking in the door on Monday, whatever it was, the 3rd of January, the 5th of January. And he said, I've changed my mind. I have you. What do you mean you've changed your, I thought I'd fired and I wasn't fired.

Speaker 3:          00:22:17       He said, you're going to do the weather. We're not going to do sports. You're going to do the weather. I said, I don't know anything about whether shoveling snow doesn't qualify you to, you know, he said, here's the way we're going to do the, whether you call Bradley field, talk to the Noaa, the national weather people at Bradley. Feel calm around 10 30 find out what the world looks like around, you know, this general area. Scratch a few things. We didn't have clay strong nines and all of these kinds of things back then we had a grease pencil and a whiteboard and write something down. Draw a picture of Springfield if you like or Massachusetts and just say it's going to be 68 degrees in rain tomorrow. That's, that's all people are going to get. So I can, and I can remember, and just to digress for a second visit, some nine or 10,000 live shows a goal.

Speaker 3:          00:23:06       But this was the very first one. I can remember when they said one minute I turned around and put my back to the camera and the sweat running down the center of my back. And I remember saying, why am I subjecting myself to this? And they turned said, you know, 10 seconds, five, four. I turned around and I decided I really like this. This is pretty good stuff. I'm going to it to be telling people about the weather. And I decided just, I had followed the Springfield Indians hockey team in the American hockey league and the Boston Bruins and the rangers, everybody in the area. So I said, well, we're going to do is we're going to find the weather from different cities, especially where the team was playing and say, tonight it's a 32 degrees in Pittsburgh and the white snow falling on the Indians won three to two and I would just write three to two.

Speaker 3:          00:24:01       So I thought, well this will get me fired for sure. So you didn't ask this was a forgiveness, not permission. Oh yeah, forgive. Oh, it's much easier to ask forgiveness. So, uh, that's what we did. And the next day I didn't see the general manager didn't say anything. So the next night I did a couple of more scores and the next day I found out some people call the station and said, you know, this new sports idea. And whether they thought it was a, they thought it was, I guess it was a plan Gig, but it wasn't. It just happened. And grand collaborative innovation. And then the gentleman at the NBC station was promoted, went down to Charlotte, North Carolina, and before he left, because he had, obviously we had met along the way because competitors do that. And he recommended me for that job and in the things happen for a good reason kind of thing.

Speaker 3:          00:24:54       I went up to that station and I was only doing the weather and the sports for about four months. And then I went to the other station, the NBC station started doing sports. And it happened to be in the year that Mohammed Ali and Sonny Liston fought. And Louis did main pick fight and his headquarters were in Chicopee, Massachusetts. And I was the guy able to go down and I met him back then and we met each other several times after that. But you never know. I mean here was a station that wasn't doing something. I talked him into something I guess or they decided they were going to do it and then the other guy leaves and I get his job and all of a sudden listen. And back then it was Cassius clay. We're going to have this big fight and I can tell you, and people who know Cassius Clay, you know, pretty bum, bombastic person, and he was, we had a lunch in one day and he was his usual self.

Speaker 3:          00:25:49       And then he said he was going upstairs. It was a long way from where his training camp was to the station. So I decided to stay there and I just sat in the lobby and an hour. So after lunch I, I just kind of dozing off waiting for the four o'clock press conference and I sense somebody sitting down over and is Cassius clay. I ain't doing, what do you, you know, we'd said that we talked for probably an hour, normal tones just to just a great guy. We were just, it was a young guy obviously, and we were, he said, well I guess I better go up and we're going to do this four o'clock writing. And I was, they didn't call it that, but I was called the question asker, the pool announcer. I was going to ask all the questions and he was going to answer for every, for everybody. So as I'd seen little wine. Yeah. Good. Looking forward to it. A few minutes later, white suit, white shoes, white shirt, white tie, big. Everybody. Wow. Here he come. He came down, he looked right to me. Like he had never even seen me before. Did his press conference with all the usual bombast that he did. And I've never forgotten that. And I saw many years later and he remembered, he put on a stage. So it on and he put on a show. He was, but he was, he was, he was quite a guy. I was privileged to meet him.

Speaker 4:          00:27:03       What's most, what were the most memorable aspects of that encounter to you? The fact that he could turn it on, turn it off that way,

Speaker 3:          00:27:10       turn it on and turn it off in his personality. And he was really, I mean, he talked just like you and I are talking. It wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't, I'm the champ and you're just a guy here in Massachusetts. It wasn't that at all. And I never forgot that. And I saw many, many years later and uh, it was the same and it was the same way.

Speaker 4:          00:27:29       You mentioned something just a minute ago, the things happen for a reason. Is that a core belief of yours, the things happen for a reason? Has It always?

Speaker 3:          00:27:37       Yeah. Sometimes. Maybe we make it happen and sometimes it just happens.

Speaker 4:          00:27:42       If you had to say teach, let's just call it, you can pick the grade, ninth grade class, college class doesn't really matter. To help students develop confidence. What, how would you approach that or how would you even think about it?

Speaker 3:          00:27:56       Are there any, you know, a lot of people ask me that question and I'm not, this is going to sound odd. I'm not sure I'm qualified to do that in the form of a college curriculum, but if I can somehow transmit that belief and the feeling of success and positive approach to things that you have to have and be able to take the negatives and get past them. And I don't know how you'd do that in a college curriculum, but it's, I just, you know, whether it's stealing bases or selling products or whatever. As I said earlier, I think that when somebody says no, they've made the mistake and I don't, I don't know how you, I don't know how I would do that.

Speaker 4:          00:28:40       The other leg of the table, it seems as advertising, so you shortly, while, I don't know if it was shortly after, but after getting the NCAA to commit,

Speaker 3:          00:28:51       we were a little ahead of that little ad. Yeah, we were. We were floating them. They were one of the, so we told them who we were talking to. We didn't tell them we had them. This is a well known beer company, Spas. It is. And so can you tell us a little bit about how that was, was that happening concurrently? Was that another ball in the air? That was happening in early January. Okay. We had hired as an advertiser Bush. Yeah. We had hired a gentleman from Connecticut, general insurance to be our general sales manager. He was the general sales manager. They're like the sports idea and I said, we have to, obviously the obvious choice is Anheuser Busch largest sports advertiser in the world. Then and maybe today, I don't know, but we had a very specific plan to take them. That sounds odd when I say all these other vagaries that we're just juggling, but we had a very specific plan.

Speaker 3:          00:29:41       We decided that if we could get eight sponsors, a 2 million, $760,000 a year, that would finance total of the sum total of the eight sponsors? No, no. Total eight times. So it'd be 20 $20 million. Got It. Got It. So we, uh, went down to New York, got invited down to Darcy Mcmanus and the vice president, Jane Patrola was his name and he listened and he was a trig. He has to be intrigued. It's his business sports business, Budweiser. He said, I'll take it to the brewery, I'll get back to you a couple of days later. And we went back down to New York and he said, I've been to the brewery will give you a $500,000. That's the first sign we ever had of any money coming our way are 9,000 have gone out the door. My family and friends had gone out the door, k a suite of, puts the money in and we were, we were running on just the first black ink, like real influences.

Speaker 3:          00:30:31       Yeah. And Bob and I looked at each other and we shook our heads and said, and this just, I was sitting right the way I'm sitting with you, Tim. And as you know in New York out windows, they're advertising things on the sides of buildings, on the front of buildings and mark keys and everywhere. And it just so happened over jeans. Left shoulder was a big ad for Miller Miller high life. And I looked at Bob and he looked at me and I took my eyes from gene and I said, we can't accept that and we were going to have to pursue other avenues. And I just looked over that way. And he said, before you do that, he knew, he knew what ad was out the window. He said, let me have an exact word, let me have another go at the brewery. He called a couple days later and he said, I'll tell you what, nobody's ever done this and cable television, we'll give you a million, $380,000 and let's go. And that's the way it was. So we had 1,000,380 committed before we had the programming committee. And then before we had the financing committed, which is kind of, you know, when all the eggs are running and it doesn't make any difference which order they come in just to get them home.

Speaker 3:          00:31:38       What were some of the more say, costly, uh, decisions or missteps that you guys had early on? Um, there had to been something I would have been, yeah, well we did, we did Canadian football. We tried to do some, we tried to do a lot of different things with different, we always tried to overreach. And even to this day, uh, just a couple of years ago, I was in, uh, Dallas talking to ESPN radio, which by the way is now the biggest radio network. You know, it's just crazy. Uh, and I asked that very same question about what happens in what are the mistakes? And this fellow had worked for ABC and so I said, what's the difference between the two same market? He worked for ABC, now he's working for ESPN because obviously they were all bought by Disney and they're all in the same house, so to speak. He said, ABC always sent out directives to us saying, don't rock the boat. We're doing well in this market. We're doing well here. We're doing all these, they don't rock the boat. He, ESPN on the other hand says, try everything that pops into your mind. If it works, great. If it doesn't, forget it and move on. Two totally different approaches.

Speaker 4:          00:32:50       Sounds like the bill Rasmussen got into life. That's like the mantra, right?

Speaker 3:          00:32:54       Well, but eh, but if we think about that, how discouraging it would be to your employees to say, I don't want you to come in and telling me anything. He might have a greater, I don't want to hear your great idea after you've given them an opportunity to work for you. Now you don't want to hear from him. So encourage everybody in, but let's do it all. And if you met someone, if he mess up, nobody's going to shoot you and there's no debtor's jail. There's no, you know, no guillotine. This isn't whatever. And uh, I thought that was interesting from them. They've tried a number of things. We did a thing with, uh, not when I was there, but with a cell phones. When they first came in, there was some gigantic program when they were testing it with kids of all the employees and everything else. And it didn't work. So they just moved on. Of course, they've changed that around a little bit now with streaming and everything else in cell phones today of course a little different than they were 10 years ago. Did we even have cell phones 10 years ago? I don't even remember.

Speaker 4:          00:33:50       We did. They just, they were closer to the Gordon Gekko. Yeah, Rick. Uh, okay. But yes, we did have the, what I'd love to do because we're talking about, of course ESPN arguably your best known for that. Uh, but to sort of bring it full circle for a second, we're going to bring out a prop. It's not really a prop. This is, this is a real, it's a real thing. A real thing. I don't want to spoil the surprise, so we're going to get that. That's going to come out. But I thought we might do if the team in the back can bring up the then and now some of the stats, because you mentioned radio and I just thought just to put this in perspective for people starting with Irish hurling and juggling five different balls, telling everyone, each person that everyone else is in until ultimately you get them all in. I think it's pretty staggering when you look at the before and after and if you, so I'm not going to read all of these stats for you guys. We can see subscribers and 1.3 million to more than 90 million, 80 employees, more than 8,000 than one acre just in Bristol alone, 223 radio, none to 20 million and that's not even counting the publishing arm. No huge magazine and everything else.

Speaker 3:          00:35:10       Yeah, it's an amazing their subscriber fees. This is a staggering number to me. We started off asking for a penny, one penny at it, would you pay me, Tim if I came to and I said, Tim, give me a penny day, 30 cents a month and you can watch sports 24 hours a day. I can give you a penny a day. Does that sound good? That sounds good. Cut. Turned down and got left out. As a matter of fact, just to digress for a moment, one of those people that I said, you could make money doing this. I said, not only that, we're to give you a local availabilities. I got this funny look like what's a local availability? Yeah, I was going to ask you. Yeah, well, what we're going to do is answer ESPN. Whoa. Pause, and you can put in a local sponsored Joe's pizza, somebody Sam's Toyota or whatever in your market and your telecast. Nuke him. Advertise. Oh, you know what the answer was? Why would I want to do that? I kind of did just what you said like this, what? He said, I'd have to hire somebody to go sell. I said, here's how I did it. Very this, that was probably rude that I shouldn't have done this, but I did it cause it's a knee jerk reaction to me. So said, here's an idea. He sells a hundred he keeps tending. You get 90 oh well maybe we can talk again.

Speaker 3:          00:36:27       Well now today, back then cable, the cable systems didn't make much money advertising today it's a multibillion dollar business as you know, they just make all kinds of money. So let's, let's bring in what I've mentioned before. So if we could bring in what we have here, I'll do my best to hold this in pieces. Let me fall apart. Pieces may fall apart. He tell us what this is please. This is a, this is the latest and greatest love of at the time, a third baseman in 1947 this is my original baseball glove in high school when I was at high school, Sophomore. And if you can see it, I don't try and put your hand in there, Tim, as if you were playing third base. I'll be the guy who destroys it on national television.

Speaker 3:          00:37:16       Can you imagine catching balls with that? And it was, that was not the easiest thing in the world. This looks like cookie monster. Now you know, here's another baseball fans of the day. This was what you had to do when the evening was over. You turned around and you through your glove back onto the outfield grass. Major Leagues did it. We did it. Say that again. I didn't know this all virtually all through the first half century when the infielders came off the field or the outfields, they never brought their glove in with them into the dugout. They left him the third basement drop as long the fall line, shortstop and throw his in short leftfield second baseman in short right field. Why nobody? I mean today there's so if there's a, I dunno, a clean expos across field time out and you have to get out and clean in here.

Speaker 3:          00:38:03       They were just littering the field with their own gloves. But what amazes me, I found this in some storage. Obviously this was absolutely the most expensive thing I had ever had in my life to do with baseball at that point in 19, it was to be the spring of 1947 and I look at the gloves today. Softball gloves are so much better than this. And uh, I don't, I don't know how we ever, I don't know how everybody didn't have about a 500, uh, feeling average because how we caught things. I don't know. It's pretty amazing though, and I'm really pleased with that because it does bring back lots of memories. Did you collect anything as a kid? I what? Did you collect anything as a kid? Did you clicked? No statistics. Statistics. I was into, we had a, we had a little board game where you spun an Arrow and it wouldn't, you know, they sent out, I think maybe it was one of the bubble gum companies that pay this little game and whoever they had on their cards, they'd make the all star team for the National Union American Legion that you're gonna need to spin any, make up games and percentages and to do all that.

Speaker 3:          00:39:09       I was forever drawing little things. I remember my father worked at the Ford aircraft engine division and during the war and he brought me home, uh, what did they call a mimeographed scorecards and I would use those scorecards and play a game and eight or nine or 10 minutes and fill out a scorecard and it's still that one and start all over again. And I was just, I guess now that I think about it, I had a pretty long obsession with statistics.

Speaker 3:          00:39:37       If you were to give advice to yourself on a day before ESPN launched, not necessarily about the next day, but just any advice whatsoever, would you, would you give yourself any advice? I probably would have hoped that we were a little farther along going on the air. I W I always want to be the next step. Um, and it didn't turn out that the next step would have been a whole lot better because everything turned out pretty well. Are there any pitches that come to mind that were complete disasters, complete failures in any, I certainly can. I mean, I've had my fair share. I'm just wondering with regard to ESPN or, or anything, anything just oh yeah. Entrepreneurs start, lots of businesses very convinced that everything's going to work fine. I did the, uh, radio networks for Massachusetts University of Massachusetts and then expand it. They're doing basketball networks and hockey that works every time.

Speaker 3:          00:40:38       I thought they were really good, somebody to say, well, we're not going to do that anymore. And I said, okay. And you know, that's the way it is. Obviously you're disappointed. Yeah. But you can't stop living. It's not the end of the world. I mean, you keep eating, that's all there is to it. And uh, I don't know if it's, if it's luck, if it's coincidence, if it's, I dunno what, whenever I've had a moment to come, uh, we had, uh, we had a, a home automation company that we bought into long before all of the technology could make it really happen. Not a good idea. Sounded like a great idea at the time, but you know, what, we tried, it didn't work. Push aside and keep on going. So you, you've been thought of as this, for instance, with the NCAA as sort of not Nostradamus

Speaker 4:          00:41:35       of college sports, right? Because you, you got the programming and then Lo and behold, we have Larry Bird Magic Johnson. All of a sudden it's the rage, right? Yeah. And it seems like, Eh, certainly I've, I've seen this a lot where I live in Silicon Valley, that you've had a lot of great bets, but some of them, like the home automation had been early and you've paddled for the long. Really? Yeah. How do you, how do you think about evaluating opportunities like that? I mean, you've made plenty of investments as well.

Speaker 3:          00:42:06       Well, what I would, I think about is obviously we all think about the success. I bet if I might think about success a little bit differently, you know, we put together a business plan, right? What's your, what's your mission statement? Have you ever seen mission statements? Sure. Page long three. Oh, I know what you have. But I mean, some of them are page long summer, three paragraphs. They get beyond 10 or 12 words. I think we've lost focus ESPN to this day. You know what their mission statement is? Six words, six words drive ESPN to serve sports fans anytime, anywhere. That's it. Does that say it for ESPN or does it, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:42:49       if I can't reduce it

Speaker 3:          00:42:50       to some simple that I can see it. Let's make it work this way. Um, we're, we're involved in a new business. No, sounds funny. At my age, right? I'm an old, but I'm not that whole, I'm not too old. I want to do things like your brain works 10 times faster than mine. So yeah, I have no sympathy, but this has to do with streaming. What do I know about streaming? I didn't know anything about satellites, but I'll find out. But I don't have to know about streaming. You dream it. We streaming. How's that? Six words. Six words. Good statement. Good, good mission statement. But it really isn't everything that we all undertake. If you decide you're going to go to the movie yet, the second pick a good movie that you want to go, say, pick the wrong one, what do you do? Well, we'll try it again. Or do you go home and say, I'm never going to the movies again because that didn't work.

Speaker 4:          00:43:45       When you make an investment, how do you decide how big it is and do you cap the downside? Is there a point where you say, all right, you know what, this, this isn't where we want it to be. I'm going to cut my losses. How do you think through that?

Speaker 3:          00:43:56       That I think that there, I think you have to set a threshold, if you will, that is both upper and lower. [inaudible] uh, I always think the sky's the limit once you have to think at the bottom. And if it's not going to work, take your medicine and, and check out. That's all I on theirs. I can't tell you how many things and how many times, how many cars do you buy. And then of course when you go into the day, you buy the car. Oh, you're so, oh this is perfect. And so what, and what? Two years later, you know, maybe you're just slapping things around the car, you throw things in the trunk or something on the front seat, you don't pay much attention to it. And then pretty soon you don't want that car anymore. You have to get another new car. So that was gone.

Speaker 3:          00:44:39       So you cut your losses and you get rid of that. I want to get to know it. And that would, life is all about really what, what's your choice? What are we going to do in the next hour? What are we going to do the next day or the week or the month that follows. And then I've just been a, I'm a positive. I approached life from a positive side. And when you say it's a loss and how do you cut your losses? Sure you, you would rather not do that. It's not the end of the world. And part of the education part of the education.

Speaker 4:          00:45:05       So when you look at, I mean you've, you've used your time very well. I mean clearly putting together ESPN just to make that series of miracles happen can't depend on a miracle. I mean you had some good timing, but you made a lot of good decisions when you were at your peak, when you were just a machine, what did your days or weeks look like? How did you manage your time and maybe the better question is how you do things differently.

Speaker 3:          00:45:31       What I would do is every day, if I had to meet you someplace, you were on the schedule tomorrow, you, you were the next thing that I was going to do, but seven other things might come up. Vinny Twain and I'd have to figure it out, how to do them and some of my put back to after you and I really, it sounds fun. It's funny, it sounds like maybe I'm at a pinball machine. I've gone from area to area, but each one of those stops had meaning in of some sort. Uh, back in the soliciting cable operators time we, there was a book back then called standard rate and data service. There was no, remember that you remember that big book. We would look up sports directors or radio or a presence of cable system. We decided we were just going to go pitch the top 20 cable systems.

Speaker 3:          00:46:19       Two of US split. I took the top first. Then the next guy, Eddie Egan was his name, took the next 10 and we had a young lady sitting in our hallway in our office that was her office was in the hallway outside two offices. We only had two and we had her call each of those cable operators and say here in Los Angeles for through was one. We'd say, you know bill is going to be in Los Angeles on Thursday and it would like to meet with Tim at two o'clock. I don't know who Tim is, I don't, I don't even know where your officers, I'm going to have to get out there and find a map and find you. We did that. She called 10 cable system, the 10 biggest cable session at the time, all 10 of them for convening all 10 of them, so five of them were in Denver and I just went right down the street and met with them all and kept him.

Speaker 3:          00:47:02       Those kinds of things. Don't be a, don't be afraid to try crazy things. I mean, who would have thought something like that would work? I'd probably be saying what? What happens today? If your cell phone rings and a phone number says unknown, I don't answer it. Don't answer. Does anybody answer? Not me. I had two of those today. Hang Up. So now here we are calling. You have to have to do with this way. Put the dial. That's a long way back. And, and I, I just think if you're, if your intentions are not honorable and you're not trying to do a good thing for yourself and the customer, you shouldn't make the call.

Speaker 1:          00:47:42       But if you're trying to [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:47:49       so two things I want to point out just to underscore first is that you had two offices, three people, but you very adeptly gave the impression of having a larger company, right? Oh yeah. We were big. We had this big thing, huge hallway. And then number two is this gambit of So-and-so's is going to be in town for two days. Can you take the meeting if you had said, I'm based in La and I'd love to take the meeting and the next two days never would have happened. Right. I don't know why for whatever reason, this psychological judo moves just works so well, but it works for just about everything. Yeah. To this day I'm calling from Hartford, Connecticut.

Speaker 3:          00:48:28       Good. Then I'm going to or will Plainville, Connecticut at the time. DENVER, Colorado as long way off Houston, Texas, by the way, on that swing of 10 yeah. You've got two customers

Speaker 4:          00:48:39       so I, okay, so I have a question. So you're like, just so happens that a bill is going to be in Denver, Colorado next week for two days when you show up. Did they ever ask you while you're in Denver, Colorado?

Speaker 3:          00:48:49       No. They knew it because apparently at that point they would have figured out by then, but who we were. Yeah, I do remember though, visiting TCI and I'm not sure TCI is Iran. I do remember them. I don't know if they're still don't. I Dunno. I think maybe at and t bought them at one point. But anyway, I went in to meet with this fellow and I hit my 11 law. Literally when you asked earlier I at one piece of paper type written 11 lines. That was my whole pitch. That was it.

Speaker 4:          00:49:14       Verse any of these 11 lines. This is like the holy grail.

Speaker 3:          00:49:18       Not really, but I mean it was, we're going to do 24 hour sports, we're going to do college and et Cetera, et cetera. We're going to be financed by Getty. We're going to be financed. We didn't say by getting it right, we expect to be the largest cable provider to turn her. Only had 3 million subscribers at that point. It took us a year to slow. Best. Damn. Yeah, that was fun. But I went to an enemy to TCI and this older gentleman that I was meeting with, I mean he was my age, but he was not a rookie and vice president of something and he had been a broadcaster in Minneapolis and he looked across at me and he, and he kind of smiled and he said, no, this isn't gonna work. You said, you know, we both been in as a tip broadcast. I do know it's going to work.

Speaker 3:          00:49:55       Cable television. I said, you're working for TCI. Well, yeah, he said that. He admitted that we went back and forth a little bit and he said, I'm telling you any, he did just this. He said, I'm telling you it's not going to work, but if it does, I want to be your first customer. I thought trip to Denver, it's been a success and he was in fact the third customer, he didn't, he didn't make it fast. Now it could be the first customer. So a lot of those things just happen on the spot. You have to kind of know all of the general areas you want to go and stay with it and then at, and it still works to this day.

Speaker 4:          00:50:31       This is the first is from Facebook, from Sid Jacobson. Why don't they show Australian rules football, the world's strongest man and sticker tournament's anymore. My favorite part is the second part of this. And what happened to this cool jackets? They're reporters had dual air. So now that the first part, I don't know if it, if it applies perfectly because I have seen if so many channels now world's strongest man for instance. But is there anything that has been that you got rid of? So you didn't take the, the rooftop tennis?

Speaker 3:          00:50:58       No, no. That would never happen. A Australian rules football is actually on ESPN Australia. Got It. All right, so just found its way home. Yeah. It's just found its way back there and not an occasion that will will show there. There are layers of ESPN, ESPN, the mothership, that's what they call, it's like star wars only. It's ESPN sports, the mothership. But then it's to a news and you and Xyz and around the world, but then they have a Australia and so on. And as a matter of fact, it's intriguing. The show Australia, the national, the a cricket championship, right. They sent a crew to Australia, do a lot of uh, preproduction a tape, brought it back and actually produce the cricket championship from Bristol, Connecticut while they were playing in Australia. And you know how that works with satellites? I don't have any idea, but they are an Australian rules. Football is, I'll never forget those guys in the white hats and that was pretty cool. Never it never understood it but it was pretty good.

Speaker 4:          00:51:57       It's a cool sport to for those of you haven't seen these, these athletes, a lot of them have accuracy with kicking that quarterbacks in the u s have with their, with their,

Speaker 3:          00:52:05       no. So it was cool jackets that we used to have one of the cool jackets you're talking about the Getty red, the orange and as soon as possible and practicable we got it.

Speaker 4:          00:52:16       No there's shortly after the check arrived, got rid of the, the right dead poet's society. Slash [inaudible] we used to have to

Speaker 3:          00:52:24       pin little ESPN zone, those jackets that we didn't have them embroidery cause we didn't have the budget. I guess. I don't know why but

Speaker 4:          00:52:32       wait. All right, well I may have to go hunt down one of those jackets for myself. Next question is from Twitter at Neil. Oh Martin, I may be saying that incorrectly. What sports do you wish were more popular on ESPN?

Speaker 3:          00:52:47       There's so many. I mean, I like college football and I like college basketball and Major League Baseball, uh, and I don't know how much more they can put on. Yeah. Um, they just put together a new, 190,000 square foot digital center, new digital center. And in there they have one studio devoted to the NFL only it's a half a football field. They have rising whatever, and they have things that flow down and balconies and stairsteps as you can walk up on all over. Uh, and that's, that's pretty impressive. And I don't know what else they could do for the NFL besides that. I mean, they're, they're doing everything except having Roger Goodell and for breakfast, I guess on odd sport or Esoteric sport that you guys had on in the early days, did you have a particular favorite? You know, we had an amateur boxing series and I've forgotten what it was, what the name who was, but what I remember about it as I was in the Dallas Airport when they had the trains underground, not the way they are now elevated.

Speaker 3:          00:53:48       And I was getting on a train and I heard somebody, I was just stepping through the door and you know, you stepped through the door, closes right behind it. I heard somebody calling me and we were Bob Arum and Don King, I'm getting on. And then somebody said the calling my name and I looked back and here it is and he's pounding on the windows and he wanted to talk to me. But the train pulled out and before he ever got back into the discussion, we signed an agreement with Bob Arum, some of those crazy things. And that happened on a train and the randomness of walking down a tree, a stairs to get on a tram to go to another flight. The guy comes down the door closes, he lost his program chance. Wow. Crazy stuff. I mean that's just the way it was. It's like terrifying.

Speaker 3:          00:54:30       Slash meets like when Harry met Sally, it's kind of like a misconnection don king. But that boxing series to answer the question and that was, that was a really interesting, a lot of boxers, no name boxers at that time when a couple of them I guess did rise through the ranks. That was kind of fun. I'm so glad I'm not a boxing fan. Oh, I am a, I am a huge boxing fan, but uh, also a huge hurling fan. So for those of you who haven't seen it, I definitely recommend checking out the senior nationals of Irish hurling. It will blow your mind. It's like football, meats, Lacrosse, but they're playing with ax handles and can hit each other and hit it like a baseball. It's terrifying. I la, I had, I was invited to do an, uh, an interview in Dublin. We did via Skype and I agreed to do it only if the host would explain to me Irish early, which he did and I used to describe it as two guys with baseball bats and the right hand and left hand betters boxes, the ball on a tee in the middle and the somebody reached in, throws it in the air.

Speaker 3:          00:55:28       They both take mighty swipes at it and hope they miss each other. I'm not so sure. Sometimes they hope they miss each other, then they go right after each other. If you want to see, uh, yeah. What, what the, uh, the Irish do when they're not drinking Guinness. And by the way, the senior nationals are sponsored by Guinness generally. So Internet don't go crazy. Uh, then you should check it out. It is fantastic. We did have those, by the way, at one time. Did you ever see that those early red jackets that had ESPN and the circle around it? The original, I can imagine though. I mean, knowing what the logo looks like. Well, it happens in the jacket. It's one of the greatest marketing stories. Espn ahead in the early days. Let's get into it. We had these red jackets, little logo on the front, the, it wasn't ESB network, it was the ESPN with the lips around it.

Speaker 3:          00:56:15       And we had the bright red jackets and in white on the back it had ESPN and the logo and Scotty Connell said, we, we were credentialed. We could go to college football games. He hired kids and gave him a notebook and a red jacket, send them to any game CBS was doing and said, I want one of you on the 25 yard line, one of you on the 50 yard line and one of you on the other 25 yard line and two more stay with the line of scrimmage backfield and offense. Now if you're familiar with the way of football game was covered cameras around the 25 or 30 yard line. They shoot down field and there's one high in the middle and then there's usually some down in the field near the backfield or the line of scrimmage and so on. So every shot that CBS did that first week had an ESPN logo or product placement right in, right in the middle of Monday morning.

Speaker 3:          00:57:04       The phone rang, we're going to suit you guys, you can't do that. CanNot do that. Scotty said, okay, fine. We're CBS planning. Next week. I did the same thing and after the second week they called and said, alright, we surrender. And so he didn't change very much, but he cut it down I guess from five to three either side. That's about all he did. Mother advertising that case was the necessity was the mother of invention and that one, oh, that's genius. But those red jackets counted a lot. I was in the fourth grade that morning that we had Pearl Harbor, the day of infamy and I've read the, uh, midway and Pearl Harbor and all of the books around that. And I have a library of about, it's probably a hundred to 150 books of, from the early thirties all the way through up to the Vietnam War, Korean War. Coldest winter is one that I would recommend a David Halberstam wrote that one. Coldest butter. Yeah. And there are just, I don't know what it is. I really just enjoy reading it. It's not that I'm, I'm lucky, obviously I'm lucky that I'm here and able to do this, but, uh, the things that people have done for us in this country are amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:58:25       This, this point I think is really important. So only in the last, I would say six months have I started reading more books related to war specifically in this country. And one of the main reasons is that, uh, spoken with a number of folks, including former navy seal commander named Jocko Willink, is very well known. And the point that he makes is that if you want to study human nature, you can learn, and I'm paraphrasing of course, but you can learn so much by looking at it when it's forced to the extremes, when you see the most unbelievable levels of kindness, the most unbelievable levels of brutality and everything in stark relief when you study Warren Warfare. So if you are a student of human nature, which of course transcends this conversation and applies to just about anything, that was one of the points that he made. And just to, to pull it into say new media for a second, if people are wondering if anybody here knows who Casey Neistat is, might have a few hands. He is an extremely well known utuber. He has hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of views, very, very well known a filmmaker. And he says that everything he learned about business and life, he learned from studying World War II. Effectively. It's that powerful. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:59:47       when you say that, just people don't, they think of America. We're just here. We won the war. All our planes were built in the interior of the country because they were worried about Japan coming to the Pacific and in Germany, the submarines were made in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. You think of a submarine, why would you do a submarine and that walkway for safety? Because they had German u boats on the East Coast and Japanese may be, they don't know. On the west coast, like Michigan, the Naval Air Station in plain view had an aircraft carrier in Lake Michigan, and that was where they learned to fly. That's where they got their wings. Who knows? It's gotta be hard to transport. Yeah, but just think about that. Lake Michigan is right outside Chicago, pled will enable it and cleanse your naval air stations right outside Chicago. The navy is training in the middle of the country for two oceans.

Speaker 3:          01:00:41       Why aren't they in the San Diego area or Los Angeles or Philadelphia enabled yards. But you learn, you can really learn a lot about the, the, the operation of life. One thing that I, and I, every time I've mentioned this, somebody is surprised. We always hear about women at work during World War II and especially in the aircraft industry and making those submarines and Manitowoc, Wisconsin, the majority of the labor force were women because they were more able to do the delicate detailed work detail work and the wiring for the wiring. Then for radio and for all of those things with a lot different than right to today. Well today they wouldn't wire that would all be, I'll be at a chip someplace but we never hear about that. Yup. And uh, it was an all out effort, believe me.

Speaker 4:          01:01:35       So this, this is going to be a bit of a left turn, but I want to ask you about it. Your signal, you're signaling at least left turn strike. Oh wait, no, I forgot to, I would be terrible. Empire. I tell you, even worst baseball player, but that's a different story. Your best or one of your best or most worthwhile investments you've ever made. And I want to explain what I mean by that. It could be money, it could be time, it could be energy, could be anything. And an example that comes from, uh, someone I've chatted with separately is Amelia Boone. Amelia Boone's a three time a world's toughest mudder champion. She's the most decorated obstacle course racer in the world. Also a full time attorney at Apple. She's one of the most impressive humans I've ever met. In her answer to that was the entrance fee for her first major competition, which was I think about $450. A huge stretch at the time for her. But she did it and it produced this incredible open door and trajectory to something she never would have anticipated. What are one of your best investment?

Speaker 3:          01:02:33       That $9,000 credit card cash advance?

Speaker 1:          01:02:36       Yeah. I have to tell you, I have to tell you that

Speaker 3:          01:02:44       brief story about that. I spoke to a group of um, Merrill Lynch and I think it was bank of America, all senior executives in Greenwich, Connecticut, some a couple of years ago. And one of the topics that came up in the discussion because these banks like to lend money and you should have bank loans and start your business and we will work with you and we'll do you know, I'm not, I'm not 100% subscriber that. So when it was my turn to speak, I get up and I said, well first of all, you'll all be happy to know that I started ESPN with bank financing and they were all sitting, every single one of them, a tie in pinstripe suits and so on. I said, well, it depends on how you define financing. It was a $9,000 credit card, cash advance. Well, I was talking about an icebreaker that got me through to them, but the real thing that got me through that group was there were a couple of Hartford whaler from New England whalers fans in the audience that salvage that sealed the deal.

Speaker 3:          01:03:41       But to me, he's a speak to a group like that. They all, and I hope I'm not insulting anyone in the audience watching or sitting here today. There is a certain confidence, a certain bearing and feeling that people have because they help others down below them. And as I walked into the room, I was the oldest guy in the room. They were all like some of my kids' age. So they weren't intimidating to me at all. I just, we started talking before the meeting was over there at loosening their ties and we had just a great, great session with them. And, uh, which I think reaching people is part of what you have to do to win here.

Speaker 1:          01:04:29       I want to talk,

Speaker 4:          01:04:30       talk about reaching people in a, in a very particular instance. So when you got that cash advance, $9,000 cash advance on a credit card where you married or are you saying, oh yeah. Okay. So now three kids, couple of them in college doesn't matter. So in today's dollars, I don't know what that would be. It's maybe 40 grand. I'm just pulling a number out. Yeah, I have no idea. It was that, was that a lot of money for you guys at the time? And was that a conversation that you've had that,

Speaker 3:          01:04:56       let me put it in context. We had a drawer in the kitchen, a little counter and so on. And the checkbook was it there? You know, cause then we wrote, wrote, check, we didn't have all this internet stuff. I couldn't pay no bill payer. Right. And I was writing a check in, my youngest son walked by me and he said, is everything all and all, he was kind of concerned and I was, cause I hit the checkbook laying there and we open the checkbook is, it was just before pay day and he said that can't be right. And there were 17 cents in the bank account, not in the bank but in the checkbook. Right. 17 cents. And he said, are you worried? And I said, why? He said, well that's not gonna. You know, we're not going far. He was a maybe a junior in college at that point. But I never, I never had any doubt because pay day came and I know something else would happen. And obviously did what's your wife were at all? No. Nope. Nope. Nope. She was, she was nearly 11 bullet points. She knew all of it right down the line yet. She was there for 56 years. She was there. So it was okay. That's incredible.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:06:10       if we had a golf ball, how would ask you about golf with one of this country's presidents? I was hoping you could maybe tell us a little bit about golf. I think it was with George. Yeah, George 41 so tell us about, I think there's one part in particular. Oh, well yeah, I would, maybe I was a little irreverent, but, well, yeah, I was invited to play with President Bush and a Naples, Florida, and a, and just a great guy. We went out and met the only appropriate people, went to the driving range, did all that, had pictures, you know, thousand pictures taken and so on. And then we started playing and we all hit on the green first green and, and he was maybe, I dunno, three or four feet from the, from the, uh, the hole. And he was a golfer. He used as longs, the long putter where he put it up under his Chin and gave the, you know, putting like this and he kept swinging back and forth and, and like, okay, who's going to give me the Putt? You know, because I guess you're supposed to. But, so after about the fourth time he stepped back again, they looked over at us and I, I don't know why I said, it's just one of those things I said, presidential privilege only goes so far. Putt.

Speaker 1:          01:07:29       [inaudible] he looked up and he

Speaker 3:          01:07:38       smiled and he said, game on. And so we had a $2 bet for the game and I had to put this long at the, on the 18th. And obviously since he didn't get the first one you with a bucket and I missed it and he made his butt and one the whole and one of the $2 and took the ball out and said, I want you to have this in honor of losing $2 to me. But I don't know why I said that to him. It was probably inappropriate, but he cracked up. Seems to have turned out pretty well when you fly. Fly by the cuff. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:10       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          01:08:23       hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a few more things before you take off. Number one, this is five bullet Friday. Do you want to get a short email from me? Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a little morsel of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering over the week. That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered. It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've somehow dug up in the uh, the world of the esoteric as I do. It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my close friends for instance. And it's very short. It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend. So if you want to receive that, check it out.

Speaker 5:          01:09:13       Just go to a four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very next one. And if you sign up, I hope you enjoy it. This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic, founded by the genius Fin's who that the Internet on fire and the, you may have heard of their mushroom coffee, which features Chaga and lion's mane, which has taken Silicon Valley by storm. I use it pretty much every day, either that or the Chaga, which is decaf and a separate version. And I use both of these primarily for focus and productivity. They just get you going let you up like a Christmas street, so he's definitely check it out. People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement and for right now this is the answer. I try to force this on all of my house guests.

Speaker 5:          01:10:06       It is a hell of a thing if I have employees or people come over who are working on projects with me, I always try to feed it to them because I'm going to get the limitless effect and get a lot more out of them. The first time I mentioned this product and four sigmatic on the podcast, their products sold out in less than a week, so you may want to check them out soon. If you're listening to this and the coffee tastes like coffee, it takes just seconds to prepare with hot water and oddly enough only includes 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would get in a regular cup of coffee. I don't get any jitters, acid reflux or any stomach burn, any of that. It's very unusual and very, very cool. So if you don't like caffeine, they also offer very strong, but caffeine free mushroom elixirs, which I will sometimes have in the evening.

Speaker 5:          01:10:55       I find Chaga specifically to be very, very grounding and earthy. So that is another option. And I have a cupboard full of their products, uh, at the moment, which is right around the corner of my kitchen. You can try something, you can try a sample pack, which is great also right now by going to foursigmatic.com/tim that's foursigmatic, f, O, u, R s, I g, m a t I c.com, forward slash Tim and use the Code Tim Tim to get 20% off your first order and they're not that expensive. Anyway, if you are in the experimental mindset, I do not think you'll be disappointed to trim up. This episode is brought to you by a sense protein. I am really excited about this discovery. I became aware of these guys when I found out that they'd spent five years trying to manufacture a better version of weight protein.

Speaker 5:          01:11:42       And the result is something called native proteins, which represents cleaner, purer, less processed protein. So here's a mini tutorial. There are only a handful of companies worldwide that can extract native proteins directly from mill traditional whey protein. What you've probably bought before is a byproduct of making cheese. So a company must have the resources, no hell and a large customer base to invest in extracting proteins directly from the milk without the ability to also profit from the associated cheese. That means the net net is native proteins are super rare. So a sentence, the only us based company that offers native proteins both way and my seller casing directly to a consumer, they're able to do that because the parent company Laprino is a huge cheese manufacturer. They've been filtering proteins for more than 30 years and there are a few important things to take away from this.

Speaker 5:          01:12:35       Number one, zero artificial ingredients that is a solid claim is much stricter than all natural. Number two, they've done extensive testing. So the chocolate which I've been using after every workout and also in the mornings because uh, finalized after 282 recipes were vetted and perhaps most important, I talked about less processed. They avoid steps like leaching and this is important to understand so it's, it's a very big deal but hasn't yet caught on for sports nutrition. Traditional whey proteins are a byproduct of cheese making. Like I mentioned, many of the proteins are therefore orange in color because they were sourced from say cheddar cheese production because companies can't sell orange powders of Noah or strawberry. They have to bleach the proteins white. This harms the proteins and leaves trace amounts of bleach in the product. That is no Winham, no good infant formula companies, for instance, abandon banned the use of bleach proteins already in in their products and that is why a sense parent company, Leprino foods is the number one supplier of protein, infinite formula companies.

Speaker 5:          01:13:40       So all that said, if you want cleaner, pure, less process protein, I certainly do and I'm really excited to be using this protein and I just ran out of chocolate so I need another bag.
