Speaker 2:          00:39          at this altitude, I can flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. Also, I'm a cybernetic organism living above too.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Perhaps jump into some rapid fire questions and they don't have to even be rapid fire quest or the quiet, just some fire questions. The questions will be rapid. The answers can be as short or as long as you'd like. What book or books have you do you gift or have gifted the most other people outside of your own books?

Speaker 3:          01:22          There is a short graphic novel by Daniel Pink Cold Juco and it's career counsel advice. It's aimed at young people. It's a graphic novel. It's a cartoon and basically, and it's Andy young people is trying to teach them how to be become indispensable and I've given that away to young people because it's for me the best summary of it. Again, it's not like how to become successful. It's how to become indispensable to,

Speaker 1:          01:52          that's right. It's a adventures of Johnny Bunko or something like that. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. I have that on my bookshelf back in San Francisco. In fact, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:01          If you know a young person who is just starting out, hand him that book, it's very easy for them to read cause graphic novel. It's non nonthreatening. It's fun and it will give us like five great principals for, I'm starting out and helping them kind of orient themselves as a start working in, in the working life.

Speaker 1:          02:22          For someone who's facing a lot of the same questions, let's just say, so you have graduates asking the what should I do? Why am I here? What am I good at? If we fast forward to say for the sake of argument and mid thirties right? People in Middle Age hitting that particular point. Are there any books that you would recommend they read?

Speaker 3:          02:39          There is a book that I'm recommending like cal Newport is called so good they can't ignore you. This changed my mind because I had kind of bought into the kind of new age California dogma, a follow your bliss, you know the money will follow and he makes a really good argument and convinced me actually not very good advice that what you really want to do is to master something and to use your mastering of something as a way to get to your passion. So if you start with just passion, it's sort of paralyzing because, and I know this from my own kids, they have 18 they really don't know what they're passionate about. I mean some people are lucky enough to know and a lot of people aren't. So this is, this is a book for people who don't kind of really know what they're really excellent at.

Speaker 3:          03:30          I don't really know what they're passionate about and his premise is that you master something almost anything at all. It just something you master and you use that mastery to kind of move you into a place where you can begin to have passion and that you kind of keep recycling that the way you find your passion is through mastery rather than the other way around, which is people think that they're going to get their mastery through passion and I kind of believe that former, you know that Matt and the passion would lead to mastery, but after thinking about it, looking at his examples in his argument, I'm pretty sure that for these, for most people you can get to your passion through mastery and that would also give you a currency or a lever to use in getting to that point. Exactly. Excellent. Do you have a favorite fiction book?

Speaker 3:          04:18          Yes. Fantastic. I usually don't get one answer, and this is great shot to Ron shots. It might take me a way to explain this, but it's, it's a one author wrote one book cause it's very autobiographical. The premise of the book and the author's life seems completely incredulous and kind of almost Hollywoodish. But what you get from it and the where it's set, it's set in India, sets in the slums of India and you get a credibly vivid, immersive deep and in some ways uplifting view of India. And the underworld in India ended that part of Asia. And the, the main protagonist is this very interesting zen criminal. He's sort of a coyote trickster blend of someone who is, you know, he does bad things but at the same time he's sorry about it and he has a kind of a cosmic perspective. It's very, very unusual.

Speaker 3:          05:26          But it's a long book and I actually recommend that people are going to try to, is it you actually to get the audible version listened to it. It runs like, you know, on and on. But it'd be one of those books that you, that you wish will never end. And I'll just tell you the beginning of it, which is that, and this is the true part, which is that the guy, the author became a bank robber in New Zealand. He was hooked on drugs, started robbing banks, was eventually caught and escaped from prison and he made his way to the slums of India where because he had a medical kit, he was treated as a doctor, gotten involved and hooked on drugs in India. I got involved with the mafia, was put into prison, tortured, left, abandoned, nobody knew and even in there started writing a book. He, we have to wrote this book. They ripped it up, destroyed it. He was recruited, found a guru, an Afghany was recruited and Ima Jean was fighting their kids. Entire company was wiped out. I mean this, that's just the beginning. That's like the first day.

Speaker 1:          06:28          It's really interesting that you would bring him Sean from for those people who haven't heard of Josh Waitzkin. I also had him on this podcast. Josh was the basis for searching for Bobby Fischer at the book and the movie Worldclass Chess Player, also very deep soulful guy. And this is one of his favorite books as well. Oh yeah, you would, you would love Josh sometime. I'll have to put you guys in touch, but any favorite documentaries?

Speaker 3:          06:52          Well, now you're, you've asked the wrong question because I have a site called true films for the past 10 years I have reviewed the best documentaries and actually have a book called true films, which is the 200 best documentaries that you should see.

Speaker 1:          07:08          Oh my God, no kidding. Wow. You have no idea how timely this is. So it's to a t r u e films stuck up

Speaker 3:          07:13          true films. And so I, there are a couple of films that I would say have sort of universal appreciation. Like you know, they might have like a rating of like a hundred or rotten tomatoes or something. So the one documentary that I think everybody that I know who've seen it, his love to his man on wire, such a good movie, transcendent, it's just a beautiful movie. It's based on the fact that this guy basically he's going to walk to twin towers. I mean he, the moment was, he was like 14 year old kid in France was at a dentist office looking at a magazine and he saw that they were, had plans to build this twin tower in New York and he saw those two twin towers and he said, I need to walk between them. He didn't know how to type, walk the towers and not been built. He was already planning this thing and he was filming himself the whole way.

Speaker 1:          08:03          Yeah. So amazing.

Speaker 3:          08:04          Okay. And so he does, he does it. And how he does it is amazing. So another great documentary that I love because it's very unusual among documentaries and films, the villain side of the whole thing as well, which is King of calm.

Speaker 1:          08:19          Oh I haven't, this has been recommended to me. I still have not seen this.

Speaker 3:          08:23          King of Kong is about a guy who becomes the video game, arcade game, King of Kong. He becomes the champion. But he is basically competing against this cabal of people who were trying suits of vert him. And are doing all kinds of really terrible things to stop, which is all on film. And so here's this really kind of Midwest and really lovable guy and you're rooting for him the whole time. While these really sleazy guys are trying to take him down,

Speaker 1:          08:53          it's just fantastic. I have to watch that.

Speaker 3:          08:56          So that's the second one. The third one is one that's not so well known but a, it's called state of mind. And it's about the spectacles in North Korea, which these two filmmakers had access to when they filed several different young athletes who were practicing for the spectical. And in the spectacles of course what it is is people are pixels. You know they have these like huge stadium size things in there, like a little robots that are cogs in this machine, which is like perfect. So you can imagine like you know like a picture that's made up of pixels, but every pixel is actually was a little boy or girl holding up a card colored cards in sequence. So these things move, which means that, you know, there's not a pixel missing. So let me that nobody's sick is like, you know this, you're not allowed to be sick. You can't make a mistake at all, and it's getting inside of North Korea, which turns out to be a nationwide cult, and I think that in 50 years when they're gone, nobody will believe that that was even possible. And this documentary will be there saying, no, no, no. They really was a nationwide called and they really did believe this. It really is amazing to see what's going on there.

Speaker 1:          10:06          All right, well I know, I know what I'm doing for the next few days. Next few evenings.

Speaker 3:          10:10          Well, I could go on unfortunately because I have a lot of them, but go to the truth. I only review when's it are? Great. So I don't do I just saying these are fantastic.

Speaker 1:          10:20          Oh Man. All right. I've been looking for this. I cannot believe that I'm only learning this now. I'm kind of embarrassed about that. When you think of the word or hear the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind?

Speaker 3:          10:31          Jesus.

Speaker 1:          10:32          All right. Why would you say that?

Speaker 3:          10:34          Well, there aren't that many people who've left their mark on as many people in the world as he has. I think what he was up to, what he was doing, his, you know, fastly been twisted, misunderstood, whatever word you want. But nonetheless, what's remarkable is, and here's the guy who didn't write anything. So I think success is also overrated.

Speaker 1:          11:01          Love you to elaborate on that.

Speaker 3:          11:04          Greatness is overrated. A lot of, you know, I mentioned big numbers but she's, but it's more of the impact they had on people's lives, but I think we tend to have an image of success that's so much been skewed by our current media. It's like our sense of beauty. I mean it's sort of like in terms of all possibilities is in a very small, narrow, defined his own kind of ritualistic in a certain sense. I think our idea of success is often today. It means you know, somebody who has a lot of money or who has a lot of fame or who has some of these other trappings which we assign but I think can be successful in by being true to and kind of being the most you that you could possibly be. And I think that's what I think of is one of the things that Jesus, whether you take them as just a historical character or anything beyond was, was about, he certainly wasn't imitating anybody.

Speaker 3:          11:59          I mean put it that way. I mean I think that's the, the great temptation that people have is they want to be someone else, which is basically they want to be in someone else's movie. You know, they want to be the best rockstar. And there's so many of those already that you can only went up imitating somebody in that, in that slot. And I think to me the success is like you make your own slot, you have a new slot that didn't exist before and I think that's of course it would use as many others were doing. But it was there were kind of making, making a new slot and that's really hard to do. But I think that's what I chalk up as success is you made a new slot. What is your new slot?

Speaker 1:          12:38          You knew, you knew that was guy who says I'm successful. I mean I'm trying to not make any assumptions here. Or what would be your slot?

Speaker 3:          12:48          Well, my slide would be Kevin Kelly. I mean, I mean that's the whole thing. It's not going to be like a career or you would really ideally be something that was, you had no, no imitators. I mean you would be who you are and that's, that is success actually in some senses is you didn't entertain anybody. No one else had mutated you afterwards. So you know, in a certain sense you have, if you become an adjective, that's a good sign. Right? So I think success is actually, you kind of make your own path. If they're calling you a successful entrepreneur, then to me that's not the best kind of success because you're being confined to the category, right? You're in a category.

Speaker 1:          13:30          If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it

Speaker 3:          13:33          I could sing. You would like to sing? Yeah. I seem to be unable to carry a tune and I can't remember when my wife can hear something once and she can just sing it back later. I, I could hear the same song I have here at the same song and I couldn't tell you three notes of it. I'm sure because I'm a Tim Ferriss Fan. I'm sure I could train myself to eat that. I know I could, but I, I guess I haven't and it would be something that I have to really work at and I haven't, but I have trouble carrying it tunes, staying in tune, remembering a tune. I love music and I appreciate it, but in terms of actually singing and or play, I don't play an instrument so maybe I would say a little easier for me. That'd be something nice.

Speaker 1:          14:17          Have you taken lessons or attempted to take lessons? No, I got it just in the spirit of trade. I've recently started exploring hand drumming with Jim, Jim Bays and different types of drums. If anyone out there can get me a pan art hang, I would really love to hear from you. Those of you that will mean nothing to most people are hearing this. The research that has peaked my curiosity most recently and of course you don't want to run out and just start swallowing these things, but there's a common auntie epilepsy drug called Valproate, which apparently has some implications for opening a window for achieving perfect pitch in mature adults. Very fascinating stuff. Wow. Uh, south I five. I do any experiments with that. I will, I will certainly report back.

Speaker 3:          15:05          Well now that you've talked about it, not the drug part, but I did remember I did take one class that you mentioned the drums. It took a one class at a, an adult summer camp, which are highly recommended. If your kids go to camp, you should go with them. And it was a steel drum. Oh, cool. Course. And I love that. So like you, I think if I did take up an instrument it would be drums of some sort. Because of that, I seem to respond to it and I did pretty good for the, for the intro course on steel drumming,

Speaker 1:          15:32          I find percussion to be so primal. Just satisfied some type of need that probably predates, yes, verbal communication even certainly certainly written notes. Right.

Speaker 3:          15:44          Is your inner cave man just respond?

Speaker 1:          15:47          Are there any particular, let's just say in the first two hours of your day, any particular morning rituals or habits you have that when performed consistently you find produce better days for you and I'm leaving better days undefined on purpose, but I love studying mornings and or what people do when they wake up. What time do you wake up? Are there any particular habits or rituals that you find contribute to better days?

Speaker 3:          16:13          Yeah. Yeah. I'm a very good sleeper. I don't sleep a lot these days. I get up at seven 30 and I have some rituals, but I don't vary them enough maybe to to know whether they are a, I'm not a morning person. Okay. To begin with. You're not a morning person. Well, I mean, well, the fact that you don't vary them as perfect necessarily optimized in any way or, or I can't tell which is better, but for better or worse when the first things I do is I read the paper version of the New York Times, it's a kind of like a, so what I call a guilty pleasure. I don't know whether that makes me better at anything else I do, but, um, I don't drink coffee or anything and this is sort of my, um, it's a ritual and when I'm not here, I don't read it. So it's like I don't miss it. It's kind of a hearing. Yes. But like if I'm here, it's like I got to do it. I don't know. It's kind of weird.

Speaker 1:          17:07          Is that immediately after waking you read the paper or is there anything

Speaker 3:          17:10          can just about, I just kind of in my pajamas, I walk out to the front gate and I pick it up and um, I read it. I mean, and I don't read all of it. I just kind of go through and I usually don't even read the news part or read the slower stuff. I make sure why, uh, now that you're asking and that's it. That's the entire ritual. I don't have the same thing for breakfast or anything like that. It's just that morning hit.

Speaker 1:          17:37          Do you do anything throughout your day regularly? Maybe it's before bed or anything else that, that most other people probably don't do? That's a

Speaker 3:          17:46          good question. Um, no, really. Okay. I have no special sauce, but you're very consistent. You don't, your days seem to be very, very widely. So that in and of itself might be something that a lot of people don't. Okay. Let's pick up two different, while I'm here in this studio, I have a lot of control over my time and so what I do during the day is, is greatly varied. I'll, you know, I'll do a lots of things for short amounts of times and you'll go into my workshop, I'll read, actually read books it down and read bookstore in the middle of the day. I'll do a hike and bring my camera almost every day. It may be that it's something that most people don't do as probably, they probably aren't taking pictures with a camera every day or reading books in the middle of the day for that man. Right, exactly. Well, maybe that's true.

Speaker 3:          18:37          I guess. How do you choose your books? Ah, that's, that's a paradox of choice probably for a lot of, for a lot of people it is just like where do you go listen to next one? Music, I think the music becomes free and everybody has all the music in the world, but deciding what you're going to listen to becomes the thing you pay for. And I, and I, this has been my prediction about Amazon is that we're soon going to have like any book you want for free, Amazon prime, you digital version of it. You can have it whenever you want, but you will pay for us for the recommendations. Um, that's a great point. That's a great point. I have a network of friends and I listened to lots of podcasts so I get them from all over the place and like probably you are this point I long ago decided that in terms of the greater scheme of things, the cost of books were really cheap and if I wanted to book I would buy it.

Speaker 3:          19:24          And the result is I am right now speaking in a two story high library of books that they have and adult to the same with digital books because I finally figured out that, oh, you know, if I purchase it do you could do two, but before I'm reading it, it's not going anywhere. It's just sitting there. So I shouldn't really purchase a digital book until like five seconds before I'm going to read it. I have exactly the opposite habit because right, because it's like, well it's there. The whole point of kindle is that you don't have to have it until like you need it. So on the digital books, I don't buy anything until like I'm seconds away from reading it, then I'll get it. But the paper books, I was near to the point of actually digitizing, getting rid of all my paper books. I was that close about five years ago.

Speaker 3:          20:12          But then I had an epiphany. I went to a private library and I realized that books were never as cheap as they are today and there never will be as cheap and that there's some power about having these things in paper. Always available, no batteries, you know, never obsolete. And that if you made a library now, you would never be able to make some of these libraries in 50 years. And so I decided to keep and to kind of cultivate this paper library as a, you know, as something that was going to be very powerful in the future. I like that, or

Speaker 1:          20:48          at least I can use it as a justification for keeping a lot of paper books around.

Speaker 3:          20:52          I get tips from books, from podcasts, from blogs, from friends, from Amazon recommendations anywhere. And whenever I hear someone recommended book, I'll go and check it out. And then I'm fairly free in buying it. But, which means I read a lot of really mediocre books. Well that's part of my job, right? That's cool tools. The book that we were just talking about, which is this catalog of possibilities that I self published that has, oh, I don't know, 1500, you know, maybe there's a couple of hundred books that are recommended, but I probably read thousands and thousands and thousands of books in order to select those. So I see part of my job reading through, and I read a lot of how to books. Most of the books I'm reading is nonfiction. And a lot of it is even instructional stuff on, you know, how to build a stone wall, how to do Origami, how to send a sale like micro satellite into space. Whatever it is, it doesn't matter. I will look at it and I've seen tens of thousands, if not 50,000, how to books over my lifetime. I can spot a really good one, but still I'll read through the, um, the other ones in order so that someone else doesn't have to. And I can recommend saying this is the best book on building a tiny house. If you want to build a tiny house.

Speaker 1:          22:07          Do you, when you read these books on Origami or Stonewall, do you follow through and attempt these projects or are you evaluating it purely based on your amassed experience of reading lots of these types of instructional books?

Speaker 3:          22:21          No, actually, so maybe one of the other things that I don't do every day, but one of the things I do in general that maybe everyone else is not doing is that I have like a thousand hobbies. I dabble in things. So I have built stone walls more than one. I have done Origami, I have made beer, I have made wine, I have, you know, whatever it is. I, I've tried to do these things in my life and I continued to try and do them. I have homeschool my son, I have, and so as much as possible, this is what my, you know, I was talking before about my day. It's irregular in a sense that I'm here and I have things, but I'm doing new things and I'm reading new things all the time. So I'm in my outside, um, you know, make a go card or we'll, um, do something that they haven't done before and that's the basis for helping decide about these books. I don't have to be an expert in it, but I can know enough to tell whether or not the information they're telling me is, is useful.

Speaker 1:          23:20          What od project over the last year has been the most fun? Let's start there for you. Yeah. Well, just the last couple of months, Charlie

Speaker 3:          23:28          built myself a real workshop and wish I could show it to you because of the cool things that did, it was, you know, if you go onto like a you line or somewhere is container businesses, they have these racks of bins. So I filled an entire wall of hundreds and hundreds of bins, so, so I can organize this stuff. And, uh, I'm a big fan of Adam Savage and he has, he has a principle for his workshops called first order access, which basically means that you don't want to store things behind anything. Everything has to be at the first level so you can look and see. It has to be within reach in the sense that you have to be able to see everything that you have and it's accessible. You don't want things hidden behind other things. Right. So that's part of what I was doing with this workshop is this kind of first order access.

Speaker 3:          24:19          And it's true, this really powerful. I mean I just, the few days or the weeks I've had working in it is just transforms everything. It's like I had the same problem with my books for many, many years. I had books like on multiple different bookshelves in the house ahead of inboxes ahead, I'm this and that and moving everything to one location until library where there was two stories, I could see all my books just transform them. It made it really useful because I could find them just really go and reach for them. And the same thing with finding, bringing it to my tools, which is that you want to have things plugged in, ready to go, labeled, organized first order access. And it can make simple jobs really simple instead of like the, you know, the hours of looking for something,

Speaker 1:          25:06          right. Gathering all the tools, all the tools. And also it's just like what's happening, like a manual random access memory. Right. You have your me some plots right in front of you. You know the tools are, yeah, that's very cool. If there were one object, manual project building something that you think every human should have the experience of doing, what would that be? It was very easy. We need to build your own house.

Speaker 3:          25:32          Which shelter and it's not that hard to do. Believe me, I actually, I built my own house. And your house is amazing. I know that. Not this house, I mean I actually built one from cutting down the logs, cutting down the trees in upstate New York and doing the stone hers. And we, you know, I mean unfortunately I don't recommend this. We made like two by fours from trees. You don't want to do that because it's a pain. Because you know, standard, standard lumber is very, it's very good. If it was, things were awful little quarter of an inch as they are with rough sawn lumber is just, it's a mess. But nonetheless, a large portion of the people in the world have made their own homes, Adobe rammed, earth, bamboo, whatever it is. And like going back to what we originally started off with, um, even if you don't wind up living in it, it's empowering to know that you can do it for, if you do wind up living in it.

Speaker 3:          26:22          I have a friend Lloyd Khan who built his magnificent place in Bolinas that he built was salvaged material from, from scratch over the many years. It gives you the power to alter its. So I believe that that your house should be an extension of you, that that really is another projection. So another way of, and also going back to what we're talking about and another we have to who you are and to discover what you're good at and because a well designed house should really reflect you. And, and what I've discovered, let people design houses and they have this kind of imaginary fantasy idea about themselves and what they're going to do. Well, you know, whatever it is, they're going to um, have a swimming pool, you know, it's like they're never going to use the swimming pool, whatever it is. I mean, very few people actually have a very good sense of who they are and what they're going to use something for. But if you really study yourself and really are honest and designed something, that space can help you become successful in the sense of making it a slot for you, making your own slot. And it's another, it's both a kind of a byproduct of who you are and also can help you because it works both ways.

Speaker 1:          27:30          I like that. Right. You're not just finding yourself, you're creating yourself.

Speaker 3:          27:33          Exactly. And, and that, so this is a larger philosophical question, but this is something I talk about a lot in a very high dimensional space, which means like space of many pending possibilities. The act of finding in the act of creating are identical. There's no difference between discovering something in inventing something. You could be, we could say that philosophically, you know, Benjamin Franklin invented late tricity. We could say that Christopher Columbus invented America. We could say that discovery and invention are the same so that discovering yourself in defending yourself is really the same things bring about that process. You have to do both at once.

Speaker 1:          28:17          I really enjoy that. Last question, if you could give your, let's say you can pick the age, either 15 or 20 year old self, one or a few pieces of advice, what would they be?

Speaker 3:          28:31          You don't have to do everything yourself. You can hire people to do stuff. I wish I had known that when I was younger. I wish that I had when I was 20 working for whole earth catalog. I wish I'd known that I could've hired a programmer to do something. I could have hired someone. It took me a long time to understand that and then recently I've been really big on it. Hiring people through e lance, you know, because I came from a little bit of kind of a duty yourself. I mean, I made a nature museum when I was 12 at a chemistry lab. They built myself, you know, building the stuff and I could buy in the classroom, but I had a whole chemistry lab, I had nature museums, I did all this stuff and I did it myself. And then of course, moving into the whole earth catalog, which was a kind of a do yourself thing.

Speaker 3:          29:19          I really was, um, you know, I just talked about building my own house. Well now I will hire professionals to work. And it just took me a long time to realize that there's something about being able to pay a professional to do what they do really well is not like a weakness. It's like it helps them. I'm happy, they're happy, we're happy, and I can do a lot more now. There's certainly a pleasure in doing things yourself in dabbling it. But there's also this other thing, which I didn't realize, which is there's, there's this leverage that you get by hiring people who are really good paying them, fairly, working with them to amplify what it is that you want to do. And I wish I knew that when I was younger.

Speaker 1:          30:05          That's a fantastic answer. And you have, if I remember correctly, an assistant and a researcher. Is that, is that still true? Yeah, it's one of the same person. Oh, they are the same. Okay. Yeah. So I thought that at one point you had believed that you needed those people to be two separate people. But

Speaker 3:          30:21          here's what I was saying was that it's very unusual to find one person who can do both of those tasks. Both of those tasks are often not found the same person because there's, you know, the hunting, the researching, the kind of, there's a hunter aspect to research. There's often found in a certain personality and then they're kind of the, the Admin is more of, um, you know, your training kind of, um, making sure things, a gardening a little bit. And so it's often rare to find someone who can do both, but as possible.

Speaker 1:          30:57          Was it luck that you happened upon this particular individual that you work with now or did you have a method for? Was there a particular approach that the forum for it,

Speaker 3:          31:07          uh, found that the place where I found over the 14 years I've had to, the place where I found that there were more likely than not to have a combination was librarians. I love it. That's fantastic. So we uh, put out notices on the librarian mailing lists and stuff.

Speaker 1:          31:27          That is fantastic. I said, last question, this will be the last question is, is there any other thoughts or advice you'd like to leave with the listeners and then where would you like people to find more from you? You're writing anywhere else?

Speaker 3:          31:41          I would say congratulations to the people who are listening to the podcasts. I think podcasts are of this fantastic new medium. I'm spending a lot of time there. I think it's just really great. We're in the early days of where this would go. I'm really impressed by the power of this medium to teach and to inform sometimes to entertain. Again, I'm thankful to you, Tim, for having me on and having a chance to gab here, but to the people who are listening, I think keep going. Listen to more podcasts. Uh, tried to go wide and know 10 mentions them here and there. Take a chance, listen to some more. So that's one thing I would say. And as far as finding out more about me, I lucked out with a very easy website. It's my initials, KK, kk.org I have very public email for past 25 years.

Speaker 3:          32:29          You can find it very easily on my website if you want to email directly. I have not outsourced that. Unlike other people that I know and my writings and books and whatnot, or at dub dub, dub. Dot kk.org cool tools is a book that I really believe that each of you out there should have. It's on paper. It's sort of the best of the website. Cool tools, which has been going on for 11 years now, where we review every day one great tool there, only positive reviews. Why waste your time on anything but the best and tools in the broadest sense of the word of things that are useful, whether it's a lance or a book on how to, um, do psychedelics or a book on how to build a workshop or how to build a house or how to hitchhike around the world. I and others recommend the best here with some great context and it's printed on paper, are available on Amazon. Not so easily fan of bookstores cause it because it's huge. I mean it's, it's like, it's like five pounds ways is really, really big. And if you don't find like 500 things in there you didn't know about that you wish you knew about, like last year, I'll give you your money back. So enjoy that. So that's that. A cool tools or cool tools and Amazon.

Speaker 1:          33:47          Excellent. Well Kevin, this has been a blast. It always is. Every time we chat I feel like we should chat more. So hopefully we'll get a chance to spend some more time together soon back in nor cal or somewhere else. I know Orange Shyna it's been a long time. I could get back. I'm ready.

Speaker 3:          34:04          I'm headed back to Japan again. And I know that you have lots of roots in, in Asia, but, um, I go there to renew my sense of the future because they are, you know, they're bulldozing the past as fast as it can and we're headed racing into the future. And so, uh, I want to see what Asia has in store for us because mathematically we don't count anymore. The whatever, the 3 billion Asians and you know, 300 million Americans, what can you say?

Speaker 1:          34:32          Yeah, that's right. So steady up folks. Specialization is for insects. I think that was Heinlein. So enjoy your time on this planet and look broadly like, like Kevin said, Kevin, thank you so much. I will talk to you soon and, uh, have a wonderful day. I'll talk to you soon. Thanks for having me too. Okay, bye. Bye.
