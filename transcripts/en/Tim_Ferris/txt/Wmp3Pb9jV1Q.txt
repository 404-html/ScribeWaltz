Speaker 1:          00:01          So it is cold. It is miserable on a Friday here in California. And I was in San Jose and I thought to myself, why even bother? I should just do something completely unproductive. So I came up here to Berkeley to do what any emotional eater would do and that is consumed massive quantities of chocolate at one of my favorite chocolate makers in the world. Scharffen Berger here in Berkeley. So let's go kill my pancreas. So here we are here with dried and Brian, what's your job? What's your full name? Is My name Rankin's here. And I am a, uh, and uh, just here you, uh, show you a little bit about what we do here and uh, take some chocolate. All right, so this, this is an excuse for me to eat massive quantities, a chocolate and a have insulin, pour out my eyeballs and just have a good time in the process.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Those of you who follow me in and the blog and know that my diet, Saturday's my off days. So Saturday I'm Olathe anything. I want it, it's Friday. So I'm taking it in a bit early this week. Uh, but generally at night I will have a nightcap of a glass or two of wine and some relaxing listening to music as well as a couple of nibs of chocolate. Uh, usually the higher cocoa concentrations. But I'm going to let you take the floor and just walk us through what we have here. Sounds good. Well this is our, uh, this is our current line up here. We have a number of different chocolates. Um, here on, on our right here we have our extra dark, which is an 82% kick content. Now that that could count content, uh, really signifies the amount of the percentage of this bar that comes from the podium.

Speaker 1:          01:45          So 82% of that is, is from the cocoa beans and 18% is, is sugar and a small amount of vanilla and a small amount of western. So this is our darkest chocolate. If you're looking at, you know, pure Cacau Coco Punch. Um, then we have our 70% or 62. All right, this is our, this is our, and then we have our milk chocolate and milk chocolate is 41% get cow, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it actually is. That's a very, very dark milk chocolate. Really gives a great combination of both no flavor and also a chocolate flavor. And then we have a new bar that we just came out with, which is our milk Coleman, um, with uh, with sea salt, which has, which is our traditional milk chocolate with almonds, dusted with sea salt, sort of that sweet and sour or sweet and salty flavor.

Speaker 1:          02:36          And then we have a limited edition bar that we came up with recently, which is a blend of several different, very unique beans from Trinidad, Grenada, the Dominican Republic. And also then as well. So, you know, this I saw earlier in the shop and I was excited to try it because this, this version over here, the 70% is actually really what I use along with the guitar. They make some good, uh, but the Scharffen Berger 70% is what I've used to make truffles. I took classes with a chocolate tier in Saratoga, which is a nice small town you might have visited before. Also great for motorcycle riding. And so I have a lot of experience with the 70%, but I'm looking forward to tasting the full spectrum or at least taking us through a tasting of Chaga. Cause I think most people they would be familiar with the concept of wine tasting.

Speaker 1:          03:26          Maybe they know a few different types of wine. Sure. Uh, perhaps even tea. They know a few different types of tea, but shut people of chocolate. I think they might think of dark and milk chocolate, but really not much beyond that distinction chair. Um, and just, just for the sake of giving people a full idea, white chocolate, my understanding isn't even shop, isn't it? It's the cocoa butter and or well it is technically chocolate according to the FDA. Okay. Um, but it's uh, it actually has in it is chocolate because it contains a component of, of cocoa beans, which is the, which is the cocoa butter. Right. However, it doesn't have as, as you can tell, it's, it's white. It doesn't have the cocoa solids, which loosely translated, it's really the cocoa powder. So it doesn't have the, a lot of the components that are healthy food.

Speaker 1:          04:13          Right. And uh, and it's oftentimes very sweet. Okay, cool. Well, let's, uh, what else do we have here? So at least I see the samples here, but what are we looking at right here? And then here we had, we just had, these are some raw cocoa beans from Madagascar and then we have this year is some, some nibs from Madagascar. This is from this next one is from a farm in Trinidad. And then we also have a selection from a deep in the glory and the mountains of Venezuela. Um, these beans have you come on horseback to get to us. So wow. Or a long trip from Venezuela to, well, it also area and also involve the garbage, getting them out of the mountain. So it took a while. So it's a very unique being in terms of it's genetics and the nibs. Are those just ships from the cocoa beans?

Speaker 1:          05:08          Yeah, essentially nibs are cocoa beans that have been roasted and then had to show him. Okay. So you wouldn't want to show those, you wouldn't want to chew on these. But if you roasted them and took the shell off and sometimes they're hard to take off button, we can see that there is a show sort of like uh Oh reskin sure. A little bit harder. Then inside of there is actual those bids. It's a, yeah, it's the sort of immediate, the bean, the caudal Eden's of the seats per product developer. Right. That's your technical title. Um, your product developers at companies like Yahoo and other places. But I think being a product developer at Scharffen Berger and means something quite different. So what, what is your job? What do you actually do as a product developer? Well, it's uh, it's in general, it's research and development.

Speaker 1:          05:56          So I work with several other people in the company to source beans. So we actually traveled to different countries and by the book of these, we work with the farmers to help them to improve their quality of their cocoa. And then you are able to buy it from them, usually at a higher price, which is, which is a great relationship because we received higher quality beans and they receive a higher price for them. So it's a really mutually beneficial relationship. Um, so that's one component. The other component is actually making and maintaining some of these blends here. So Shark Hamburger, um, we've always taken a traditional look at chocolate and that, and we'd like to find a chocolate for a number of reasons. Um, it creates a more consistent land. It also can create a more complex chocolate flavor profile. So when you say blood, do you mean the different deans from different sources?

Speaker 1:          06:44          So it'd be like a maritime, the right word. Blending varietals. Okay. Exactly. Cool. Um, our founder, John Scharffen Berger, came from the champagne business where that's very common, um, creating and developing complex flavors, a number of different meetings. He's sort of our, is our forte. And you can see here we have, for instance, this bar here has, has between eight and 11 different beans in it at any given time. And you know, sometimes a certain sort of, uh, you know, it might be less available and at a certain time of year, so we'll have to insert another, another type of view. And therefore we're constantly changing. And we have a flavor profile that sort of locked in our heads.
