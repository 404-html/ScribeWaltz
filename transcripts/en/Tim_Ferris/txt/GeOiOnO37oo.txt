Speaker 2:          01:13          This episode is brought to you by gymnastic bodies.com this is the training system that I am most obsessed with at the moment and I don't get paid any commissions or anything like that. You may have heard coach summer on the podcast who designed the program, former national team coach for men's gymnastics. I am not easily impressed and I've just been completely blown away by the sophistication of his programming and the elegance of his programming. I've been using gymnastic bodies for just a few months now and I feel more flexible, stronger, and younger than I have in years. And it sounds cheesy to hear myself say that, but it's true. That's the hardest part to believe and you can check it out.

Speaker 2:          02:17          Hello boys and girls. Ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show where it is usually my job to interview world class performers and tease out the habits, routines, tools, tricks, et cetera that you can use. This episode is a role reversal. I went to New York City and I sat down with Stephen Dubner freakonomics fame and I was grilled. I was hit with all sorts of questions I had never heard before and we had a blast doing it. We had so much fun and their team did an incredible job with post production and editing. I wanted to share it with all of you and you can of course find Steven and his team and his coauthor@freakonomics.com at freakonomics on Twitter and freakonomics radio in the podcasts sphere and without further preamble, please enjoy my wide ranging sometimes very odd conversation with Stephen Dubner.

Speaker 4:          03:16          If you don't try hard, no matter how much talent you have, there's always going to be someone else who has a similar amount of talent who out works you and therefore outperforms you. It's very easy. I think in a digital age easier than ever to confuse being busy with being productive and they're just not the same thing. Well, what if I did something with some more passion? What if I found something to be a deeper interest to me? I thought maybe I should give it a go and see if it was actually possible to improve. Let's start with in 60 seconds or less what you actually do in a given day if you have such a thing as a given day.

Speaker 2:          03:52          I would say interviewing experts, tracking down eccentric Weirdos who are really good at one thing or another. Formulating a plan for some type of experiment involving their observations are findings and then recording it. That is what I do most days. That is Tim Ferriss. He is,

Speaker 4:          04:12          hmm. What is he exactly?

Speaker 2:          04:15          I am a human Guinea pig and professional dilettante.

Speaker 4:          04:20          For our final self improvement episode, a man whose entire life and career are one big pile of self improvement of accelerated self improvement as evidenced by his book titles. The four hour work week, the four hour chef, the four hour body, Tim Ferris is in fact such a poster boy for self improvement that you might be as I first was a bit suspicious, I'd seen your face and I knew that you were the four hour blank guy and of course I assumed that you were a total charlatan. Of course. Right? Cause that's how could you not with a title like that Tim Ferris Charlatan or self improvement wizard, you'll be the judge as we cover everything from his humble beginnings, I mean very much the runt of the litter in school and some rough patches. So I've had extended periods of depression that I've become better at mitigating over time to his good fortune in startup investing. Facebook also did very well to the reason that millions of people do every single thing the Tim Ferriss tells him to do. So the objective is to provide you with tools and principles for 10 x in your hourly output. Is there anyone here who isn't interested in 10 exing their hourly output?

Speaker 4:          05:40          No, I didn't think so. From wny c studios, this is freakonomics radio. The podcast that explores the hidden side of everything.

Speaker 2:          05:59          Here's your host, Steven Dubner. Tim Ferris

Speaker 4:          06:06          recently stopped by our studio with a head full of ideas and as you'll hear, a belly full of sardines.

Speaker 2:          06:14          I suppose my professional life can be split into writing books that all sound like infomercial products, most notably the four hour workweek and then tech investing. So if you had to pick a noun or maybe two to describe what you think of yourself as, what is the noun? Noun will be teacher. I don't view myself as a writer first and foremost. I always thought I was gonna end up teaching ninth grade specifically because I had a lot of really formative influences. I think at that fork in the road or a lot of crucial decisions are made by young folks, but I view my job as testing many, many different things, performing experiments and then providing the cliff notes to people. As a teacher.

Speaker 4:          06:57          Not long ago you also started a podcast which is called the Tim Ferriss show. Now why did you want to go and do a thing like that? Cause we all know that podcasting is not where it's at.

Speaker 2:          07:06          It was intended to be a break between large book projects and I have this nasty habit of writing along books. So the four hour chef was 670 pages.

Speaker 4:          07:16          So weird in the best way. They're not narrative from beginning to end. Even when they kind of feel a little bit like those self help books with boxes and charts, you are just zany in a way that reminds me, I'll be honest with you, of one person where anyone else, which was my mom, my mom was this kind of Brooklyn girl who ended up in upstate New York trying to be a pioneer woman and raise eight kids and she did it. She had to figure out all this stuff and that's what strikes me is what you have this intense either curiosity or need or something to figure out stuff and then tell other people about it, which is, you know, generous of you. Where does that come from? Why? Why are you not satisfied with just being like everybody else?

Speaker 2:          07:59          I think the answer's twofold. So, number one, my mom always encouraged me to march to my own drummer. So that

Speaker 4:          08:06          how, how'd you do that?

Speaker 2:          08:08          She exposed. Me and my brother. I have one sibling, a younger brother, too many, many different environments. My parents didn't have much money growing up, but they always had a budget for books. And my mom would take us to experience things firsthand, like go to the beach and take leftover chicken bones and tie them to strings and fish for crabs, which we threw back. But the, the list just went on and on. And if we grasped on anything and became really passionate, then she would, uh, and, and my father as well.
