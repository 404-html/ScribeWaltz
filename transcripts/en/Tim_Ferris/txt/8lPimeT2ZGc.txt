And this episode we have a fantastic guest I've wanted to connect with for a very long time. Darren Aronofsky. So who is Darren, we're going to get to that in a second, but he was introduced to me by another podcast guest, Peter Attia who is a medical doctor, an endurance athlete or he would say former endurance athlete. And I encourage you to also check out his episodes because it'll put a lot in context and Peter has three episodes. If you just go to tim.blog forward slash a tia, a, t, t I a, you will find three of them.

Dot blog forward slash at Tiaa, but back to Darren, Darren Aronofsky. You can find them on Twitter and Instagram at Darin, d a r r e n Aronofsky a r o n o f s k y to say hello and he's doing some very cool stuff on Instagram and Darren aronofsky.com is the founder and head of the production company, protozoa pictures. He is the acclaimed in award winning filmmaker behind cult classics like Pi Requiem for a dream and the wrestler which are really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his filmography, but going back to the beginning pie, his first film, that was 1998 one him early plots and he best director award at the Sundance Film Festival.

Speaker 2:          00:06:29       Aronofsky.

His latest movie, his mother with lowercase m and an exclamation point, a psychological horror thriller film starring Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, ed Harris, Harrison, many others, Michelle Pfeiffer. It goes on. I've had a chance to see this movie and I'm stumbling over my words because it's, it's hard to describe. It was mind bending, super intense. And I walked around in a dream state for an entire day after seeing this. It is unlike anything you have ever seen. So, uh, if you want to strap on your seat belt and go on a roller coaster, I suggest that you check it out. So without further ado, please enjoy my conversation with Darren Aronofsky.

Speaker 2:          00:07:50       Darren, sir, welcome to the show. Thank you Tim. I have been looking forward to meeting you for some time now, but thank you. I'm a big fan as well. We have quite a few mutual friends and I have some suggestions. I won't mention them by name yet as to topics and questions, but I wanted to start with a question about your writing environment. Oh, that's a good question. I've read a little bit about a desk. You will, your desk, could you describe this desk and if you still use it,

Speaker 4:          00:08:22       it was interesting. I know you've spent time in Japan and so I was in Japan probably promoting, I don't know if it was pio requiem for a dream and I went to some spa town south of Tokyo, I can't remember the name of it. And I guess it was the kind of nexus of this place where they make these puzzle boxes. I don't know if you've ever seen them. They're kind of beautiful. Pattern would inboxes and you can't really see any hinges or any spaces, but if you slide a few panels in a certain order and it could be up to eight 1632 moves depending on how much money you want to spend. Eventually it opens and as a secret compartment. And it blew my mind. I had never seen any type of souvenir like it. I bought a couple and I played with it for a long time and then I think it was early days of Internet.

Speaker 4:          00:09:13       So I started to Google a little bit about what it is. There's a whole art form, I won't try to butcher the Japanese word for it, but I then noticed that there were contests worldwide and that there was, there was this one dude who was winning year after year contest and he was a guy in Colorado. So I was like, oh, that's kind of interesting. And so just randomly I tracked them down and I sent him an email, his name's Kagan sound and I sent him an email. I said, hey, you know, did you ever think of doing any furniture? And he's like, well, actually, I'm working on this thing for a library. And I said, well, it'd be interesting maybe to do a desk out of it. And He loved the idea. And um, then he, it was amazing and he said it true master. I May, we should probably go over to my house to check it out. I would love to say it. David saw it. I don't a if he told you about it, but he freaked

Speaker 2:          00:10:07       the hell out. David Blaine. Yeah. This is, this is part of why I'm asking.

Speaker 4:          00:10:12       Oh, okay, got it. Yeah. So anyway, uh, he ended up this, this master, so the whole thing is made it completely out of wood. He doesn't work with any other materials but would, and um, I'm not sure the count on puzzles in the desk, but it's, I mean, scores of them. And eventually they all sort of work together to build to a final release where you basically, it, he was able to turn it into a musical instrument. He created bellows all controlled with wood. And the draws and by actually pushing the draws, it create sounds and it has a full octave. And he asked me what song I wanted and it has, he been, was able to build a, basically a computer thing that has switches that are all blown by the bellows and if they're done in the right order, a panel flaps open in the back with a secret draw. So it took him five years to do it and it was insane. And I think the price we agreed on was a crime at the beginning cause I am to him or driving him. It was a cry that him and I felt so. And then I realized I didn't have a chair for it. So then I said, you know, we should make a puzzle chair for it and that and then out years later and I paid through the nose for that to get them back. But um, it's a beautiful thing and it's a great desk.

Speaker 2:          00:11:27       I want to say, I read this in a previous interview that you've referred yourself as a nomadic writer or writing in one place for a few weeks and then moving locations. So how does your writing process differ project to project or do you, how do you use, say the desk that we were just talking about and combine that with shifting locations? I'm on book deadline right now, so I'm thinking about this and of course I'll do anything to avoid writing. Exiting, including interviews.

Speaker 4:          00:11:52       Exactly. Um, I, I completely understand that procrastination, but you know, my a writing partner, a guy right with a lot already handled once said to me probably the most important thing I taught to him taught him was that I didn't do this on purpose, is that procrastination is part of the process. That actually your brain needs a break every once in a while. And not to say to abuse that, but to be a little easy on yourself and allow yourself to go to a bookstore, to go to a museum to just, even if you are serious about your work, even when you're not working, you're, you are working, your brain is putting stuff together and you know, inspiration comes from the strangest places as we all know. You know, you suddenly stumble on something that's exactly what you were looking for when you didn't know you were looking for it.

Speaker 4:          00:12:37       But it's changed. My writing process I used to, what I do was a tremendous amount of prep where we would do a tremendous amount of research and outlines and eventually get to a place where were we? We were exhausted with that and then I would do something called the muscle draft where I would go and disappear somewhere usually far away where I could be very alone and be very lonely and that loneliness would inspire me to work hard and fast and I would muscle out a draft, which meant I would never go back. It would, it was all about just pounding through it to get to the end as quick as possible and it was like a two three day process and you come that out with like um, w if it ended up being 120 page screenplay, you'd have an eight 79 80 page screenplay.

Speaker 4:          00:13:21       But in that muscle draft there would be moments when you, you know, when you do enter that zone, I don't know if you have a term for it if you run into it, but does that zone when you kind of forget time, it's, you know, I imagine athletes are doing it and rock musicians seem to be doing it when they, their eyes roll back in their head. But as a writer, every while you get that, where the way of time disappears and something comes out on the page and that scene is often something that ends up staying all the way through to the end of the process. When you are muscling out that first draft, is it in, are you using screen reading software? Is it just kind of brain vomiting bullets on into a, a, a word document? What does it look it's, I'm trying to think.

Speaker 4:          00:14:08       I mean, you know, final draft has been around for a long time now and it's a great software that I've used. I don't, I don't know if I'm Pi was written on it. It's hard to, that was [inaudible] 97 so I can't, I, I doubt it probably I probably was formatting stuff back then. I don't really remember. Um, but you know that that just helps you, it helps you work quicker because you know, instead of dealing with indentation, you press tabs and shortcuts to get through it quicker. I mean, you know, screenwriting is very much like sculpture in the sense that, you know, if you start with a piece of clay, you don't want to just focus on the hand. You know, any artists that does that will tell you, you know, then the hand will be grossly low, detailed and enlarged. The, compared to the rest of the body, you kind of just want to slowly start cutting away at the clay to get closer and closer to the final form, you know, but you don't want to get the sand paper out till you're ready for that, like level of detail work.

Speaker 4:          00:15:10       And so it's just about passes. You keep going through it and once you say, I'm going to start writing, even if you get the page 30 and you think, oh, page five need something, you just make a note of it and then Zap to the end before you ever go back. So it's, it's really like working at way, working slowly away that big clay. Do you no longer do the isolation retreats? I do it less and less. I mean, it's a funny story. I was just telling my son, this was when I, when I wrote by, uh, my friend actually who does visual effects for me, um, his parents had a little cabin up outside of Woodstock and I was like, Hey, can I go there for a few days and pound out my muscle draft on Pi? And he was like, yeah, sure. And I went up there and that his parents were intellectuals and just had books and books and books.

Speaker 4:          00:15:57       They were academics. So there was tons of books. And then I was looking, you know, procrastinating, looking through the books. And of course the only book that caught my attention was Carrie, which I had never read. So I proceeded to pound through procrastinating by Reading Carrie. It's scaring the living crap out of myself. You know, when you read king it's just like wow. And then I really had it right quick cause I had to get the hell out of this cabin. So I think I wrote the first draft of pie and like 18 hours. Wow. But, but to talk about now, um, it's funny this, this, this new movie mother is very, very different process. The, the most different process than I've ever done in probably more similar to where I started. I wrote the script and five days and it was this kind of fever dream want to happen.

Speaker 4:          00:16:43       I had had the idea two weeks before and you know, it started off with this idea for this allegory with a real kind of relationship drama at the core, but I didn't know how to structure it. And then I had this kind of breakthrough of what the structure is. And I had a five day weekend without, uh, my son was with his mom and I was all alone and I just sat in my kitchen. I actually am and go up to the desk and I just pounded it out in my kitchen, in my underwear, barely eating. It was just like this fever that came out of me and in five days and when I was done with the script, I showed it to my producers who didn't know I was even working on something and they were like, well, while the, I think there's something here and it's weird.

Speaker 4:          00:17:27       I think I've always been jealous of musicians. You know, you hear the story where Bob Dylan wrote a song in the afternoon and it became, you know, the anthem for a generation. But as filmmakers, we really don't get to do that. It takes us two to five years. I mean, you know, Black Swan, the first meeting when Natalie was 10 years before I shot it, the wrestler was eight years. The Fountain took me six years. Noah was an idea for 20 years. You know, it's a long time. I, I, but I, I was like, is it possible as a filmmaker to take a single emotion and a feeling of, and it's kind of what I was feeling right in that moment and try to channel it into a single track and into a movie. And I think that's kind of, it kind of captures a single emotion. This film, even though it has other stuff, it really was one color that burst right through.

Speaker 4:          00:18:17       I want to talk about something maybe related to fever dream. So the, the idea of, or concept of madness, uh, and uh, I want to say, I'm certainly paraphrasing that, that maybe you've said that by walking the tightrope between sanity and insanity, you can learn what sanity is or something along those lines. Do you have a fascination with madness? I mean, if so, or why do people have that perception? I had an uncle who, um, was, uh, schizophrenia. So I grew up around that and I got to see it. I'm very, very close and sort of saw his mindset and also how it weighed on my family and you know, the emotional ripples from that were tremendous. Um, and I then I also saw how society treated people like that. And, um, so it's, uh, it's something I've been very close to and I've always thought about it.

Speaker 4:          00:19:20       And I remember reading, what was it, the denial of death. Do you ever read that book? That's a good one for you. Um, but they talk about the Liminal, the line, the thin line between the conscious and the subliminal, I think, how they were using between genius and insanity. And there were things that my uncle would say that, I mean, he was a highly functioning guy. He worked at, he worked as an engineer for New York City for his entire life and you know, had a pension and all that, you know, may made it through, but lived a very tough, tough life because of the illness. But, um, he would say things that were just unbelievable. Brilliant. Like I remember one time my dad was talking to him about something, you know, about how to do something. I don't remember exactly the details. And he said, well, I can't really say this on radio. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:20:15       And he said something like, yeah, that's like, if you fuck a snake, again, an elephant. And I remember hearing it, I was whatever I was 12 or 13, but that's kind of crazy metaphor and kind of beautiful and it's so extreme, you know, it was like the best way of saying, yeah, right, like you're selling me the Brooklyn Bridge. So, but he had many of those that would just sort of like, that's not proper English and, but it kind of works, you know? Do you, I've always had just a, an absolute fascination with that very thin line. Uh, when I was an Undergrad,

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       I was, I'm not a mathematician. I, in fact, part of the reason I went to Princeton is because at the time at least did not have a math requirement. I was scared off of math by very a belligerent teacher in 10th grade. My, yeah, it was terrible. My brother, in fact, same grade, different teacher was steered in the opposite direction and it's just finishing a phd in social studies teachers can do. But I was drawn to a few specifically mathematicians at Princeton who were really riding that razor's edge and had multiple suicide attempts. But we're also brilliant beyond all description. Yeah. I personally, and I in fact also have a cousin whose schizophrenia, which was relatively later onset and uh, became effectively a different person's still very smart. Um, but have you ever worried that you would bleed over that edge and you know, luckily my Hubris doesn't go that far, get that worry.

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       I'm not, I'm not the, I'm not crazy hypochondriac and stuff, but yeah, sure. I've, when I was a, yeah, I think when I was a teenager and I read somewhere that like it, like schizophrenia is onset can happen in your 20s you know, that that idea that when you're a fully formed human being Suddenlink things can change for you. That was a scary idea. Will it happen for me? Um, but you know, I, uh, you know, and I, and I definitely think when it came to, you know, perhaps exploring, you know, plant enhancements, I was always a little terrified that I might go too far in a certain direction. But, um, you know, so, so it's always been in the back of my head a little bit, just cause, you know, a lot of that stuff is genetic, but I don't think it's really haunting me.

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       But I guess maybe a little bit, you, you thought of the possibility of the fear of it. Yeah. Well, I almost off myself in college, so I went through very, very dark period, uh, that actually talked about really publicly in a major way for the first time on stage at Ted, which really shut the room down. Well, no, good for you. It's important, but, uh, that is always, or has always been kind of in the back of my mind. And one of the things that I got from as you put it, plant enhancements or psychedelic experience was temporarily experiencing what could only be, I would have to be on some level synonymous with extreme mental illness definitely. And having connection and developing more empathy as a result of living in a place like San Francisco where you're just surrounded by people who are homeless and mentally ill. Uh, so one of the topics I had down to talk about was psychedelics, which was suggested by someone we both know who will remain nameless for now. What I want to know, yes there are only three, but uh, what role has that played in your life or how do you think about it as fitting into your life?

Speaker 4:          00:23:53       Well, I look, I think it's, I, I've, I've researched it, read a lot about it. I think it's very interesting. I mean, you know, um, the story of, uh, of deer that inside barrier that eat mushrooms and fall over and it doesn't seem like there's any true shouldn't, you know, survival of the fittest, evolutionary positivity for a deer to make itself that helpless. So maybe there is something else going on that some other medicine or something else that this creature is getting out of putting itself at risk was just a fascinating idea. And the fact that shamanism and reaching alternative states has been just part of our culture for a super long time and then somehow got completely washed out and I don't know, it turned into the sacrament, maybe rock and roll music, but we've really lost, um, you know, anything that's sort of trying to reach away from scientific reality is clearly a loss. And, um, and it seems like, um, you know, the, there's a lot of wisdom to come out of, you know, some exploration and in a safe type of examination, as long as very controlled environments, it's as clearly tremendous benefit. You know, that's happened, you know, for society, you know, over eh, that's recently been discovered and is being rediscovered right now. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:25       Involved with some research at Johns Hopkins and a few other places related to use of cell Simon specifically in a potentially addressing treatment resistant depression among other things.

Speaker 4:          00:25:38       That's what's fascinating. All that stuff that maps is doing with PTSD and the fact that this department is supporting it, you know, because it seems to be working. You know, I just saw a film that came out of Israel that uh, it is using MDM to sort of help people deal with not just soldiers but people deal with all different types of emotional distress. It's fascinating and it's interesting and um, it's um, clearly, you know, if the Defense Department is sort of supporting it, then there's probably some, you know, it's probably pretty interesting to them.

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       I think it's also a really smart place for research to start or one at least of the subsets of the population that's very smart to work with is returning vets. Yeah. Specifically among other reasons because it is a nonpartisan issue. It's very hard to be like, fuck the vets. Right. Or like screw the terminal cancer patients who want to decrease end of life anxiety.

Speaker 4:          00:26:35       It's funny though because another thing I'm involved with is I'm on the board of directors for the Sierra Club and a big part of what cr club is trying to do is get vets into nature and we have all these different programs that do that. And in fact, I actually went to the Arctic with two vets and it was amazing for them to sort of, you know, not just to have that experience, which is completely mind expansive to see, you know, nature in a, in a true to see true wilderness like what's happening in the Arctic. But um, I think to the, a lot of them, what they expressed to me as they actually, this is what they were fighting for was the defendant this, you know, in their, their spirits. So they actually get to see the beauty of America outside of the cities that they're from.

Speaker 2:          00:27:22       Continue to talk for a little bit about really old traditions because what we're talking about, or at least some of these traditions have existed for Millennia. Fasting is another one. Yeah. Have you done experiments with fasting?

Speaker 4:          00:27:34       A little bit. It's something I definitely want to get more into. I've been totally into the idea for a long time. Of course. Um, you know, I, I fast once a year, uh, not that I'm religious, but because I, I liked the spiritual practice of fastening once a day with my buddies. And so I get together with my friends and fast for that one day. But a longterm fastening I think is fascinating and I've heard great stories about it, but I haven't, I haven't actually had the, it's amazing how little that goes on and in our privileged lives and how, you know, um, that's just a very interesting practice.

Speaker 2:          00:28:14       What, what is interesting about it to you? Because I tried to, for instance, I tried to do and note to people listening. I'm not a doctor, I don't play one on the Internet, so don't be stupid. Talk to a qualified medical professional, blah, blah, blah. But I've done a, I tend to do at least three days of consecutive fasting per month, and then I'd go longer fasts a few times per year. Wow. And you do just water? I will make some allowances and I do it differently at different times, but what I will sometimes do is use fasting as a way to kickstart ketosis. So clicking over into Ketosis, certainly, uh, our friend Peter t knows a lot about that. It was in Kansas for about two and a half years straight, but fascinating for a period of time. Uh, and what I will allow if I'm doing a longer fast in particular is I will allow myself non caloric drinks that are unsweetened. So let's say black tea, black coffee, right? Uh, and Kit Kat bars and cake only zero Calorie Kit Kat bars. And I will also, particularly in the beginning, allow myself, uh, some exotic generates ketones. So they're just supplemental ketones or fat, like coconut oil to help with the transition. That was great, but besides that,

Speaker 4:          00:29:32       amazing Nick's than the pain is after two, three days, right? It's supposed to, she's off. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:29:37       For most men, women can sometimes take a little longer to click over for most men, about two to three days. Right. And then you can, then you can click over. Um, all right, well let's do it. I'm in w what interests you about the fasting?

Speaker 4:          00:29:51       I mean, it once again, it's just the way, it's clearly a way to explore other spaces, you know? Um, I mean I, I immediately for me, if I've got a difficult meeting where I kind of have to be a jerk at because something's not getting done correctly, you know, if I skipped breakfast and uh, do it close to when lunches, you know, I, I get stuff done. So I do it my own way. I do miss, I do micro micro fasteners to control my mood knowing that, um, you know, some of that anxiety and anger will disappear as soon as I eat. So it's sometimes a good thing to sort of modem I motivate myself to, to help with the work in certain ways. So I do do my own mood enhancement. I mean for a long time. Um, you know, I was dating someone and you know, we used to get at each other.

Speaker 4:          00:30:45       And then finally, um, someone turned me onto the word hangry, which is the hungry Yang, which I think is probably pretty common now. But at the time it was a pretty new word. And that was, it kind of changed my relationship and kept the relationship going for three, four years. Cause we could actually identify why we both became assholes for a little bit. So clearly it's a major mood, a blocker and changer and an alternator and all that stuff. So I think that's interesting. And then, you know, I've heard and read all about the health benefits of it and, and then of course there's all the meditative elements of it to control the mind over the body and all, you know what, David Blaine is always demonstrating, um, clearly going to some series extremes, but, you know, I think there are lessons to be learned and, and experiences to be, have, have had during it.

Speaker 2:          00:31:35       This is sort of the nature of my fragmented mind that we're going to jump around a lot. But you, you mentioned, uh, difficult conversations or where you have to be an asshole. Uh, I had read about, well, very, very much in passing you having a conversation with Mickey Rourke before filming. Uh, well these version. Yeah. Well, no, I actually don't have a whole lot of content, but roughly that you knew it wasn't going to be easy, that he had a lot of strong opinions. So you had sort of a, an honest upfront and conversation and I would love to hear how you open a conversation like that or plan for it.

Speaker 4:          00:32:15       You know, I look, um, you know, Mickey at the time, you know, had an awful reputation. Um, and I think that's because, you know, he, you know, I think he in many ways he was a lot of his worst enemy because he just, you know, love, love to acting. But he also loved boxing and you know, and he had this fight and struggle between them, which one was going to focus on. And you know, I think he was, he really respected the box anyway. Whatever happened with him, you know, everyone was warning me about him. Everyone. But I love him and I loved his work. Um, you know, before I knew him, I just, I thought his work was exceptional and I, it was, I felt the crime on the acting arts that he did not have more opportunities to share himself with the world because whenever he has shared himself, it was unbelievable from barfly to angel heart to all of the beautiful early work he did.

Speaker 4:          00:33:15       And then it just sort of disappeared. But I just wanted to be very clear with him because I felt, um, I just knew how challenging the film we were about to do was going to be. And I just, I, I find that the longer I do this, the more clear you can be upfront, the better. Because no matter what happens, it always changes. I think sometimes people don't really hear what you're saying to them a lot because they really want to do something. So I try to be very, very straightforward and clear because I want to get all the PR as many of the problems off the table because when we do get to set time is really the biggest enemy. Or, you know, pho, because it's so short and, and it happens so quickly that if you start getting to stupid things that weren't pre discussed, it's a nightmare.

Speaker 4:          00:34:06       And so you have to be as completely prepared and professional as you can when you're spending whatever it is, $20,000 a minute. Oh, you know, whatever it may be that day, you know, you want to, you know, Mike Tyson tie money time is what I'm talking about. You want to be on top of your game. So I just went in very clearly with making it, I think, I think, well, what it meant for Makey for it is like he, he looked at me like medicine, you know, he tasted really bad, but he knew it was good for him. So, you know, he just closed his eyes and opened his mouth and swallowed to get it done. And, and really to keep, um, because I think he knew deep in his heart that what I was trying to do was, you know, make a great film with him and, uh, and then, and then he rose to it and he brought it and bring it.

Speaker 4:          00:34:53       But, you know, he talks about that meeting, you know, like the little skinny punk coming to him in pointing his little stubby finger in his face, which I love. I, it's funny, I wish I was that tough and that straight bode. I'm sure I was more cordial and polite to them because I was, um, I know I was in awe of him and excited to meet him. Um, but I just wanted to be clear that like, look, you know, if we're going to do this, we were going to do this. Let's roll up our sleeves and go for it. Um, because it's just, for me, filmmaking is so hard. Um, I, I think for a lot of people there's just so many challenges. It's like, you know, literally every single film I've done has been like, it's own IPO. It's a, its own corporation. You know, I start off with an idea.

Speaker 4:          00:35:36       I have attract talent and money to come together. Um, yes there's a formula, but I generally are making things that don't quite fit into the widget factory. They're are a little weird and stuff, so I don't think they fit in the region. So we have to, you know, I have to convince people why it's going to be a widget and then we have to raise the money and hopefully, you know, make it and get the, get the investors' monies back. And you know, I'm five or six, which isn't bad, but you know, each time it's, it's a real, it's a lot of work. So, um, you wanna make the whole process of it for all the artists working with you as easy as possible. It's not really where you want to put your fighting. You want to do the fighting for the world and the money and all that.

Speaker 4:          00:36:21       Let's say you're making a new film and you're working with some one who you respect, just to depersonalize it a little bit. All that you could give a real example. Let's say like Mickey, someone you really admire who has a reputation for being very strong willed and you're going to have this conversation and you're going to have this conversation again. Yeah. How do you, how do you open it? Like what is the, what are some of the phrases that you use to prevent it from blowing up or to, uh, to try to allow it to go? Well, of course. I mean, look, I mean, I've never done a situation where I'm asking someone, hey, we're going to waterboard you for three months. Yeah. I mean, um, we're trying to do something that's exciting and hopefully beautiful and you know, you know, striving to make art.

Speaker 4:          00:37:05       So that's the underlining agreement. So you're walking into that conversation, Hey, I dig you, you dig me, let's try to make this work. But just to be clear, these are some of the things that are going to be going on that will probably make you feel uncomfortable. And what would be some examples of this? You know? Well, I mean a lot of very clear example would be, you know, when working with women, if there's things that, or men with those things that are sexual in nature, you know, what's required nudity wise and all that type of stuff. And you have to talk about that beforehand because of course it's very sensitive material and you want everyone to be comfortable and very clear on why you're doing something. You know, anytime you do like a love making scene, what exactly is it going to be and why?

Speaker 4:          00:37:47       And I've never really, I've never done a love making scene to sort of make it sort of an erotic thing for an audience. I, I always try to tie it in narratively. So I tell them very clearly where the camera's going to be, what we're going to do, how we're going to run the set, stuff like that. Same thing with violence. Violence, I think is, I'm just as important and the other way of, you know what we're going to be, how we're going to be demonstrating violence, how are we going to show it? I mean, for me that's, that's a huge pet peeve because I, I feel in this country, you know, sexuality and violence has flipped, especially in the movies where you can have as much violence as you want an a Pg, PG 13 movie, but you can't have an ounce of sexuality and a Pg or PG 13 movie.

Speaker 4:          00:38:31       And that to me is, it's disgusting. I don't have words to, to go beyond that. The fact that we're training our kids to fire guns at such a young age with nerf guns and video games, it's disgusting and disturbing while you know any form of like saying there's a beauty in human connection, physical connection that no, we can't talk about that. And the fact that the NPA sort of reinforces that and that's what I mean, you know, I mean here I'll go off, but like guns in ads, I'll walk down the street. We not, my kid was five, six years old and my kids pointing I huge, crazy, sexy looking machine guns on the biggest movie stars in the world. It's discussing the gun companies again, free ads and you know, yet you can't show someone kissing, you know? So there's a whole sort of bend with that. I don't know how I got it

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       there. I got it. Sorry. Sorry. I don't know how I get to where I go half the time. Want to talk a little bit about the word Catharsis? I recently saw a union film. I really enjoyed the experience and came away. I told you this for, for a full day afterwards was in this dream like state wonderful. Which I savored and I had to, I had a lot of questions and sometimes I, I feel like we will actually Milan Kundera I think said that, you know, the, the stupidity of man is that he has all the answers and the intelligence or beauty of a novel is that it has a question for everything. Something like that. Well, that's interesting. I'm paraphrasing and this is in his book of laughter and forgetting, but at one point I recall reading that you didn't intend people to have to find catharsis in your movies. You know, they, they expect to have happy endings and so on, but that perhaps the catharsis comes the day after seeing the film. What do you want the experience of your audience to be or what do you want them to take away from any one of your films? You could give a concrete example or just in general something that drives you? Well,

Speaker 4:          00:40:41       I guess I start off with, you know, the first rule of film making is never to bore an audience. Um, that to me is, is the worst feeling and experience when I'm watching a movie and my mind is wandering and maybe looking at the colors splattered across the screen. I think you always want to engage an audience, not just visually, not just through sound, but emotionally. So I think that's rule one is just to give people and engaging emotional experience for two hours, whatever your running time is. And then I think, uh, on top of that you can hopefully layer in some ideas so that when people leave the theater, it's not like, you know, 15 minutes later, what did we watch? You know, I don't want to be the Mcdonald's of movies where the rapper, you know, it's just the wrapper is all that's left over.

Speaker 4:          00:41:29       I want people to be, you know, thinking a bit about and talking about it. For me, one of my best life experiences was just randomly I walked into a coffee shop and it happened to be around the corner from where pie was playing in la at the new art. And a dad came in with the, his 18 year old daughter and two of her friends and the four of them were sitting there just talking about this black and white movie that they had just seen. And I just kind of bs dropped, you know, listening to him just thrilled that there was a conversation and a debate and what did that mean and what did that mean? And you know, for me that's always been the films I love is, you know, yes, you know, there are movies that you have a great experience in and enjoy and it's just a great pleasure to watch and a great experience.

Speaker 4:          00:42:14       But I also liked the ones that, you know, um, you know, make you scratch your head and you think about your talk and you debate because uh, you know, you want to kind of have an impact. And I think in today's landscape a lot of things are disposable and it's really, really quick how disposable they are because of how quick, how much stuff we're being bombarded with day after day after day. Um, it's nice to sorta hopefully have something that reflects back on it and thinks about it. You mentioned emotional thinking that said, emotional connection or engagement. What are the, what are some of the ingredients that helped to create that? Because most films fail the eye I think anyway. Yeah, I mean, I mean it starts with the greatest, I think the greatest invention of the 20th century that's overlooked, which is the close up and that, that's the great thing about cinema is the fact that you can stick a camera right in the face of Paul Newman, right?

Speaker 4:          00:43:11       And, and those beautiful blue eyes and you can go right into his soul. And then when you project it months later to an audience or years later, potentially centuries later, you are anonymous and that audience, yet you can feel the empathy because in reality, two people talking and hanging out. How much eye contact do you make? There's lots of other things going on in this room that you're taking in that act conditioner rattling my guys mixing in the other room. But the actual connection with another human being where you are really looking into their soul and not thinking about yourself. Cause the thing is when I look at you and you look at me, we're thinking a little bit about, well now I'm making really a calm, comfortable us looking at each other and we will, we're going to be looking away. But in a movie and via the close up you can be unconscious and fully be in.

Speaker 4:          00:43:59       Paul Newman said, even though you don't know exactly what he's thinking, you can sort of study him and steel and steel that thought. And that's, that to me is the great greatness of cinema. Um, or one of the great things about cinema. And so, um, and that's where you get emotion. You know, and what happens is if you start linking different emotions together, hopefully you start to tell a story. It store, what the story does is it expands the emotion. Just like a joke, you know, set up, set up, set up, pay off, you know, that's the classic structure of a joke. It's the same thing with drama or you're setting up a character and building character. You give them a challenge and then you see them go through that challenge and pay off. And then there's always the pitfall when it all falls apart and then they rise up.

Speaker 4:          00:44:42       And at that hero's journey, you know, is just so, I don't know if it's genetic, I don't know if it's part of the human condition. I don't know if it's something that we, we're taught very, very young and our first doctor Seuss books. Um, but it's something that we all around the planet and every language and every culture can relate to. I mean, for me, the power of storytelling happen. I was, um, I graduated high school early and backpacked around Europe and the Middle East and uh, I ended up in the, the Gemma in Marrakesh. I don't know if you've been there, but it's a, it's amazing square in the middle of the suck, you know, whether I'll um, where they have all the shops and stuff and uh, at nighttime they ha it's filled with snake charmers and food and all this stuff. And there was one old guy leaning on a cane and a beard telling a story and he had a huge crowd around them and it was all in Arabic and I didn't understand the freaking word, but I was mesmerized and I was like, that's what I want to do.

Speaker 4:          00:45:46       I want to tell stories because that little old trivial, the old guy on a cane was transforming himself into this 20 foot beast and I didn't even understand the language. And I was like, that's cool, you know, to entertain a crowd with a point of view. Where was that experience relative to your time in Kenya? But that was after Kenya. I'm also on the board of directors for an organization called the school for Field Studies, which is a great organization out of Salem, Massachusetts, which basically trains mostly college students, uh, to go abroad and, uh, into sensitive environmental areas and do environmental studies. And when I was a, I dunno, a young teenager, I worked at New York City aquarium in Coney island, which was right next to my neighborhood in Brooklyn. And the, one of the big perks of that job besides being at the aquarium, was that if you wore the aquarium tee shirt, you got to go on the site clone roller coaster over and over again.

Speaker 4:          00:46:49       Um, so we used to go 40, 50 times in a row on the side, you know, and um, but I picked up a book for the School for field studies there and they, it was just this little color catalog and I was like, wow. They sent kids to Kenya and I was like, Ma, this is what I want to do, dad. You know. And somehow they took a few high school students and I was, I was like in events, the biology. So I had a little bit, I was always good inside and my dad was a science teacher, so I was always pointed in that direction a bit. And so I got them to let me go to Kenya where I, um, I did what I study. I study thermo, thermo regulate, no, I studied, um, water strategies and ungulates the next year I went to Alaska with them to Prince William sound actually with a big x on spill was, but I was there two years before that, which was fascinating because the research we did there actually they use that research after the, after the spill to see what the impact was.

Speaker 4:          00:47:46       But in Alaska I studied thermoregulation and harbor seals. I just like to say these words cause Sir fancy sounding ungulates now tell us what fall into the class of ungulates are. They're all animals that stand on their hooves. Got It. So everything from cattle, uh, you know, domesticated cattle to Zebra Gazelle, um, will be, yeah, there were no deer elk. I, there might've been some elk in some type of elk there, but um, yeah, so it's all that's true. Right. I guess there would be Caribou in Alaska. It was interesting. We basically were there, we were on this, we were on this ranch owned by an Afrikaner who wanted to, he did this thing called preservation for profit was his idea where basically he was like, look, during a drought, all the cattle die. But indigenous animals of course don't die because they basically forage in the morning when there's dew on the leaves and then the mid afternoon they're in the shade.

Speaker 4:          00:48:46       So Ba basically what we were there to do is to prove his idea that indigenous animals were better adapted to the environment. Then domesticated animals, which is completely obvious, but in science you have to sort of prove it. So we studied them morphologically, which was biologically when they, and then we also looked at them and their behavior patterns during the day. And I mean it was, it was fascinating because basically we just use this, you know, I learned the scientific method and we did real serious research and real charting and real, you know, and it, the next year was Alaska when I went to Prince William Sound. And the beauty of that was the textbook. The only textbook we had was origin sbcs. And each, every two days we had a read another chapter of origin of species and discuss it. And over the six, seven weeks I was out in the bush.

Speaker 4:          00:49:35       That was the whole, the whole class. I had read that your time, as soon as acting as a field biologist are doing field biology in Kenya changed how you looked at the world. Now I don't want to put words in your mouth, so I don't know if that's accurate or not, but if that is true, yeah. How did it change how you looked at things? Everything changes your life all the time. Right? But back at that age when you're 16 and you're a Brooklyn kid from New York City who's basically, you know, you know, concrete jungle flee and you've suddenly in, you know, the Savanna of Kenya, of course it's gonna Change Your Life. So it's a little bit of an overstatement I think. But um, I mean every day was mind blowing. I, as an embarrassing moment, I was 16 so you have to forgive me. I got off the plane and I was riding with the professors to the thing.

Speaker 4:          00:50:25       I was like, Oh, when are we gonna See Tigers? They're like, there aren't any tigers in Africa. They're in Asia. Oh, that's what I meant. So I, you know, a kid from Brooklyn, no idea what was going on. So I mean, every day it was just every day literally was something I had never seen before. And now in Alaska, and you know, this is a pre Google pre crazy media age, you know, still only 11 channels on the station at the couple of people had cable, but early days of civilization. And um, I remember we were kayaking. It was an amazing trip. It was like five weeks in kayaks out in Prince William Sound, one of the most untouched places on the planet at that point until Exxon showed up. And we can, we were going to this glacier and I had never seen a glacier. Now everyone's seen a glacier at this point because of that, the calving ice and what's happening to the glaciers.

Speaker 4:          00:51:23       But the idea of blue ice for a kid from Brooklyn and they're like this [inaudible] glacier. When the first time I saw it, it was like two miles long, you know, half a mile tall. I mean, I just, with huge chunks of ice falling and you'd see the chunks fall off and then a minute later you'd hear the sound because of the distance, like at a ballpark. And then these huge waves from that start coming at you and you're in a kayak. So you really close to water. And on those waves are icebergs with seals hauled out regulating their temperature on it, going up and down. I mean, just like who needs psychedelics?

Speaker 2:          00:52:06       You've been called controversial. I don't know if you view yourself that way. Um, but I'd love to talk a little bit about how to respond to public perception and criticism. Another mutual friend of ours, Rick Ruben, fantastic guy, uh, incredible music producer, uh, among other greatest. Yeah, he is. He said on this podcast, he said, the best, the best art, I'm paraphrasing, but the best art divides the audience. And so I think it was, uh, help me out here. I think it was variety. The day after you got a 30 minute standing ovation, said you should quit filmmaking and go therapy instead. And, uh, you've had as anybody who's in the public arena, uh, has, uh, a fair amount of say, criticism of various types. Yeah. What would your advice be to a filmmaker you think is very promising? Who's doing something that is not, that doesn't fit cleanly in the widget factory? Yeah. They're probably gonna catch fire, but they haven't had the experience.

Speaker 4:          00:53:12       What would you say to a person that's an easy answer? Keep going. You know, that's what you want. I mean, I, when I meet, uh, when I teach are like my, both my parents were teachers and so I, I, it's in the blood and I love teaching. You know, the thing I try to instill in students is like the only thing you have to offer as you, you know, your individual stories, your individual perception, your individual humanity, and figuring out a way to communicate that humanity to the, to humanity at large. I mean, that's the beauty of cinema, once again, that you can have a six year old Iranian girl, our 90 year old British gentlemen, and you can have an equal emotional experience if the filmmaker does their job right to it. So like for me it would be, you know, a ballerina and a wrestler, hopefully.

Speaker 4:          00:53:57       Can I make you feel and their blood in their pain. That's, that's the goal. Um, because that's, you know, that that's one of the great things cinema does, is to bring us into other human experiences. So if you're, if it's truthful to who you are and you're concerned about how people are going to react to it, you know, stick up your middle finger and charge straight into that fire, you have to, um, if you're trying to be a provocateur, just to be a provocateur, you know, go f yourself. You know, that to me is, that's the bad stuff is like when it's not real. Um, so for me it's not, it's never like, oh shit, how do I, you know, mess around with, that's not why I make movies at all. I, I'm just juiced about these ideas. And um, they had, they have nothing about being confrontational.

Speaker 4:          00:54:45       But even when I do a film, like, you know, you know, the fountains been called a love poem to death. I piss people off even though it's just really gentle move romantic movie about a guy coming to terms with dying. I guess that's just not a very commercial idea in the west. But you know, I, I thought it was at the time and I was like, you know, dancing around for five years telling studios I was going to it, that people would be interested in the movie. And because I really believed it, I wasn't, I'm not interested, you know, I happened to be a filmmaker who wants to talk to audiences. I love it. I love when they respond. Unfortunately I haven't done a comedy or something that's easy, quite yet easier to connect with an audience on, easier to make by any means. But I just mean, you know when you're going to, when you're aiming the please annoyance, it's a lot easier to make it then when you're just making something that you feel inside. And for me it's not a conscious thing. It's purely from my gut. That's the core for me. It comes from my stomach always. It's not the heart, it's mostly where it might be somewhere between, I don't know what's right here, solar plexus. It's right beneath the solar plexus. It's kind of this stomach, I guess like your large intestine. Oh Great.

Speaker 4:          00:55:59       Let's play this die there. It's that, that area, when I feel when I'm writing and it's like coming out of there, I know it's like some type of Chana g from there. Si. Do you pay a lot of attention? Does your kinesthetic response to what you're doing when you're writing? I mean you, it's that unconscious state where you're not feeling body. That's the, that's the state to get into where just coming of you, you know. And, and that it's not by, by no means is that often. You know, I, I believe there are writers out there. Um, I was very, I know some real writers and I think they are, I get into that state a lot easier and I'm not a real writer, but sometimes I have ideas and that I want to get out and express and so I, I tried to do it.

Speaker 4:          00:56:47       Why do you say you're not a real writer? People who would argue that you have writing credits? I don't know. I mean I just, I guess I, I'm in awe of, I have, I have some friends that really, right. And I see the way they can put words together. I don't, you know, look the reality, I'm being more truthful with Ferris then I've been with him, probably anyone. The reality is I was a public school kid from Brooklyn and I, they never really taught me how to write. And when I got to college, I went into the creative writing class and I almost flunked out of it because I really did not know how to write an essay. I didn't even, I, I to this day, my, my son, my 11 year old son knows more about pronouns and nouns and sentence structure. I just never learned grammar. It was never talked to me and, and then, and it was a shame. I just never, I never did the Romeo, so I probably have some type of security about that cause I don't think I could write that. I can write dialogue because I have an ear and, and I, and I do have some ideas that I can try to sketch out, but I don't really, um, you know, I guess I'm scared of, I'm scared you're going to give me an essay to write

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       challenging one. I'm going, going to be the last person he did. He just say it right. My, my, uh, writing my senior thesis in college, which is mandatory and it constitutes a huge part of your departmental grade for the entire time that you were at school. Yeah, traumatize me so much that I pledged to myself when I graduated. I would never write anything longer than an email ever again. Clearly did not work out. Uh, it worked out, but it didn't work out as planned. I guess thesis on my thesis was on the phonetic and semantic acquisition of Chinese characters in the Japanese language. It's called [inaudible] by native English speakers. So how do native English speakers most effectively acquire both the meaning and pronunciation of Chinese characters? Um, unbelievable. Yeah. In retrospect, it doesn't seem like someone who's afraid of writing would write something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:58:51       That's pretty, you know, I had, I had a lot of my true interests were buried in some of these early writing projects or even scientific assignments that I then felt were trivial or not serious for some reason. And now I'm coming back to them 20 years later. I'm amazing. I mean, I remember I took a neuroscience class initially the plan was to be a neuroscience major. Actually. It was a psychology major focusing on neuroscience for a host of reasons. Move to the language, namely principally, I couldn't do the animal testing that was required to be part of the lab. I want it to be part of. Yeah, I mean I, I will say, I mean I understand the sensitivity of the subject. I do think some studies are very difficult to do or impossible to do without certain animal modeling. But let me just say that for instance, one of the studies, I've been deep into this.

Speaker 2:          00:59:43       No, I know you. I know you. I don't want to own up for environmental reasons. Just Oh, for sure. I have a, well, we'll talk about it later. No, we can, yeah, we can definitely talk about the, but where I became, I was really fascinated by rem sleep and some of the sea, the physiological similarities to state states. It can be induced with hallucinogens. Oh Wow. And so this was probably my sophomore year in college that I was really fascinated by this. And it only took 20 years, 25 years to come back to it full circle. Did you ever try to stay awake for a long time? I stayed awake and this is not advisable at all. I wanted to see what the disclaimers, you know, because the I, every once in a while I'll get an email from somebody's cousin [inaudible] he said, and he gave himself a headache.

Speaker 2:          01:00:33       And I'm like, yeah, you got to use your common sense people. But I stayed away for six days. Oh Wow. I wanted to see what would happen because I had read these reports of people having all sorts of odd phenomenon crop up when you stay awake for that period of time. And uh, so I used a stimulants, nothing illegal, but it was very good at concocting putting together these cocktails for myself and stayed awake for five and a half, six days. I stopped because I was walking on campus. I remember very clearly where I was. I was, I was, you would make it [inaudible] Hagen and there were goblins everywhere. No, I fell asleep while I was walking and woke up about a block later and I had crossed two or three. Oh Wow. And I was like, you know what, this is no longer a good idea.

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       But you, have you stayed awake for a really long period of time? No, I had a, there was a test when I was in Undergrad and my roommate did it where he basically was to stay awake and he just became cruel. And I remember him telling me like they, they were like, oh, he's like, I'm going to go to sleep to like, don't go to sleep. So he took a deck of cards and start throwing cards around the room and made everyone run around and pick them up. Otherwise he would go to sleep. So he started doing like really messing with the aids and the, and the Grad students that were doing the studies on him. Yeah. But of course the overnight or, and those are important. Not just, you know, when you're in college and stuff, but I haven't, I'm glad you, you are out there exploring it for us.

Speaker 2:          01:02:06       Yeah. I don't, the, the conclusion is don't do that. Inclusion is don't do that. And if you remove sleep and food from people, they get really, really grumpy. It turns out, uh, this is a quote from New York magazine. This may have been from a while ago, uh, on, I don't think it's that old actually. So I think when I was starting out as a filmmaker, I had tremendous focus, but I don't think I robbed myself of too much life. I'm still friends with the guys who grew up with a nursery school. I have a great relationship. My family, I'm definitely attracted to balance to symmetry. I'm definitely an order personality, but I'm a lot less ordered than I was. God Damn, I said some stupid shit. So you can definitely deny you can correct it and set the record straight. But this is of incredible interest to me because many people who would aspire to be creative or who self describe as creative burn themselves out or they sacrifice family relationships by being singularly focused. And sometimes they're proud of it. Sometimes they regret it. But this is, this is something that I don't hear very often. So I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that because how do you have, how do you have the tremendous focus required to do what you've done while still having that balance and symmetry?

Speaker 4:          01:03:29       I mean, it is a balancing act and you know, uh, but I think all the time you put into life, you know, and to family and to friends and into activities outside of the work, you know, back to our procrastinate. Not to say what your family is procrastination, but bringing in those other experiences into your life is what makes you be able to relate to people and to communicate. And at least for filmmaking, that's a major part is you know, going to a diner with friends and seeing an argument between some strangers over there ends up in a movie. For me, you know, living life and seeing stuff and doing all different types of experiences through this planet is important to be a storyteller because it's all about the stories. I mean I think the first three, four films of my career and definitely all my short films before that all came out of very personal experiences of my life.

Speaker 4:          01:04:35       And, and the problem is if you keep working nonstop and you're originating your material, I think it's different if you're more of a journey, men who's going along and then just taking your craft and bringing it to life, bringing a great script to life. Cause I think at the, you mean by that as a journeyman, something that's not a personal story. By nature. I mean, I think every stories personal or you can find a personal way because anytime you portray a character on screen, you should sort of infuse them with real emotions and stuff. So, and to do that you have to feel it yourself. But, um, if you're drawing on your own life and your own stories and you're somehow more autobiographical somehow, even through metaphor, because I think all my films are not about, I'm not a ballerina yet. You know, there's a lot of Natalie in me.

Speaker 4:          01:05:23       I mean that character, Nina and me, not Natalie, but Nina, the character, I'm not a wrestler, but Randy the Ram I, I'm pretty connected to and I understand why he makes every decision and some of those stories in there I can relate to or, or drawn from my own life. So I think, you know, if it's an assignment where you don't really, you just showing up as a director and you're there to, you know, make all the departments work together and make the actors do it. I think it's the, it, it becomes, it becomes more of a craft then, not to say that it's not an art, but I think if you're trying to create your own stories that are coming out of life, you have to actually live life to do it, you know? Right. Otherwise you're just getting your stories. I don't know where you could get your stories from.

Speaker 4:          01:06:13       I guess you could make things about being an obsessive film, which is kind of like, you know, one of my favorite filmmakers, Fellini, started making films about directors, making films, you know, I mean eventually went off until the things, but for a while that's what he worked on. And so I think you, you have to balance in this, in this art form. It's, it's very different, I think, uh, in different forms because all the forms can be expressed in different ways. So I, I can't really speak for that, but, but storytelling, you need stories. Realize if something has told at one point, which helped me at least, which was a friend of mine, a writer, I think it was, it might've been, it was either. Debbie Millman, I want to say, or Maria Popova. And they said, uh, if art imitates life, you have to have a life.

Speaker 4:          01:07:01       Right? And I guess my followup question is when you are really immersed in a project, yeah. And maybe maybe now with family and so on, it's different than in the early days, but my experience and part of the risk I have when I go into a project is that it tends to crowd out other things, right? You schedule say time with friends and family so that they don't get displaced. How do you ensure that that happens or you just programmed in such a way that it's natural? It's not a bad life as a filmmaker because basically, at least the way my, my schedule is, I do a, a film every two, three years. So in that two, three years, there'll be like a 50 60 day Ron, which will be completely selfish and completely committed and dedicated to the film where I'm working 1820 hour days over and over again.

Speaker 4:          01:07:57       Insane amount of time. And you know, you get one day off on the weekend and then the next day you probably prepping. Um, although I'm able now to almost get two days off because I've been doing it enough that I kind of have more skills but I can go in so can get a weekend off sometimes. But where I can spend with family and friends, not that I could go out and party and have a beer, I mean it's gotta be very mellow and most of the time I'll just want to watch game of Thrones. But that's a huge marathon. That only happens once every two, three years. And then you get into editing and it's basically a nine to five job. You know, there's always things coming up, but it's a much slower pace and that could be a 40 week process. Then you get to selling the film, which is kind of a two, three week kind of marathon of travel.

Speaker 4:          01:08:46       But it's kind of fun cause that's where a lot of stories come from because you see all these different cultures and you just see a lot of crazy shit. So it's not that bad. And then, and then I get into development. And when I'm in development for the next project, it's, once again, I can really shape that around, um, my son's schedule and, and, and I can have time to see my friends and have experiences and travel and stuff like that. Because when you're developing, it's all virtual, virtual in your head, not quite in a computer, but it's, it's all in your imagination for a while. And all you need is a notepad and a pen and you can be anywhere. Are there any particular resources, and I'm sure this is a question you've had a lot, so I apologize in advance, but I haven't heard the answer.

Speaker 4:          01:09:28       So to aspiring filmmakers, uh, let's just assume intelligent, driven, organized, so big assumption, but let's just assume they check those three boxes. Sure. Are there any particular books or resources or approaches that you would suggest they take? Assuming that they're, they want to put together some type of narrative storytelling about doing a document. I always push the writer's journey by Christopher Vogler. It's very good, but it's only for people who are writing screenplays. So, but he, but he's great. He basically took Joseph Campbell's work and turned it into screenplay language and he did a really good at job at it and we're totally part of his cult. Uh, cause we, I believe in that hero's journey. And not to say that's the end all to end all. And there are other ways to approach it. But it's a very, very interesting structure that can really lead to big breakthroughs.

Speaker 4:          01:10:22       When you're struggling, you can look at the different archetypes that there are and, and often you find yourself falling into it. And, and you know, it's funny like requiem for a dream. When I was working on it, I, it was before I read Vogler, but now that I look back, I, I still, I was doing stuff similar where I was charting out where their emotion was, the characters. And what was interesting is that the graph was actually upside down when something good was supposed to happen, something bad was happening. And I was looking at it one day I flipped it over and I said, oh, they're actually the bad guys. All my characters. The good guy is addiction. And this is actually a hero's journey of addiction, overcoming the human spirit. That's when I finally understood what the movie was about and charting it and using hero's journey, how I was able to figure out that, that id out, that this invisible monster was a, of this craving was actually the hero of the film.

Speaker 4:          01:11:20       But that's great. I mean, and then the other thing back on what we talked about is, you know, tell, tell your story. Don't try to figure out what people want because the reality is, you know, and I kind of learned this when I, when I was coming out of film school, I went to support my friend Scott Silver, who's a big screenwriter. Now we have made a directed a film that was at Sundance and it was the year that, uh, welcomed the doll house was there and a bunch of other indeed jams. And I remember watching these films go, these are such specific, unique movies, but they're done exquisitely well. And what Sundance allowed me to believe in what independent film has allowed so many dreamers to believe is that if you make a film, well no matter how personal it is, if it's truthful, you'll find an audience.

Speaker 2:          01:12:10       So not, not to invoke the name of, of Rick again, but I was having a conversation with, with rec recently in a barrel sauna that as the exact replica of his barrel sauna and that we were talking about this deadline that I continually, uh, I'm actually working hard on the book, but I, I spent a lot of time talking, I spent a lot of time talking about how hard I'm working on the book. And uh, I was asking him some questions about working with musicians and whether he knows if something has hit the mark or not. And uh, I'm going to paraphrase here, but he said effectively great is always better than now. And Oh, that's interesting. And, and in the way I interpreted that was, you know, there's always a good time for great. There's never a good time for mediocre. So if you feel like you were rushed to hit some kind of deadline, obviously are realities of production and so on. Don't get me wrong, but uh, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:13:06       rush. You can't rush that. That's, you know, I mean Rick's filled wisdom. Yeah. And it always comes out so interesting. Um, but yeah, I get that. It's, you can't force it.

Speaker 2:          01:13:19       The threat I want to tease a little bit is something you mentioned earlier, which is a say the argument between the strangers that in the diner that then makes it into your movie. Right. Could you tell us or tell me since I'm just sitting right here, uh, your, your history with the game of go, I got into it a lot when I was doing pie,

Speaker 4:          01:13:41       I needed a game for the two guys to be playing so that they had some reason that they were meeting so that Max and his mentor could meet. And I just thought playing chess was just, we've seen it so much and it's cliche and mathematicians playing chess was just not quite interesting enough. And at that point 97 go was still very much a fringe game, sort of is still. And um, but I think it was much more fringe then and we used to go a lot to the, the New York go, um, meetings, which were like 18 very intellectual people and very book line departments at different houses each week playing go. So it was a great cast of characters, just a fight. And they, you know, the best thing about go character go characters are the ones that have said that blow off chess as like a full scale.

Speaker 4:          01:14:34       You know, they, they so looked down on chess and it's just such a chip on their shoulder that they've, they've graduated to go. But that, you know, and the thing that's fascinating that I've been hearing a lot of people, I think actually Rick was talking to me about it. That's where I heard it was, well he's the one I suggested I ask you. Oh, there you go. But the documentary, which I haven't seen yet, he told me those are some documentary about what it meant. This computer finally beating these go masters. And he was telling them about a scene where after the first move, the go master gets up and walks away because basically, I guess the point was that it's such a radical way to change of how the game is played, how this computer is playing it, that it's actually affecting now how humans play each other when that's, that's a line about AI that is interesting where, you know, it actually changes the way we act with each other after thousands of years of playing a game a certain way.

Speaker 4:          01:15:31       Suddenly this idea comes that is a moment of genius that changes the way we look at the board. That was interesting idea. And the, is that from a dot? That's from a document. I believe so. But you have to ask Rick fascinate me and I was, I've been thinking about it for 4 cents. See that? And yeah, I don't want to take us totally off the rails, but I play go. I have a go board at my house. I know. Not Good. Yeah. Uh, I tend to play a hybrid version of connect for fellow connect five. I doubled my brother and I love to play, we just call it connect five or something like that where we use a goal board and it seems really childish. But my brothers, I mean he's, he's a statistics phd, very good chess player. Oh Wow. And these games can actually last a really, really low.

Speaker 4:          01:16:18       It's just basically getting five in a row and you could place him anywhere on the board. It sounds great. It's a great, and it can, it can take, you don't flip on tiles or anything, it's just about blocking jumps. You leave them there so you're not capturing, well, you are capturing territory, but the rules are completely different from real go. Yeah. My, my son came home from math class with fat on paper and we played it for a while and I was like, wow, this was complicated gang. Super complicated and go is so fascinating on many, many levels. One of which is you can feel like you're winning. And then effectively if your, if your pattern recognition is off in a handful of moves, completely loose. I mean, it's, it, the tide can turn a lot faster. Uh, I shouldn't say this with any degree of expert credibility because I know people like Josh Waitzkin are actually good at chess. I'm not, but, uh, uh, the, the game I got really into, uh, in Japan. So my first trip abroad

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       was a year in Japan as an exchange student at a Japanese school, lived with a Japanese family. And I listened to the session you did with the knife maker. Oh, Spam Murray Carter Murray is amazing. So I want to get something of his knives are incredibly shit. There's so good. Uh, the Boutiquey line, oh, his stuff is amazing. It's the game I got into was called a Shogi. So shogi Japanese chess. Oh Wow. And what makes shopping? He's chest different and there are ways you can play western chest this, this way, but you're able to reuse the captured pieces and just drop them on the board at different places. And then also, not only do ponds get promoted, there are multiple pieces that turned into completely different pieces. Sorry. Cool. When they get supposed to serve a lot of chess. Yeah. Yeah. It's really a cool game. And so there's, um, I used to buy these books in Japan, so she'll get somebody Shogi is, uh, basically books that allow you to think of a really slow APP. It's a book where you, you try to figure out the three or four moves in a given position necessary to win the game. And then there's an answer key. And so I would on the subway, she had a lot of time on the subway in Tokyo. At least I did. I would either read comic books or I would look at these some issue or I would read judo textbooks. Um, but I'm, I'm getting judo. Yeah. Um, as an aside, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:18:33       it's funny, the one eye, it was very upsetting when they got, um, Wifi on the New York City subway because now I have to work hard. But like my rule is never take out your phone. Not because I'm worried about getting stolen or anything, but just because that's the chance to watch people for me. And um, so you don't want to get lost in your device at that point. That's a great time. And the, and the rule in New York is great. You know, basically you can stare at anyone you want. If they make eye contact with you, you can never look at them again, but you're allowed to look as long as they don't look at you. And that's that. People come to New York. I said, that's the real, you can, you can watch and check each other out. But if they need realize you're being checked out. Stop. So I, I find it fascinating and I imagine, uh, yeah, the subways in Japan must be insane. It's just, once again, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:19:21       which shocked me that, I mean there's so many things that are so alien about Japan for someone who hasn't been exposed to Japan specifically, even in East Asia. And I've spent time in China, I've gone to school there, I've spent time in Taiwan and spent time in Japan, Japan, and within Japan. Tokyo is just a particularly a particular brand of weird. Yeah. And so you get on the subway and I remember a couple of things really striking me. Some 15 everything's backwards, right? We're driving on the opposite side of the street, like we have to take a shower before we get into the bath. I'm like all these rules that seem very Alison wonderland, topsy turvy. And then I sit down on the subway and you'll see, you know, the salary men Saturday mom who are on their way to work these worker bees and their reading comic books with the most explicit porn imaginable.

Speaker 2:          01:20:11       And they're completely nonchalant about it. Yeah, I mean, Tentacle Porn, who knows? And then the, uh, the other hilarious phenomenon I bumped into, which I'd really didn't expect. So you hear about in Japan, perverts on the subways and they're definitely perverts on the subways and they're called Chicago. So if you're like, she can't, you got to, that means a pervert per, per. Oh, really? And so if like some guys trying to fondle some girl's ass, like you'll hit a key or Chicong and then, you know, there's big kerfuffle. What they don't tell you is that, uh, I remember one day I was in my street

Speaker 4:          01:20:41       Conan kerfuffle in one sentence, just so you know,

Speaker 2:          01:20:44       might be the first time, uh, the singularity is near. And, uh, I was in my school uniform 15 clearly a high school student, right. Have my Judy uniform over my shoulder. It's wrapped up and I'm standing up as packed subway and I fear, I feel someone groping my ass. Oh Wow. And I'm like, what is going on here? I can't turn around because it's so crowded and eventually I'm able to turn around and what do I see? Not what I expect. I see two really old women with like half of their teeth, w captain gold chuckling to themselves because they'd been grabbing my ass. And these women are called [inaudible] young [inaudible] young is from old battalion, which it's a long story, but it refers to like older Japanese women who just don't give a fuck anymore. And so, yeah, it was a real cold night. My favorite,

Speaker 4:          01:21:40       you know, when I went to Japan for the first time, which was with pie, you know, I was, I was a big, huge fan of, um, I had all, I dreamt for so long and I go to Tokyo. Um, and I was like, you know, I Kinda, I want kind of want to make a statement here. I kinda, you know, I want to be remembered, you know, I'm coming with this a little film, what can I do? So I had dyed my hair purple and I came and I do an interview is the whole time with big bright purple hair and no one mentions it. And I get to my last interview and it's kind of a young hip guy who's like a pop star in Japan and we become buddies and I'm like, man, you know, like I've made my head purple, but no one's commented on it. And he goes, yeah, come to the window. And we look outside and it's a major intersection. Says, who has purple hair out there? All the old ladies,

Speaker 2:          01:22:26       hi, they are here. And I'm like, oh, that's totally true. Hundred percent accurate. Oh my God, I don't even pieces together. That's true. I'm having flashbacks. I think the old ladies are grabbing that and it's like, you know, in requiem for a dream, they dyed their hair red and then it's purple. So probably funny. So speaking of Tentacle Porn, uh, this is, that's about as graceful segway as that can make, and we don't have to talk about this if you don't want to, but this is one of the bullets that was recommended for me to talk to you about. And I should preface this by saying, in my second book for our body, there are two chapters on female orgasm, two on various aspects of male sexuality. So I'm not shy about talking about this, but recently I'm on the Howard stern show, suddenly are in the Howard stern show restricting ejaculation. I don't have any context for this, but I was told to ask you about restricting ejaculation. Wow. Where'd you get that from? My sources cannot be made. Uh, but is that something that you can tell us about?

Speaker 4:          01:23:33       Um, I'm not sure what you're referencing. Oh, I think, oh, there we go. It's coming back to me. Oh, W it was funny. I had, I had a, um, well there's in, in a requiem for a dream that is something in the background called month of fury. Um, which was, I guess it was early self-help. Um, I had, uh, when I, wow, this is going way back and actually kind of flows a little bit into probably why, um, we're, we're a growing friendship has happening here because, uh, similar roots in a certain way. But when I, my first, when I was in film school, and then there's another great thing for young film students to know is like, there's usually the first screenplay you write that we'll never get made. And believe me, that happens. And at a certain point you have to be, you take the bold step to abandon it, you know, because there's a learning process.

Speaker 4:          01:24:27       And that first script, and I worked on a script that was set in Coney island and I had a guy, really talented kid I grew up with who probably if you went to Wall Street would be a, you know, a hundred millionaire type of guy. But he ended up getting involved in this kind of culty organization that are those guys who go around and sell roses and little toys around the streets wearing ties. I don't know if you ever see them. There are a lot on the west coast and they, they're basically kind of pyramid schemes where you basically open up an office and you hire like 10 20 year old kids and they go and they hustle for you and then you buy it from a guy above you. And then if you get a few, you slowly move up this type of thing.

Speaker 4:          01:25:05       And they have these huge conventions in Vegas with where they all come together and they have all these chants where they choose each other up and get all excited. And I, I, when I was in film school, he was in the, uh, west coast area. And so I just sort of studied it and hung out with them. Once again, here's another play, hang out with a friend but also kind of get stories. So I developed this whole kind of characters and world for this movie about this. And eventually I didn't make that film, but I was able to take that character and, and when I had to bring a Hubert Selby Jr is requiem for a dream alive, Sour Goldfarb. The old lady watched a lot of TV, but we couldn't afford the TV to put TV on the channel. So I decided to make my own TV show and create and create kind of a Tony Robbins ask because Tony was just starting and it was, he, he didn't sort of evolve into the kind of figure he is now.

Speaker 4:          01:25:56       At the time he was sort of a tele van. No one really knew what it was. And it was, it was odd. So I kind of create my own sort of of that and had this guy on TV and I had to give him a philosophy. So I had an act, a friend who was also a boxer and he had this thing called Mama Fury Eddie. The harp is his name. And it was three rules, which are actually three great rules. It was 30 days. Uh, no refined sugar, 30 days, no red meat and 30 days, no. Our, yes, now those all together. Yeah. You do all three, four a month for 30 days. And it was actually a very interesting, you know, so, so he preached it to me cause he would do it before he would box or one more. You died? No refined sugar, no refined sugar.

Speaker 4:          01:26:40       So that's everything. Like toothpaste anywhere where there could be sugar, you know, no red meat and then no orgasm. So in the movie requiem for a dream, the third one is not actually pitched it because I just thought it would be good as a little secret. Now I'm sort of giving it away, although it's come out of it. Uh, it's, it's actually in there. It's actually in their bit. It's an Easter egg that's hidden in the film somewhere. It was funny because when I'm, you know, when we started working on it, I suggested it to the actors that they should go on a month of fury before we make the movie. Just to understand what it is to withdraw, which is a big part of the movie creek. Cause it's hard if you're not a drug addict or a smoker, you know, to actually stop to something for 30 days to fast as you talked about too.

Speaker 4:          01:27:28       It's, it's really tricky. And here with three things that were seemingly not hard to do. And it was funny to, you know, run, see my actors that they 24 and 25 wind to kill me, I don't know. And it's the month I have another friend of mine, well my best buddy who actually on day 29 ended up proposing to a woman, which I was like, you never propose on day 29, what are you out of your freaking mind, the month of fury, fury. So if I ever did a self help, that would be, you know, hey, if you want to cowrite and start a movement, I know you, I know you've got down, you heard here first folks, I could, I could get, I think quite a few people to participate in the muck theory, actually very effective. I'd love to ask quite a few questions about the new film.

Speaker 4:          01:28:15       Uh, but the first is related to the writing of the film. So when you are writing a film like mother and there are many, and I don't want to give anything away, but many visual components, how do you write that type of material? Being the writer and then the director. I can sort of, um, not worry about that that much, but there are two different steps. I think. First you're writing and you're following along the emotional truth of the characters and following scene by scene, what's going on and watching the story unfold. And then there's the next stage. At a certain point you kind of hang up most of your writing cap because you can always rewrite if you're the writer, but then you start to become the director and start to think about blocking and movement. And that was very, very big deal in this film.

Speaker 4:          01:29:08       Can you define blocking just for people who don't know? Yeah, sure. Blocking is basically just how actors move in a scene. It's all it is, but it's really truly, um, a big part of the work because for a lot of reasons. Um, first you want to create blocking that's organic and natural to what the actors are doing in the scene. So you want to make sure whatever the actors doing makes sense with what their objective is in the scene or what they're doing in the scene or what they're not doing in the scene or what they're hiding in the scene. So you kind of want to think about what that, what that is all about. Then there's a second tier, which is as the filmmaker, you're trying to make it as economical as possible, meaning as few setups as few times to move the camera as possible.

Speaker 4:          01:29:53       Because every time you have to sort of change where the camera is, you have to change the lighting and that just takes time and you want to get as much time being shooting as possible. So you're trying to figure out blocking that works best for the simplest amount of technical problems unless you're really trying to do something technically super challenging stuff. So you try to balance those and you know, and it's kind of a balance because sometimes you will, you'll tell the actor, oh, can you help me out here with blocking? Cause it means we have to do less, but sometimes you don't want to get in their way and you want them to be creatively free. So you want to give them an open playground to play around then where they can do and move. So it's all, it's, it's, it's a balancing act, um, but it, but it's a big part of it.

Speaker 4:          01:30:37       So at a certain point, you know, when the script is done, and in the case of mother, I was actually lucky enough to have a three and a half month rehearsal period where basically, um, I convinced Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem and Michelle Pfeiffer and then Harris to join me in a warehouse out in East Brooklyn where we basically taped out the set and got, we would work on the scenes and then we'd get up on our feet and we would just start the block then. And then in the last two weeks of that three and a half month long process, I actually brought in my camera man and we shot the entire movie moving the camera around on video as kind of homework and then, which was really fascinating because you figure out all different types of problems like oh, how's the camera going to get from it's, it's a constant moving handheld camera.

Speaker 4:          01:31:25       So how am I going to get the camera from here to there because there's a wall there. Um, and, and that's, that's suddenly started to play into action. And for this film it was a very, very restricted visual language. I was part of the, one of the challenges I put in front of myself. Normally you'll have a wide shot in a movie and nice thing about a wide shot is if an actor is somehow does something that's not, that's like dramatically new, emotionally new or if they decide to comb their hair a different way in each. If you go out to a wide shot, the basically the illusion is broken for a moment because the viewer's eyes have to take in more or different part of a scene or there's other things to look at so that when you pop back into a closeup you can get away cheap almost what's happening and no one would ever notice.

Speaker 4:          01:32:18       In the case of my film, since there was no wide shots, it was extremely challenging. I mean the only shots in the film are you the over Jennifer Lawrence, his shoulder on Jennifer Lawrence, his face or her point of view, which means what she's looking at. That's the only coverage in the entire film, so that's why this edit has been, you know, almost a year long cut because I had such a limited amount of language to work with and I had to make every moment by moment by moment work even though that's not really happening in real time.

Speaker 2:          01:32:49       Why did you choose to use that constraint? I find, I feel like I could talk to you about constraints and rules for a really long time because you mentioned, yeah, exactly. Just get progressively more belligerent. And you talked about say having lunch scheduled for after the difficult meeting and then you have say, shooting over Max's shoulder and different ways of, as you put it, sort of limiting your visual palate. Why, why do that?

Speaker 4:          01:33:19       Well, I think, I think it coming out, starting as an independent filmmaker with very limited resources, uh, makes you be very, very, you know, try your, you strategically, you have to figure out economical means to basically take advantage of all the limited resources you have. So I ended up actually stylistically creating techniques that actually turn those limited economics and to a stylistic choice. So I've always been preaching that boundaries are the most important thing in any form of an art. You know, I mean, when you're a painter, you have the boundaries of a canvas and the limitation of your, of the, your colors. Um, and I think it's extremely important to do the same in filmmaking, uh, and, and, and to make real choices about how you want to do those limits. Sometimes they're self imposed. I have less of the economic issues, although always you, you have to be very economically responsible for it, for what you're doing.

Speaker 4:          01:34:21       But I went really extreme on this film, which was like, I basically said, there's three shots for every scene, which is an incredibly low amount of shots, but I would normally do, um, in a movie. And it just became an interesting exercise and experiment and, you know, and there were times when Maddie, my DP was like, don't you want to, you know, like never does a character come between Jennifer and the camera. Yeah. No one never crosses the line. I noticed that, which is crazy because when we're doing crowd scenes with lots of people, you know, it would a lot easier to tell the story by having Jen get lost in the crowd and crowd come through. But no, I was like, and my DP mad, he was like, why? Why don't we, it could be. And we talked about it for a while and, and, uh, and I was like, no, I think let's just remain Orthodox here.

Speaker 4:          01:35:10       Let's remain truthful to the intent. And the one thing I was worried about, people would feel claustrophobic or you know, bored by the style. And that doesn't seem to be the response people are in seeing those limitations. And I think that's because we just turned it into a language and into a style that people can understand. Is there something you hope audiences will respond with our walkout with? Did you have an objective, and this ties into I suppose the, the genesis of the film as well. I don't actually know the origin story. Well the origin story is hard cause it's murky. I think it came out of these endless headlines, the endless stream of notifications on your telephone. The ability to scratch right beneath the surface of our kind of civilization and realize how many desperate and awful things are happening around the planet. It's still in this, you know, pretty enlightened time and there's a lot of rage and a lot of helplessness because like what can I do?

Speaker 4:          01:36:14       How can I stop this? And you know, being an environmentalist when we're completely under assault, when you know what science is telling us is going on. And the same people that use their smart phone every second and every minute of the day of the people who say, well, science isn't always right yet. This, the product of science is in their pocket, you know, dominating their lives yet refusing to see what's going on. Like how could you not say, wow, there might be some connection going on. And I don't know. I come from a science background and I, I, I, I, I witnessed how little tiny, small changes by men can deeply have huge effects very quickly that are out of control, you know, and then this new idea of these feedback loops, which isn't that new anymore, but these ideas that are becoming more idea that there's these tipping points where things are just going to start to accelerate.

Speaker 4:          01:37:11       You know? And as a parent, I just sit there and I go, oh my gosh, you know, I look at the beauty of my child and want them forget about having a job, having a freaking atmosphere and having the ability to, I mean, it's just crazy to ever think that, you know, he'll see, uh, uh, really, uh, an elephant in the wild and in any type of wilderness way. I mean, I, I, for the, for I guess, I guess Prince William Sound was very much wilderness when I was a kid and something happened to me when I was in Prince William Sound. That was, I had a, um, we were kayaking, as I said, for weeks, and I was eating a granola bar and the wrap or fell into the water, it was like a foil wrapper. And I freaked out. I like stopped. I tried to, it just went right on there.

Speaker 4:          01:37:54       And because of the guilt of that, I still, when I see trash on a beach, I pick it up for that foil. You know, it's like that, that guilt has carried me and I, because at that time it very much felt untouched. Like I was the f one of the first humans to ever experience it. There isn't a place on the planet anymore, not because of pollution only, but because of climate change that isn't effected by humans. There is nowhere on the planet that is true wilderness as it was 60 years ago. You know, when I was, I was writing a western and I realized, you know, it was set in 1883 I think if every single person on the planet disappear, drop dead was abducted or whatever at that point in time, besides some forge metals, belt buckles, horseshoes, bullets, guns, everything, every remnant of humanity would be gone in a century, you know, completely gone because it was, everything was built out of earth materials and then you suddenly have all these freakish new materials where every single bag of Lay's potato chip you have is something that's around for 10,000 years, longer particles that are part of us and you can't escape it.

Speaker 4:          01:39:08       And so quickly from my childhood where there still was places on the planet that weren't really feeling any impact to now where the, it's all changed. It's, it's scary that people are just completely denying it and turning their backs on it. And out of that just, you know, I just want to how it's like, you know, I felt the Ginsberg howl and I just wanted to Hal and I guess it's my how, what is the Ginsburg Hell, Alan Ginsburg, uh, the poem. How got it. All right. Sorry, I'm, they never read the trading, my lack of it, you know, show that way you should read. Oh, that one's great. All right. Yeah, I mean, but it's basically, you know, it was a cry from the 60s you know, of like what for his generation or at least that's the way I took it. How would you like people to go into the movie and who should go see them now?

Speaker 4:          01:39:54       The obvious commercial answer might be after everyone. Yeah. Well, I think, look, I think you got to know you're going into a roller coaster ride and it's like, you know, when you get to the amusement park and you see that loop de loop and you're like, no freaking way, you should, you should be ready for it. I mean, yeah. And no matter how much I prep you and Tim can tell you, it goes there, so, right. I mean it's, it's intense and it's, so if you want an intense different ride, if you're, you know, you want to see something different at the, at the cinema, you know, please come on down. Um, I, I think, I think it's, uh, you know, that's what we tried to do was make, make a very unique rollercoaster. Except, you know, it may go off the tracks and into the concrete wall, but I can't really be, I don't want to be responsible for that, but that's what happens.

Speaker 4:          01:40:46       But I mean, I just want, I think it works on a lot of levels. Um, I was always like thinking was going to be really scary and, and you know, tilting into the horror genre. You know, Jen Lawrence, when she saw it actually thought it was incredibly beautiful and moving, that there was a beauty to it. And, and then I, and I've heard that reflected in a lot of ways and so it's definitely not your normal night at the movie. It's, but it's the type of movie that you go see and, and everyone will have something to say about it, I think. Um, and hopefully they're not too many profane words directed in my direction.

Speaker 2:          01:41:27       Well, it could be profaned, but modifying something good also. Yeah, there's that. Yeah. I'd like to ask about the sound. Yeah. So I have read that, well, a few things that a, a lot of independent films or films in general fail from poor audio quality.

Speaker 4:          01:41:47       That was a big thing I realized very young in my career was like, this is a pretty good movie, but something's off. And it was always a sound

Speaker 2:          01:41:54       and the sound in this movie and in a, and I mean in, in more than one of your films certainly is a very, I'm searching for the right words, but very visceral, very pronounced. And uh, I only read this other expression after the fact after I saw the movie, but that I think thinking of music or the sound as a, as an additional character. Yeah. Could you elaborate on that? Because I've, I've, I've never paid so much attention to sound in a film.

Speaker 4:          01:42:28       I think it's a, well, you, you saw a slightly unfinished, the only, the first half of the film was kind of Po really dialed in, so it's going to get better. I hope that's what we're supposed to be doing as we speak. You know, sound designed. It for me is a huge tool and I got totally turned on when I was a, uh, a young kid. I saw a documentary on the guys who did the sound design for star wars and they were out in the desert banging on wires, making light saber sounds and it, it blew my mind. I was like, Oh wow, you know, that's such a cool idea that you can use any sound to do this and matching up sound and image you can really mess around. So I've always been fascinated by that. Um, but you know, since I move, make these films where I really am trying to make the audience have a visceral experience with the character. In this case Jennifer Lawrence's character, I try to draw the audience into her subjective point of view by you know, creating a soundscape that starts off realistic, but then as things sort of shift and get more and more insane becomes more and more expressive and expressionistic Dick,

Speaker 2:          01:43:31       I love the fact that people are going to be able to see this in theaters for a lot of reasons. And I want to connect this to something else that I read about you, which relates to the historical lack of compliance to widget making. Uh, so the story

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       of you shooting Natalie Portman for Black Swan in the subway at something like three in the morning without necessary permits, without her having signed a contract. How do you, and I don't know it nearly as many filmmakers as you do, but I know a few. How do you get away with it? I mean you, meaning you seem to be able, and this is from the outside looking in, but to make the art you want to make and bend the rules or do things like that. Why is that? Are there certain sort of contractual decisions or conversations you've had that allow you to do it? Did you set the precedent as like a problem child early? So that's, they're just like, ah, it's fucking Darren. So you get away with it. I mean it's just the project. I, I don't think, you know, it's never meant to be abusive.

Speaker 4:          01:44:37       I mean, I don't know, but I'm just saying, I think that's the, the, the reality is it's, it's not abusive. It's about the work. It's always about the work. And I think if you can relay back to that, but this is about, you know, US bringing this to life and the best way, and I think, you know, there were people that would take that line of argument and turn it into abuse or, or push the line to something that's not safe or fair. And I think I'm pretty empathetic to other people's feelings. Maybe to a fault because I think some directors in May, it's kind of helpful sometimes to push past some of that pain and be blind to it. But that's never, that's just not my character. I can't do it. I, I feel when people are uncomfortable very easily and it makes me probably better as a director to read performance, but it probably gets me less than what I always need.

Speaker 4:          01:45:34       Cause I feel sorry sometimes I have mercy cause and how dare you. So, yeah, but you know, I think though that, you know, when it's the work you, you just, you go for it. And people get excited by that. And if you're actually being truthful about that. But there are times and places where I've tried to do too much and people have pointed out to me, hey that's probably, you know, it's not fair for these reasons and I hear that and, and then I just listened to myself if that's the truth or not. If you have that conversation and doesn't feel true to you, is that the, is that one of the primary causes of walking from potential projects or like what, and I guess all of this is sort of coalescing into a question of if you were talking to a very promising new director, let's say director, maybe they're a writer, director, but they drive and you want it to prevent them from getting chewed up or corrupted by the system.

Speaker 4:          01:46:31       Is there any particular career advice that you would give to them? It's a good question. I mean, I mean, you know, just you gotta be doing, if I, I'm always from the school, you got to do it cause you have to do it, but you don't have any other choice. But to do it. Just recently I ran into a film maker and he was sort of complaining and whining about doing a TV show because he really wanted to be making films and that and then, but you know what? My advice to him was not just stick with your gut and do what you want. I could tell he was a type of guy that should be doing that TV show because I could see like he was, he was already past that point where he had crossed and he was just going to, so I was like, do it. But, but then you find people who just, you know, want to do what they do and you know, and then you just want to support them and give them as much love and support to, to get it because they're trying their hardest to do something that only they can do.

Speaker 2:          01:47:33       Now does that mean, for instance, I've heard this advice with writing that writing, you should only write say a book if it's easier for you to write the book and then to not write the book. Like it has to be that much of a kind of compulsion. I don't think it's ever easier to make a movie than not make a a well, I guess maybe just sort of from a

Speaker 4:          01:47:55       personal right

Speaker 2:          01:47:57       pain, pleasure standpoint. Like I remember reading an anecdote and I don't like it again, who knows standard yet. But about you, I actually think this might have been from the New Yorker, a about a diary entry where you were talking about a rave in Thailand and you were like, the sun came up and the people were dancing and, and the sun came down and the people were dancing and the tides went out and I was miserable because I wasn't making movies. Yeah, that's true. That means you have to make movies, right? I mean it's, I

Speaker 4:          01:48:26       guess so. I mean, I think for me it was storytelling more than films, although I think there would definitely things in my past and experience that, you know, helped me. Like very early on I got into photography into black and white photography when I was in junior high school and I would, you know, go into the dark room and develop the film. I loved it. And I don't know why that fell into my lap. It just so happened they had this lab nearby and I was able to take a class there and then I just started thinking about photographs and taking pictures and all that. So, and that all led to this. Um, but I think it could've gone any way. It's funny cause when I was in college, I didn't know what I wanted to do the first couple of years I was in college.

Speaker 4:          01:49:09       I hadn't discovered filmmaking till I was a junior in college. And, um, and I remember walking around hitting myself in the head going, oh, I'm never going to find what I want. I'm never going to find my calling, you know, and then it happens for you. Hopefully. And that happened for me. I found something that I, it was the first time I ever got an a in college was filmmaking. No, I was a B minus student until film came along and suddenly, boom, it was like something that kept me out of my girlfriend's room. You know, it was like, I'd rather be rather be cutting the movie then laying in bed. So I was like, um, you know, I found it but uh, I think eventually it comes and, but it could have been a lot of things I think. I don't think necessarily like, I mean it's this weird kind of weird art form and it could have probably come to me in lots of different ways. It was just something that I was like, okay, I see a path, I see something there. And it's interesting and fascinating and there's a lot to learn in there. And so I just went for it. If I were to ask, say some of your closest friends what your superpower is, maybe you wouldn't talk about it cause he seemed to be a pretty understated, humble guy, but what your superpower is or what makes you different? What would they say or what might they say?

Speaker 4:          01:50:27       I mean, my friend Dan is like, who's doing those visual effects? For me it was, I met him first day of Freshman Year of college says, you know, when people ask me, but he changed. I say, you know what? He was an asshole on college and he's still an asshole. But does my brother telling me that that's an old breadth therefore it, yeah, exactly. Exactly. I don't know. It's hard. It's hard for me to say, but definitely one of the best things about my life has, uh, as I talked about there is I still hang out with the guys. I went to nursery school. I still hang out with the guys I went to high school with. I still hang out with the guys I went to college with and um, I think that that having the roots like I'm into roots some into loyalty and I think that's pro and I work with the same filmmakers pretty much. And I think, I dunno, I had my friend Jed once said that the guy who dies with the most friends wins. I thought that was pretty good advice. If I were to Pester your friends a little bit more, give them a few drinks. Yeah. And they get past the obligatory, he's still an asshole.

Speaker 4:          01:51:30       If they're, if they got to like the, the, the, the point of drunk reminiscing and sort of the emotional point of drunkenness, what would they attribute your success to? A Lot, a lot. I mean, more people don't make it then make it, you know, in the film business. Ooh, it's a good question. Oh, you attributed to, we could make it direct to, I mean it's a combination. I mean, I had, I had excellent parents, but you know, almost always support me and always told me that not to work so hard, not to work too hard. You know, when I would tell I got to go work, they'd say, well, don't work too hard. Was there saying I, I mean that was after I got out of college. So up to college they put, they were both school teachers and academics was super important, but they also created a lot of, um, they created very good responsibility and boundaries, but also, um, didn't necessarily create opportunities, but gave me breathing room, would support to find opportunities.

Speaker 4:          01:52:33       So I struggled in my twenties, but I was able to struggle in my twenties. Um, and so that, that was, that was, I think a big part was having that type of support system and my sister, so family was a major part of it. And I think that allowed me to have persistence, you know, um, which I always say is nine tenths of the game is persistence is, you know, you gotta get up to the plate, you know, to get that chance, to take that swing, uh, and to get to the plate just takes a lot of work. Um, but then, and then when you get there, it's preparation and homework. Having done all your homework and um, as well as you can, as much as you can and then, and then as you're taking the swing is make it a responsible swing for the team. You know, make sure that that I, I love the baseball metaphor.

Speaker 4:          01:53:27       I wonder how much longer I can keep going with your students. You teach, what is the name of the class? I don't see, I mean, I don't do it regularly because I haven't found the best place. I taught at Nyu for a bit and um, a few other places. But I mean, I just, I, I just to be honest, I kind of wing it to see what kids are doing. You know, I'll come in, I'll, I'll talk to them about what their dreams are, what their projects are. I'll ask. They all sort of share. So I have them all described each other's stuff. But I, I love doing scene study with kids where I have them put up a scene and bring work with actors. Put up a scene. Now this is a, this is a scene that has already peered, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 4:          01:54:09       I've seen from their projects, they describe it to me. They tell me what they want. They'll put up the scene and then I'll, I'll teach them, I'll give them my, my direction on how I would block it. I'll work with the actors, I'll just show them my process and then I'll pick a truck bought out and I'll show them, let's see, how would we, how do we shoot it? And I'll just draw my designs to show them how to draw. So I give him a chalkboard is sort of bird's eye view. Always bird eye's view. That's how I've always, I, I came up, I mean I know the filmmakers do it, but it was when I was 1920 years old starting to do films. That's how I started. I always, and it's probably from playing dungeons and dragons as a kid, it was like, you know, you get that sky view and like I drew little triangles and I came up with all these different shapes and forms.

Speaker 4:          01:54:50       I have my own like language that I've developed over the years for how to do it and I have the ability to look at that architectural plans and then to see it in three d below so I can, that's how I do it. I do it very much from a bird eye view. Dungeons and dragons will be for round two. I was, I was always a chaotic good cleric Plus Gray Elf. Elf. Yeah. You're a cleric. No, no, I, I don't remember that. Well actually, I mean we played for ever, but I don't actually remember my character. I'll bring some graph paper next time. If you were to, this is related to the class, let's just say you could no longer make films. Right. And your sort of divinely assigned to mission was to coach five five to 10 filmmakers. Yeah. And not only would you get the psychic reward of seeing them do well, but much like say who bankroll

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       is a poker player, you would get a percentage of the future. What are the things you would focus on if you had say, a six month period? Well, I mean if I was doing that and I had a share of it, yeah, I mean as soon as you bring the share into it, it's like a, all right, so that we could, we could, we could, we get approached as a couple different ways. So one is you get the profit share, it's like a 50 50 split with them. Plus you have a kicker, but you have to add some money. All right, we can do that. I would never do that. I this is this only investments. Awful invests. This is force. That's what we have huge Chinese companies for it. But the other could be really whatever reward you would want to get out of it. So it could be the acclaim and receiving awards and prizes and so on. It could be anything else. But I mean really,

Speaker 4:          01:56:32       I mean the, the real, I guess, I mean the gift of any teachers to see whatever the goals of the student are, as long as they are righteous goals be achieved, you know. So, you know, I would probably want to teach students that were, you know, probably had just wanted to tell good stories and then I would want them to see them, make them as well as they could and then have them connect with as many people as they could. The awards, the money, that's all silly stuff. I mean, it's great for everything, but it's really has as many issues with it as good things. So, um, I mean it's, it's just you want to find people and I'd want to find students that really just want to tell stories and entertain and they not that they want to be a filmmaker quicker because where the rock star of the present day or the NBA basketball player of the day, you know, where it's because that's what they want to do.

Speaker 4:          01:57:32       Like when I started telling stories, it wasn't like when I was a kid, no one knew what Spielberg did. We heard the name Lucas and Spielberg. But that was it, you know, but not really, you know, no one, how do you become a director? And when I started to do it, even in the early nineties, it wasn't really, it was early Sundance days. It wasn't really this track record of how to do it. So I wasn't like looking for the reason to be, you know, that it could lead to something that was clear. It was just something that was interesting and fascinating to me. So at this point when there are all these paths too, you know, um, fame and money and all that and you know, if you make one film you can go and do a marvel movie or something like that, which is happening all the time now.

Speaker 4:          01:58:21       I think you want to find people that are looking to tell the stories and then help them tell stories. And like when I, the last class I taught at Nyu, my best student was a Turkish kid who was going back to Turkey to tell a small story about an apple tree on the, on the, on the side of mount are at that starts a village fight and tiny story. It could be huge, who knows? But he was serious and you just wanted to tell that story. And so I gravitated to him and I spent most of my time in the class working with him to help him because he was the guy who was going to go make a movie and was serious and knew what he was doing. And I said, let me focus on this kid so the other kids can see, be inspired by his path. Any

Speaker 2:          01:59:05       top scripts, if somebody has never read a screenplay and you're like, look, just start, start with a

Speaker 4:          01:59:11       BC. I mean, the guy's working today, Eric Roth, Scott silver, read any of their scripts that great writers. I'm Chris Terrio. I mean, there's a lot of great writers working right now. I mean there's, there's, there's a lot of good, great scripts that I've read. I mean, Charlie Kaufman scripts are great and fun to read.

Speaker 2:          01:59:29       It's enough to start with. Yeah, I think so. Where can people find the film? Where should they learn more about it? I've never had something. Yes, exactly. And I've had just for everybody listening, I highly recommend you check it out. Like Darren said, like, no, you're signing up for a roller coaster. And uh, but I've had nothing produce this really unique. I'll get yelled at for modifying unique by someone I know, but that's okay. I'm going to just for him, very unique, a dreamlike state for about 18 hours afterwards. It was amazing. Yeah, it was really profound. But where can people learn more about it? Well, I mean it's

Speaker 4:          02:00:09       mother with a low case. I'm in an exclamation point, which causes all different type of difficulties with social media because of the exclamation point. But, um, I mean by the time this comes out, I hope, uh, it's going to be around, um, if not, um, you know, uh, that, I mean just Google mother movie and you'll, you'll be seeing a bunch of bat it out, I hope.

Speaker 2:          02:00:33       Where can people, if they want to check you out on social media or was that something else?

Speaker 4:          02:00:38       Full name Darren Aronofsky ad on Instagram and a Twitter. Yeah, that's, I, I, you know, Instagram is pretty cool. I've been doing this cool thing. I don't know if you've been following it, but I found two young film students and they were moving out to go to film school in La and I rented them a big projector and a cube truck and they'd been driving through the country, projecting the word mother in different languages onto all different types of structures around the country. And so I've been posting these, emit these beautiful images that these young filmmakers have been making, um, to help sell, promote my film. But also, um, it's, it's been a fun project to learn about all these different places all over America. It's kind of humans of New York, is that humans have, sure. Is that the name of the Cummins in New York? Humans of New York. But, um, more projections of mother.

Speaker 2:          02:01:30       Very cool. So people can say hi to you on the interweb, check it out. Any last, uh, asks or recommendations of people listening besides seeing the movie? I mean, just keep, uh, keep seeing the weird stuff. Go out and, you know, let you know, support when you, and then spread the word, you know. So I think, you know, if you dig the movie, get it out there and get everyone to go see it. I'm hoping that it's type of film that you'll want to talk to other people about. Well, I will, I can attest certainly with two people I saw it with, we talked about it for hours afterwards. So one of the things I really enjoyed his head, this is not follow the typical template. Any typical template. Yeah. And that I can, that I can see. So it leads to a lot of conversation. Dare to be different, dare to be different. Well Darren, I really appreciate the time. Thank you to Sam. It's an amazing, yeah, this has been really fun and we, we can, we can keep going, but I want to let you get back to his film. Yeah, well then polishing up everything and to everybody listening, you can find links to everything we've discussed, including the movie, the books and so on in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast as per usual and every other episode. And until next time, thank you for listening. Bye Bye.
