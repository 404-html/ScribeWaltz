Speaker 2:          00:04:09       Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers, people who are exceptionally good at what they do. To tease out the routines, habits, favorite books, and so on that you can hopefully test and apply to your own lives. And my guest today is none other than drew Houstin, h. O u s t o n at drew Houstin on Twitter and elsewhere. He's the cofounder and CEO of Dropbox since founding the company in 2007 with a rush for dozy, drew has led the company's growth from a simple idea to a service used by 500 million people around the world. You can let that number sink in. Drew received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Mit in 2006 I think I've heard of that place. After graduating, he turned his frustration with carrying USB drives and emailing files to himself into a demo for what then became Dropbox.

Speaker 2:          00:05:01       Today, Dropbox is one of the world's leading business collaboration platforms with 11 million paying subscribers and 1800 plus employees across 12 global offices. Drew, welcome to the show. Thank you. You know, I've wanted to have an excuse to ask you for your life story and all of these details because we've known each other quite a while, but it's super weird to sit down with a glass of wine at a dinner table or something like that and just start asking you for your doctor evil story. So this is, this is a fun opportunity for me to dig in. So I appreciate you taking the time. Awesome. Yeah, me too. It's a, it's, it's great to be here and, uh, thought we would start with some of the backstory that I do not know and that is your childhood. And perhaps you could just begin by telling us how you would describe yourself as a kid. I mean, let's call it kind of three to grade or anytime really. What type of kid were you?

Speaker 3:          00:06:02       So yeah, going way back. Um, well first I was, uh, I was definitely that kid who is a on computers. So we, my parents, I remembered, uh, just like, like titling into my living room and seeing this glowing orb and all these buttons. And those were two things I really liked when I was three. Um, I guess still do. Um, and um, so for sure I was, I was super interested in computers and technology and started out by, by playing computer or video games. Basically. That was like the first interest. And then I wanted to make my own computer games. Um, I thought that my career was going to be starting a computer game company and I thought that was a, that there would be nothing better than that. Um, and, uh, so I, but I, but I was that kid, I'm sorry. I learned programming at an early age.

Speaker 3:          00:06:59       Um, I grew up in, uh, just outside of Boston, so grew up in New England. Um, and, uh, and then on my way to MIT, I've really liked math, science. Um, so, uh, kind of out of central casting in terms of being a computer science student. Um, and then, yeah, and then, then I got, my first career was babysitting, but then I discovered that you could be paid to program and then that caused a bit of a career shift, which we can talk about. Um, uh, as much as I enjoyed the babysitting lifestyle, you know, you get like three bucks an hour, I eat some Pringles watched the HBO, it's not that bad. Um, but, uh, the program is even better anyway. So, um, so, uh, so, but in, in middle school and in high school I ended up getting a bunch of programming internships or, or, or summer jobs, um, at what worst our bed startups basically. Um, one of the most remote, most of them are local, but then that got me on a path of starting companies and, and being involved in startups. But, um, I would say those are probably the, um, the biggest when it, when it, when it comes to Dropbox and everything that kind of followed after to from my childhood. It was a happy childhood. Lots of, um, uh, say it was still pretty balanced. But I did, I like programming and engineering was for sure my first, my first love.

Speaker 2:          00:08:32       And were you a shy kid and extroverted kid? Played Sports, kind of kept to yourself at recess? What was, what would somebody looking in from the outside? Like, how would your, how would your third grade teacher describe you in that capacity?

Speaker 3:          00:08:48       Yeah, I think somewhere in the middle. So I, I wasn't, um, reclusive. Um, I had a really group of friends. Um, I wasn't captain of the soccer team either. Um, I think I did, I did academic, I did academic decathlon, which is just a fascinating thing that it exists. Um, but you know, more of a math leads then right. Then an athlete to athlete. So, um, but uh, and I was, yeah, it was not like a super social, but I had a good group of friends and um, um, and then for sure it was, I went into college, I became a lot more social and, and just curious about humans and human behavior. Um, but, uh, but otherwise I think people like I would have been known in class, um,

Speaker 2:          00:09:41       as always doing it. Like, I think there were like those superlatives and yearbooks. I think I was like most likely to start a company or it'd be like they pegged it pretty early. Yeah. So I was doing homework for this, which I always enjoy doing when it's someone I know, uh, because I dig up all these bits and pieces that I then want to fair it out and explore a bit. So I came across this line, the described folding chair on top of fraternity, uh, at MIT and that you would go up there with piles of books and read these books. So I don't like could you place us when that was in your undergrad career and how you chose the books and why you did that? Yeah, so, so

Speaker 3:          00:10:28       I, it was about my junior year of, uh, of, of Undergrad, I took a leave of absence because I had an idea for a startup that I want it to pursue. Um, so I took a year off to do that. Uh, what I noticed was that the, this was back in 2004, so the, I was maybe 21 and the, uh, sat was changing. I started online sat prep company and maybe, and because what the opportunity was was the sat was changing in 240 2005 from 1600 points to 2,400 points. So suddenly all the course material overnight was going to be obsolete. And so I saw an opportunity to maybe develop, not just a course for the new sat but an online course. And I teamed up with a former teacher from my high school who had his own little cottage sat prep company and I'm like, Hey, if we come together, we can put this thing online and we'll be on an even playing field because, um, you know, all those 800 page books that have been printed about it are now a obsolete and who really wants to go to some classroom at eight in the morning on Saturday.

Speaker 3:          00:11:32       Um, anyway, like we can build a much better experience if we do it online. So, um, I was really excited about starting a company and we jumped into it and I think we met in a Chili's and like we're planning world domination and like figuring out, okay, how do you incorporate a company? And so it's really, um, introduction to the world of starting companies. And then, um, it was, uh, it also, the more I learned about the mechanics of, of starting a company, the more I realized I didn't know about business. Um, and I, and I knew a lot about in engineering and programming and, um, I had been, I had worked at startups but when it came to one w but it was kind of, there was a fog beyond just like building the product. And so I was like, all right, we're going to need, I know like sales and marketing and strategy, like these are all things and all I know is I don't know a lot about them.

Speaker 3:          00:12:32       So, um, I had the highly scientific method of, I just was like, all right, I'm just gonna go on to Amazon, type in sales by the top three or four books and just do that for every like category. Um, and then I had a couple of book recommendations from one of the founders of one of the companies where I worked as well. But, uh, but it was, it was great and it was, it was, it was an important combination. So if one was one was actually starting, the company gave me motivation to really learn this stuff because I think a lot of times when you're reading it can just be like entertainment basically. It's like something where you just like read the book, you'll like, that's interesting, but then don't use the knowledge to actually starting a company. Then you really have an excuse to internalize and really study the material.

Speaker 3:          00:13:17       So there's a big difference between reading the material and studying it. Totally. But I was pretty systematic about it and like, okay, here's all the stuff that I don't know and, um, and then is going to be a good way to get me introduced to all these topics. Um, and all of that. Maybe the first instance of that was when, um, you know, I went through my high school and I was, and there were a lot of great books that you read as part of your, um, you know, high school curriculum. But, um, then I stumbled across the book emotional intelligence by Daniel Goleman. And I was like, oh my God. Like this has just like, it's, I mean, it's nonfiction. Um, but it, it, it spelled out something that was, I just didn't know you could kind of break down in a logical way. And suddenly I have this understanding about the world that I didn't have before. Um, and so that was important because it sort of, it was sort of one of a bunch of early examples that anything is trainable. And, and, and it, it got me on a path to developing what we'd now call a growth mindset. Um, and realizing that it's possible to learn about these things that you were where you have no experience or where it's easy to be like, oh, I don't know about that or I'm just an engineer. I'm not a business person. Um, and kind of shatter that misconception.

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       Do you think that you were open to all of these different categories of learning because of the necessity vis-a-vis starting the company? The reason I asked that is that, uh, it's, it's not across the board, but some people with engineering chops have seemed to have a learned or intrinsic disdain for sales marketing. This different bits and pieces of businesses that are a little softer, let's say, less quantifiable in some respects. Uh, was it, was it simply the motivation in building this company where we had to write a, or rather wear all those hats that kind of drove you into these different categories? Or where are you intrinsically using that word quite a bit, but interested in learning more about these different buckets through these different books?

Speaker 3:          00:15:29       Well, I think it was a little of both. So certainly starting the company made it a necessity and created a lot, a lot of additional motivation. But the experience, I also found these other topics, uh, just as interesting as, as the engineering. Um, and I, and I think it's, yeah, it's a big cultural when engineers, um, start off by being dismissive or defensive about that the technology is all that matters or if it doesn't have a triple and a girl in Greek letters, it doesn't count. Certainly was certainly like a cultural meme at Mit. Um, and I think it just creates a huge blind spot for people, um, both because it makes them less effective. But it's also like, the stuff is, is actually really interesting and, but I kept having experiences like that and the emotional intelligence, which is just one example, but I took a class on negotiation and MIT, which sort of opened my eyes a notch further on this kind of thing where I'm like, all right, negotiation.

Speaker 3:          00:16:23       I go into that class. I don't know a lot about it. I'm like, whoever like yells louder lies more, smacks the table harder, I guess that's what makes you get negotiator. Um, and then this class like, I mean those are, those are tactics, but like the class has these frameworks where like, okay, it's more, people have thought about this and they've broken it down. Um, and you, and it turns out that there's a whole process of uncovering mutual interests and figuring out what your leverage is and your best alternative Dah, Dah, Dah. And so, and, and spelling it out in a way where I was like, actually this is a lot more straight forward than some of the theoretical math classes I'm, I'm, I have to take. Um, and it's a lot more applicable to my daily life. And so, um, I started to, I really appreciated like learning a little bit about a lot of different disciplines and in just putting up a folding chair on my roof was the first thing that came to mind as far as how I could actually do that.

Speaker 2:          00:17:23       Were there any other books besides emotional intelligence during that period that really had an impact on you?

Speaker 3:          00:17:31       Yes. So in that negotiation classes book called getting to yes. Um, which is about principle negotiation. Um, and I still think about a lot of those I still think about and apply a lot of those concepts, um, today. And then some of the, so part of it was just like kind of doing a random walk, Amazon. But, um, I also became friends with the founders of the companies where I worked. Um, and I went during lunch breaks or at other times I go like chase him down and bug them and ask them questions about like, hey, how do you start a company? Like, do you have any book recommendations? I'm just making that kind of taking advantage of being the bright eyed, bushy tailed intern, um, and shaking down my boss or my mentor or my, the founder or my mentors for, for advice. And so two of the books that were really instrumental, uh, the first one is the innovator's dilemma by Clay Christiansen. Um, it's a book about how businesses get disrupted and, um, and what, and it's a big part, a lot of those themes or why startups can succeed and thrive even when there are big competitors who you would think would just wipe them out. Um, and so how that cycle works. And there's a book called crossing the Chasm, which is another classic. Yeah, it's a book on marketing, technology, marketing. It's like how did, how do you, how do technology products make their way from early adopters to the mainstream?

Speaker 2:          00:18:53       And if you find yourself revisiting those books, or were they a point in time during that rooftop Amazon education period?

Speaker 3:          00:19:04       I have, I met, I'd say there are a lot of, you read a lot of books. Not all of them are as good as the innovator's dilemma, but then yeah, it, it also helps to revisit some of the classics. Uh, innovator's dilemma is, I've actually, both of those books are good examples, so, so yeah, I do revisit them because again, when you're 21 and you've never had a real job, you know, you're, you're, you're reading this book and you sort of get a general sense for things, but you don't, you don't really deeply understand the concepts and then coming back five years later, 10 years later, you can really absorb a lot more of that material. So I do, I, I read a lot of books in general and then when I'm reading a book, I'll triage them like, okay, is this something I need to study? Is it something that's like interesting or is it that I might need to know something about or is it just fun? Um, and if you study it, if I'm like, I need to study this book, then I approach it pretty differently than if it's just like entertainment.

Speaker 2:          00:20:05       And for those people who haven't read getting to, yes. When you were leading into that with some of the concepts from the class. I thought to myself, I bet that was part of the class or one of the books you read because you, you had best alternative and there's a term I do recommend also people read getting to yes, Batna, best alternative to negotiated agreement, which is a really important concept to grasp. And there's another book that I recommend to people. I think it was written later by one of the coauthors of getting to yes called getting past to know and I think they go together really, really nicely. Uh, if you were teaching, say we're just going to stick on books for a little bit because I know you read so much. If you were teaching saying a freshmen class or senior class Undergrad, uh, to, let's just say smart but non technical people and you were assigning books to read, uh, and uh, they can be part of the class or things, it could be read in advance. If you were to pick, I'm just pulling this out of thin air, but three to five books that would be sort of the core of your reading list. Uh, do any come to mind that we, that we haven't talked about?

Speaker 3:          00:21:20       So for this, for the sake of starting earth, if the subject of the class, we're starting a company yeah. Um, or evolving from being an engineer to being a business person. Um, I have a few, I have a handful of, of books that I really love and the concepts I still, that I use and think about every day. So, um, probably my two favorites are a high output management by Andy Grove, um, which Andy Grove was the CEO of Intel, which was kind of the Google of its time back, uh, in the particular back in the eighties and early nineties. So he, Andy was an engineer, one of the founding engineers and then rose the ranks at Intel and became CEO. So he, he's lived his path. And, and when I read about that or I heard about this book and it was introduced me as the best book on management ever written.

Speaker 3:          00:22:19       Um, and I agree and it just breaks down all the mechanics of um, okay. How, how do you run a team? How do you break down a goal and to into sub goals? How do you just the one on one of, of, of, of running a team and, and running an organization and a focus on, uh, output and results and how do you measure people? And just a lot, a lot of the things that you, nuts and bolts, things that you, uh, challenges that you encounter when you're, when you're running a team. Um, whether that's a company or a team within a company. Um, the second is the effective executive, um, which does a great by Peter Drucker. Um, and the central core of that book is really about people. It's very easy to mistake a effort for effectiveness. Um, there are a lot of different phrases for this, like, you know, it to confuse motion for progress or, but, but it's really about that idea.

Speaker 3:          00:23:13       So how do you, um, how do you know if you're being effective, what practices? And then there's a bunch of practices that you can adopt that, um, that make you more effective and then how do you avoid the sand traps of things that feel productive but aren't actually, um, and how do you deal dissects or how do you unpack the case where we all have the same number of hours in a day, but some of us seem to accomplish a lot more than others. The why is that and what can you do instead? So the, the effective executive is, it covers a lot of that crowns that, that's another, those two I think of is kind of like textbooks. Like you want to study them, you want to take notes, you want to really chew on the material. Um, then I, I think there's others, there's a lot of other tactical things about starting a company.

Speaker 3:          00:24:00       I'd say some more of the, uh, favorite book that's more about the experience of running a company is Ben Horowitz's book hard thing about hard things, right? Which is kind of just shows you kind of a mess and adventure and the crazy highs and lows of, of, and like with the human experiences of actually having to do this. Um, and then I probably zoom out and get a little more philosophical. Um, so a couple of favorite books are, um, poor Charlie's Almanack by Charlie monger. So Charlie Munger is Warren Buffett's longtime business partner. Um, and um, and one of the, this book is really interesting because one of the things about being a CEO or taking on big responsibility, um, for anything is you have to make a lot of decisions about a lot of different things and do it quickly and be right. Um, and so how do you be right about tons of different things, especially if you don't have a lot of life experience.

Speaker 3:          00:24:56       Like how do you train up that scale quickly? I mean, that's really called wisdom or judgment. Um, and so the, it says like, how do you, how do you grow wisdom or grow judgment quickly? Um, poor Charlie's Almanack is a, is a great example of books. So it talks about how actually a lot of what you need to know to be successful in life, conceptually, you learn it in middle school or in high school, you just don't apply it or you don't really internalize the concepts. Um, and he argues that a lot of really wise ineffective people develop or be basically build a catalog of mental models, um, where uh, and concepts, whether that's something from and basically assemble all the best ideas from all the different disciplines and then figure out how to apply them in life. And so for example, the concept of, um, a Batna like in and leverage that that might be a concept that can be applied in all kinds of different situations or comparative advantage from economics or, and, uh, or you know, you could, you could go on about, um, these different concepts, but then figuring out how do you internalize them so well that you're able to figure out, okay, these are what matters in these situations.

Speaker 3:          00:26:11       Um, and then, uh, and then how do you avoid petty particularly avoid terrible decisions. But really how do you build enough of it? Get enough of these, he calls it allowed us to work. How do you build them enough of a network of these mental models so that you know which ones to apply when, um, and that you find yourself most of the time being able to make good quick decisions. Um, and then I'm also on the philosophical front. Uh, so zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. Yeah. Appear sick. Yup. Um, so you talked about engineers who like dismiss like all these things that can't be fit into an algorithm or uh, or, or you know, that don't have some kind of like mathematical rigor, rigor underpinning them. Um, zen in the art of motorcycle maintenance is about that. Like that. Just that question of okay, you have like this whole rational world which can explain a bunch of stuff, but then you have the whole aesthetic world, which can't be boiled down to a formula.

Speaker 3:          00:27:08       And they both exist and they are both useful in different cases, but they don't tend to get along. And so how do you like, so what's up with that? And then it's a really great book about those kinds of concepts. And I think developing an appreciation for, for both are developing both your left and right brain, you know, to, to, to use that analogy I think is really important if you're, if you're running a team or, or growing a company. Um, because there's a lot of stuff where it's a lot about technique and data and, and um, and sort of like, and a lot of things like strategy or the engineering, how are kind of fall into these if this, then that kind of reasoning. But then a lot of the hard part of the job is really about people and what motivates people. How do you, um, paint a vision of the world that's exciting for people?

Speaker 3:          00:28:01       How do you build good relationships? Um, how do you develop products with taste? Uh, those are things that are not going to be where you're not able to reach as much into the, to the more rational or in or like kind of engineering, um, bag of tricks. So I think developing both of those, um, developing both sides of your brain are developing an appreciation for for both is, is really valuable. Um, maybe one more the, so principles by Ray Dalio who was, I know it was a recent guest. Um, I think he's got just really concise and good, um, thoughts for like, all right. How do you sort of approach all the, um, how'd you approach life? So it's um, I would include a mix of, of of of different kinds of things. I'd have like more instructional books, like more philosophical books. Um, more story in history kind of books.

Speaker 2:          00:28:57       Man. I don't want to take your class. I'm like, yes, that's pretty good. That was pretty good. Number one. So consider me preregistered or free preapplied. I want to make a couple of comments on these books that you mentioned because uh, I, I am very fond of all of these books and I'll, I'll just add a couple of, of notes because they tie together also really nicely. So high output management by Grove was out of print at one point and then became so popular in Silicon Valley that a new edition was printed. And the forward, I believe was from Ben Horowitz who wrote the another book that you had mentioned. You know, the, what does it, the hard thing about hard things, right? And Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz and many other things prior to that, uh, to that book. And there's of course a selection bias here since I have a limited Dataset, but the startups that I've been involved with that have done best have kind of returned to the fund many, many, many times over almost without exception, have all read high output management and have a copy of it in their offices.

Speaker 2:          00:30:07       Uh, th that's now I'm sure there are many unsuccessful CEOs who also have that book, but nonetheless, uh, the effective executive, actually I'm gonna leave that one for last. So poor Charlie's Almanack is a great book and I want to underscore something that you said a somewhat in passing or which is really important and I know you, you know, it's really important, which is the avoiding of making really bad mistakes. And one thing that monger emphasizes a lot, you know, the right hand of Warren Buffet in Warren. It I guess I said he has the fat, the best 62nd mind he's ever met. And I'm going to butcher this, I'm sure, but it's something that I think of a lot, uh, because I have some tendencies that are unhelpful intro in shrine to be really smart and come up with clever solutions. And I said, I revisit this quote, somebody could find the right version, but it's monger who says, you know, it's amazing how successful you can become if you just consistently avoid being stupid versus trying to outsmart everybody else.

Speaker 2:          00:31:12       And I think a lot about that. Uh, because it's so true. It's like God, yeah, if you just kind of watch your chips and know your downside and don't make, you know, consistently make rational decisions with these lattice works. And these sharistics that you mentioned. Super, super helpful, uh, and, uh, the effective executive. So the effective executive, I want to come back to for a second. And you mentioned nuts and bolts. The effective executive, I've read probably 10 or 12 times. I love this book and it's, it's very short too. It's easy to read. And you mentioned the sort of nuts and bolts. So I'm going to use this and then we'll probably jump around chronologically, but you, uh, if I'm remembering correctly, have a label in your email called opp. Uh, could you explain for people what this means?

Speaker 3:          00:32:08       Yes. So originally I think originally, well, yeah, it was, it stood for other people's problems. Um, although I made it a little nicer later. Other people's priorities. Um, and because I have a vendetta against email, which we can, um, we can, we can dig into, but I, I'm, I'm, I've had this experience, I imagine anyone listening is that this experience, like, all right, you're inbox overflowing or

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       like, I'm finally going to deal with this thing. You plow through hundreds of emails and your reward is more emails. Right? Um, but, but then to the OPP opp thing, I'm like, wait, what? Then what are these things like what am I doing? And then you realize that like you're just basically checking off items on other people's to do list. Um, where there's, there's a sort of in the abstract, there's nothing wrong with that and it's important to be helpful and we all have been helped by and help other people. But, um, you can end up in a situation, um, where you're basically your to do list is a composite of other people's to do list and your calendar and your email can often reflect that and uh, and tying it to another. So one of the most important concepts is focus. Um, everybody understands like, yeah, yeah, focus.

Speaker 4:          00:33:34       Um, and I imagined something we'll probably talk more about here. Um, but there, there are so many forces. It will, some people love the idea of focus and, and, and when it was interesting just going back to Warren Buffett, so Warren Buffet and Bill Gates did an interview. Um, it's on, I think it's on Netflix. There's like a Warren Buffet documentary, um, which is great. I also recommend, but anyway, they, they, uh, the interviewer ad, he was interviewing both Warren and bill and was like, all right in a word, what has made you most successful? And they both at the same time, it's like without missing a beat, those said focus. Um, and so if we all, and it's like, seems so obvious that we all know why focus is, is like we don't need to be told why focus is important. But then, uh, and one of the things that the effective executive, uh, highlights is that there's so many, like the default for pretty much anything is to unfocus you.

Speaker 4:          00:34:29       Um, and that's true of your inbox, your inbox, which is not prioritize. It's just kind of like you basically get all these requests that are other people's priorities. Um, uh, if you're working within an organization, pretty much everybody we'll be pulling on you to kind of feed the beast of the organization. And so it becomes very hard to do a few things. Well. Um, and so, I mean there's a lot of great things about that book, but, um, but yeah, I do have an opp folder, which I try to keep it manageable or find ways to, um, I think that best is if you can find ways to be helpful budgeting, like involve other people and actually helping. So I have a whole team of people who can help me respond to, to, to those, those kinds of requests

Speaker 2:          00:35:14       sooner. The OPP folder, it's not this, it's not necessarily a black hole. Uh, it's not an indefinite archive necessarily, but it's when I'll get around to it. Do you have a set schedule for looking in the OPP folder or having other people do that for you? And what are the criteria? Right, if it, is it that anything that doesn't come from say a direct report or an investor or a family member into opp or what are the, what are the guidelines?

Speaker 4:          00:35:42       Yeah, so the, I think some people would say feeling call even when I'm, when I help. So I'm not great at responding to these things. So, I mean, it might be, if it's something that's like not a priority, then I'll try to respond in days. But sometimes this weeks, sometimes it's months, sometimes, sometimes I'll give you, you'll get a response that's like, oh yeah, it's seven months later. It's like, Oh, here is, you still need this. Um, but, uh, so I, I would, I think it's, if, if it is something from a person you have a relationship with, um, I would say [inaudible] and there's probably other factors, but it's like, okay, is this someone who, uh, I know and where I, where I personally would be really helpful, um, and they have done their homework and it's like, well, I think there's a certain first pass filters like that.

Speaker 4:          00:36:32       Um, I would say, uh, there is no commandment from God that you have to respond to every email you receive. Um, so if, if it's like a cold email cold call or if it's like some, some someone I don't know, or it's like a sales thing or whatever, I just, then it just goes into the black hole. Um, or if it's something like, you know, there's a lot of folks who are like, Hey, I need, I need a mentor, or how do I raise money? Or you can often tell by the question, like, as a person, many if not most of the requests will be something where the person could just do a little bit of homework and get a good answer. Um, and that's troubling because at first you try to help people with those kinds of things. You're like, oh, well, you know, go to this blog post or do this thing.

Speaker 4:          00:37:19       Um, and then you don't hear back from them and it turns out they just never followed up or just didn't do it. And so after you get burned by spending a bunch of time trying to be helpful to people who don't do their homework, who don't help themselves, you realize it's like not how you want to spend your life. Um, so, so you have to, you know, I think, I don't think there's a magic formula, but, but I think you want to just keep what you want to do. Just keep that budget of you're time constrained to something small. Yeah. Or at least over small or big, you should at least be mindful of it. A lot of people just and find themselves hopelessly busy and on this treadmill responding to other people's, um, to do lists and, and knowing no one is doing the things on their to do list.

Speaker 2:          00:38:03       Right. Yeah. One thing you said about people doing their homework, uh, reminded me of this quote from Maria Popova who writes brain pickings, which is this incredible site, millions and millions of readers and really long forms, smart writing. And at some time I think she changed it to be a little, uh, more, uh, maybe sunny seeming, but she had a quote, I'm pretty sure on her Facebook page as the graphic, as the header at one point that said, if you haven't done or if someone hasn't done the homework to determine, uh, whether it's a fit or not, it doesn't warrant the energy to explain why it isn't a fit or something like that, which I think is a great commandment, uh, or sort of guideline to use because so much of it when you reinforce that type of behavior by trying to be helpful, they just come back. People tend to come back with equally nebulous or unthought through questions. Uh, do you have any other best practices or do's or do nots when it comes to, to managing email? We're not using email. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:39:13       Try not to use a lot of email. Um, because often if it's, um, I think emails for is good for quick discrete tasks, um, where you're holding someone up by not doing them. But if you're trying to, uh, and then I think it's also useful to like for broadcasts, like if you have something, if you have some long form written, um, direction that you want to give a group of people, um, then then, then that's a good use of it. Um, but often when people get into these long email threads, uh, it's often, uh, it's sometimes we fun and indulgent to get into these big like flame wars. But often the best way to if, if, if you get along email, often the best response is to talk to them in person. Um, and if you're getting a lot of little requests, it's better to just batch them up and have some kind of weekly cadence where you can deal with a lot of quick requests without having the overhead of, uh, of, um, uh, of email.

Speaker 3:          00:40:13       And I think that this is, these are all kind of email is just one example of a lot of different forces that can take away that can kind of shatter your attention, um, or take away your time. Um, I think one of the, one of the most valuable concepts from the effective executive is, is measuring your time and early understanding where your time goes. Um, and it is kind of shocking and Hilarious, but really tragic that we all think we know exactly where our time goes. Um, but then when you measure it, you're not usually just like slightly wrong and you're like totally upside down. Um, so, um, this is a really valuable exercise for anyone but actually like keeping a log of like where you spend your time, um, and categorizing it. I remember the first time I did this, did this, I was like, all right, I'm running a company.

Speaker 3:          00:41:01       It's things are going well. I probably what, what do I spend my time on? Oh, back then it was PR. I was like, I want to spend my time on the product and recruiting and Dah, Dah, Dah. Um, and when I actually did the, the, the inventory, um, like I was spending like no time on those things. I was spending a, there was a lot of, yeah, a lot of opp back then. Like, just like responding to fit, like following up on favors or speaking engagements that didn't really do anything for the company. And there wasn't like a lot of tea, like total fat like that. But um,

Speaker 4:          00:41:35       but it just might [inaudible] what you find is you write down your priorities and you look at your time and you find that things are totally mismatched. And so any mechanism you can, uh, to, um, to first understand where your time goes and then make sure your priorities actually match it. I think at the end of the day, that's conceptually what you want to do a and then just understand that, um, you're going to attend and then you also want to offset the, the tendency for to be in this permanently. We reactive state. Um, which, whether that's cause you're getting emails that are other people's requests or your calendar says one thing. Um, usually when you, your to do list gets too long. You just try to, you just sort of do things randomly or just do whatever the last thing, you're just respond to whatever showed up most recently in her inbox or what blinked at you or what yelled at you loudest in the last hour.

Speaker 4:          00:42:28       Um, and that's not a, that's not effective. Um, compared to having, setting your own priorities and measuring yourself against them. Um, and this is separate topic, but I think technology needs to do a lot better job of helping us do that because it's really hard. And then, especially as you're in any kind of organization, um, you're gonna, you're gonna the, the, the, the fires will get dealt with first and that's, that's not a bad thing. Um, or that, that's like necessary. You can't not put out the fires, but then the important stuff, the, I'd say Eisenhower had this work versus virgin. Yeah. The matrix that are the quadrants, I guess it was the two by two is an important and urgent and, um, eliminating stuff that's not important. Not Urgent, but, but really the biggest prior crisis of prioritization is like how do you make sure that you do, um, that you elbow out time, the important not urgent stuff because the important and urgent stuff will get taken care of.

Speaker 4:          00:43:27       But then you end up with a lot of stuff that's not important or urgent, not important or not important, not urgent. And you really want to cut those down as much as possible because otherwise a lot of the fires, if you actually do root cause analysis, I think about like why did, why was this fire in the first place when you kind of climb that ladder a couple of rungs? Like why did this happen, why this happened or why it happened cause that well, why did that happen? Because of that. Um, you find that just a little bit of planning would have, would have eliminated the need to fight that fire. Um, and so, but it, and it's really easy to spend your days kind of doing the equivalent of paying, paying down a lot of like high interest credit card debt with your time by just doing, fighting all these fires and not actually putting them out at their root.

Speaker 4:          00:44:11       Um, so something I do on that front now is I, I've, uh, uh, there's a concept called no meeting Wednesday, which I think is popular around the valley and maybe it originated Facebook, I'm not sure, but we've sort of Ha halfheartedly adopted that and I half heartedly adopted that for awhile. But I remember there was a, I'm like, I really want to do this because there's all this planning and like all these things that are important that that where the cost of me not creating clarity for my team is super high. Um, and I sat down with my assistant at the time and I was like, Hey, I need to like, please don't schedule stuff on Wednesday. Like, it's really, uh, it's really important that I work on this particular project and, you know, it's just not going to get done unless there's some, unless I have like a full day or like many hours of uninterrupted time.

Speaker 4:          00:44:56       And she's like, but she's like, but blah, blah, blah has this and it's important and blah, blah, blah has this and it's important and blah, blah, blah has this and it's important. And I'm like, there will never be a day where there isn't something quote important, you know, coming up. Um, and so, uh, it, it's dawned on me in that conversation, but I'm like, this shit, this is all important. Like, eh, but it's not in. And so, um, I was like, look, just, I really want it. If, if, if it is important, just schedule it on Saturday, I'll come into the office, I'll do all those things. And then miraculously, those things kind of ended up doing themselves and adopting no meeting Wednesday was utterly transformative in terms of, of actually being able to think and make progress on the most important thing. Because otherwise you just, you lift up your head and you finally six months have passed on some important on quote important priority of yours and there's been no progress.

Speaker 4:          00:45:52       So thinking about how to develop systems and how do you build in time for reflection and an elbow at the time, um, for, for you to think and set direction. I think that's, that's probably one that's one of the biggest mistakes that people make. And one of the concepts from effective executive is like a lot of that stuff only makes pro, that doesn't, that that stuff doesn't make progress with a half hour slot in a meeting of 10 or an a day of 10 hours of half hour meetings like you, there's a minimum quantum of time for deep thought or deep work that you need. Um, and so anyway, there's a lot of really conceptual found, a great conceptual foundations and effective executive about your time and effectiveness and disability, waiting buisiness from effectiveness and then the concept of leverage in high upper management, um, and a focus on output. So those, those two books have pretty much conceptually everything you need. But then implementing it in practice is a lot harder.

Speaker 2:          00:46:46       Yeah. We're, we're going to talk about the practice all, all quite a bit. I think also in this conversation, I want to circle back to a few things you mentioned because I think they're really important. Uh, the, the first is the Eisenhower Matrix. I think it might be referred to as, uh, which, which people can look up on their own time. But the, the correlating in some respects, maybe exercise that I think Drucker brings up and the effective executive is the jar or a mason jar. And if people can visualize this very easily, but if you have a mason jar and next to the Mason Jar, you have a handful of large rocks that can fit into the jar. Then you have a bunch of smaller pebbles and then you have a pile of sand, all of which has come out of the jar. If you put in the big rocks first, I your sort of most critical tasks, which may or may not be urgent, then you can fit in the pebbles and then you can fit it in the sand.

Speaker 2:          00:47:44       And you scroll on the top and it's nice and neat, but if you put it in the sand first, the whole thing falls apart, right? You, you, you, you cannot take the same volume of rocks and pebbles and sand and get it into the jar and a which, which visually, uh, from, from an imagery standpoint, it is very easy to understand. And, and, uh, the, the time audit though as you described, is so important for people to do because very often even your calendar is not a good reflection of how you in fact spend your time. And, uh, if you look at say self reporting in dietary studies where they're observational and people are going home and then coming back and reporting every two weeks or something like that. If you, if you ask people to estimate their caloric consumption, it's almost always like 30 to 40% off, right?

Speaker 2:          00:48:36       It's not a small difference. And I think the same thing happens with time. Uh, really, really routinely. Um, the, the blocks of time, actually, you know what I'm going to get, I'm going to make a reading recommendation and then I'm going to come back to this name, which of course you're going to be very familiar with, but for people who really want to also get a teaser for what you'll read more about and the effective executive and there's an essay, I might be getting it, the headline slightly off, but you'll be able to find it. Maker's schedule, manager's schedule. Yep. Bye. Bye. Paul Graham. And uh, the legendary PG who are going to come back to a, is a good place to start. But I want to rewind the clock for a second and ask you why did you stop the sat on my prep company?

Speaker 3:          00:49:20       So, uh, I started the sat prep company in 2004 and then I, uh, went back to school, finished my undergrad and then a couple of things happen. So I was still, I was, after graduation I started working as an engineer at a, a network security company. Um, and I was still moonlighting on the s on Accolade, the sat prep company. Um, but I found myself in a situation where it was like, it was just like harder and harder to make progress on the sat prep company and I wasn't really sure what was going on because I just felt like it was just, it took more and more willpower to like pedal, uh, or I felt like, I don't know whether it was because I felt like I was peddling harder but not getting anywhere or one way or another, it just, it. But over time it took a lot more willpower to work on it.

Speaker 3:          00:50:12       And so I found myself procrastinating with all these like side projects and I mean now I recognize all of this as burnout. Um, and, and, and a positive. Uh, there aren't a lot of good things about burnout, but sometimes it can steer. The positive element is consider your attention to things that are more worthwhile. Um, but then I was worried cause I'm like, Oh my God, I'm like so unproductive and I'm getting a wallowing in this like guilt. Um, I was raised Catholic, so like this Catholic guilt of like not, you know, I'm not working hard enough. This company is not successful enough. All my Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. And it's like totally not helpful. Um, but, and so I'm like, oh my God, am I broken? Like I might not capable of working hard, what's wrong with me? Um, but then I would like, well one good news, I started working on this like poker Bot that started and it played with real money.

Speaker 3:          00:51:07       Like I like got past the security on the poker client. This is six. So I figured out how to like make all that work and then watch kind of my Frankenstein moment as the Bot comes to life and starts playing on real poker tables. And so this idea that you can have poker bots was like totally false. Um, but, and, and but I was possessed. It was like kind of thing. Was the WISC Frankenstein's monster wedding? Well, I mean frank is, the Frankenstein was like, not too, not too smart in the beginning. So like there's some [inaudible] it, that's the thing starts moving the mouse and playing cards, playing the hand then gets confused because it had, there's some like obscure multiple split pot or something that I just didn't write the code to handle that situation. So the thing crashes and folds your aces and you're like, okay, awesome. This is what AI looks like.

Speaker 3:          00:52:01       But it was scaring my family because I was, I was living in Boston but then we have a little summer place in New Hampshire and I was like, my family is like, okay, you can come up this weekend, we're all going to be at the lake. And I'm like, okay. And then I get to the lake and I'm start unpacking my trunk and I've had like three monitors and like all these computers and I'm like, I mean this is like a little cottage on upon, it's not set up to be like mission control. So I'm like putting monitors on the stove and my parents are like, what are you doing? They're kind of used to me having all these side projects. So they're just like, I hope it's not illegal. Just, um, unfortunately that side project had to stop because of that, like the potent, in fall of 2006, it became like, went from like kind of borderline too, like very illegal to do online poker so that, um, that project ended.

Speaker 3:          00:52:57       But, um, but, but so what's that about? Uh, what I took from that was like, well, first I'm like, I'm not broken. I'm super capable of working hard. It's just like, I need to find something that I'm really, I'm motivated by. Um, and so that was a relief. And then, um, uh, and then along the way, so I, I continued to work on the sat prep thing, but then the kind of the founding story of Dropbox was, um, well I had to use, well, the founding sort of striped Dropbox starts with forgetting my thumb drive and going on the Chinatown bus, which I'll get to. But, um, but before that I was, I kept having these problems working with my cofounder because, um, are collaborating with them because we didn't have an office. Well, we bootstrapped the company, so we didn't raise any money and we didn't have an office.

Speaker 3:          00:53:45       We didn't work out at the same place and we didn't have servers, we didn't have anything. So we would just like email stuff back and forth. Um, and I had to work on multiple computers, so I kept carrying around this thumb drive and having these elaborate scripts that would back up are the sat prep company, kind of all of our files to a server. And then eventually I was like, all right, well I want to, I, I had graduated from college is about 2006, late 2006 a lot of my friends had lived in New York and they were like, you gotta come out. It's a lot of fun here, you know, just come out for the weekend. And I'm, I have a dilemma because I'm like, well, I need to get some stuff done for my company, but I also want to go to New York. And I'm like, maybe if I take the Chinatown bus, uh, or if I ride the bus, I can get, I can have four and a half hours each way. So then I'll have 10 hours. 10 hours should be enough time to do what I need to do is, you know, you know, the alert, elaborate rationalizations we we come up with and so I'm like, okay, I will fail if I take the bus. That's, I'm, I'm greenlight to go to New York. Then I get on the bus and I've forgotten my thumb drive.

Speaker 3:          00:54:55       So and then crack problem. Yeah. Yeah. Back to self flagellation I'm like, oh, I can't, I'm like, I keep doing this. I suck. You know, I'm not like I hate my thumb drive. I'm like, I hate me. Um, um, but I'm like, oh my God, I just cannot deal with this problem. I'm like, I know this is so stupid. Like I'm so sick of like email, like emailing myself a file. Like what is the question for which there is no question for us. That's the right answer. I'm like, what did you think of the physical equivalent of that? Like taking an envelope, putting something in it, putting your own name in the to and from putting it in the mailbox and getting it back. I'm like, this is what we do to like manage our files. Um, uh, that carry on a thumb drive. All the things we used to have to do.

Speaker 3:          00:55:37       And I'm like, I never want to have this problem again. So I on the bus, um, I open up the editor and started writing some code in python that basically was the seed that sprouted into Dropbox, but it's weird and I was just like totally possessed with that problem. Um, because I'm an engineer, I'm an engineer by upbringing. Um, my favorite classes at school other than some of the stuff we've talked about was, or like algorithms, distributed systems, um, you know, and I found myself at a crossroads where I'm like, look, I love standardized tests as much as any human possibly can, I guess. But it was a couple of things happen. So one is I like pause. I'm like, okay, I'm working on this company. I'm kind of burning out. Um, part of why is because I thought about it like, okay, even if all of my dreams come through and like everything we hope for happens with this sat prep company, then I'm like, then what? Then then what? And I'm like, I'm like King of sat prep. Right? And there's nothing, I mean I think that's fine and like people need help with these things, but I'm like, that's not what I want to do. I'm just picturing this kind of like cardboard crown.

Speaker 3:          00:56:55       And I'm like, and that's only if everything goes well. Oh, that's like if all of our dreams come true. So I'm like, I need to do something else. Um, and so I ended up with these side projects and then found myself getting totally obsessed with a first to poker Bot, but then even more so with Dropbox. And so sometimes it's hard it, you know, like how do you deal with burnout? How do you know if you're doing the right thing? And, cause these are really hard questions. I mean for me sort of listening, sometimes a lot of procrastination is unhealthy, but sometimes that little voice is leading you in a much better direction.

Speaker 2:          00:57:28       So I want to serve, I want to bring this back to the dot, dot, dot that I left after Paul Graham. Uh, and we can certainly go in any possible direction you want to take it. But for people who don't know, Paul Graham, maybe you could, maybe you could describe Paul Graham's certainly as close to a Demi God as one can probably get among many, many young entrepreneurs and older entrepreneurs in silicon valley. Who is Paul Graham? What is y Combinator? And can you describe your first meeting with Paul Graham?

Speaker 3:          00:58:04       Yes. Um, so Paul Graham is best known as the, uh, is one of the founders of y Combinator. So they are, which is an incubator for startups. They've, and they were our first investors and they also invested in a lot of great companies, including, um, Airbnb, stripe, uh, a lot of them. And, uh, Paul was before starting my Combinator, he had written, uh, he, he was an entrepreneur himself, so he started coming home via web back in the.com or the the first.com boom and sold it. And then he had a lot of really provocative and insightful essays on startups that gained a big following. Um, and he was also one of the creators, um, um, or at least was very early in the conversation around, uh, using a Bayesian methods using this kind of math to do spam filtering. So he's also one of the originals are one of the architects or at least involved in that community of people who have figured out how to get rid of spam.

Speaker 3:          00:59:08       Um, and that's actually how I first heard about him, but then he started writing about startups and then ran this experiment that became my Combinator. Um, but it was actually called the summer founders program when I was digging through some old email it because, um, I, this was the precursor to y Combinator. Uh, I applied with my sat prep company to that and was rejected. Um, but then managed to get into y Combinator a couple of years later. So, um, so I guess the first virtual meeting of applying to be funded, uh, didn't go well. Um, the first in person meeting was probably, oh wait, hold on, hold on, pause. Why didn't, why didn't the virtual meeting go well? Well, we didn't really officially meet. It was just sort of like, if it was like a college admissions thing [inaudible] we, you, you, it's open application.

Speaker 3:          00:59:54       Anybody who wants to submit an application kit for, uh, for the summer founders program, which is basically, it was like the same thing as y Combinator to like you get a little bit of money and they'll all come together. Um, it was like sort of y Combinator version one. Um, but I applied and didn't get in and I was super disappointed. Um, so that didn't go well. And then, but a couple years later, I wanted to apply again with Dropbox and this is skipping ahead a little bit, but, um, I had, so I had the idea for Dropbox, um, started working on it and I want to do YC because a good friend of mine or for for many reasons, but in a, in another friend of mine, this Guy Adam Smith, uh, no relation, um, it was one of her friends from college. Uh, he did YC in 2006 and had an awesome experience and I had like a front row seat to that and saw how much fun they're having.

Speaker 3:          01:00:46       And then their company was just in like a much faster trajectory because of YC and I'm like, oh my God, I want something like that. Um, but then I have, so I started thinking about applying for YC with Dropbox. Um, and one of the good things about coming from college admissions is you sort of learn how these admissions processes work. Um, and YC was not really that different. You have a lot of people applying for a few spots. Um, and so in addition to getting the scores and the grades and everything, one of the things you can do is try to stand out and do something kind of unique. And so I'm like, all right, well maybe to get in to help me get into Yc, I'll try to put a video out about how Dropbox works. Um, and y Combinator also had their own, they had just started this new, this new site called Hacker News, um, which is kind of like reddit first startup news.

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       Um, and, uh, and I'm like, what is I'm buying? I thought, I'm like, I had an, I had a hunch and I'm like, what do you, what do I, what does Paul do all day? I think he probably does what most of us do, which is just hit refresh on hacker news all the time. So I'm like, maybe you have to put a video on hacker news. Maybe I can get in front of the dean of admissions here to get Paul's attention and then go from there. It actually worked. Um, so I made and, and, and I was a concept from a book that I had read on that roof called guerrilla marketing, which is like how do you get attention and you and users for your product if you have no Jay Levinson, 11 cent or something like that. Yeah, something like that. It's like, how do you do that when you have no money?

Speaker 3:          01:02:25       So, uh, and, and so they're like all these, so there, it's the tactic of putting a video on hacker news or creating a viral video is that that was a seed that was planted by reading guerrilla marketing. Um, and so, but I made a screencast or just like a, like a three minute demo of how Dropbox works. Cause like I wasn't ready to ship the code, but I wanted some feedback and I wanted to get into YC. Um, and that video both got me into YC and it got me a cofounder. Um, but I didn't know that at the time. So, uh, coming back to, so then what happened with this meeting with Paul? So I put the video on hacker news. It hits the top of hacker news for multiple days. It's a long time. Talked about the top of hacker news APP. That can't happen anymore because for a bunch of reasons.

Speaker 3:          01:03:07       But it was like, I was pretty happy about that. Um, and then, uh, I'm like, okay, this is so far the plan seems to be working. I'm just like, keep hitting refresh on my inbox. I'm like, maybe I wonder if Paul has seen it. And then Lo and behold, I get an email from Paul Graham saying like, Hey, it looks pretty cool. Um, but you need a cofounder. Cause they did it, especially at the time. They didn't like single founders applying. And I didn't have a cofounder yet. This was, this was before I met a rush. Um, so I was like, Oh God. Um, because the PR, the only problem was I agreed with him. The only problem was the application deadline was, had already passed. I already applied. Um, and the interviews were in like two weeks. And so I needed a cofounder in two weeks, which is like saying like, Hey, I know you're not dating anyone but you need to get married by.

Speaker 3:          01:04:01       Right. Uh, and so, uh, hilarity ensued. But, uh, but then I was, I can't, I flew out to San Francisco. I'm like, I'm like trying to shake the trees for any cofounder candidates. I hadn't thought of it because for one reason or another, all of my close friends and people that would have been the, the folks that I would have leaned on, like at the timing wasn't good. They didn't want to do it, whatever else. And so, um, but I, I found, uh, another friend of mine, I was actually getting managed to get a friend of mine interested out in San Francisco. Um, but he's like, okay, I'm interested. I don't know, but I want to know what PG thinks before I make a decision. So I'm like, okay, great. Um, and I'm like, it's a Tuesday. My flight is a Tuesday at like 1:00 PM. My flight back to Boston leads it like 10 or 11.

Speaker 3:          01:04:51       So I'm like, oh actually wait, this is, YC has its dinners on Tuesdays. Maybe I can just like drive down to mountain view and just like pitch Paul maybe that will visit bar. I like fly down in one on one. Um, and like the plan was working pretty well. I got it. I got to Yc, I went in the office. It was as expected. People were just chilling and kind of, um, there was some downtime. And so, um, and so I go knock on, or like I go, I go to Paul's office and sure enough he's in there. He's just challenge my, Hey Paul, do you have a minute? Um, I just want to, you know, I just want to show you something I'm working on. And he's like, no, I'm busy.

Speaker 3:          01:05:42       And I'm like, okay, look, we bought, I'm like, I, I can almost see your screen. I know you're just like hitting reef. You're just like reading hacker news right now. Actually busy. Um, but it's like awkward. So I step outside and I talked to Jessica, um, who as an, uh, his, his partner at in cofounding YC together. And, and, and his wife. Um, and I talked to Jessica, I'm like, Hey, look, Jessica and I had met Jessica before, so I'm like, Jessica, I'm really sorry to bother you guys. I just have a cofounder who was like looking for some feedback from Paul to make his cofounder decision. You know, I got a flight back in like four hours. I swear I'll, I'll, I won't take more than 60 seconds of Paul's time. Do you think it's okay if, um, if I go in there and she's like, oh, we've got drew of course, like, no problem. Like Paul's not doing anything just like he'll, it'll be fine. So I go back in there

Speaker 5:          01:06:40       and

Speaker 3:          01:06:41       it's like detonation, it's like I still like three words and Paul's like, no, he's like, I'm not going to see your stupid demo. The whole reason we have an application process so that randos like, you don't just like show up here and bother us. It's like, no, please leave. And so I'm like, okay, thanks Jessica. Thanks Paul. Like, Ooh, like my friend that's, I'm like, this is not going to be good. And like it was a rough, rough returned to San Francisco. So needless to say, the cofounders situation did not work out. You were like there, Paul's, Paul's thinking about it. Let me get back to you. I did, I did meet with the dean of admissions. He just thinks I'm an asshole. So that was, I think he's, I think he's coming around. Get back to that was a tough plane ride home. Um, but as good training, like this is, you know, this, this is you gotta this is like the new normal if you're starting a company. Um, so let me, let me just hit pause for one second. What were you, what were you saying to yourself on the way back? Like what was the self talk on the plane ride back? I was like, I have, I could not have like eff this up any worse if I had tried. Um, cause like now and I'm co founder and I'm like, I might've been able to get in if I just like, hadn't like maximally pissed off Paul.

Speaker 5:          01:08:07       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:08:09       Anyway, now I have no cofounder, no YC and probably know company. Um, and like two weeks left to like resolve this, um, may or maybe a week left to resolve. But anyway, not a lot of time. Um, so it was bad. Yeah. I was like, I don't really see how this all kind of lives happily ever after. So then what happened? So then, but my kind of shaking the trees in San Francisco did help. So I met, it. Turned out I met a guy named Kyle convoked, um, who I'd met at the Mit entrepreneurs club. So he's an MIT student. He dropped out here. He had just dropped out to do Justin TV, which became twitch. Um, and then Kyle then later started cruise, which did degrades Kyle Kyle has done well. Um, and then I was complaining to Kyle and like, hey Kyle, like I need a cofounder.

Speaker 3:          01:09:03       I, you know, is there anyone you'd recommend? And he, he recommended me to a, it turned out that Kyle and Raj were four made cities campus at Mit. Um, and so he's like, Oh, you should talk to a rush. And then a day or two later, I got an email from [inaudible] saying, hey, um, he was like, uh, he was a senior Undergrad at MIT computer science student. Um, and, uh, and he was like, hey, I got this email from rush and say like, Hey, I saw your video on hacker news. And Kyle said, you're looking for a cofounder. You know, maybe we should talk. And then it was kind of insane. Like we met in the student center. Um, maybe we got coffee one more time and then he drops out of school. Um, he's like a senior, he drops off with a semester left. You know, I was thinking this is going to be like a process.

Speaker 3:          01:09:55       Right. As I mentioned, I talked to his parents and like reassure them if I notice like we hang out for like two hours and then he then like come then we, the two of us commit to like spending most of our waking lives together for the foreseeable future. I don't think either of us really understood that at the time. Um, fortunately it all has worked out great. But, um, so, but, but against all odds. So our osh and I team up, um, I think Paul forgot about his meeting with me or didn't like put the two together. So we, we did our interview, um, and we got into Yc, so, and it was funny cause like we were doing the white, the interview were milling around waiting for who? We go down in the morning, we go get lunch. Um, we come back to the car, are our car got broken into on our laptops, got stolen. Oh God. But fortunately all of our stuff was on Dropbox, so we were like patient zero for all this. And then we got the happy phone call from Paul saying, Hey, we want to fund you guys. And ended up, I mean, I dunno, it was, it was nuts though. So I don't know if this has changed, but for some period of time, uh, I think it's probably still the case, but, but you could correct me if I'm

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       wrong. I mean, Dropbox was far and away the most successful investment that y Combinator had ever made, uh, ended up, I mean, certainly Dropbox has done incredibly well. At what points did you go to go to Paul's office and knock, knock. Hey Paul. Like in brackets now we're friends by any chance? Do you remember when I came in daring Tuesday on a Tuesday not too long ago, Dah, Dah. Did you ever bring that up with him or did he learn about it through some other means?

Speaker 3:          01:11:51       I like to remind them about it. Every camp, every year to first. He's like totally embarrassed. Like he didn't, like, he didn't put any of these things together. He didn't know, he didn't remember it. Um, he's like, I was so awful at this app. So the, the mostly it's just they, they both Paul and Jessica to turn like bright red and they don't like to talk about it, which is like why I like to keep poking at it every now and then. It's all, I mean, it's all good. I would have done this course him. Well, he did tell you I'm busy, right? Yeah, I was super obnoxious, but

Speaker 2:          01:12:24       some was dropped. It was Dropbox, the original name of the company. Yeah, it was. Wow. So, so just from day one you had the name that stuck.

Speaker 3:          01:12:34       Oh, pretty good. Getting the domain. It was get dropbox.com getting the dropbox.com domain name was, oh my God, that was a, that was the journey. Um, so there was, I don't know, I'm like, I'm like starting to shake a little bit going. I don't know. I don't know how illuminating this the story is, but it had no, let's talk about it people, I mean people run into this stuff. I'm sure. I'm sure we can. I'm sure we can pull some lessons from that. So I I remember get Dropbox. So ration, I fell like, so the, the, the name Dropbox actually the behind the music version, like the story behind the name is also probably unintuitive or like not what you'd expect. So, um, you asked what am I like, what was that like in high school? Um, and the answer is like, basically he's a huge nerd who likes computer games.

Speaker 3:          01:13:27       And that's true. Uh, one of the things we would do is we'd all bring our, uh, w we would like a bunch of friends and I would bring our computers to someone's house and we'd play games. And, um, so back in the day, these things were called land parties. Um, they are about as cool as they camp. Um, and uh, and, and you know, you all show up and played, you play Til Sunrise and, and, um, and so on. But you bring a bunch of people together and often someone doesn't have the, the right maps or the right patch or the right whatever. And so we had a convention, like you've just create a folder called your Dropbox that's shared and writeable by anyone. Um, and that's how he would exchange files. Um, so that people could play games. Um, and then it's, I remember this, it was like Christmas 2006. I'm trying to come up with a name for Dropbox nor didn't have a name then. I, uh, the initial name, I had like some, uh, what the name before I was dizzy, photoshopping a logo. Is it initial iteration of it was folder anywhere which catchy. Catchy, yes. Which just was, which was probably the first indication that I had a brilliant future in marketing and for this.

Speaker 3:          01:14:48       And then some like in Photoshop trying to make a logo for folder anywhere. And I'm like, I'm like, of course the probably the logo was like a literal folder or something like totally inane. And then I start and I'm like, and I, you know, believe it or not fold or anywhere.com was actually available. So I, I was the proud owner of older anywhere that com. Then I realized that I did a search and I found that there's a company called files anywhere and I was like, no, like I can't, I that's, it's like I can't, now, I can't name it folder anywhere. And so I'm, I'm sort of, I'm on aim talking to one of my friends from high school and I'm like, God, I don't know what to call this thing, you know, folder anywhere it's taken. Like, maybe I should just, you know, maybe maybe I should call it Dropbox, like from the, you know, from, from high school or from land parties and he's like, okay, whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:15:41       And then, um, and then I Dropbox like how not available. Uh, so I got get dropbox.com but then, um, so we just lived with get dropbox.com for awhile. I tried to you, you can sometimes look up who owns a domain and then contact them. And so I, I actually did, I amended that I managed to give the guy a call, um, and I'm like, Hey, are you dropbox.com? You know, are you, are you using it? And the guy was like, uh, yes, I'm using it for a project. I'm like, okay, well do you have any interest in like selling it or, you know, coming up with some kind of arrangement? He's like, no. I'm like, okay, cool. So that's February, 2007 and then, then we then, then we get distracted with the whole getting into Yc, finding a cofounder, all that doing YC, and then I land in, then we moved to San Francisco in September and I'm like, we really need to get this domain name.

Speaker 3:          01:16:36       Um, and unfortunately our ration, I had totally fallen in love with it. So like we weren't really, we kind of only had one plan. Um, by the way, that's, that's called a great, uh, negotiating position. Yeah. Awesome. About as well as you'd expect. So we, I'm like, well, since the fluffiness Zipcar and show up at someone's house worked so well the first time, we're going to do it again. So it turned out the guy lived in Pleasanton, um, and he was an entrepreneur. Here's someone who like nearby, who should be sympathetic to our cause at to some extent. Um, and I'm like, and I call him and I'm like, how's that project going? Because there's obviously no project in and he's just kind of being difficult. Um, and so I'm like, I'm like, okay, God damn it. We get off the phone and I'm like, are Ashley's, let's just like show up at this guy's house.

Speaker 3:          01:17:31       Let's just see what happens. Um, so jumping into other car, we go to the, that we've dropped when they go to the like the the corner store and get their like most expensive bottle of $20 champagne. We could get, uh, get as a car and go to his house and um, it's like nine at night. So I don't know, for some, this seemed like a good idea at the time. So we show up then and then he was kind of, I think he was kind of shocked, kind of amused. It's like lets us in. Um, we have a suite, we start talking and he's like, we're like, hey look, you know, we're, we're, we're, we're pretty serious about this thing we're doing. You know, we'd love, um, you know, if, if it's true that you're not actually doing anything with the domain, you know, like help, help us understand what you're trying to accomplish. [inaudible] noxious way. Just like, you know, but at least consider this alternative where you know, we use dropbox.com. You know, we've got some really good folks who are excited about this in involved, whether that's y Combinator, we just gotten funding from sequoia, our first venture capital investor who one of the best in the world. And so we're like, oh you, oh you, oh, you told him that? Yeah. All right. Yeah, that's really building up our leverage here.

Speaker 3:          01:18:47       So this would be called hemorrhaging leverage all at the same time. You know, these, these, uh, the frameworks don't completely account for everything cause if you don't, if you don't actually help them understand why they should be interested and you hold all your cards to the vest and nothing happens and that's what we can experience over the last seven months. So we're like, um, okay, so like at least get sketch out a case that a reasonable person would look at and be interested in. So, um, and then he's like, um, cool. Uh, it's interesting, I got to talk to a friend. Um, and you know, why don't you, why don't we touch base soon? And I'm like, I'm like, great. Well, it was like Friday. I'm like, whoa. It was like a Friday night, I think. And I'm like, well, we'll be back on Monday.

Speaker 3:          01:19:33       Um, and we're, we're in the ride back going over the bay bridge. And I'm like, Holy Shit, we might actually be able to get this thing, like this guy has been impenetrable and so difficult. Like we're both kind of in awe and just like, this is such a positive thing. So we go back on Monday and he's just like, Yep, thought about it, not interested. Thanks. Bye. And we're like, are you kidding? Is this for real? Like, no. I'm like, I'm like, where's this going to go? Are you going to like, are you going to bequeath this domain to your children? Like, what the hell? Um, but he was just like totally wouldn't budge. And so that was a much sadder drive back.

Speaker 3:          01:20:15       So then this guy, and then there's just kind of nothing for a couple of years or for a year. Um, and then we launched drop out. We put a, we launched Dropbox publicly, um, and then all these confused people start going to dropbox.com, uh, and, and presumably start trying to get, and they wanted to get into the Beta. So this is, this is later in the air. So the, the, the, and the, so that he starts getting all these emails from people, I think probably March, 2008, um, who were looking to get into the Dropbox data. Um, and then he, he does God, he, and I'll end the story in a reasonable amount of time, but we like, so he, he then he kind of goes dark, he puts a privacy shield up on the domain, then puts up an ad words landing page. So like dropbox.com, like it was a, no, it went from like a go daddy parking page to like a Google adsense for domains page.

Speaker 3:          01:21:12       Um, which was a problem because then we're like, oh my God, now this guy is like totally cashing in. Like it's basically you go to Dropbox icon. It was basically ad words for all of our competitors. Oh God. Um, and so I'm just thinking of like, I'm like, what the hell are we gonna do about this? Like our investors think we're idiots for not changing the name. We're doing all these like pointless and branding exercises that, um, did not go well, like to try to find an alternate name. So I'm just like, oh my God, look what, what are we going to do? And the answer was read the Federal Copyright Code and a trademark code. Um, and I became kind of an expert in Cyber Trademark Law. I got an armchair expert in this stuff and it turns out you can't just like get a domain from someone for no reason. Like you can't just be like, oh, you're not using it, so therefore it's mine anymore. You can can be like, oh, you're not using that land to give it to me.

Speaker 3:          01:22:15       But it is also illegal for someone to intentionally confused, um, uh, confused customer can confuse your customers. So, um, I can't just like say that were, um, you know, I can't sell paper teller tell or I can't sell like Kleenex with three e's to confuse people or whatever. So like intentionally confusing consumers is a problem. Um, and we had another whole odyssey trying to get the Dropbox trademark, which aisle that's not as interesting, but I'm like, we had a problem what we did, we didn't actually have the registered trademark either. Um, but he was now making money from infringing on our common law trademark rights. And so I'm working with this crazy trademark like was like trademark and domain attorney. And so we sue him for federal, for trademark infringement. Um, and so that got his attention. Um, and, and which we would not have done it.

Speaker 3:          01:23:13       Like we're not, we weren't just trying to push him around. I mean, he was really, he was sure trying to profit off of confusing our customers. So we were for sure. Dot on our high horse after that. Um, and I mean, that was a comical whole experience, but eventually he's like, okay, okay, okay. Um, you know, all, all like, let's, this is, there's no point to have this lawsuit. You know, I'll give you guys are, I'll tell you guys the domain, I'm like, okay, well we can offer use stock or cash. She's like, I'll just take cash. Um, so we paid him 300 grand, got the domain live. I mean that was such a, like sending that first email from dropbox.com to Paul and Jessica was a huge triumph. Um, but what's even it, I offer, we offered him stock at that like at w would have been at the seed round the most God worth like multiple hundreds of millions of dollars today.

Speaker 2:          01:24:12       Oh Man. I think what you can

Speaker 3:          01:24:16       take away from this, it's like there's just no manual for that, right? You got to kind of wing it. And there were a lot of things that are the equivalent. Even today I've just kind of getting in the zip car with a bottle of champagne and hoping for the best and, and um, you know, sometimes we get really good cards. Sometimes you get really bad cards, but you just got to kind of roll with it. Um, and so, um, between finding a cofounder, getting the domain, each, each of those is definitely, those are definitely memorable points along the journey.

Speaker 2:          01:24:45       Well, we were chatting a bit before we started recording about the psychological aspects of say, prepping for starting a company. And I want to tie that to a company you mentioned earlier, which is reddit and see you mentioned that hacker news is sort of read it for the, the computer science slash hacker subset. Rhett and I remember having Alexis the cofounder on this podcast and he told me about meeting really early on with an executive at Yahoo. They were really excited. They went in and they shared their numbers in the executive said wow, if something along the lines of Oh my God, you're just a rounding error for Yahoo. And it was so insulting that Alexis took like you are a rounding error, I think it was and put it on the wall in the office to motivate. Right. But that's, that is one of several different responses that that are possible. Right. I mean there are, there are certainly people who would be crushed by that. It could be the end. Uh, and I don't, I don't remember exactly where this quote is from, but I want to talk about when this came out and how you, what the self talk was. So the, he, uh, okay. This, there's an article being

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       written about Dropbox and I think the quote was quote, fortunately the Dropbox founders are too stupid to know. Everyone's already tried this and quote. Yeah. Uh, so when did that happen and how did you and anyone else involved respond to it? Yeah, so that was very early. Um, I would say it was probably within the first year and, uh, probably the most, well, I think what happens is you'll get, I mean, I just think that even back to that first video that I put it on Hacker News, a lot of the, actually a lot of the commentary was positive. People like I would use something like this, it's good. Like, and it was really, um, uh, and that was really encouraging. So it's all on the one hand, half the peanut gallery saying that the other half is saying like, listing all these reasons why it's been tried before and won't work.

Speaker 4:          01:26:59       Um, that, and then even if it does work, like Microsoft, Google, everybody is going to kill us. Um, and here's why it's never been a business and here are all these other ones that have never succeeded at. And the things that I agreed with them, I was like, yeah, you're probably right. Like, I don't really see how we survive as, I mean in 2007 I don't see how we kind of make it through, you know, to mount doom, little plucky band of, uh, the two of us. Um, so, and then invariably every investor we talked to would raise similar concerns. So the, the, the feedback is all pretty negative. So, um, it's easy to say like, oh, just ignore it all, but you, you kind of have to, you have to be balanced. So on the, on the one hand, we did get encouraging feedback in the beginning, so people were like, drop this as cool.

Speaker 4:          01:27:52       I will use this. It sounds great. Um, you know, and I knew that I needed it and then I wasn't like trying to create $1 billion company. I was trying to just like solve the problem. And so I think setting your sights low in the beginning ironically, can be helpful because you're not putting so much pressure on yourself. I was just like, look, if I show the cool thing, it'll be one of this is just another side project and a number of side projects and like, let me not suffocate it by putting all these crazy expectations on it. Um, so I think that's pretty important. Um, and then people are like, oh, when did he know it was a success? It's like, well, it was sort of a different point. It, it, it was like the goalpost for success kept successively moving back. So even just having a video was a big milestone in launching a private beta was a big milestone and there were a bunch of milestones, but, so it was sort of a continuous project process more than like, oh, is this one moment in time?

Speaker 4:          01:28:42       Um, but yeah, there were people who had very good arguments about why this wasn't gonna be successful. And that's why I think, um, you have to have, you have to sort of have alternate, you have to have both thick skin and thin skin, I guess to have kind of get that balance right. Because if you just have, if you just ignore all of the feedback and dismiss it all, then you're PR, you're probably going to have some kind of blind spot and you're gonna, you're gonna miss some important information. So, um, just because they came, but, but just because they came to that conclusion doesn't mean that their assumptions were all correct. And that's why you also need to have enough thick skin to know when to like, um, when to be a little bit dismissive or not listen to everything. Um, uh, and part of what helps with that is having conviction and conviction that comes from being able to think from first principles, um, and pay less attention to people's conclusions.

Speaker 4:          01:29:41       Let the outputs of people's conclusions as much as the inputs into those conclusions. So what does that mean? Well, people said that, okay, the Dropbox is not gonna be successful because if people try to in a million times, um, and that is, that is true in anybody who that's like factually true. It's not, you can't debate that. Um, but that would have been true for mobile. Like every phone, every mobile thing before the iPhone or every mobile software company, every APP like was a total failure before the iPhone world changes. Suddenly it's the right time. And so, um, if you study history of technology or history business, you realize, okay, that that argument is not in and of itself. Um, causal. Um, so the, the, what you want to answer is like a why is that incorrect? It's like, well, actually, um, there, there are a lot of good ideas that are, are bad ideas for awhile because the timing is wrong.

Speaker 4:          01:30:31       But then at the time he becomes right because of some discontinuity in tech and like then, and what's like the innovator's dilemma or others will illustrate that. And so if you really understand these, if you understand that that's why it's important to build these mental models because you were like, all right, this is my framework for how the world works and I keep refining it. Um, what these people are missing. The key conclusion from that, that just because something has happened like has failed before, it doesn't mean it will always feel in the future, can still fail. But, um, but that kind of conviction came from an understanding or a belief and a f and a worldview and framework of like, here's how, here's how I think business works or here's how to think about an idea like ours. Um, so, but that said, it's not.

Speaker 4:          01:31:14       So I think there's a, how do you receive advice and how do you sort of develop first principles thinking, which we talked about, but then like that doesn't make it feel any better when people that like your idea socks and you're going to fail, um, or worse that like you are stupid or you're an elite. Yeah. At Super Ad Hominem, right? Um, yeah, people are not. So, first of all, I think you have to have a sense of like this is normal. I'm like, do it. Just don't take it too personal. Like, cause that's the thing, you know, you want to take it, you do want to take, you want to receive the feedback and like try to extract the kernel of that's useful from it but not feel obligated to, to accept the whole thing. Um, I think more broadly you have to, whether it's getting criticism or just a lot of the things, I think one of the harder things about running the company in general was I just remember being in the beginning being like, oh my God.

Speaker 4:          01:32:09       Like all right now we, uh, like sequoia has decided to invest in, in our comp against the odds. Now Sequoia has decided to invest there. They're writing us a check for $1 million. I hope they realize that. Like I've never, I've not, I haven't really done this before. And like, Oh God, like that million dollar, it's great to kind of cash that check. But whoa man, they're going to be looking for that money back at some point. Like, what are we going to do? Um, and so that's not, that wasn't the, I mean there were probably a lot of things going on in my head at the time, but, and then like, oh my God, I've never really built a successful company for, I don't, I've never manage people really, you know, the idea of Dropbox being at a hundred person company is like terrifying. Like I'm, this treadmill is just going to go faster and faster until like I'm violently thrown off of it.

Speaker 4:          01:32:59       Like, how am I going to deal with that? Um, and, and a lot of me also felt like, okay, well I'll just be like, build the company until it's like successful enough or makes enough money where I just don't have to worry about money anymore. And then I had like, uh, like as soon as I get to that, I don't know, this was like some kind of theory. I'm like, all right, as soon as I get to that level of success, I'll just stop and like, just when will screw it up. Um, but then interestingly that the fat goalpost kept moving back and moving back and moving back because I think it's, it's never really been about the money, but you can read in the y Combinator application, like that's now public. We put that out there and I'm like, I would, I would like, I would if I had $1 million after taxes, F for six months of work, I consider that a pretty good deal.

Speaker 4:          01:33:44       Um, so, um, so, but, but, but, but more on the, the, the, the more I'm just like, what do you do when you're like, oh my God, this is like pretty uncomfortable. I've never done anything like this before. Um, I might screw it up. You need, so your instinct will to be to, um, run away from that feeling and what you need to learn to do is run towards it because that's just going to keep, keep happening, keep happening. Like, you know, we're going to drive a show up at this guy's house. I don't know. Maybe we'll get arrested. I don't know. But we're going to do it. I don't think that's the best example. Uh, there's so many things where it's like, you just gotta Kinda figure it out and keep going. Um, and Ben, one of the great things from that that Ben wrote in his book, the hard thing about hard things is the hardest part of being a CEO is managing your psychology.

Speaker 4:          01:34:35       Um, and I didn't really know what that meant at the time. I think I have a much better sense now. So I think first thing is getting comfortable with being uncomfortable, um, because, and, and you think about principles like Ray Dalio, his book, he's like pain plus reflection equals progress. Uh, people love the progress part or they love growth, but they don't love the pain part and they don't bother to do the reflection part. So, um, uh, so understanding that that isn't in the sort of zooming out and understanding, like depersonalized it, it's like, it's not really you. This is just like the process of growth. It will be painful or think of your journey as more of an adventure rather than like a final exam where you have to get everything right and you only got one shot. Um, I think that's, that's pretty important. And then second is all right, you have to, now it's, it's, everybody likes the idea of growth and pushing yourself, but you also have to take care of yourself. Like, um, you have to find ways to metabolize stress and avoid burnout. Um, and for some reason people just, they just use the one tool of like pushing themselves harder and then they break. Um, and you know, you wouldn't do that to your car. You wouldn't do that with like a musical instrument. So why would you do that to yourself? Right. So,

Speaker 2:          01:35:51       um, just to, just to pause for a second, like I recall very distinctly every time we've stayed at the same hotel or been at the same event and I've gone to the gym, I've almost always seen you in the gym. Uh, I mean it seems like you have, just as a component of that, a physical practice to care for the machine, so to speak.

Speaker 4:          01:36:13       Yeah. I wouldn't say I'm the best like athlete by any stretch, but I, but it's really important that you have to do enough so that you don't break down. Um, and so, and, and you've got to figure out what that is for you. And, um, and I know that's something you really care about and, and the, the advice that you have to offer your readers is gonna be a much better than whatever advice I have a, but you need to do something, some kind of routine and stick to it. Um, but just the basics of the, I think some of the stoop, the dumbest advice that people get is like, you know, not sleeping or wearing like, or just pursuing this idea that that successful people somehow work like 70, 80 hour weeks and that's the norm. Um, there are a number of problems with that.

Speaker 4:          01:36:54       First, it's like usually not true. It's usually more of an indication that person's either lack of awareness about where they're spending their time or a lack of effectiveness if they need. Um, if their only tool in the shed is like work more hours. Right. Because just think about that, like, you know, there that that is, that has a ceiling in terms of how much of an advantage that can give you. Like, yes, you want to work hard. Um, but if you're only advantages, like being able to work 20% more hours than someone who's merely very committed, then you're not going to have outsized results. And you also, I mean there's, so there's, I have a, I have a, I think this meme that people that successful people work a hundred hour weeks or something is, is both false and super harmful. Um, most of the, most, the most successful people I know actually work.

Speaker 4:          01:37:44       I mean they, they've crunched times where they're super busy, but they otherwise have a workweek that looks more normal than not. Um, and so that, that was something I didn't realize when I was, when I was starting out. But the basics of sleep, eating well, self, self care, exercise, putting it on your calendar, not just wishful thinking and hoping it'll sort of happen in the spare moments. Like if you can't see, um, these things on your case, if you can't see your priorities in your calendar, if you can't see your gym time on the calendar, it doesn't exist. I'm totally, so, uh, and then, and then I think like self awareness, there's probably a lot more we could talk about how to, how to metabolize stress and avoid burnout. But I think having that taken care of the basics, like having a good foundation and setting healthy boundaries is pretty important.

Speaker 4:          01:38:33       And having a sustainable workload, um, the self awareness is pretty important and being willing to like shine a hard light on yourself, um, and embracing that. So for me, coaching has been super helpful. A coaching meaning you have like an executive coach. I've had different ones over time. Um, and, and, and, and really like I go through the experience, I'm like, Oh God, I'll give this a shot. So my friends have had, um, I have spoken positively about it. Um, but it's a little, it's um, well I'll say this first part. I remember my first coaching experience and like getting, they do the three 60 and then you sit down and you do your review of your results. So, sorry to pause. The three 60 for people who don't know is where you have any superiors, peers, employees, et Cetera, people who know you really well, interviewed about your strengths, weaknesses and so on.

Speaker 4:          01:39:28       Would you, is that fair? Is that fair to say? Yeah. Well you get all this feedback from all of these, you know, everybody you were closely work with, so it's kind of overwhelming, um, cause you get a lot of it. Um, and it's not all good. So, uh, and actually to this day, like opening those documents and like reading all the free 60 feedback is one of the most painful like human experiences you can have. Um, maybe that's a little hyperbolic but, but it's not fun. It's at least not fun. It's not something I look forward to. Um, but it's important. So, um, because you need to know, like it's much better to just like know and being able to do something about it. Like Act. Then Ben, Ben's been a great friend and mentor and he's like, he was reflecting, he told me a quote that one of his mentors told him, which is that God gave us all weaknesses. It's a blessing to find out about them.

Speaker 4:          01:40:21       Yeah. You know, sobering. You know? Um, uh, but so, but, but I went through the, I just remember my first coaching experience briefly, like, you know, sit you down and they're like, first page is usually like, here are your strengths. And I'm like, okay. He's like, my coach was like, you are really good. You really, really care about people. You love building great relationships. And I'm like, Yep, okay. Yeah, that sounds, that sounds good. Um, you're really creative. You like new ideas. I'm like, all right, I'm enjoying this coaching thing so far. He's like, you're really comfortable in chaos. Like it doesn't bother you that this stuff is like so crazy. I'm like, Yup. It's like, okay, Duh, Duh, Duh. And then flip to the next page. All right. Now, like it's never weaknesses, development areas. That's right. Or operating opportunities are to improve it.

Speaker 4:          01:41:08       So something like, all right, let's hear about some opportunities. Um, he's like, you are really conflict avoidant. Um, you don't, uh, make hard people decisions. Uh, people don't know what you do, but like where they stand. I'm like, okay. He's like, ah, you're unreliable. You drop, you drop balls, um, uh, you're not paying enough attention to the things that are important. I'm like, okay. And he's like, and you suck at planning. Uh, if people are confused about what to do, and I'm like, okay. And then he's like, look, okay, you're good with people. So, and you like people to be happy. So you avoid conflict. You are creative. You like new ideas, so you don't view, don't pay attention to the routine stuff. You're comfortable in chaos. So you don't plan like these strengths are all like their own weaknesses and disguise. Like, um, so, and there's no one who's like 10 out of 10 on everything.

Speaker 4:          01:42:05       And that's, that's why, um, so, you know, there's a lot different philosophies on what do you do as a feedback and you know, the play more your shanks 30th, I think you need at least to get your weaknesses to a point where they're not like destroying the company. Um, but generally you want to play to your strengths and that's one of the key effective executive tenants. Um, but other than that, uh, and I think just sell foreign, like trying to understand yourself on all kinds of different dimensions is really valuable. And I talked about the Enneagram, uh, in your book. Uh, and that's, it's sort of like, I would call it like a useful Myers Briggs. So most people are familiar with Myers Briggs. It's a personality typing system, but then you read it and it's like reading a personality quiz on the Internet. You've sort of, you remember he had some letters and there's like some stuff, but you don't actually do anything with it.

Speaker 4:          01:42:53       Uh, I found enneagram to be similar in terms of it's, uh, there are a limited number of personality types, but it's much more of a theory about what fundamentally motivates people, what, what demotivates them. Um, and so, uh, I know we don't have a ton of time, so I'd just say like, check it out. Enneagram is very valuable. Like I do it. My Tea, I was, I was super skeptical. I was like, this sounds like a cult. Um, and it kind of is. But, um, it's been very helpful both to do individually and with your team because it, it just, you sort of, what you learn is like, okay, here are the, here are my blind spots. I was like, I'm an enneagram seventh. These are like totally textbook strengths and weaknesses of a seven that they like. They like new things. They like, uh, they're, they're comfortable and came on in chaos, but then they can become distracted and, and you know, and unreliable, um, conflict of way and things like that.

Speaker 4:          01:43:44       So it just knowing you always one way or another, you always want to have an accurate map of like, what do you need to work on? Um, how were you, how were you introduced to Enneagram? Well, so it's through my cofounder. Uh, but then Mirage was introduced to it through a guy named Gentry who, who was the founder of mailbox, who worked with us for a, for a while, says, you know, call it three or four years ago. And then Ross was like, you're going to love this. It's great that it. Ah, and I'm like, it sounds super weird. Um, but he was right. So it's, it's been super helpful.

Speaker 2:          01:44:16       Awesome. Well, I know we don't have a ton of time left and maybe sometime we'll do a follow up with some wine and I'd love to talk to you more about your cadence and so on with an executive coach. Maybe we can get to it another time, but I thought, I thought we could wrap up with another thing that you mentioned in the book, you know, tribe of mentors, but I'd love to hear you talk about it, which is the tennis ball circle and the number 30,000. Can you tell us where this comes from and what that means?

Speaker 4:          01:44:46       Sure. So, uh, I did the commencement speech for Mit back in 2013. Um, and I was like, the whole premise was I'm like, all right, what do I got? I'm like, I'm 30. I don't really like, I'm a Chi. Wait 20 years. I'll say something like, way more insightful then. But I'm like, all right, well, I kind of, the prompt, the prompt I came up with was like, well, what do I wish I had known? What would I tell my 23 year old self? Um, and if I could sort of send a cheat sheet back in time, what would it have on it? And what I would put on that little cheat sheet is a, as you said, a tennis ball, a circle and the number 30,000. So, um, the tennis ball is really about finding that thing you can become obsessed with. And so when I think about like Dropbox or even just other side projects, like the Poker Bot, like I am both most productive and happiest and most successful.

Speaker 4:          01:45:37       And like, it's like when all those things line up or when the thing you're obsessed with overlaps with something, the world really needs, um, uh, or values. So, um, but, but like don't saddle, like find something that, uh, the tennis ball was, sorry. The, what is it, where does the tennis ball come from? I had this like really lazy fat dog growing up. Um, who would, uh, but when you showed her food or you showed her tennis ball, she would be just to, to just like go nuts. Um, and so you throw a tennis ball for it. So it was like, she just as like this, it was like watching like, like ham running on twigs or something. You're like, it's like super, it's just bizarre. It's just funny. Like, and so I was like, I, I'm, I'm like, what you want is to have like that ridiculous expression on your face and just got to kind of be so obsessed with something that you just don't care about anything else.

Speaker 4:          01:46:36       Not overdo it, but like, but the point is like, find something that I'm not just passionate about, but like that, just like that, that, that you can become obsessed with and, and just really love and something you would do even if you weren't, you know, even if I want your job. Um, then the circle concept is really, there's a saying by a guy named Jim Rone that you're, you're an average of the five people you spend the most time with. Um, and I found that to be super true. So, and then, so the, and the upshot is like, chooses to choose wisely. So whether that's the literal five people you spend the most time with or just in the environment you end. So being, um, like going to a or just find an environment that will pull the best out of you. Um, and so, and I think that's been true for me.

Speaker 4:          01:47:17       Going to MIT really taught me like what a good engineer looks like. Um, and it's both inspiring in terms of watching all these people who are super like capable, but then also you get jealous and you're like, oh, I, you know, I want to be that good and see you want to harness that kind of negative energy and to pushing yourself to work harder. So, and that's what that was true. Whether it's school or being in y Combinator with other founders, like friendly competition there or with my friends who were starting companies, being in San Francisco, all of those contributed massively to, um, to us, uh, to us making it. Um, and then finally, 30,000, uh, is, is, is really about, do you have everybody lives on average, humans live on average for 30,000 days. I was at first, I was like, okay, yes, this is like a clinical truth.

Speaker 4:          01:48:06       Not terribly interesting. Um, because I think I had just moved to San Francisco and as an a and I was just like, I couldn't sleep. So I was just like on the Internet reading stuff. And I came to, became across that and I remember being like, Huh, okay. Um, and I opened the calculator and I'm like, all right, I'm 24 at the time, 24 times three, 65. I'm like, Oh my God, I'm like already 8,000 days now. Um, so this idea of like life unfolding infinitely in front of you is actually not really true. Um, and so it's really important to not just make everyday count but also understand that like, think of life more as an adventure or a story more than how you think about life as when you're graduating college, which is like their life up until you graduate college is just like a series of checking off boxes and like getting ready for stuff and performing.

Speaker 4:          01:48:57       Um, and all of your worldly achievements can be, are averaged into a GPA. And so every mistake is like brings that number down. And like it's something you have to like obsess over. And then college graduations the first day where that's not really true anymore. You don't really have a GPA anymore and you're not an average of all your successes and failures. Like you should change your mindset to life. And also just think of it more just making a story that's interesting, not just not trying to be perfect because I think that's a trap that a lot of people fall into. So anyway, those are when I thought about, um, you know, if you were to play everything over again a hundred times, who knows what would happen. But if I could just hand back a cheat sheet, that's what I would put on it. That's who you'd put a tennis ball circle and the number of 30,000. Well, drew,

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       I know you have a very, very busy, uh, time ahead of you and I'm sure today's no exception, so it'll let you get back to your day. But do you have any closing comments? Asks, uh, suggestions or anything else for people who are listening to this? Any, any kind of parting comments before we wrap up? Uh, let's see. So I, um,

Speaker 4:          01:50:13       I think I just don't, don't, don't forget to have like don't forget to have fun. And like I said, I think at the, at the end of it you want to have like,

Speaker 6:          01:50:23       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:50:23       there's an obsession with avoiding failure. And if you think of it more as the failures aren't really that important, it's more how you respond and even like what you, what you want to do is write an interesting story. Not like a perfect story.

Speaker 6:          01:50:38       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:50:39       Yes, yes. And I mean, the first thing they do with it, well, I shouldn't say the sort of definitively, but it's like a lot of screenwriters who are experienced, we'll, we'll say you have to create characters and the protagonist who on some level the audience really cares about and then torture them and then they come out the other side will like it.
