Speaker 2:          00:00:24       This episode is brought to you by ink tell and I've used them personally ever since I wrote the four hour workweek. I've been asked over and over again how I choose to delegate tasks, how I do 80 20 analysis and so on. At the root of many of those decisions is a simple question. Actually two questions. Number one, how can I invest money to improve my quality of life? I use that in investing as well. The second, how can I spend a little money or moderate money to save significant time inc tell is one of those investments. There are a turnkey solution for all of your imaginable customer care needs. I used Intel during the launch of the four hour body, which was very, very involved and they provided 24 seven customer service for my land rush campaign because it was critical for me to take care of every person who purchased my books and participated.

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       This allowed me to focus on the things that I am better. At my strengths, like the marketing plan that we'd worked on for six months, implementing that until trains their experience. Customer service reps to know your business and your products inside and out and make your customers are raving fans. They answer more than a million customer service requests every year and they can do so across all platforms, including email, phone, social media, texts, even chat, leaving your customers with poor service or just mediocre service, which by the way, in a competitive pool is a huge liability. Long wait times are unanswered messages carries a massive cost and risk to your business. Intel removes the logistics and headaches of this type of communication, allowing you to focus on your strengths and grow your business. It can be a real competitive advantage. And I see many, many ecommerce companies and tech companies thinking of customer service as a good enough checkbox or an afterthought, and it just like airbnb use design and innovative ways to be a competitor and to win.

Speaker 3:          00:04:10       Tim

Speaker 2:          00:04:14       well hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to interview world class performers, to tease out the habits, routines, thinking frameworks, life lessons, favorite books, etc. That you can apply and test for yourself. This episode features someone who is very, very well known in the world of investing, but studying what he says is really a study in clearer thinking and it transcends investing in business and so many different ways. Howard s marks is Cochairman and cofounder of Oak tree capital management, a leading investment manager with more than a $120 billion in assets. He is the author of the new book, mastering the market cycle, subtitle, getting the odds on your side and his previous book on investing. The most important thing to uncommon sense for the thoughtful investor with a critically acclaimed bestseller. To give you an idea of who reads his memos and his writing.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       Warren Buffet has written of Howard quote. When I see memos from Howard marks in my mail there, the first thing I opened and read, I always learned something and quote, I'm going to keep this short because it covers a lot of ground. We talk about the three stages of a bull market newsletters. He reads thoughts on Bitcoin and Crypto. His thoughts on understanding market cycles for making better decisions. How his firm was poised to capitalize on the bubble in 2008 and put massive amounts of capital to work and more and more and more and more. We really cover a lot of ground and I had a lot of fun. So without further ado,

Speaker 3:          00:05:42       maybe I've already said that. Here is Howard marks.

Speaker 2:          00:05:49       Howard, welcome to the show. Thank you Jim. I've been looking forward to being here. I am thrilled to be sitting here with you because I have so many fans of your work and thinking in my friends

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       circles. Well that's great to hear. When I went out to a handful to ask for potential topics or questions, there were very, very forthcoming. But what I thought I would do in this particular episode, I've never done in a podcast episode before, which is to start with a poem. This is always risky, risky business. But this was suggested by a friend and he said, I would use an ae houseman poem. This capture is effectively the, uh, I think that what he views as, as, as the spirit of, of much of your writing and you can agree or disagree. Here we go. Eye To my perils of cheat and Scharmer come clad in armor by stars. Benign hope lies to mortals and most believe her, but man's deceiver was never mine. The thoughts of others were light and fleeting of lovers meeting or luck or fame.

Speaker 4:          00:06:44       Mine were, have trouble in mind. We're steady. So I was ready when trouble came and that is a Shropshire lad, the name of the poem. And I thought that, uh, we could certainly talk about that specifically, but in the course of doing research for this conversation, I discovered that you had studied not only finance and what you might look at as vocational subjects when you were an Undergrad, but also it seems like Japanese. And, uh, there was this concept of Mucho that popped up when I was doing my reading. Would you mind describing that time and that concept?

Speaker 5:          00:07:21       Well, I went to Wharton, um, at a, uh, at a edit enlightened time when you were required to have a non business minor and then a semester of the literature of a foreign country in English. I never learned Japanese, but I started off for some reason, which I, it's interesting that I have no recollection of what motivated me, but I decided, not French literature or English, but Japanese literature. It must've been the exoticism. Uh, and I liked it so much that I turned Japanese studies into my minor and took 15 credits at the graduate level. And that's what turned me from a, from an indifferent teenager into a, into a student. Really. Um, but the professor, for most of those courses, a guy named Dale Saunders was an inspirational speaker and a Oxford don an aesthete. And so I took this course in a Japanese philosophy and we came across Mucho.

Speaker 5:          00:08:27       Mucho literally means the turning of the wheel of the law. In other words, the operation of life. And, uh, the, the, the essence is impermanence. And because La Wheel does turn and, um, and also the, the unpredictability of the future. And these were really formative for me and they have an unconsciously informed everything I've done. Um, and uh, I think that personally that in the investment business and also in life, you are better off if you realize number one, that if life is always going to change on you and there will always be new things coming down the pike and you can't control it. Um, and what we have to do is live with it.

Speaker 4:          00:09:23       In the course of the reading. I've done prep for this, which is not only the, uh, the new book, but also many of your letters, which I had already been a fan of, but went back to revisit. Uh, I came and grant across many people who had tried to select favorite quotes and one that came up a lot. So you could certainly correct this if this is not accurate, is something along the lines of you can't, you can't predict, you can prepare. And that leads me to 2008 and we're going to bounce around chronologically quite a lot I suspect. But, uh, during the 2008 bubble, which of course it was a time in which many investors were pulling out of the market. Oak Tree did exactly the opposite and you put more than a half a billion dollars a week to work over 15 weeks. Why did you do that? Where are you predicting where you prepared? What led to that type of

Speaker 5:          00:10:25       decision? Sure. Well, you mentioned the memos. I've been riding the Malmo since 1990. Um, and, um, I wrote one about 20 years ago, late nineties, uh, cold. You can't predict. You can prepare. I stole the tagline from then an ad from Northwestern mutual life insurance. Uh, but I think that's true of life. Uh, now it sounds like an oxymoron because how can you prepare if you can't predict? But the answer is, uh, we never know what's going to happen, but we can consider the likely scenarios and prepare for some of them. Uh, you can't, I definition prepare for every eventuality, but, um, I would say that we did have a sense, uh, my partner Bruce Karsh and I, uh, had a sense in o five and six that the world wasn't running right. Um, and the main thing that made us conclude that was the crappy deals that were getting done.

Speaker 5:          00:11:32       And he and I would spend the day walking into each other's office saying, look at this piece of crap that got issued yesterday. There's something wrong. A deal like this should not be doable. The fact that investors are buying this tells me that they're not being skeptical. They're not being demanding, they're not applying standards. And, um, you know, uh, buffet, uh, has a, has a saying, the less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own affairs. And it's absolutely true. Um, and so we knew that the market was dangerous because of the behavior of others. Now you can't. So we were prepared. We, we sold a lot of assets. We liquidated large funds, we replaced them with small funds. We became very selective in our buying. We raised, uh, a very large fund for investment if a crisis bursting would come into being, was this for a distressed debt for distressed debt.

Speaker 5:          00:12:36       Now the interesting thing though, so you can't prepare, you can't predict. The thing that caused the bubble to burst, uh, was the unsubstantiated polity of mortgage back securities. And especially subprime, if you read the memos, you won't find a word about it. We didn't predict that. We didn't even know about it. It was occurring in an an, an extra odd corner of the securities market. Most of us didn't know about it. Um, but it is what, what brought the house down and we had no idea, but we were prepared because we knew simply that we were on dangerous ground and that required a cautious preparation.

Speaker 2:          00:13:23       Let me ask, and I may embarrass myself with questions that, uh, display my ignorance about many topics in this interview. But when you raised money for a distressed debt fund, did you emphasize to the lps or whoever gave you those funds that, uh, you had a specific timeline in mind for deploying those funds? Or did you emphasize the importance of patients with those people and that you'd be looking for indicators and that they needed to look at it as a longterm investment? How did you manage the question of, of when from those people?

Speaker 5:          00:14:02       The question of when is is one of the hardest ones in our business? And I always say that we may have an idea of what's going to happen, but we never know when it's going to happen. You can't call these things as one of my partners says, if you name a price, don't name a date. And if he named the date, don't name a price and then you can't be wrong. But, uh, we never did name it. Date. We probably, I can't even remember. We probably had a limit. In other words, if we hadn't deployed within x years, then it got cancelled, the commitments. Um, but I think there was an understanding that we thought it was coming within the next one to three years. Something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:14:41       The, the subtitle of this new book, of course, the title, mastering mark sites, subtitle, getting the odds on your side. Why this book and in the how does one, and this is of course something we could, we could discuss, uh, for many, many hours on end, but to why this book and how does someone in this context get the odds on their side.

Speaker 5:          00:15:05       So I started writing the memos in 1990 I wrote them for 20 years. I always concluded that I would write a book and pull them together into a philosophy when I retired. Uh, and then I got a letter from Warren Buffet in 2010 is saying, if you'll write a book, I'll give you a blurb for the jacket. So that was enough to get me off my ass and get me to do it in real time. Um, I wrote a book called the most important thing because I found myself sitting in client's offices saying the most important thing is buying cheap. And then 10 minutes later, I would say the most important thing is not losing money. And then 10 minutes later, I would say that the most important thing is contrarion behavior. So I wrote a book called the most important thing, which has 21 chapters.

Speaker 5:          00:15:46       And each one starts off. The title is the most important thing is, and then it's a different thing. One of those most important things is knowing where we stand in the cycle. Um, and uh, as I say, I don't believe in forecasts. I always say we never know where we're going, but we sure as hell ought to know where we are. I mean, I can't tell you what's going to happen tomorrow, but I should be able to assess the current environment and that's the kind of thinking, uh, that helped us prepare for the, for the crisis. Um, I think that the two most important things are where we stand in the cycle and the broad subject of risk and in fact where we stand in the cycle is the primary determinant of risk. Um, so, uh, I think that this is really an important topic and it can really help you do better getting the odds on your side.

Speaker 5:          00:16:43       What that means is we don't know what's going to happen. Nobody can tell you, but there are times when the future is the outlook is better and there are times when it's worse and it's largely determined by where we stand in the cycle. When we are low in the cycle, that is to say we're coming off a bust. The economy is starting to warm up. Investors are just barely starting to switch from pessimism to optimism and prices are starting to rise. Clearly the odds are in your favor, the outlook is better. It doesn't mean you're going to make money, but the chances are good. On the other hand, when the cycle has gone on, the up cycle has gone on for a long time when, uh, when, when valuations are high, when optimism is rampant, when everybody thinks that everything's gonna get better forever. When the economy's been moving ahead for 10 years and it looks like it's never going to stop, then usually the enthusiasm has just carried the prices to such a high level that the odds are against you. And just knowing that is as a huge advantage in investing. You should know that when the, when we're low in the up cycle,

Speaker 5:          00:18:00       that's a time to be aggressive and put a lot of money to work and buy more aggressive things. And when we, when the cycle has gone on for a long time and were elevated, that's the time to take some money off the table and behave more cautiously.

Speaker 4:          00:18:13       Question about 2008, uh, or you could pick another period, uh, a bus cycle that you're familiar with a weather from firsthand experience were from research that you've done. You raise these funds and I want to revisit the question of when and from personal standpoint. Uh, and I'll admit, admit it very freely. I think I've had a very fear based mentality when it comes to public markets. I've done reasonably well in privately held technology startups because I've lived in the middle of the switchbox in San Francisco and that's the only thing I paid attention to. And it protected me and away from my lesser behaviors because I wasn't allowed to sell. Uh, but in the public markets, I've almost always held on to cash, waiting for some cataclysmic event, but then lost my nerve in some fashion. Uh, I'd be, I'd love to hear and maybe the catching falling knives as a way to segue into this. I don't know, that found that very, very interesting to read about. Uh, but how'd you think about sitting on a position like that and timing of what, what, what determines the go command for deploying?

Speaker 5:          00:19:25       You have really,

Speaker 1:          00:19:27       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:19:27       Touched on an extremely important topic.

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:19:31       Most of us have an inherent bias. Most of us are essentially cautious or essentially aggressive. Probably more people are essentially cautious then aggressive. So one of the most important things is to assess ourselves, understand our biases and try to overcome them. Now, the Tim Ferriss that I heard you describe, I take that to mean that maybe you were lucky or smart enough to turn cautious leading up to the bubble.

Speaker 5:          00:20:08       The markets fell apart. You're sitting on cash, you patted yourself on the back for being so smart as to not get caught. And you're watched what you didn't do as you didn't turn aggressive at the bottom. That's right. And it's common, uh, not to do. So. It's common to, as you say, for people to say, I'm not going to jump in while this things collapsing down. I'm going to wait till the dust has settled and the future is clear. I'm not going to try to catch a falling knife. But it is when the knives are falling that the people are most terrified that they best bargains are available. So if you wait until the dust settles, the bargains are gone. And that's what happened at the end of, of a, you mentioned that we in distressed debt, we put 500 million a week to work in the last 15 weeks following the bankruptcy of Lehman brothers and across the firm, uh, something like 650 million a week for 15 weeks.

Speaker 5:          00:21:08       That's $10 billion. And, but the key is it was at a time when essentially nobody else would. You get great bargains. By the time the end of Oh eight rolled around, the hedge funds that were getting withdrawals had either satisfied their withdrawals or gated and what is gated mean, uh, told clients they couldn't have their money back for awhile. Gotcha. Um, and uh, so the, the selling debated, a few people saw that, that, uh, the great values and with this, with the selling, and thus the fear having reduced, they were able to come forward, prices started to move up, then it's too late. Because if you're trying to buy in a falling market, you can buy all you want at successively lower prices. But if you're trying to buy large amounts in a rising market, your own buying puts the price up. You're your own worst enemy.

Speaker 5:          00:22:04       You can't get much at low prices. So, you know, one of the keys to successful investing is to either be unemotional or at minimum act like you are. Uh, you know, the great investors I know are behave in an unemotional fashion. You know, Warren Buffet couldn't care less. Uh, David Tepper couldn't care less and, and, uh, and so forth. Um, uh, my own partner, Bruce Karsh, very, very, very stalwart. But part of it is that we support each other at the bottom. It's not easy, you know, and, and a, I say in the book that I recount some of the things we've done right with regard to cycled extremes, but I absolutely don't want to give the impression that it's easy. It's terrifying. Others are terrified. That's why they're selling. That's why they're saying, I don't care what the price is, just get me out. That's what, that's when you want to buy.

Speaker 5:          00:23:00       But the things that terrify them into selling, we'll also terrify you. You have to overcome it. How much of that stoic resilience or a stoic composure is a nature versus nurture born versus trained in, in from what you've observed and experienced. And, and if, if a portion of it is trained, how, how would you suggest to someone that they develop that ability? I don't want to answer categorically. I think it's a hell of a lot easier. If you're born then you know, to, to, to teach yourself to be unemotional is to, is to count their human nature. And by definition, it can't be easy. Um, this is other than as to, you know, uh, where are we in the cycle and what's going to happen in the SEC coming six months? This is probably the question I get the most often. Hmm. How can you teach herself to be unemotional, to be contrarian, to be a second level thinker? Um, and there is no easy answer, uh, in, in the first book on the subject of what I call second level thinking. I say, uh, in basketball they say you can't coach height. All the coaching in the world will not yet make your team taller. So I don't know, frankly, whether you can, whether people can teach themselves to be unemotional, but clearly if you are as emotional as others, you will probably succumb to the same errors.

Speaker 4:          00:24:36       So let's, I think we can not, I'd love to back into this type of, uh, not psychological profiling, but an examination of, of this type of resilience. Maybe indirectly. Maybe it'll come up, maybe it won't, but, and I might get the total duration, uh, incorrect. But you mentioned the name Bruce Karsh that I'd love to, to bring up yet again. And he made me make him up repeatedly. 23 year partnership, is that right? Or 20 plus year. 31 and 31. Okay. Oaktree is 23 years. I got, we worked together for eight years before the prior to that. All right, so if you were trying to hire a say 25 year old version of Bruce, what would you be looking for?

Speaker 5:          00:25:18       Well, I'll tell you what he is, let's, let's do that. He's super smart. That goes without saying. He is

Speaker 5:          00:25:30       highly competitive. Uh, you know, he, he's a chess player and, and, and most of the people that are, again, that I know who are good investors are, are, are a games players, either backgammon or, or, or chess or something like that. Um, we are an inherently competitive, um, uh, he's also a very analytical and he's kind of a grinder. And I would describe myself as being intuitive and, and a quick decider thinking slow and fast. Conaman um, I'm a fast thinker. You tell me a problem. I tell you my answer in short order and I'm done with it for the most part, Bruce, we'll think about it longer, come to his conclusion and then it'll come back the next day. And he said, you know, I was thinking about it last night. I don't think that's right and here's why. Or I don't think you were right and here's why.

Speaker 5:          00:26:28       And he'll, he'll grind on it for hours and days. I think this is part of the secret to our success. Uh, again, something I once wrote a on the subject of a good partnership, I should, I said shared values and compliment the re skills. If you have a partner who has different values than you do, for example, uh, w Bob wants to make the most money possible and Ed wants to operate with integrity. Those are largely contradictory. So I think it's very important to share values, but I also think it's, it's important to not be the same person, a copy of yourself. If you're, if it's a copy of yourself, you don't need it, it, it the person should bring skills that you don't bring and maybe operate in ways you don't. And I think it's, it's probably helpful that I'm intuitive and he's analytical.

Speaker 4:          00:27:26       I've heard, well heard, that's not the right not the right verb. I've read, uh, I believe is Buffett who said that Charlie Munger has the, something along the lines of the best 62nd mind he's ever encountered. It sounds like you also have a very highly developed fast thinking capacity. Is how is it similar or different from Charlie mungers 62nd?

Speaker 5:          00:27:56       Well, it, if, first of all, it's a daunting comparison. I would never put myself in the category with Charlie. He's, he's, he's brilliant than, and a one of the best thinkers there is. But, uh, you know, uh, I mean, the main thing is that he has read more broadly. He's had, he's had another 22 years to read further. And knee was probably always, uh, a broader reader than I was. And so it's, it's his ability to call on these references, you know, uh, in a way it's kind of silly to think we have to end or that we can reinvent all the wisdom in the world. It's great to borrow from others and, and, and Charlie does that broadly and I try to do it. He just knows more. I think we'll, we'll

Speaker 4:          00:28:43       almost certainly come back to a more an in Charlie Moore in this conversation, but I want to return to to Bruce because you mentioned the complimentary skill sets and you've, you've written about him of course, quite a bit and mentioned him quite a bit and I want to pull up quickly just a few lines. In the new book, it's Bruce and I have exchanged ideas and backed each other up almost daily over that period. This is a proceeding taxed and my give and take with him, especially in the most difficult of times has played particularly indispensable part and the development of the approaches to cycles on which this book spaced. Could you share an example of a, of back and forth or disagreement during a difficult time or with a particular decision? Uh, does that possible just so that we can we have a, a real world example of, of the interplay between the two of you?

Speaker 5:          00:29:34       We, we normally don't debate individual investments because he operates more at that level. And I operate more at the big picture level within oak tree. But I mean, I think a good example is in the period we just, we've been talking about a couple of times now, we've mentioned the last 15 weeks of Oh eight. Um, you know, it was really a very tough period because a Lehman brothers had gone bankrupt and, uh, and uh, bear Stearns had disappeared and Merrill Lynch had been absorbed by Bank of America and Washington mutual and Wacovia Bank. And, uh, you know, and it, it looked like falling dominoes and it, you know, people were talking about the fact that Morgan Stanley was next and Goldman was right behind that. And so you just had to conclude that the world, that the financial world was either going to end or it wasn't, you couldn't analyze it.

Speaker 5:          00:30:25       You could improve anything about the future. And, and, and, and so it required a, an almost gamesman like approach to whether you buy or not. And, uh, you know, we would talk about that in that sense. And we were both very comfortable talking about it in that sense. And what we concluded was that if the world ended, it didn't matter what we did, but if the world didn't end and we hadn't bought, we hadn't done our job. So buck up and do your job. Now, the great thing is that half the days Bruce would come to me, cause he would be lying in bed at night thinking about this stuff and he would come to me and he would say, you know what? I think we're going too fast. I think we should slow down. And half the days he would say, I think we're going too slow. And, uh, you know, so I would play devil's advocate, um, and uh, and support his decision.

Speaker 5:          00:31:27       But, but try to show him the other side. And he would do that with me. And that's why we got it done. But I, as I say in the, in the introduction to the book, from what you read, I think that I don't think either of us could have done as good a job alone. I think that the devil's advocacy and, but in a supportive way, uh, really held the key. Um, I wrote in one of my memos, I wrote about a reporter, uh, and he, he called me up a few days after the bankruptcy of Lehman and he said, what are you doing? I said, we're buying. He said, you are like, it was the craziest thing he ever heard. And you know, my reaction was, if we're not buying now and we will, um, but, uh, you know, it's been a great partnership. As you say, 31 years. Never an argument. Never an argue, never an argument. I mean intellectual disagreements, but never an emotional argument and never, and the key is respect. Even when we disagree. We respect. And the great thing about that is you sit down, you disagree. You, maybe you don't come to the enclosure and then you go back to your corners and he says, well, you know what, maybe how it's right. And I say, maybe Bruce is right and then you can have a productive discussion. If, if you, if your reaction is that moron, then you can't benefit from what he has to say

Speaker 4:          00:33:03       for, for people who were hoping to exhibit that type of poise and respect for someone else, are there any tactical recommendations you might have? And the reason I asked that is, uh, I no longer live in silicon valley, but I was there for 17 years and you see cofounder splits all the time. Some of them go the distance, but a lot of them end up fatalities. And you can almost see the writing on the wall when they're specked goes out the window. And it's just a matter of time for a lot of these guys, uh, for, for people who are in partnership, let's just for the time being, assume it's in a business capacity or an investing capacity, what are some of the tools of the trades that it doesn't escalate? Do you walk out of the room if you're starting to get heated there? Or do you avoid in some systems way given policies of the firm? Any types of sort of mission critical single decisions from becoming an object of argument, if that makes any sense. Because when the stakes are high, what are some, some recommendations you would have when things, when perhaps emotions are starting to escalate?

Speaker 5:          00:34:11       Well, the only issue I would take, Tim, is you started with, assume you're in partnership. I think you have to start sooner. Okay. Who Do you get in partnership with? And you know, you have to, you have to share values and you shouldn't be partners with somebody you're not going to like enjoy spending time with and be able to work with constructively when the stuff hits the fan. That's really the case. So, I mean, I believe that that most solving most personnel or managerial, uh, problems start at the beginning with the hiring decision or the combination decisions. So, so, uh, you know, just don't get into business with somebody you're not going to be able to live with. It's kind of like a marriage. Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:34:56       do you stress test their ability to handle potential high stress situations in some real or simulated fashion? Do you look back at in say, hiring decision? Do you look back at their history and reference checks to assess that? How do you assess whether someone is going to keep their cool or not?

Speaker 5:          00:35:16       Well, we don't do simulations or war games or anything like that, but we do, you know, I mean, that's an important part of reference checking. Uh, you have to, you have to look beyond whether the person is smart and whether the person's a moneymaker, you know, uh, uh, we have a no assholes rule at oak tree and I think that saves solves a of problems. Then, you know, there are lots of people in the world who can make you a lot of money, but you, you may not want to be in business with them and it, it may not be viable long term. Now it's, it's hard to absolutely follow that rule, uh, because really smart moneymakers are very tempting. But I think it's, I think it's really important, but, but then, you know, once, once you are in business together and you have the inevitable disagreement, I think one of the most important things is to, number one, acknowledge the limits on what, you know, if you, if you go in with some humility, then you're unlikely to have a fight to the death that is to the death of your partnership over an issue.

Speaker 5:          00:36:27       And, and it's, it's, you know, it's great to say, I mean, people should wake up in the morning and start the day by practicing. I don't know. I don't know. It's a great thing to say. And not enough people say it. And, and the, the, the, the flip side of, I don't know, is what I said before about our discussions. The, maybe he's right. You know, and so I think that's important. Humility. Number two, again, a control of emotion. Don't get into fight just to show who's who's more manly, uh, or you know, or, or equate, uh, winning the argument with success. Because if you're, if you're in a business situation and you're fighting for something that ultimately proves out to be a mistake, your success in winning the argument will lead to a failure. Um, so don't confuse winning the argument with coming to the best decision. Um, and you know, again, try to limit the testosterone. Um, I think that really gets in the way.

Speaker 4:          00:37:38       One, uh, one of the many things that I really enjoy about your writing is that it serves for me at least as a reflection on clear thinking that transcends investing. It'll, it applies to so many if not all areas of life, at least those governed by anything in the prefrontal cortex. And one that caught my eye when I was, when I was reading just page 15 in the new book is the following. And, uh, I'd just like to read, it's not very long. In addition to an opinion regarding what's going to happen, people should have a view on the likelihood that their opinion will prove correct. Some events can be predicted with substantial confidence. Example, given we'll a given investment grade bond, pay the interest in promises. Some are uncertain example, will Amazon still be the leader in online retailing and 10 years and some are entirely unpredictable example. Will the stock market go up or down next month? It's my point here that not all predictions be treated as equally likely to be correct in us. They shouldn't be relied on equally. I don't think most people are as aware of this as they should be. Could you expand on this a bit, if that's possible, maybe give some examples of how you or other people you respect use that type of, of puristic when making decisions or just I suppose reflecting reality in their own minds are perceiving things. Sure. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:39:02       okay,

Speaker 5:          00:39:03       we all have opinions and we hold our opinions because we believe in them. Nobody ever says, you know, my opinion is x and I think I'm wrong. We all think that our opinions are correct. Uh, but,

Speaker 5:          00:39:22       and, and, and again, the world becomes a better place, an easier place to navigate if we admit that even though there are opinions that they may be wrong. Uh, and, uh, you know, how, how does an investor like me deal with the fact that he doesn't believe in future predictions and, and, uh, and the answer is a, I say, and I have opinions on all these subjects, but I say it's one thing to have an opinion and there's it, it's another to believe and act as if it's right. And if you just say, maybe I'm wrong. If the world gets easier, in my opinion, uh, easier to succeed, uh, less, less easy to, to, to navigate day to day. You know, and, and a big theme of the book is that we have to view the future, not as an event which is predetermined and predictable or, you know, determined already, but as a range of possibilities, as a probability distribution.

Speaker 5:          00:40:24       And you know, I went to the world's fair in flushing in 1964 I think it was. And I stood before an exhibit that IBM had and it was, you know, typical of technology 50 odd years ago. It was the most simplistic thing you could imagine. They had, they had a slot at the top and a bunch of balls and the balls came through the slot. And then there were a bunch of pegs in a grid. And when the ball's hit the pegs, they started to diffuse. And by the time they get to the bottom, they were in a bell shaped distribution. And I think that was probably my first exposure to a distribution. But it's beautiful and that's how life is. The future is a distribution of possibilities. And if we're really smart, we know what the distribution, what the possibilities are, and we may have an idea of which are more likely and less likely, but we still don't know what's going to happen. And, and, and I think we have to behave that way now. Some things we know more, some things we know less, we shouldn't get confused. But the, the most important single thing is to not have the same degree of conviction about all of our opinions.

Speaker 4:          00:41:41       Do you apply a biopsy of one to 10 numerical value? Is it more of a light, medium strong had? How do you think about that yourself?

Speaker 5:          00:41:50       Yeah, well I think it's certainly not, you know, I'm not for the most part a quantifier if you read the book, uh, I would hope you would be struck by how few numbers there are in it. Um, and uh, you know, one of the great quotes which has broadly attributed to Einstein, I don't think it was Einstein, is that not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted. So the most important insights to life or non quantitative. Um, but I, I try to be conscious of when I have an opinion of how likely it is to be correct and I try really hard not to always assume that I'm right. By the way, let me add one thing. Um, Henry Kaufman, who was the chief economist of Solomon Brothers in the 70s, uh, at a time when America was riven with hyperinflations 15, 16, 17% a year, nobody could figure out how to stop it. And, and, and the world was really a very difficult place to live at. Kauffman. There was two guys, Kaufman and now, well, and our first Boston, they were called Doctor Gloom. And Doctor Doom and, and, but, but Kaufman said two kinds of people lose a lot of money. The people who know nothing and the people who know everything and um, uh, it's very few of us know nothing, but it's really important to assume, to not assume we know everything.

Speaker 4:          00:43:24       Is there any reading you've done or maybe it's just real life experience in the trenches of doing this day in, day out. But, uh, if for people who want to develop that, uh, I, I saw that you're, it seems like a reader or a fan of some of what Nassim Taleb has put out and he talks about epistemological arrogance quite a bit. It's a thinking that we are believing. We know it all or more than we, we actually know. How would you suggest, are there any resources, letters, books, memos, talks that you might recommend to people who want to really cultivate that awareness of limited knowledge?

Speaker 5:          00:44:02       Well, when you started to ask that question, I did fast forward to, uh, uh, Nassim Nicholas to lab and his book fooled by randomness. Uh, I think it's a really important book in terms of its ideas and, uh, it's, uh, it's really about how much randomness there is in our world. Now. It's primarily about investing, not the general world, but the world of investing. And you know, his example that if you're a dentist, he picks on the dentist a lot in the book, but it, but if you're a dentist on economist, yes. And you always fill a tooth the same way you'll always get a successful filling. Whereas in the investment business, there's nothing that you can do that if you do it the same every time, you're going to get a successful outcome because of the changeability and randomness in the world. Um, and, and, uh, this is, uh, extremely important and, uh, you know, we have to think about the world as a probability distribution when we, you know, one of the things that interest me most is when you look at history, you say, well, I don't know so much about the future, but the history that's, that's done, that's settled.

Speaker 5:          00:45:17       We know what happened, we know what the truth was. But to lab uses a concept called alternative histories. The other things that reasonably probably could've happened but didn't. And so when you look at a historical event, you have to say, was it, was that outcome inevitable, in which case that demonstrates a a truth or was it subject to randomness and could other things have happened just as well? You know, I wrote a memo, uh, in, in a memo around Oh six, I talked about the rose bowl game between USC and University of Texas and USC was highly touted as the best team in the history of foot college football. And, and I won't go through all of it, but I hope readers will take a look at it. But in the end they lost on one play. And so nobody talked about them as being the best football team in history.

Speaker 5:          00:46:20       My point was, and I wrote, I entitled this section, What's real? Maybe they were the best team in history and maybe the fact that they didn't, weren't successful on that one play that the whole game then maybe it was because the wind was blowing left to right rather than right to left at that moment. And so we should not be too firm in our conclusions. I guess the recurrent theme is that is, is a lack of certainty, but I really would push people to fooled by randomness. Uh, there's a little book by John Kenneth Galbraith called the short history of financial euphoria and a great quote, he said, we have two kinds of forecasters, the ones who don't know, and the ones who don't know, they don't know. And, and that has been very, uh, inspirational for me. I was, uh, I don't think this was attributed to you, but, uh, I came across it in looking at some highlights of your memos, uh, in prep for this conversation.

Speaker 5:          00:47:22       And I don't think it's attributed to you, but someone said, dumb money can become smart money if it accepts its limitations. I don't know if he would agree with that, but it, it, it's, it stuck with me is maybe not necessarily forecasters, but at least people who cultivate becoming aware of what they don't know. Sure. Well, I think first of all, knowing what you don't know is one of the keys to success in anything. You know, dirty Harry said a man should know his limitations. Uh, I wouldn't say, Eh, it's not my quote. I wouldn't necessarily say the dumb money can be smart money. Uh, but, but I, I would say that one of the ways to avoid being dumb money is to not act as if you know things you don't know. Uh, maybe by the time I get done giving the quote, I'll be, are ever able to remember who said it, but somebody very wise said Mark Twain.

Speaker 5:          00:48:16       That's it. It's not what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for certain that just ain't true. That is so important. There's nothing more dangerous in life than being sure you know, something that you don't know if you are, if you have excess certitude, you will do things boldly in dangerous ways and to dangerous extents that have the ability to get you into trouble, get you killed. But a sentence that starts you off with I'm not sure, but is unlikely to lead to fatal action. The distinction to me is so clear and so unarguable that I, I think this is one of the most important things for life. Know your limitations. You mentioned a little bit earlier how you could potentially say to yourself in the morning, I don't know. I don't know. Maybe he or she is right. Maybe he or she is.

Speaker 5:          00:49:12       Right. Uh, and it makes me think of some of these Memento Mori type quotes that, uh, maybe maybe apocryphal from ancient Rome or they'd have someone behind or the emperor when he's being paraded through the streets and you're just a man. You're just a man. Something like that. I know this is, this is seemingly, maybe not on the same topic, but nonetheless, I, I want to ask about it. Do you have any particular routines or habits in the first say hour or two of your day, whether it's now or whether you are kind of, if you can, if there were a particularly productive period in your professional life where you feel like those routines or habits in the morning were important? Does anything come to mind?

Speaker 5:          00:49:58       I don't have a stylized routines. I mean, I would just say that my life is, uh, is pretty calm and I try to keep it that way. Uh, and um, what would be a symptom of it not being common? How would you respond to that? Well, watching too much political TV and getting exercised about what you see on TV would be a good example. I mean, uh, that's, that's negative energy. That's not going to contribute to your effectiveness in the day. Now my, the fact that I don't get exercised about what I see on the news shows, uh, is not purposeful.

Speaker 4:          00:50:35       So up to this point, we've talked a fair amount about the importance of avoiding Hubris, of understanding your limitations, the incompleteness of your knowledge. How do you balance that with perhaps knowing your strengths well enough or having conviction in evidence to the extent that you can then take action? Sure.

Speaker 5:          00:50:55       That's a great question, Tim. And clearly it's essential to balance. Uh, you don't want to be the person who thinks he knows everything, but you can't be very successful in life and especially not in investing. If you think you're the person who knows nothing, uh, there is no magic in it. Uh, there is no rule, no method. Uh, it's just the, uh, an awareness. Um, but we, we have to feel, we know enough to take action. Now, most successful people, most smart people, uh, have, uh, don't have a problem in that area. They have a history of having their ideas validated for the most part. Um, but I think it's, it's, it's, I mean it is one of the great conundrums which is unanswerable. Uh, methodologically, you know, you buy a stock at 80, it falls to 60. You say, well, I think it's cheaper now.

Speaker 5:          00:51:57       I like it more. I'm going to buy more. You buy more now as well as the 40. Is there a point at which you say, well, maybe I'm wrong and maybe the market's right. Uh, you know, if you, if you throw in the towel and sell every stock you buy, when it goes down a little, you can, you can never be successful. But if you ignore the possibility that you're wrong, you can ever be successful. Um, and you, you have to strike a balance. So, uh, when you buy a stock and it goes down a little, you take another look at your analysis. Is there anything you missed? Did your analysis hold water and, and so forth. Maybe you talk to some people that you respect, uh, to get their opinions. Um, but, uh, you know, again, if you're, if you're too sure you're in trouble and if you're too unsure, you're in trouble. Uh, you have to strike a balance.

Speaker 4:          00:52:50       If we come back to the, the hypothetical example, you gave someone buying at 60 drops to 40 drop to 30 drops to 20 to avoid being in that position where you are offering yourself the option of buying or selling at each of those check in points. What are you deciding in advance so that you don't make those interim mistakes or you don't even make those decisions or, or look at them to begin with.

Speaker 5:          00:53:18       That's not my approach or oak trees approach. We don't have preset rules. Everybody says, well, why didn't you just a rule that there are things called stop loss orders. You buy something goes down 20%. You sell it every time. There is no rule that will ever work in every case. Uh, you have a say. You have a rule that goes down 20 year out, so it goes down 21 Esl, then it goes up a hundred, you know, or it goes down 10, you don't sell and it never goes up again. Uh, there, there can't be a rule that always works when they, just before the publication of my other book, uh, I had lunch with Charlie Munger and, and at the end of the lunch and when I got up to go, he said, now, just remember, none of this is meant to be easy. Anybody who thinks it's easy, as stupid, these things cannot be reduced to a rule.

Speaker 5:          00:54:13       The market operates, so as to confound rule makers. Uh, you know, it, it, and I wrote a memo five years ago called, it's not easy. It all comes down to judgment. We have to have, if we're going to have superior investment performance, we have to have superior judgement. And, uh, you, you, I mean, you can work on your processes both intellectual and emotional, but you can't, I mean, superior judgement is, isn't something you can order up and not everybody can necessarily attain it. Um, but, uh, I mean, I think that one of the most important things is, is to dismiss the concept of a process or a rule that always works in the absence of superior judgement.

Speaker 4:          00:55:05       Is the judgment, the, the decision to take a certain path versus another. In other words, and I know I'm going to be bastardizing this, but if, if, if an advantage could take the form of access to better information, better analysis of that information, uh, making a better decision with the, with that information that is available, having the courage to act on it, and then the emotional fortitude to either act on it or also sit with that decision. And there, there may be other behavioral psychological advantages or disadvantages. I'm sure there are. When you talk about judgment, is that a particular link in that, in that chain? Is it a,

Speaker 5:          00:55:48       I think judgment is everything. Uh, for example, just to follow your taxonomy, judgment is knowing when you have information that others don't. And if you think, you know something that others don't, it's knowing when yours is likely to be valid and not knowing whether you're likely to be off beat. It's understanding how to analyze it. It's judgment is, is, is the reaching of conclusions based on your analysis. Um, and a judgment is all we have to tell us when something goes against us, whether we should hang in or give up. So, uh, as I say, I think it's all judgment.

Speaker 4:          00:56:32       I would imagine a lot of people read your memos and your writing to develop in hopes of developing better judgment. And that while there, there is no one rule that will work for all circumstances, all cases. There may be certain questions or tools that proof helpful in, uh, in a greater percentage of cases than others. And to, to that, I would love to refer to a few things that I have in front of me. One is, is a letter that you sent to me along with the book and towards the end of the letter, it's, it, uh, it says, I draw my 50 years of investing experience to provide an orientation to the usual cycles in the economy, corporate profits, the availability of credit and the securities markets as well as some of the less ordinary ones. For example, in distress debt, investor psychology, and even in success.

Speaker 4:          00:57:25       But I think potentially, I think potentially the most useful chapter or the most useful is the chapter on the cycle and attitudes towards risk. How investors are thinking about risk and behaving toward it. At a point in time might be the single most influential determinant of markets position in the cycle. Uh, and thus the best indicator of how we should behave with regard to, and I, I read that chapter, I believe I had the right chapter and there's a, there's a point in this chapter that is a, that has a few lines bolded, which I really appreciate by the way. And it is, if I could, if I could ask only one question regarding each investment I had under consideration, it would be simple how much optimism is factored into the price. Uh, could you talk about this question and perhaps give some examples of using it or how people might use it?

Speaker 5:          00:58:16       Sure. You know, I started in the business in a summer job at Citi Bank, summer 68 50 years ago. And the bank was an investor in the fifth what was called the nifty 50 the 50 best and fastest growing companies in America. And if you bought the stocks the year I showed up and held him five years, you've lost almost all of your money in the best companies in America. Then 10 years later, I switched to the, uh, so-called junk bond business, high yield bonds. Now I'm lending money to the worst companies in America and I'm making money steadily and consistently. So, uh, clearly buying good things can't be the secret to success in investing and avoiding bad things. It has to be the price you pay. It's not what you buy, it's what you pay. And there are, there's no asset which is so good that it can't become overpriced.

Speaker 5:          00:59:09       This is of course, something that people have to bear in mind when they look at the Fang stocks. And on the other hand, those who don't know could fangs, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and, and they throw in alphabet too. Um, and um, so there is no asset which is so good that it can't be overpriced. There are very few assets which are so bad that they can't be underpriced and us a bargain. So what we have to look for if we're going to be successful investors. Uh, now my school, which is called value investing, puts more emphasis than perhaps a venture capital or or growth investing, which largely looks for brilliant futures. But the key is paying a low price relatives on to something called intrinsic value. If you pay a high price relative to the value, you're unlikely to do well and yeah, probably have to get lucky to have a good return. But if you pay a low price relative to the intrinsic value, then the odds, again, like my book says are, are on your side. So we want low price to value. How do you get low price to value? And the answer is low optimism. There are other ways to describe it.

Speaker 4:          01:00:26       You mean looking for low overall optimism,

Speaker 5:          01:00:28       right? If, if, if the insured, the things that everybody feels good about are likely to be the things that are high priced and the things that everybody feels bad about are likely to be low price. So, uh, if you could find out that here's, here's a stock, nobody thinks this company can ever have a good day, maybe there's a chance to do, produce some favorable surprises and make you a lot of money. If there's a, if there's a s a company like the nifty 50 back in 68, everybody assumed literally, Tim, nothing bad could ever happen to these stocks, then clearly there has to be so much optimism and the price that it's, that there'll never, there can never be favorable surprise. We make money from favorable surprises. And if, if the conviction of a positive conviction is so high, then by definition there can never be a favorable surprise. So, uh, I think that this is a number one concept.

Speaker 4:          01:01:31       You, you, you, you mentioned, uh, this, I think, I think you said the word never in this sort of hypothetical, uh, exuberant enthusiasm. But someone might say, and what I believe you, there's certain words you dislike using pay, pay, pay attention to when they come up

Speaker 5:          01:01:51       of the, uh, of this, uh, lack of, uh, intellectual Hubris, right? We should never say, never. Always has to, can't, you know, these, these, these expressions are far too absolute to be winners in a world beset by uncertainty. And, um, and uh, when you, when you use those words, uh, you tend to get into big trouble

Speaker 2:          01:02:27       when assessing a public sentiment. And I think it could be really wide. Let's say anyone participating in the SB 500, it could be narrower, but let's, let's assume we're looking at the, the, the broad, uh, the broadest collection of market participants at least, let's just, let's just say s and p 500. I was texting with a friend of mine who's a successful investor, very different stylistically than yourself. And I asked him, I said, what, what would people use are, or what do you invest in pros use or what's, what do some of them use to measure how feel fearful or greedy? Uh, and then in quotation marks, the market is, are there, go to indices, are poles. And he said, people use the vix as a measure of fear Vix. Uh, and then, uh, he said some people might use something like yield on junk bonds as a measure. In other words, low yield equals complacent market. What are, let's say, it seems so difficult to keep track of the media as a whole, although certainly it becomes obvious at some point if it's all negative or all positive. Are there, uh, particular indicators that you like to pay attention to or, or your affirm likes to, to at least keep an eye on?

Speaker 5:          01:03:44       In the old book, there's a chapter that talks about the importance of taking the temperature of the market, knowing where we stand. And it has a, it, it includes with a checklist, uh, largely tongue in cheek, uh, called the poor man's guide to market assessment and basically ask them simple questions. What's going on? Are, are if a new fund comes out, does it sell out immediately or does it struggle? Um, if, uh, if, uh, if an investor goes to a cocktail party, yeah, there you are. It's also a new book. Oh, it's also in the new model. It's great. It's, you know, if an, if an investor like me goes to a cocktail party, is he, is he the center of attention that everybody wants to talk to? Well that's probably a sign that the interest in the market is too high or is he pushed into a corner and everybody wants to talk to, to the, uh, athletes and the, and the venture capital guys.

Speaker 5:          01:04:41       And that's probably an indication that interested my part of the market is too low and that bargains may be available. Uh, you know, and when you turn on TV, uh, is it all they want to talk about is the good news or the bad news? And I have some cartoons in, in, in the notebook, uh, old cartoons dredged up from my files. Uh, but you know, um, it, it just, they demonstrate that virtually everything in the world and in the markets is subject to a either positive or a negative interpretation. And if, if, if everybody is interpreting positively, that tells me that the, that the spirits are too high and, and perhaps ready to be dashed and, and vice versa. You know, the greatest thing I was ever taught was back around 73 74 somebody said, I'm going to tell you about the three stages of the bull market.

Speaker 5:          01:05:36       And in the first stage, just a few incredibly insightful people understand that there could be improvement. And in the second stage, most people recognize that improvement is actually taking place. And in the third stage, everybody and his brother believes that things will only get better forever. Now I think this is number one, this is a very accurate description of the world. Number two, clearly if you buy in the first stage when only a few people understand the potential for improvement, you're going to pay a low price because there isn't much optimism in the price. Then as you progress to the second and third stage, the UN anticipated improvement takes place that gives the market a favorable surprise. The stock prices or the asset prices rise in response to those favorable surprises. Um, and uh, but you eventually reach a point where the good news convinces people that it's going to go on forever. And when everybody believes that things will get better forever, clearly it's likely that so much optimism is in the stock price, that it's dangerous and unlikely to yield a profit. So I think that the three stages of the bull market, uh, and conversely of the, of the bear market are really important, not as a money making rule, but as something to bear in mind and watch out for.

Speaker 2:          01:07:18       I'm going to ask you a few questions that, that, uh, you may not like, but that my fans will kill me for if I don't ask. So where, uh, it gets number one is where do you think we are at the moment? And of course this has to be timestamped. Uh, and then we're, we're talking about in the August, 2018 and what has you worried, what has you optimistic if you're optimistic about anything? Sure. Well,

Speaker 5:          01:07:46       where are we for the last 10 years? Ever since the crisis, people have been asking that question in the form of what inning are we in? Eh, when they asked it in late oh eight, what they really meant was, uh, how much longer will the pain go on? Uh, now what they're asking is how much longer will the pleasure go on and the bull market and the economic recovery, I think we're in the eighth inning now. You don't have to timestamp. But because I've been saying this for awhile, um, and, and I'm likely to continue to do so. But about a year ago, I came to realization that that observation, even if accurate is of limited use. Because unlike baseball, we don't know how many innings there are in a game. This is a big distinction. In a normal baseball game, we know there are nine innings. If I say we're in the eighth, and if I say it accurately, that means the good times are about to end.

Speaker 5:          01:08:40       But in economies and markets, there is no fixed duration. So the bull market, this is the 10th year. That's a long time in the economic recovery. This month we have begun the 10th year. The longest economic recovery in recent history is 10 years. So these observations start to tell you, not that it's gonna end, but that the likelihood of its continuing is declining. The odds are not on your side. When you're in the 10th year, the odds of having 10 more years of recovery seemingly are not good. We don't know if there's some reason why there has never been a recovery of more than 10 years. Uh, but we have to wonder if there is. Um, but on the other hand, we can't be too sure. Uh, now I believe that this economic recovery for many years was the slowest on record. That is probably helpful because that kept excesses from coming into existence that have to be corrected, uh, with a, with a downturn.

Speaker 5:          01:09:47       Um, so you asked about the good news. The good news is that the economy is functioning at a high level. We just had a quarter of unusually rapid growth. Um, unemployment is declining. Our economy is the envy of the world. Um, stock prices, which were very high when measured by price earnings ratio last year are not so expensive this year because the earnings have been supercharged by the tax bill. The projected earnings of the s and p 500, uh, our, our way up this year, 23%, I think, which is unusual and higher earnings. Everything else being equal means I lower price earnings ratio. So on Mo, by most measures, a stocks are only slightly expensive at this point in time. So that's the good news. The bad news is number one, interest rates are likely to increase and interest rates increased the burden of debt on companies. And when bonds yield more, they offer more competition for stocks.

Speaker 5:          01:10:53       Uh, clearly there are a lot of uncertainties in the macro world and the geopolitical world and the political world. Um, the, the, the greatest of which is the possibility of a trade war, which, uh, almost everybody thinks would be extremely negative, uh, not only for the u s and for the people who engage in the trade war, but for everyone. And, uh, I think that interestingly, what we've been talking about is assessing the level of investor psychology. I don't believe that investor psychology is terribly frothy. The way I've put it in the past is that people are not thinking bullish, but they're acting bullish. A lot of people have moved into higher risk investments in order to get the returns they want because right now, safe investments, treasuries and, and high grade bonds and cash and money markets or for so little. So people have been forced to move out the risk curve and take more risk and that makes the world a riskier place for you and me. Uh, I, I borrowed a phrase from my late father in law who said that those people could be described as handcuffed volunteers. They're doing things not because they want to, but because they have to. But the effect on the market is the same when people move to riskier actions that makes the market riskier for everyone.

Speaker 4:          01:12:21       So if we were to consider all of that, uh, if you had say three people come to you and you had to, you had to give them some responses because that's like a mother in law, people in the family. So you have to give them some kind of response. And I might be, feel free to ask some clarifying questions, but let's say someone has a hundred k to invest 1 million, 10 million to invest, so a hundred k 1 million and 10 million, they make $100,000 a year that is going to remain stable and predictable. It's just assume that on the income side, uh, they are very cautious. I think like a lot of people, the loss aversion and pain of losing $100 hurts much more than the joy they derive from making $100. Uh, and they have their investible funds, in this case, a hundred k, 1 million, 10 million in cash or cash equivalence or some of these safe vehicles currently. And they say, Howard, I don't know to do. What are your thoughts? I think that

Speaker 5:          01:13:25       one of the most important things of in investing is to make people comfortable. It's a mistake to sit there and say, you should do this. You should do that regardless of people's comfort level. Because if you violate their comfort level, if you force him into things that are too risky for them, and then things go bad, they're unlikely to do the right thing. They're more likely to panic and sell on the way on the lows, which is the cardinal sin of investing. Uh, so it's very important to assess people's needs and ability to withstand tough times. Um, clearly, uh, the person who makes a hundred and, and, and has a hundred doesn't have a big margin of safety for tough times and, and, and they should invest, uh, more conservatively. The person with 10 million, um, uh, depending on his psychology, uh, or her psychology probably would be willing to stomach some losses in the pursuit of big gains.

Speaker 5:          01:14:30       Um, now people always over estimate in advance. They're the equanimity with which they would greet losses. You know, back in 1997, eight, nine, when the, when the stock market and the tech stocks were rocketing along what a, what a lot of people I think said is, well, I, I, you know, my 401ks been doing so great. I wouldn't mind if I lost a third of my money. It's okay. Believe me, when, when, when they lost a third of their money, they weren't okay. Uh, but you know, our mantra, my mantra for the last few years has been moved forward, but with caution and, and uh, so in varying degrees to those three people, uh, what I would say, we are investing every day. We are endeavoring to be fully invested today other than in funds that are strictly designated as standby funds for the, for the crisis. We are definitely taking risk.

Speaker 5:          01:15:30       But with caution, we were cautious firm. We invest in risky asset classes, high yield bonds, distressed debt, uh, real estate, emerging market stocks and bonds, et Cetera. These are, these are risky assets and oak tree has always taken a low risk approach, a controlled risk approach to those asset classes. So when I say with caution, I mean with more caution than usual. I think this is a time for more caution than usual. Uh, and that's what I would tell those people, but I don't. So I think that the, the uh, the, uh, outlook is not so bad and the prices are not so high that you have to practice maximum defensiveness and go to cash and, and, and suffer a 1% return on cash. But I think the outlook is not so good and prices are not so low, but this is time for aggressiveness and I wouldn't be aggressive.

Speaker 5:          01:16:24       The, the, I think one way to that I help myself make these decisions, and it might be helpful to your listeners, is I constantly remind myself and others that as an investor there are really two key risks that we face every day. Now the first one is obvious and everybody knows about it's the risk of losing money. What's the second? Not so obvious, a little more subtle. It's the risk of missing opportunity. And most people, if, if reminded of the twin risks, they would say, well, I think that's right. And the truth is that I don't want to lose a lot of money. But on the other hand, I don't want to miss all the opportunities. So I'm going to compromise, I'm going to balance the two. I'm going to do something kind of in the middle. Um, and that makes sense. Everybody, you know, other than daredevils and scaredy cats, everybody should do something in the middle.

Speaker 5:          01:17:16       Exactly. Where in the middle is, is debatable and should be a tailored to their own psyche and financial position. So the interesting question is, okay, what about today? Today, should you be at in your normal balance between the twin risks or should it be different? Should you be in a higher risk position because so many things yields a little or should you be in a lower risk position? Because there are so many uncertainties and I actually think the ladder so fully invested and being cautious does not mean being in cash, but everything you want to do in the investment business, there are higher and lower risk ways to do it. And I think today is a time for the lower risk ways.

Speaker 2:          01:18:05       Uh, I, uh, you know, this is the, this is not the first time I've asked a question like this, but the last time I asked the first part of that, which was making a hundred grand a year, I've, uh, someone has a hundred grand grand to spend was actually at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting a long, long time ago. And it was my, my, my first and only time there and I was so excited to be there. I mean, it's Woodstock for investor nerds and it was, it was, there was so much excitement. People were camped out out front to be in line. I was part of that and I asked someone working there where the microphone wireless that was hardest to get to. And then I sprinted over there and I was able to ask a Warren and Charlie this question, of course, you know them and the responses can be very short.

Speaker 2:          01:18:54       And, uh, I said, if someone, hypothetically, we're making $100,000 a year, they had $100,000 to deploy in some way, how would you suggest they invest that capital? And it was along the lines of invest in the s and p 500 or a low cost index fund in the SB 500 and get back to work. And I found that very dissatisfying. But in retrospect, uh, certainly not the worst advice that you could get. Give someone, uh, how, how do you, uh, what do you disagree with, with Warren most on, what do you guys not see eye to eye on?

Speaker 5:          01:19:29       You know, Tim, there's a book out called the Warren Buffet Way, and I was asked to write the forward for the latest edition, and I wrote something called what Wakes Warren Buffet, Warren Buffet. And I listed the things that characterize him extremely high Iq, unemotional, great analysts understand what's important, looks at the things that are important and figures out their import, ignores the things that are unimportant and on and on like that. And the last one was the most, one of the most important. He's not afraid of getting fired. He doesn't have to worry about the, the interim consequences of error most people do. And, um, so, you know, okay, so you say your, your advice is, uh, or his advices invest in an index fund, fine as far as it goes. But how much should the person who has 100,000 put the whole hundred thousand in the stock market, right? And especially should they do it today?

Speaker 5:          01:20:28       And if they do it all today, we're confident the 20 years from now they're going to have a lot more money and they're going to be really happy. What about a year from now? And, and, uh, not everybody is financially able to live through a decline and emotionally able. And so as I said, the first purpose of investing, especially for people who have more money than they need to eat, should be to make you comfortable. When I started at bank Citibank 50 years ago, they had a cartoon on the wall. It said, scared money never wins. And it's true. And so everybody should invest only up to their comfort level. And, uh, so I, I think I would, I, I certainly agree with Warren that for most people they can improve on an index fund. But, but that's, and I'm not saying that Warren says that everybody should put 100% of their net worth in the index fund, but clearly they shouldn't.

Speaker 5:          01:21:33       And, and I was once at a, uh, at a talk and I was preceded by a, by a college professor. I wounded identify him. Uh, Warren always says, uh, uh, praise by name, criticized by category. So I'll always say, so I'll say I was, I was preceded by a college professor. And here's what he said. And this guy is known for pro stocks attitudes. And he said, if you are of average risk tolerance, you should have 85% of your money in this. No. If you're a below average risk tolerance, 85 average was Tom's 105. If you're aggressive, 125% of your net worth should be in the stock market. And I just think that most people can't live in the long run, in the short run with the consequences of being that much invested. Uh, and, and, and, uh, being human. We are our own worst enemy. Everything that goes on in the world and the market conspires to make people buy when things are going well and prices are high and sell, when things are going badly and prices are low. And, and fighting. That is the number one theme of the book. And it's the number one theme of, of success. Just from personal experience, and I mentioned this earlier, but looking at my response in say 2008, I had bought a house in 2007 and with some

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       very unfortunate, uh, mortgage terms and, uh, made some very bad decisions also with money that I had in the stock market at that time. And I think in part it was because I, I couldn't have known how I would respond under those circumstances. And when I filled out this very templated form of course for whoever it was at the time, I won't mention any anyone by name, but it was to what extent would you be comfortable with a drop in your portfolio over one quarter or one year, whatever the, the form of the question was and had 10% 20%, 30% and 30% maybe. I mean pulling it, the answer out of thin air had to answer it to get through the online form. But I'd never experienced anything similar to that. And this just came to mind because I'm looking at it on a book, at a book on your shelf, uh, bringing down the house about games.

Speaker 4:          01:23:57       We were talking about games earlier as I understand it, Bill Gates, I think also buffet played a fair amount of bridge, uh, certainly many people in the investing world, including some people who are really, really, really fantastic. Some of the guys from renaissance and so on poker, uh, then you have backgammon. What do you play and what do you think the game that they select says about the person, if anything, and could playing those games help someone to assess their risk tolerance for larger types of investing? Are there other ways to, in any way accurately determine that?

Speaker 5:          01:24:32       I think accurately determine, yes. Quantify. No. Uh, but I think that we can get a handle on our degree of risk tolerance, risk aversion, and we should. And, um, you know,

Speaker 6:          01:24:50       uh,

Speaker 5:          01:24:52       I was with the, my son and, uh, one of his friends this week and his friend is a great chess player. The interesting thing about people who play chess is that in chess, there's no randomness. Uh, you know, there's no dice to roll. There's no wind to blow a no card to pick from the deck. And, and every, all the information is on the board and everybody has all the information. So it tells you something about an intellectual process. Um, and you know, all the way out to craps, which where everything's, uh, you know, in play all the time based on randomness. Um, so maybe which game we like, uh, tells us something about ourselves. But how we play also tells us about ourselves. Backgammon, which is one of my main games, uh, which is highly probability intensive. Um, cause it's all the dies. It's the dice it and the skill.

Speaker 5:          01:25:49       But the dice mean a lot. Um, you know, in, in any situation with any throw of the dice there are aggressive and defensive ways to play. So, you know, probably the interesting thing was if you played and I watched her for a couple hours, I would know if you're aggressive or defensive or risk averse or risk tolerant and, and, and you should be able to do the same for yourself. The one of the, as I said before, one of the great things is to understand ourselves. And, and without that we are really in trouble. What are some of the things that otherwise smart people miss about cycles or misconceptions that they believe to be true? Like you said with Mark Twain, that just ain't so, I think the, well, the, the, the biggest mistake you can make is ignore the repetitive nature of the cyclical pattern. Uh, Ray Dalio in his, in his book principles, uh, talks about how much analysis he and his partners did.

Speaker 5:          01:26:52       Uh, the conclusion of which is the ability to look at what's going on in the world or in the market and say, oh, that's another one of those life becomes very easy when you have studied the past to the extent that you've seen the recurring patterns and you can recognize them when they come up again. So, so, uh, I think that's, I think that's extremely important. Um, but the other thing is, and I think the guiding quote of the book is a, is another one from Mark Twain. History does not repeat, but it does rhyme. History does not repeat, the cycles are not ever the same in terms of amplitude, speed, duration, cause or ramifications. But they do. There are themes that repeat that can help us to identify and properly respond to cyclical occurrences. So I say in the book that I, you know, I've been in the high yield bond business now for 40 years and there was a time when there arose a body of thought that most defaults a car on bonds, second anniversary since issuance.

Speaker 5:          01:28:15       And I don't, I don't think there's anything magical about the second anniversary. And you know, if people believe that, then they would sell all the bonds they had that were 23 years, 23 months old, and by him back when there were 25 months old if they had survived. But I don't think they would accomplish anything by that because they were, I think they were, they were, uh, assigning an import to a number that was not a valid. So I think it's really important to recognize cycles and understand them. I think it's unimportant to assign importance to these numbers who are rules. Uh, but it's very important to understand what's going on around us. And when, when, when the recovery is old, the bull market is old, the psychology is elevated, the, the, uh, the valuations are high, then you should know that the odds are not on your side and you should take some money off the table and behave in a more cautious way. And vice versa.

Speaker 2:          01:29:20       I suppose also on some level necessitates cultivating a fair degree of patients. Uh, I mean it would seem

Speaker 5:          01:29:28       patients is, patients is essential. There was a investment sage named Peter Bernstein, and he said, the market is not an accommodating machine. He will not give you high returns because you need or want them. And you know, if I believe that right now we're living in a low return world.

Speaker 1:          01:29:47       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:29:47       And if you say, Howard, I need high returns in a low return world, the only way to try to get them is by taking a lot of risk. And by definition, taking a lot of risk is,

Speaker 5:          01:30:02       is, is not sure to work and could have negative consequences. So I believe that when you're in a low return world, you have to accept it and deal accordingly. Now, this comes from Joel, which we started the interview with. Uh, I talked about Mojo in a memo about 20 years ago. Entitled, it is what it is. I think one of the most important things that we can do as adults, be it, be it in the investment world or the real world is to say it is what it is. In other words, accept things for what they are, deal with them as they are. Don't spend a lot of time wishing they were different. Uh, you know, certainly don't

Speaker 1:          01:30:42       okay.

Speaker 5:          01:30:42       Act as if they were different. Uh, we have to accept the realities.

Speaker 2:          01:30:47       I've, uh, not that in my, in my little tiny corner of investing, which is, I mean, not even worth mentioning, we late in this conversation, but I, I, I only bring it up to tie it to how helpful actually reading certain, I'm not going to, it's not quite scripture, but Buddhist thinking related to concepts like Mojo and stoic philosophy, Epictetus and so on. Uh, how helpful that has been to tempering emotional reactivity. Uh, you mentioned someone I want to it to come back to for a second. Uh, Peter, is it Bernstein or Stein? Ernestine Bernstein, financial historian. Uh, sadly passed away. I think it was in 2009. I, I've read that you consider him one of the smartest people you've ever met. Why, why is that? Are there any other things that you learned from him?

Speaker 5:          01:31:42       48 years ago when I was a junior analyst following xerox for Citibank and I would give the portfolio managers at the bank my opinions when I'm came up to me and said, who is the best analyst on Wall Street on Xerox? And I said, well, the one who agrees with me the most is so, and so. We always think that the people who agree us are really smart. And Peter saw the world the way I did, but in many cases put it into words better. Uh, and um, um, I wrote him a memo, uh, called risk in o six row risk revisited in 14. And then bizarrely one day I found a memo from him. You pay, you mentioned he passed away in o nine. In, in 16, I found a memo for whom all my desk, my desk is a little messy and there's a lot of stuff floating around and it was a great memo entitled, uh, can risk be reduced to a number.

Speaker 5:          01:32:38       And I took a bunch of stuff from that in a Redo of my memo entitled risk revisited again. Um, but I just, I just think that Bernstein is great. And, and, and in on the subject of risk, he said every day we walk into the unknown. Um, and, and as I said, you know, the future is a distribution of possibilities and some days we don't even know what the possibilities are. And, and I conclude if I can borrow your copy of the book, I can include, uh, with, with a quote from him, uh, because I think it's so good and, uh, if I can find it quickly, he said the future is not ours to know, but it helps to know that being wrong is inevitable and normal, not some terrible tragedy, not some awful failing and reasoning. Not even bad luck in most instances. Being wrong comes with the franchise of an activity whose outcome depends on an unknown future.

Speaker 5:          01:33:49       And I think that that's a great way to, to think about the world we have to work in. And if you accept and inhale the unpredictability, variability and randomness of the world, I think you're likely to do a lot better in it. Now, that doesn't mean you can't invest. You can invest even boldly. What it means is you have to assume that things are not going to always work out right away. Well, of course they're not always going to work out, but they're certainly not always gonna work out right away, which means what? You have to have patience. You have to same power. You have the fortitude, you have to, uh, not invest so much that if it goes against you, you're going to panic and get out. Uh, preparing for an unknown world, unpredictable, maybe even hostile world in the short run is probably a lot smarter than assuming everything's going to go right and it's going to go the way you expected and it's going to go that way right away. And you're not going to be tested. Uh, and, uh, so I, I think that the, this is the kind of thinking that, that, that, uh, you know, when I read Bernstein or, or some of the other people I've mentioned, you know, I just go, oh yeah, right, sure. That, that gets it for me. You know, and that's why I love his stuff so much.

Speaker 2:          01:35:19       Uh, Warren Buffet has mentioned how Fante is of your writing and that, and I'm paraphrasing here, but if he sees it in his inbox where he sees one of your letters, it's one of the first things or the first thing that he'll pick up to read. I'd love to ask you about your reading. Are there any, say three to five specific newsletters or columnists or economists or writers who you find yourself excited to read these days? Anyone who comes to mind?

Speaker 5:          01:35:47       I th I think the best, uh, you know, I worked mainly in the credit area, not the stock market. So, you know, most people invest mainly in the stock market and we've talked a lot about the stock market. Uh, but that's not what I do professionally. And, uh, our oak trees investing is largely in, in something called credit, which means, uh, fixed income securities, bonds and notes and loans, uh, not issued by governments. That's the definition of credit. Um, and in, in our world, I think that is a great newsletter called grant's interest rate observer. It's a little ironic because it grants has nothing to do with interest rates are almost nothing, but it's about credit and it, and, and in particular, it exposes a stupidity. And it exposes companies which seem to be where people are not bringing enough, uh, skepticism and, and deals that seem unwise and that kind of thing.

Speaker 5:          01:36:52       And, and I think they do a great job. Now it, I think it's fair to say that it has a negative cast. In other words, they're mainly talking about things which are, which are rated higher than they should be, which you should avoid or bet against. I don't think they as often talk about the things that are rated lower than they should be and present profit opportunities. But for credit guys like us, uh, avoiding the losers is extremely important. And, and I think that's a great, a great newsletter, not only for the content but for the attitude and the importance of identifying misperceptions. You know, the misperception is the key to operating in the, in the markets and the variant perception. You understand things differently from the way everybody else understands them is the key to success. Assuming you're right, uh, if you understand everything just the way everybody else does, clearly you can outperform. That's the death knell for would be a professional investor. So you have to have, you have to see things different from others. That's a necessary condition for outperformance, but you also have to see it better than others. That's necessary to, uh, that the, the two, the combination of those two is what I call second level thinking, which, which I mentioned a couple of times.

Speaker 2:          01:38:16       You also mentioned how widely read, uh, Charlie Munger is and certainly in poor Charlie's Almanack for instance, he talks quite a bit about if I'm not missing Mr roaming a evolutionary biology and, and, and really is able to pull concepts from seemingly unrelated disciplines into his sort of power zone of, of investing. Uh, and, uh, I've had investors recommend certain books are, are much broader than investing, such as lessons of history by will and Ariel Durant, which I found really fascinating also, I mean, talks about cycles in a way. Uh, are there any books that you found recommending a lot or that you've enjoyed in the last few years that are not specific to investing?

Speaker 5:          01:39:09       Uh, not specific. Yes. My, my reading is usually closer in a that then Charlie's a, so an example, uh, is the book I'm working on now, which is called fact fullness. Um, and basically it, it, it unmasks a lot of misperceptions that people have about the state of the world. Uh, and, uh, they hold these perceptions, uh, generally, qualitatively not based on data. And the author tries to substitute facts for these perceptions, Eh, eh, he starts with a list of 13 questions describing the state of the world. And fascinatingly, uh, the, I guess he, it gives you the answer to one and you have to think about the answer. The other 12, the average score on the 12 is too, and he points out that if you flip the coin, you'd get six, right? So the average American gets two of the 12 questions, right? And so not only are they systematically wrong, but they're wrong in the same direction, which is they always pick the more pessimistic answer when the more optimistic one is true. And so he's, he responds to our bias and he tries to overcome the ignorance and the bias, uh, by, by using facts and, and, and, and some great, uh, very communicative graphics. So I would recommend, uh, impactfulness and I love the idea of unmasking biases.

Speaker 2:          01:40:46       You mentioned that, uh, and if I get this wrong, as I'm restating, please correct me, but for in a low yield environment

Speaker 4:          01:40:55       to get high yield entails increased risk. Uh, I know you've written a little bit about cryptocurrency before. Uh, the last I saw was about I think, I think for about a year ago. What is your, what is your current view or thoughts on cryptocurrency, if any? That's one place that people are going, uh, often with no understanding of the technology or anything else. I mean it scares me enough, although anyway, I won't get into my view on that stuff. But people who are well outside of tech, well outside of all that getting very, very bullish as it relates to cryptocurrency. But what are your thoughts?

Speaker 5:          01:41:34       I am what is called a value investor. And that means you look at the situation, you don't look at the atmospherics, you don't look at the aesthetics, you look at the value, hard value, uh, the, the company's assets and the cash flow that is business producers and you value those things and you come to something called the intrinsic value and then you see if you can buy it for less. If you pay full intrinsic value, you'll probably get a fair return. If you pay more, you'll probably have an unsuccessful experience. But if you can buy it for less than the intrinsic value, you, you should have an above average return. That's value investing. And I think it is the intellectually sound, this form of investing. And nobody has been able to tell me the intrinsic value of a bitcoin. I believe there are assets in this world where you can come up to intrinsic value and they are the ones that produce cashflow companies, stocks, bonds, buildings, that kind of thing.

Speaker 5:          01:42:41       There are a lot of assets in this world to do not produce cash flow. You cannot put an intrinsic value on oil, gold, diamonds, paintings, bitcoin. Does it apply to all currencies? Yes it does. Yes it does. Uh, we cannot say how many pounds a dollar is worth. Um, we, we people look at them in terms of what's called purchasing power parody, but it doesn't really work very well. And the truth of the matter is that these macro considerations to directions of economies and, and, and markets and the currencies and PR, commodity prices, I mean, what's the intrinsic value of an orange, you know, um, these things I think can't be predicted reliably. And in fact the so called macro funds have been doing quite poorly for years. Um, so, uh, there are some things can be valued in some things a can. And I believe that bitcoin is one of the ones that can't be valued.

Speaker 5:          01:43:55       And everybody says to me, but you don't understand. And I wrote about this in my July 17 memo and, and uh, and return to it in September, I learned something between July and September. That's why I put it in the next memo to, um, people said you just don't understand. People are going to want a currency that the government can't deflate and that can't be counterfeited and can't be stolen and all these things. And um, so, uh, that's why I returned to it, but I still don't understand how it can be valued. I don't [inaudible] today a bitcoin is $6,500 here on August the 10th. And I don't see how you can say it's worth 7,500 or 5,500 or anything like that. You can say it's going to be useful in the future. You can say people want occurrancy a nongovernmental currency, but I don't see how you can put a value on it.

Speaker 5:          01:44:49       And, and uh, uh, with all of its attractions to the extent that people find attractions in it. Last year it went from 1000 to 19,000. Now, I could be wrong, but that tells me it's speculative buying. Uh, and by the way, the people who remember what I said about people who have opinions believe in their right. Obviously the people who it traded at 19,000, somebody thought it was a good buy at 19,000 cause it was going higher. And today it's a third of that. So for the most part, reasonably valued value investments do not go up 19 times in a year. And then down by two thirds.

Speaker 4:          01:45:34       Are there any understanding that you are a value investor? Um, you, you mentioned a few other names and the bit in the introduction of your book, Joel Greenblatt, uh, who I'm also a fan of. Are there any growth investors, venture investors who are, uh, is certainly a person thinks differently, but are there, are there any particular growth? Are Venture investors or people who are playing a slightly different approach who you have a lot of respect for or admire for particular reasons? Sure.

Speaker 5:          01:46:07       Let me say, there are many ways to invest. There are many people who engage in activities that I think can't be done. And there are many people in each one who do very well. So, you know, I, I don't, I don't say mine is the only way in venture as an example, and I'm not a futurist, I'm not a dreamer. I'm not highly risk tolerance. Uh, I'm not biased to risk taking. And if, if it, 40 years ago when Citi Bank said to me they wanted me to start at a high yield bond portfolio, if instead they would have said, I want you to start a venture capital fund, I probably would have been disaster. Um, but in the venture field, you know, the, the, the firms that success seems to be recurring, not random. You know, if, if, let's say 20%, 10% of venture capital funds are successful, you would think that any given firearm, 20% of their funds would be successful.

Speaker 5:          01:47:09       But there are firms which are repeatedly successful. Um, you know, uh, I was lucky in the last year to get to meet Bill Gurley of benchmark and, and, and bill was nice enough to give me a blurb for the jacket in my book. Uh, and, and I was very impressed by our conversation and by, uh, benchmarks, a record of achievement and Sequoyah has a great record, um, and, um, you know, climate Parkins, et cetera. Uh, so you can do it. Uh, but it wouldn't be right for me. That doesn't mean it's not right for them. The macro, there are, you know, I said 15 minutes ago that macro funds have had pretty bad record. Some of the greatest investors in history have been macro investors. Uh, George Soros and Stan Druckenmiller, for example, uh, have been fabulous. They, they, they probably have the highest returns of, of everybody, um, and quantitative investing, renaissance and so forth. So, uh, again, it would be a terrible form of Hubris to say, my aunt, my way is the only way my way's the way we're way that works for me. And by the way, if you look at the others, the success ratio is not terribly high. Uh, but certainly there are people who've done it. Great.

Speaker 2:          01:48:30       Yeah, there's a very high concentration of success and a handful at least within venture. Uh, yeah. Bill's a very smart guy. And all the firms you mentioned have done really, really well. Uh, so I, I've heard said, ah, this is not, not from, not from you in these words, I don't think, but that, you know, the right decision at the wrong time is the wrong decision. And, uh, I'm, I'm very excited about the new book and the literacy of cycles that you are helping people to do develop with this. Uh, and, uh, we're gonna wrap up in just a few questions. Um, are there any particular, uh, mental models or heuristics that are in this book or that you've used in your investing life do you think are particularly valuable kind of across the board in life? I know it's a big question and you probably have, uh, quite a few different directions you could go with that. But just in terms of becoming a clearer thinker, a better operating human being, does this, does anything come to mind that we haven't discussed so far as it relates to any type of mental model that would be worth mentioning? We wrap up.

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       Well, you know, Tim, when I finished writing the book and I was thinking about cycles, I said to myself, so for example, the economy grows about two, two and a half percent a year on average. Why doesn't it just grow two and a half percent year every year? Why is it sometimes four and sometimes one and sometimes five and sometimes negative. And the answer is accesses and their correction. And people get too excited and they overexpand their businesses or they invest too much or they invest too much using debt and then something goes wrong and, and that, and their accesses are produced booms and then something goes wrong. And those excessive activities turned out to be unsustainable. And they are then corrected by selling off inventory, closing plants or, or liquidating leverage portfolio and those produce busts. So accesses and their correction. And I think the best thing that people can do is be on the lookout for those things. And when other people are engaging in accesses to the upside, we should turn cautious. And when other people are over correcting to the downside, we should turn aggressive. And, uh, and, and I think, you know, it's been a big part of what Bruce and I have accomplished for the oak tree investors and my other partners and colleagues to, uh, and, and it's something that everybody can do if they, um, if they turn their mind to it.

Speaker 2:          01:51:26       Well, Howard, I really appreciate the time today. Good.
