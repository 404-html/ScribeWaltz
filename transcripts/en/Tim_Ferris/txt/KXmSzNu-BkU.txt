Speaker 1:          00:33          this episode is brought to you by inc tell and I've used them personally ever since I wrote the four hour work week. I've been asked over and over again how I choose to delegate tasks, how I do 80 20 analysis and so on. At the root of many of those decisions is a simple question. Actually two questions. Number one, how can I invest money to improve my quality of life? I use that in investing as well. The second, how can I spend a little money or moderate money to save significant time inc tell is one of those investments there a turnkey solution for all of your imaginable customer care needs? I used ink tell during the launch of the four hour body, which was very, very involved and they provided 24 seven customer service for my land rush campaign because it was critical for me to take care of every person who purchased my books and participated.

Speaker 1:          01:23          This allowed me to focus on the things that I am better at, my strengths, like the marketing plan that we'd worked on for six months, implementing that until trains their experience. Customer service reps to know your business and your products inside and out and make it your customers are raving fans. They answer more than a million customer service requests every year and they can do so across all platforms including email, phone, social media, texts, even chat, leaving your customers with poor service or just mediocre service, which by the way, in a competitive pool is a huge liability. Long wait times are unanswered messages carries a massive cost and risk to your business. Ink Tell removes the logistics and headaches of this type of communication, allowing you to focus on your strengths and grow your business. It can be a real competitive advantage. And I see many, many ecommerce companies and tech companies thinking of customer service as a good enough checkbox or an afterthought, and it just like airbnb use design and innovative ways to be a competitor and to win. You can do the same thing with customer service. So as a listener of this podcast, you can get up to $10,000 off.

Speaker 1:          02:54          this episode is brought to you by leadership in turbulent times, which is the latest book by the Ever Amazing Pulitzer Prize winning author, Doris Kearns Goodwin. I had her on the podcast not too long ago and she just blew everyone away. What an incredible storyteller and weaver of history and lessons from history. You can check that out if you want a tim.blog forward slash. Doris D. R I. S. It was a captivating conversation that that really blew me away. Leadership and turbulent times. That is the latest book is a culmination of five decades of a claim studies in presidential history, which offers an illuminating exploration of the early development. That's super key. Early Development, growth and exercise of leadership and uh, draws upon four presidents, which we'll get to in a second. Goodwin asks and answers in those pages. The questions are leaders born or made, where does ambition come from? How does adversity affect the growth of leadership?

Speaker 1:          03:52          Does the leader make the times or do the times make the leader? And she draws upon the four presidents she has studied most closely, namely Abraham Lincoln Theater, Roosevelt, Franklin d, Roosevelt and Lyndon B Johnson to show and how they recognize leadership qualities within themselves and were recognized as leaders by others. And I mentioned early development being key because it goes back to their first soldier as an experiments and attempts at engaging with policy and public life and covers their failures, their near misses and lessons learned. So it applies to anyone who is trying to make a study of leadership or how they can better lead both themselves and others. It's important to underscore that no common pattern describes completely a single trajectory of leadership, although set apart in background abilities and temperament. These four men shared a fierce ambition and deep seated resilience that enabled them to surmount uncommon hardships and at their best all four were guided by a sense of moral purpose. This seminal work provides an accessible and essential roadmap for aspiring and established leaders in every field. I highly, highly recommend it.
