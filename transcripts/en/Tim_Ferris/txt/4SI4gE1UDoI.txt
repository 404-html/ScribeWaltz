Speaker 3:          00:03:21       Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers of all different types, whether they're from the worlds of business, sports, entertainment, military or otherwise. And this episode we have Ricardo Semler who was by popular request and it certainly had a large impact on me. He came up not too long ago in the very, very popular podcast episode with Dhh David Hannah Maia Hansen, who is of the 37 signals base camp and ruby on rails fame, who also credits Ricardo with having a huge impact on him. So who is Ricardo? Cool. I always want to call Ricardo because he is originally from Brazil. He is the former CEO of Semco, a Brazilian company, best known perhaps for its radical form of industrial democracy and corporate reengineering. And all of that will make more sense as we get into the conversation.

Speaker 3:          00:04:14       We really focus on entrepreneurship even though there's so much more to talk about, including education and what he's done with his Lumiar schools. But going back to Semco under his ownership or during his leadership. Certainly both revenue grew from $4 million us in 1982 to 212 million US dollars or so in 2013 and his innovative business management policies which are very controversial, attracted very widespread interest all over the world. He's taught at Mit, he's an many, many other things and most recently he has started a podcast which is checkout called lead wise and you can find that at podcast dot lead wise. Dot Ceo on Twitter. You can find them at Ricardo Semler or at let's lead wise if you want to be pot podcast specific so you can check out both of those. Facebook let's lead wise and then Linkedin, Ricardo Semler and I should also provide some context for two very similar sounding book titles.

Speaker 3:          00:05:12       So he wrote the seven day weekend in 2003 which had a big impact on me. The four hour work week. I'm not sure how happy he is about how seemingly related those titles are. But came about for those people who don't know the story from the original title of the book, which was drug dealing for fun and profit, which was the tongue and cheek name of the guest lecture I gave at Princeton and high tech entrepreneurship. Uh, ultimately for at least 10 years, I think it was around 2003 to 2013 or so. And when the book was sold to crown within random house at the time, there were a few retailers, I want to say it might've been Walmart who really didn't like drug dealing for fun and profit. So I, so I, I quickly sketched out as did they, I'd say a dozen or so titles and one of the ideas was the two hour workweek because that's how long it took me to manage my company at the time.

Speaker 3:          00:06:04       But that seemed to unrealistic. So I was like, all right, we'll go up to four hours a week. And then I tested that along with the other titles in Google ad words and for let's just call it $200 a week later since Google mixes and matches the, the ad headlines, which were the titles and the ad text, which were my subtitles, I knew which combination at the highest click through rate. And that is how we ended up at the four hour workweek. But no matter, I will put a shots of a photograph of my self made index at the beginning of the seven day weekend, which is a great book and I recommend people check out. And uh, this conversation ranges vary very widely and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. So without further ado, please enjoy my conversation with Ricardo Semler.

Speaker 4:          00:06:56       Carla, welcome to the show. Thank you. Thank you. I'm so happy to have you on the phone and on the show because I have been a fan for so long and I in fact have this copy of one of your books, the 70 weekend which has traveled with me for at least 10 years now. I bought it when it first came out and I was looking at the index that I made for myself in the very beginning, which I'll have to take a photograph of and send to you as a, first of all, as it came up in my conversation with, with Dhh on the podcast. I just wanted to thank you for sharing your experiences.

Speaker 5:          00:07:35       Obviously I have a copy of your work week or a similar name and I'll have to photograph or that to believe that you've actually carried it around, but it's great to, to to catch up. I know you've been very sought full about all these really deep issues of how to live, how to work and uh, how do you put wisdom into things, which was my concern as well.

Speaker 4:          00:07:58       I think we'll, we'll want to jump into that and also talk quite a lot about education. A lot of my audience has many, many quiz questions about learning and education, so we will, we will certainly get to that. But for those people who don't have a lot of background and a lot of context, could you give us perhaps just a snapshot of where you grew up and your childhood just as, as a starting point and then we can depart from there to many different places. But that would be very helpful place to start.

Speaker 5:          00:08:27       Sure. And you know, I was thinking about it the other day when I've been trying to work with some guys in the UN and elsewhere about putting education platforms into refugee camps in it. And it, it kind of explains my background as well. My, my parents were both, um, Ostrin refugees and um, my, my mother was a refugee in, in all respects of the world. And it says the sheep runaway from

Speaker 4:          00:08:54       Vienna to Shanghai. I

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       spent 11 years in Shanghai, but then was kicked out of Shanghai by Maltitol in 1949 and then actually spent 18 months in a tent in a refugee camp in the south of France. And she was one of these displaced persons who had no passport whatsoever. And so it's, it's very interesting how we see different variations of the word refugee. But the fact is that she then became an an immigrant in Brazil, which is the only place that accepted her. And um, and so much later I was born and she had a, uh, she lost seven pregnancies, hand still borns, et cetera. And so she always regarded me as somewhat of a miracle. And a Freud always says that if your mother believes in you, absolutely that you can do anything, then you can do anything. And that's the only thing it takes. And so it was very interesting because I grew up in a household that was already a well to do and we had everything.

Speaker 5:          00:09:58       And um, and when I got to about 12, 13, I got involved with rock bands and then I, I spend a lot of time as a Rodeo. And then as the and playing, I was never terribly good but enough to, to kid all in and enough to trickle it to all my friends into thinking I was very good and going on stage here and there, which is I think probably the most important part of it, you know. And uh, so, um, so why the by the time I was 17 or 18, I was, I was very much in that mode, but my father then who was 50 years older than me and uh, I always, it was very interesting also because I kept looking at us 15 years older men span is almost my grandfather. And um, and I said I could never do that myself and so forth.

Speaker 5:          00:10:44       And so promptly I had a son not when I was 50, so, um, he's now seven. So some of this stuff comes back to bite you in the ass. But the fact is that then I was 17, he wanted me to, you know, he kept taking me to the plant and staining Sunday, all this will be yours because of the manufacturing plant, which makes pumps and very heavy equipment. And he was very engineering oriented. There were about a hundred people there and this wasn't, had been there for a long time and doing relatively well. But then it started deteriorating. So the, by the time I was 19 or 20, the whole business, um, double industry for that was, it was in very bad shape at that point. I had decided to do law school because I didn't want to do, I thought business school in general was very restricted and very much turned to the past and so forth. And I'm wondering more and more humanistic background that did that. And then that joined the company in. And when I joined the company, I'm kind of following his swishes while I was still doing law school. Um, I realized that we had a big, the big difference in the way we saw the world or how we would run things, that it was very traditional and he was wearing a three piece suit. I was wearing a three piece

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       suit with a watch in my pocket. It was pretty unbelievable. And then, um, why was your watching your pocket? Because this was my grandfather's watch and my father were, went in his pocket with a little gold chain and pulled it out every so often, you know, I was ready to start smoking pipes, you know, this is the world that was just staring me in the face. It was very, very curious. But, and of course this was all colliding with the rock guitarist and basis, which I thought I was, I had hair down to the middle of my back until a year before, you know. So this was all very strange and it was a very strange world. And I saw people getting, um, uh, having to come to, to the company and be searched on their way out and have exact times. And if there were five minutes late and docking pay, and this is an extraordinary world compared to what I'd seen up to them, let's say, in the world of rock.

Speaker 6:          00:12:58       And, um, so when I started looking at all that, at a certain point, I told him, I said this, we're incompatible here. This is what I would do here is so different. And probably you're saying it would never work. So, um, let me go do something else. And um, for a while he just kind of took the bluff and said, sure, go see what else you can do. And I found out at that point that the business world was more interesting than I thought that I could do something with it. And I went out and started looking for opportunities to do something on my own. And that was not a world 35, 40 years. It was not a world of startups or anything in the sword. So if you wanted to start a business, this is all very hardware oriented. So I went out and I talked to people who were in the consulting business, you know, I want to buy a company, but I don't actually have any money to pay for it.

Speaker 6:          00:13:52       And if I were going to pay for it would be my dad's by the end. Of course, that makes no sense whatsoever. And then I finally found a consultant at pricewaterhouse of all places who, um, helped me. He said, no, you have to do the following. We'll look for companies that are broke and then have no money whatsoever. They have a big debt. And if you're not scared of taking on that and you can buy these companies for a dollar. And I said, the dollar I have, let's go do that. And so we looked at dozens and dozens of companies finally got to one, which was a ladder company, made metal and wooden ladders. And um, and I got to the point of signing, there was 200 page contract that was sitting at the lawyer's office to sign the purchase of this company, which was really a very high negative worth of course because it hadn't been dead how of problems. But the guy wanted to get rid of it and I said, give it to me. And suddenly my father bursting to the law office and he said, what does it cost to pay the fine to do this deal at the sort of longer sentence than it was. I remember it was $200,000, which seemed like an enormous on Monday and at the time. And so he, he baited and we paid the fine and didn't sign the agreement and then I started with the company. So those are very interesting beginning

Speaker 4:          00:15:12       this, this I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but sort of probably chronologically it's close to something I wanted to ask you about that a lot of my listeners wanted to ask you about. And that was when you took the reins as CEO, maybe you could describe the circumstances, but the, the firing of 60% of top managers as, as one of the first decisions. And, and I don't know if that is as straightforward as it might seem, but the question that came up from a lot of my listeners was how did you make that decision? And I would just love to hear the circumstances surrounding it and the thought processes that went into your first decisions, uh, when that transition took place.

Speaker 6:          00:16:05       Yeah. And, and it's, it's interesting. I mean, what, what I told you a little while now connects to that of course. But, and then, and it's interesting the thought process when you say, you know, your, your, your listeners want to know this one or that. And I just, I just started, uh, uh, Lou, our guys have been suspended a little podcast and, and we've covered a leading wisely and leading wisely is all about this issue of, you know, how do you make some decisions like that one of firing most of the people and how do you know that it's folly or wisdom when you start, you know? And so I'd gotten to that point where, um, it was either him or me in the sense of there were two ways of trying to run this. And at that point the business wasn't doing very well, which gave me an opportunity.

Speaker 6:          00:16:56       But as I looked out at these people, maybe, you know, we had a hundred odd people, so maybe 20 of them a little bit more. We're either managers or supervisor is somebody wearing a leading capacity? And I looked out at these people and I'd already had a little bit experienced with trying to change things and people were always explained to me why it can't be done. So they would listen very patiently and then they would say, yeah, okay, but you're a new, you know, you're 19. You've just that prior to this and the fact as we've been in this business for so long and there's this and there's that event. And I realized that in the amount of time it would take me to turn these people around and to deal with the, um, unconscious sabotage that everyone who is in place, uh, applies to everyone else.

Speaker 6:          00:17:44       You know, anyone who was coming in to something is always new and hasty and doesn't really understand and you, and so it takes a hair all the time in the business. At that point, it was not doing well enough to withstand the long cycle. Uh, and then I realized that the amount of sabotage that I'd have in the amount of interactions, the permutations of firing three people who then create an alert and panic and the other six people who talked to the other five behind our backs and so forth, it seemed like we didn't have the time for that. And it seemed obvious that these people were terribly, uh, in place, uh, and, uh, completely calcified with all these users had been there. So I took a rash decision, which may be only a 19 or 20 year old would do, probably wouldn't have, I don't think I'd ever occurs to do that today again.

Speaker 6:          00:18:36       But I looked out there and I said, we just sort of pull the bandaid off this thing so that I can start the next day. And so on one Friday afternoon, I just called people in, I had never hired anybody much less fired anyway. And then I fired out of the old 16, 17 managers and directors and that included the CEO, the CFO or anybody who mattered. And, and these people went home Friday and didn't return on Monday. And we spent the whole weekend going through these people's filing cabinets. This was all paper and going through the filing cabinet and trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this company. And we would look at it and then we'd see a customer and they would say, oh, I wonder who this customer is that we had no idea. And it was really, it was really quite a quite a rollercoaster ride. But I think in the end it made us change direction of course, very quickly. So that 60 days in we were a completely different company and then it was possible to throw out the whole rule book from, from nothing and say, what does that, what, what part of this do we really need? And what part of it, which has just been here forever and doing that slowly, I think it would've killed me and the other guys as well.

Speaker 7:          00:19:46       Did you have many conversations before making that decision? Was it, was it scary for you to do that? I guess? Uh, it's just seems like such a, uh, you said rash, but also, I mean courageous in some respects, decision for someone at that age, in that position. Did you have any conversations inside your head or with other people that allowed you to take that, that leap and make that decision? I'm just wondering what sort of led up to it.

Speaker 6:          00:20:16       Yeah, I'm imagining that there must have been and I can think basically any one or two people who from the beginning I felt would be on the right side and they'll, maybe I tested it with slightly, but I already knew as well that I couldn't tip off the system or the wrong people. And I didn't know enough people. I remember talking to my dad a few days before because he was about to go on a trip to Europe and I said, uh, you know, I have to do a few things here and it might involve some of the, and he said, and I imagined, I imagined, uh, do everything while I'm in.

Speaker 6:          00:20:57       As soon as he, I think he traveled and we traveled on Thursday and I called everybody and on Fridays. So, but I think it was, it was knocking around inside my head in the sense that, Geez, you know, if I, if I tried to do this the old fashioned way or the soul cycle, um, this is going to be 10 times as hard, but also the chance that I actually get to the end of this as smaller and a, I felt in many respects that on top of it being rushed, I felt I really had no option. There was no time and we needed to do this very quick. And now of course, that gave me an opportunity to have a startup, let's say, um, on Monday from a, a business that was already 30 years old on Friday.

Speaker 4:          00:21:41       You, uh, I want to flash forward a little bit and I'm sure we'll fill in the, some of the gaps in there will be stories that will come back, but could you please describe the, uh, I would love to know the actual meaning of the title Vii Donda Appropriate Mesa and which is, as I understand it later became maverick, but clearly in, I don't speak Portuguese but seems to mean something very different than maverick. Can you describe how that book came to be? And as I understand it became the best selling nonfiction book in the history of Brazil, which is saying something. I mean, there are a lot of books I've spent some time in result to it that that's a nontrivial accomplishment. So what does [inaudible] mean?

Speaker 6:          00:22:29       Literally, it means turning your own tables, but it's basically turning the tables with, you're stuck in the middle there to make it more self facing, you know, but it was really about an in Portuguese, it makes a little bit more sense, but it is in the same, in the same thing, which is to say, uh, turning everything upside down and so forth, which was this whole process of starting from scratch and changing the rules entirety. And it was really just, Eh, because let's say from maybe the five, six years after this mass firing, let's say in which we started, uh, redoing things, we started asking questions. And I don't know, it seems a very simple process, but actually when you do it, you realize that potential, which was a whole process of asking three why's in a row. That was the only thing we were doing. And I said, since we're starting this again, tell me again, why do we search people in the way I knew all the people have to arrive at the same time, et cetera. When you ask three why's in a row, the first why people have a very good answer for, they've been thinking about this for a long time or they'd be living this for a long time.

Speaker 6:          00:23:42       Yeah. And so people say, why do people have to be here at the same time? And they'll look at you and say, Oh poor kid look a little dense. Let me explain to you, you know, think I guy comes here and the guy next to him on the assembly line is not here. Yes I'm aligned. Does non woo. That's the first, the first set of whys and it just becomes more sophisticated. But they did the same thing to me. It uh, law school, the Harvard Business School, everywhere I heard this same condescending response to, or let me explain it to you. So the first why is the easy one? And I always say that I have five kids in the smallest one is seven. And I always say that when you have the three why's and you asked them, they asked you something, anything, they said that why is this this way?

Speaker 6:          00:24:29       And the first question is why is easy to answer? And then they'll say, but why that? And then you start getting into a little bit of trouble, you know, really, because by the third way you have only one option, which is to buy them an ice cream. And this is what happened to be there. So I'd say, why do we have to come in right time at the same time? Or we say, why were we all dressed the same way wherever you are wearing suits and ties. Oh, you know, so that will look more like your term. Okay, great. Why don't we want to look more like each other? No, because this is the same with almost anything you ask of business rules. There was a reason sometimes somebody who was concerned with something, but it wasn't really essential to what you're trying to do.

Speaker 6:          00:25:13       And so we would say if we can't answer the three whys about anything or about any rule, let's just throw it out and see what's left. And we were left with absolutely nothing, hardly anything of, of really important. And, um, and so we started organizing ourselves around this new way of if you can't justify it, absolutely let's try to do it without, and uh, that went for organization charts and boxes and titles. And you know, when we were asking things like, why can't you just set your own title, choose any title you want, put it on him on a business card. And if the guy who wants to, who's going to buy from you and you put their rather right VP regional sales manager instead of trainee, I don't care as long as he buys from you and trust you and you deliver the product.

Speaker 6:          00:26:08       And off we go. And so we started doing this for everything. And so we threw out the organizations, are we through our drop titles? We said very quickly we started asking questions. Why doesn't everyone know what everyone else makes here? Why can't people set their own salaries and nothing resisted. Three wives in a row. And I met the man I can. Long story short, suddenly the company started doing well and then instead of a hundred people, we had 200 and then 500 and a thousand and in 2000 and then at a point we said, um, when people start to say, oh, you know, you've got to write a book, you know, you've got to tell this story in a book. And I said, no, I don't stop bugging us. But at a certain point in time, I sat down, I said, I think I'll write a book.

Speaker 6:          00:26:48       So I started on a Friday and I ended up down the other Sunday. So I spent nine days riding. And uh, and that was it. And I, it's interesting because I considered that book so belonging to, to, you know, the, the sin air and not to myself that I never corrected any grammatical mistakes. And, and it came to me from the publisher as many times as you surely don't want to correct that you, this is silly what your role here. And there's stuff that I'm not at all proud of anymore. Of course then there's a lot of mistakes. And I said, no, you can't touch it can through them along to anybody. And so what happened was I sent it out, I finished it in ink and it was 900 pages of pen and ink. And I, I took it, I had, I had someone type it and then I send it out to the eight big publishers in Brazil and the eight rejected it.

Speaker 6:          00:27:43       And uh, it didn't take them very long, either eight rejected. And they said, you know, nobody wants to hear anything from Brazilian businessman. You know, they're buying the coker and kill more return and all these guys in their home, nobody wants to hear from resume businessmen. And then one of the guys that talked to me, he said, you know what we could do, we could give this out as a year end gift from the company. Wouldn't that be nice? It's 300 calm. Is there some? And I said, you know, my ego is not small enough for that. I can't do that. And then I found a publisher who was the night and I said, this is not possible. You've got to publish this. This for me and a small version and you can't, you can't lose all that much money and so forth. So finally the guy says, sure, I'll do it.

Speaker 6:          00:28:36       And we had a very interesting discussion about, uh, royalties because he said, or what you get is 10% Reuters and that's how that sounds good. And I said, what if it sells more than 5,000 copies? And so he laughed and said, no. So, okay, 11% anyway, we had this whole, this whole table, because I kept asking, I said, what about 50,000 and then you need almost fall off the table after uni as well as make that 15% anyway, so I got a 20% of a million sales and but what happened was I, I really never thought, of course that I knew what I was doing and I knew this book was very necessary part, but I just wanted at least to get it out there. But apparently it was a bit like a surfboard, you know, that you're sitting there and suddenly the big wave comes the wave.

Speaker 6:          00:29:28       I didn't make, you know, there people were apparently ready to think about a different way of doing things. And so they took, they took the book forward in it. Nothing happened at all because he put the book out, there was no publicity, there was nothing in about week later somebody found it and then somebody wrote a review and then it's spend 200 weeks on the bestseller list of which 150 weeks a number when it was very simple. It's just when Mt Martha and apparently it hit, it had um, uh, a moment, a nerve, a time in which it went off on its own. But so that's a long winded response to, it's called turning the tables because of this whole turning things upside down and finding out that it works just as well. And in our case a lot better.

Speaker 4:          00:30:17       A couple while I'll have a million followup questions, but I have a few that are related to, we've talked about so far. So the first is, and this might seem super specific, but what is, what is the right way to fire someone or how, how would you go about firing someone now or to those entrepreneurs listening? So of course you had your approach when you first came into the company, but how, how has that changed or evolved over time? What is, what is the right way to fire someone if you need to let someone go?

Speaker 6:          00:30:51       You know, sometimes my, my wife says that, you know, it's, it's so nice being fired by you that I keep thinking this was a very positive thing and I see all these people getting up here after you aside. I really have to find this person. Then they get up and they're smiling and they're patting me on the back and I said, what the hell are you doing with his firing process? But the fact is this, that um, one when, when you get close to it, some people are surprised, but most people have an inkling already that things are not doing well. Um, I have this, this, uh, if someone's working close to me, and that's the only situation of course where there's firing situation, but persons working close to me and it's not, it's not going places early on. I do very little of that.

Speaker 6:          00:31:36       Let's do this again, let's do another and another chance, another way, another cycle, et cetera. So it's highly, highly intuitive. And so to me, if it doesn't show right, it's not good for the person or for me to continue. And so I'll sit the personality and say, this isn't working. And for many respects the personal, so I didn't realize or I didn't think so, not wait a second, what this and that, but um, it's all about being very, very exceedingly frank and saying, you know, and most of the time it's a situation which I say, you can definitely count on good references. Let me see if I can help you. Let's think about where you could go from here instead of that. And mostly I think that that's the bit of white people in the end don't feel so bad about it is because I look forward a bit of a few months or a few years in a city, you're going to be stuck here. I want this from you. You're not, you're obviously, this isn't a fitting your profile entirely and you're going to keep adding, keep adding to that. But slowly we're going to start the abrasion. We'll sit in, you know, and I'll be

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       more ill humored about this or you'll find that getting up on Monday morning and coming to do this isn't as fun as it used to be. Well let's cut all this at the rule and gives you a real chance of finding something that, that makes you a lot happier. And, and normally I'll say this, this is in here. It makes me seem like something you'd do well, but let me tell you this, this doesn't work but this, that you're good at, you should be able to find a way to do that. And normally it ends relatively well because it is so based on, on transparency, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:33:11       Definitely. And when you subject these conventions to the three whys and everything falls apart or it just isn't justifiable. So now you're effectively dealing with a blank canvas. How do you choose what to do first? Or if somebody does this in a company, is there particular order you might suggest that they tackle things in if they're just left with all of these rules from all the way from say, marketing to finance to hiring to fill in the blank have have fallen by the wayside because they can't be justified. Where do you start? Because I could see a lot of people feeling scattered or becoming scattered. How do you choose or how did you choose what to do first, second, third.

Speaker 5:          00:33:59       You know when, when you, when you think Tim about what you write about and what inspires you. When are you going to the issue of a Workweek, a chef for a workout or how to live a life wisely. You're basically concentrated on process. The process by which you do all of this is the one that makes sense. So I would definitely start by the process that takes us out of bed. You know, the bit that makes you get up and go somewhere to do something, that that process is the first one that needs to be changed. So, um, how often do you want to work? How many hours do you want to work? Who you want to work with in what place you want to work? That is the one that to me would be the number one issue because if you have people in your company, organization, wherever you are that are doing this because you told them to or somebody told them to her, it's always been done that way.

Speaker 5:          00:34:55       Or people aren't stopping to think about why the heck should I take the subway and a bus and go to a place downtown and so forth. This is the stuff that is undermining your whole opportunity to have the right process. So I would always start with do, is this really what you want to do? Oh yeah, I love doing okay, but you love doing it at this time of the day? No, not really. Actually. If I could take my kids school person, right. This is the stuff that I would take off, you know, what are the, what's the stuff that you're doing or how you're doing it, which somebody asks for or somebody thought was going to be smart or was a good idea four years ago. This is the date,

Speaker 4:          00:35:37       I'm sorry to interrupt and this is something you would ask of every employee.

Speaker 5:          00:35:41       Yeah. And, and we did of course. And so we ended up of course, was people who didn't want to come at the same time, who didn't want to work there anymore. We went from one one building, which was when we started asking this question, we had one central building and everybody came to us and this was the obvious solution. Um, within maybe a year, year and a half, we had 14 different places around Tom. And so we would say go to the place that's nearest your house or near as the customer you want to visit or to uncle anywhere. Uh, but don't even tell us because we don't want to have anyone who keeps tabs on you because your process of how you want to do this is the most important thing. And let's negotiate you and us. Let's contract for something you're going to do. Are you gonna sell 56 widgets a week?

Speaker 5:          00:36:27       Oh, great. So if you sell 56 widgets on Wednesday, please go to the beach on Thursday and Friday. Do not show up and sell more widgets because you're going to create an enormous problem for engineering and manufacturing and consumer has to go out and buy another company. And under those don't do this before we thought it through your six 56 which where you're going to do it from how you did it is none of our concern. Don't tell us, just tell the 56 witches now will always be fine. And this is true for everything else is true for accounting, as for marketing and so forth. And so the process of how you're going to do this isn't necessarily yours and we don't want to be in the way. So here are 14 different places you can go to, few wants, you can stay in bed, we don't care. Don't tell us how many hours you worked or how hard it was still the widgets. Cause we don't have any place to put that information that that was the, the whole focus on process.

Speaker 4:          00:37:21       And when you're asking why not a, B, and c, right. And when you're, when you're testing these assumptions, are there any particular notable failures that come to mind with tests that you performed?

Speaker 5:          00:37:36       Oh yeah. And, and I, I can, I can think of a few and I'll tell you she'll, but the main thing is that the enormous amount of mistakes that one makes in organizations with your wife, with your kids at the church in a group battalion and so forth, is so humongous that you have to consider a bit, you know, the, the Babe Ruth permutation that if you just hit more home runs than you miss the ball. But can you think, how many times does it miss them all? And here we have very little in general. We have very little patience for these mistakes. And, and my thing is really to brush aside the mistake and say, hey, that's great. That was wrong. Let's try this again now for a wrong again and again and again. That's, that's really no problem. We just have to be batting in the right direction.

Speaker 5:          00:38:25       So there's a lot of things that we started that we thought was, was really smart. You know, we figured all this out. Um, and for we, with the, with the whole search thing, that was a very big issue because we had, um, we had all these electronic components, we had all kinds of stuff, which people said, just crazy. People take this in their purses and in their hair and so forth. And we said, it doesn't matter on the way out. And I'm going back here 35 years, and it was open. This is, this was a big issue because everyone kept checking the stocks and there was those always something missing from inventory. And this was all very expensive stuff, which was easy to take. We worked, you know, in the motors were all copper wires in and there was silver this. And then there was, uh, components and so forth.

Speaker 5:          00:39:19       And, um, and I was saying, you know, the process here is that I cannot work with people that I, I interact with and we try to do things together with, I have empathy with, and then I search on their way out to find out whether they're stealing from me that it's just not possible. It can't be done. And so for some time that didn't work at all because, uh, slowly are, we had a lot of inventory problems and, uh, uh, the amount of losses that we had in the months following was obvious and people would look at us, let's see here. Silly. I, you know, it's getting worse. And My, my reaction to that at that point was, do we, do we keep this inventory, uh, safe and the locked up and people have to requisition. Yes, yes. Okay, well let's give up that process as well.

Speaker 5:          00:40:09       And just leave the store is completely open. The inventory and anybody can take anything. And then for the first time we had to decrease until the problem went away because, because the whole process was, if we're showing you here in there that we don't trust you and sign this and lock this in and so forth, and then we're just making sure you don't steal. It's a crazy situation. It's always a very small minority of people. And as we put the process in place, people started saying through a form where they would, it would come together at a meeting and decide who they needed in their air for the next six months and slowly the system expelled the people who were just stealing. And, uh, I dunno what happened over the years who've stayed in these 35 years of people's stolen more or less, etc. It, we don't measure it.

Speaker 5:          00:40:58       We have no idea. We've never had any idea, but it's never become an issue big enough to worry about since, you know. And so what I meant to say was that we make a lot, we made a lot of mistakes in every one of these processes. When we started telling people on the assembly line, they take good time, could come anytime they wanted. They could leave their kids at school, they could stay longer in bed. Of course for a time the sandwich line suffered and we didn't deliver some products and people were pulling their hairs out. But then a few weeks later suddenly these people realize. Then they'd say, well wait a second, you're not here. This is a seminar

Speaker 6:          00:41:34       I was going to move. So what time you think you're getting here tomorrow? And a whole new schedule started coming into place. So I'd say ultimately if the process decision is to to trust people to believe in people as people, the issues go away with time and they just look like mistakes in the short term.

Speaker 4:          00:41:52       I think this is actually a good place to perhaps tie this to folks who are listening who have say smaller companies. So let's just say they have fewer than 10 employees. A lot of people listening to this are entrepreneurs. They might be Solo preneurs who were doing their first hiring or people with small groups, small teams. What are some experiments, uh, or questions or any type of assumption busting that you might suggest they test for themselves? Is the, are there any, are there any good starting points for people who have processes in place but they're small teams, relatively flexible but very, very resource constrained. Uh, w well, where might they start in terms of, of, of testing?

Speaker 6:          00:42:44       I think I'm doing your first urge is to become organized. Are, are a great place because, um, when you have the two, three and you're in your backyard or and go Raj and suddenly something seems viable and you're writing cold or you're put together a small object which suddenly has shop wants, um, you're, you're in your most primitive creative stage. It's not dutiful and romantic and shine dot coastal all around it or thorough. It's really, um, your first urge. When you, when you start going places slowly and you start realizing that people are interested or there's more volume, more expansion possible, that's when you start looking around and say, whoops, I need more people. But very soon after, and you might have eight or in your mind have 12, and then suddenly you say, oops, no, wait a and this, we're going to go, we're going to become bigger.

Speaker 6:          00:43:43       I need to get organized. I think this is probably the single riskiest point because it doesn't seem like such a big assumption. You might ask someone who supposedly knows or you'll spend some time on the web looking at literature of organization and then suddenly you're stuck in a world which starts a scribing in prescribing and describing how you should be doing things. Um, and I think that that is the original sin, let's say, of organizations. And so I would say resisting the rationale that is being handed down to you, that you would need to get organized and I think is much more valuable than it sounds. And people look at that and said, well, wait a second. I don't have the this and I

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       don't have a software that does that. And if I don't give my payroll to that, I'll never know when this will be wrong and so forth. And you find that the, the stuff, let's say the bureaucracy that that has to be dealt with is nothing like the creative effort of communicating and dealing with people and giving them freedom. And slowly you find that as you grow from eight to 12 to 14 years, just they say, oh, wait a second before we could do this. But now I'm, I'm, I'm not able to just hire somebody or agree and contract for something. I need to know what they're doing. And I think that when you start asking, why do you need to know all, because if, I don't know, I can't, um, following them on slack, but I don't really understand what they're doing. I don't know where they really come in.

Speaker 5:          00:45:18       I don't know if they're working harder or less than someone else where they should be making that. And maybe the answer to all of this is it doesn't matter. You know, this or not. If you get down to the very, very few things that really mattered to you being unorganized, a parent, which is not knowing a lot of this stuff becomes completely irrelevant. I've had now in the last two years, Tim, I've been dealing with kids, you know, 25 year old, 28 year old, 32 year olds who have, uh, oh, I've started businesses with, um, one, one of the businesses, which is a, in Holland for example, these guys started this business and I have some, uh, minority partners and have some equity partners, et Cetera, who I have never met. I've never met personally. I've never met on Skype. I have a few people who went to, who was, let's say, CEO of a startup, et cetera.

Speaker 5:          00:46:14       And I have not the slightest idea what it looks like, trees tall or short. I haven't very generic idea of age and so forth. And one of these people the other day I was, I set up time to talk to and they said, oh, the time's not very good. And I said, why not? Oh, because I live in Australia. And I said, what? So, eh? And I said, well, how the hell did I know that said, you're never asked where there. And so this, this whole process is now I think one in which I would highly recommend to people that they do not fall into the trap of saying, I need to get organized. I need to know all of this. Because the essence of what people are trying to do with their lives, their businesses and the organizations, they really don't require the amount of information and communication and structure that you think it needs. You know,

Speaker 4:          00:47:06       w what would you suggest they focus on in instead of that? I'm just in maybe the way to frame it is besides a flipbook focusing excessively on the bureaucracy and putting systems in place, um, what are some of the other most common mistakes that people in smaller companies, and I should say also that we might not, those companies may stay the same size. So they may, let's just say that, you know, 10 person company, they're creating a great product, but they want to scale in revenues, potentially not headcount. Um, so a, either one of the most, some other common mistakes that the people in that position make or be, what should they focus on instead of what might they focus on instead?

Speaker 5:          00:47:54       I think there's a lot of rationalization and a lot of tricking yourself, you know, because, and I think that's a very dangerous enemy that you don't really realize because whether you're going to grow or not and it's doing well, et Cetera, what happens is that there's a point where you try some of the things that you're, you're testing out there and that you tend to insist very much either on an impulse on intuition or an early result and uh, and you say, this is, this is going to work, this is, that's where the difference between perseverance and self trickery is, is very fragile. It's very delicate. And so I would say that testing impartially, finding a way to test him partially whether what you're doing is, is really worth what you're doing and the way you're doing it, et Cetera, et Cetera, I think is a very difficult one that people sometimes take a heck of a long time to do and then sometimes the businesses there, the money's there, et Cetera, but essentially there, there was nothing really of substance there and it might take you years and years of spinning your wheels to realize it and sometimes when something does not go through in the end you start remembering those small comments or those people who, who were naysayers all along who you were just pushing it out of the weight in order to do what you had to do because you knew it was right.

Speaker 5:          00:49:31       This whole process of really poking at what you're doing, the product or the entity or the time you're taking is a, is a disheartening process most of the time because very few things really are, are feasible and most of the things will run for a while. And I think that if you could poke at that early on and be excessively, um, transparent and humble about whether that that exists really as an opportunity, I think that would be the, by far the most valuable thing you could do,

Speaker 4:          00:50:03       which you've, which of your books would you suggest say that's small organization entrepreneurs start with and which books besides your own have you gifted the most to other people?

Speaker 5:          00:50:19       You know, the, the, the one that you mentioned, the, the seven day weekend is, it is a good place to, as with many other books is it is a good place to poke around also inside your own head and to look for some insights. You know, in the end, when I, when I, when I wrote the book originally, um, in and Brazil was, was still a relatively closed at elite environment for business people, et Cetera. So obviously because the book has sold a good quantity, most people had read it and I was kept giving autographs to taxi driver. It was a very, very, a very small microcosm was living in. But I remember the second occasion that has happened to me, which was being stopped on the street and somebody saying, you know, I read your book and it changed my life. And they would go off and quote somebody else's book in time when this happened the second time I said, shit, this is, this is not about me at all.

Speaker 5:          00:51:21       You know, this is, um, so let me stop right here. Because, and of course at that point, there was all kinds of campaigns for me to run for mayor and for president and become Brazil's Trump, you know, because this is, people get lost along the way and they start believing in their own bullshit, you know? And, and the interesting thing here was about going back to the issue of the book was that, uh, it's when you, when you come across an insight, which was already yours, and you see it in writing, that's when you say, this book changed my life. You know, but really insights where you go there and you said, Geez, I never thought of that. And there is some of that it has to add to something that you believe in or that jives with your moment and so forth. So I think that I'm putting too much weight and too much importance on something that you got out of summer.

Speaker 5:          00:52:12       I got an insight, doesn't remind us that this intuition and this since I was growing inside you already, we're just waiting for some clarification of it, but that kind of answers the second bit, which is I, I taught for for several years at the Sloan school at Mit and I had a group of Mbas and as long as a very fun group and I used to go there, um, in the fall quarter and, um, and, and I, I'd tell them, look, this is what you have to read to understand business and organizations. And so far it's time and I was of to make this available on the MIT side anyway and so forth. And then the books that were there were Marco polos travel, one book, uh, uh, CAFCA parable, um, a, a yoga book on synchronicity and so forth. And so these, these kinds of books and calf guy think is extraordinary.

Speaker 5:          00:53:16       Um, these kind of books I think give you an enormous insight into the people who are doing things or why they're doing things. Um, rather than the whole set of how to, you know, and when you, when you run away from the how tos into the issue of how you get to real wisdom. You know, we've been at this for a long time. We've been in this agriculture and then we were in the industrial area and then we were in the information age and we were in the knowledge age, but we don't get any closer to the age of wisdom. And something is terribly wrong for population. And then the humanity has been around for so long and doesn't get closer to wisdom. You know, when you think about organizations and you ask you to show me one democratic organization or business environment in the world, or to find one wise company as a company, et Cetera, these are all almost impossible to find.

Speaker 5:          00:54:14       So answering your question, I would say that the books that stopped to think about, why the heck do we do the things that we do, which are in calf car and Freud or in younger and thorough. I think that those will answer at business world much closer than people think when they say, okay, that's all very good and well, but that's all philosophy and that's all airy fairy and touchy feely. But I need to get down to answer this, how come, which people how until Friday. But this process I think is much, much stronger from a philosophical point of what, what makes you want to get up in the morning, uh, and how you let the other people around you do what they want to do, how they want to do it and get out of their way. And then that is a philosophical issue that I think would solve a lot more issues of people went from that filter on, which, you know, definitely.

Speaker 5:          00:55:11       Do you have any particular books or writing of Kafka that, uh, that come to mind that you would recommend? Yeah, there's one that I used always there, which was, uh, which was wonderful. It's a collection of parables. There's only one and there's a set of parents, but one of them is especially interesting is called before the law number four. The law is only three pages long. And I used to, I used to sit on top of this teacher's desk there in Cambridge and read this to the, to the kids, you know, the NBA kits. And this was really interesting because I really felt like I was reading to my small kids and I'd sit there and say, let me read this to you. But the fact is it's only two and a half pages long, but it just, it just tells a story of a guy who sits in front of a door, which is open and has this big guy who is guarding the door and he's cost sack and he's closed this big for Colton is enormous and he's scary.

Speaker 5:          00:56:11       And the guy asks him, um, uh, whether he can go in and he says, sure, you can go into the doors open, but don't forget to further on there's another door with a guy who is scarier than I. And then another door and support. And then the guy says, well, wait, I think I was just waiting a bit here. And, uh, this goes on and on until this guy's getting older and older and older. And then finally when he's about to die, he's lying there on the floor. And then the guy, the guard bends down and he says, um, uh, and he asks the guard and he said, now that I'm about to die and I have no more forces to go through anyway, uh, what is beyond that door? What's going to happen to the guard? Says, well, this store, it was only for you and since you are now going to die, I'm going to close it. Okay. And it's a wonderful, a wonderful exercise in realizing that each, for these doors that you did not go through, we're only for you. Okay. And everything that we're comparing ourselves to all the time and the size of our businesses and the health of the, the wealth of that and how good our family is and how good our life is. Whereas happiness, whereas wisdom, et Cetera, it all really answers this one issue that this store is there only for you when, if you don't cross it, uh, it'll close when you die, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:57:30       No, I, uh, I've been struck with how much I was a nonfiction purist for a really, really long time and was fortunate to have a few people intervene. And the amount that I've taken from books like Dune or Zorba, the Greek and since they're told in a narrative form, have actually stuck compared to say, the dryer in some cases. Nonfiction has just been extremely eye opening and liberating for me. I want to ask about, or this is really a question from a fan. So a Philippe Moist, I don't know how to pronounce his name, but this is, this is a part of his question. Uh, so he needs, is referring to you. He wants it. He made a big fire in his backyard and burned every article, book, interview, everything he had done as a symbol to not look back. Has this been done again? And how is his relationship to the past? So it, could you elaborate on this? I don't know if it's accurate or not, but uh, if, if you could comment on that, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Speaker 5:          00:58:32       Yeah. That was when I turned 50, so I'm 57 now. So when I turned 50, um, I looked at my, why Britain, I looked around me and so forth and I said, shit, there's a lot of stuff on me here. You know, I have my books and all these languages, 38 languages. I have a thousand articles, I have DVDs, I have cds, I have even, you know, of course the video, cause I don't even know I would play that. But I had it and I said, there's something wrong with this stuff, you know, one, um, I don't need it anymore for my ego. I think I'm all set or I need to figure it out what my therapist but not here. And two, I have these five kids, you know, we're going to run around a and suddenly they're going to find that I'm larger than life and people are going to say, well, are you going to follow your own?

Speaker 5:          00:59:20       Are you going to run your dad's company or going to? And I said, that's a terrible imposition to make on them, you know? And so, um, I thought there were two things holding me back. One of them was that if I remember that I did this and I did that and I have this and I have that award and I have to have that, um, I have a very wrong sense of very superficial sense of, of who I am. So I thought that if I get rid of all this stuff, I'm also, um, a a lighter for the, the, the trip that's in front of me and that I can look good things from scratch and say, let's forget all that. What, what would I do now and how do I kind of zero based my life from Huron? And two, I didn't want these kids to be burdened by the idea that your dad this year, that that.

Speaker 5:          01:00:07       So, um, what we did was we just started a bonfire in the backyard and it took us about five or six hours to burn everything. We were just burned 100%. And so just like your SD, this is in Sao Paulo or where were you? I live up in the mall. Just wondering what your neighbors thought. Okay. Yeah, they didn't call the, the, the fireman. So we just spent hours, Bernie on this time and it takes a hell of a lot longer than I thought it did. And, and VHS tapes don't burn very well and a lot of black smoke. So we get hours of this. And so it's now been seven years since there is no shred of anything of mine in the house anywhere in that respect. And the good part about it is, is my five kids, they really don't have the slightest idea what I do.

Speaker 5:          01:00:56       And, uh, and if you ask them, someone might say, I'm a writer, or some might say I don't do very much. And I'm like, I've never taken them to a company. I've never told them that one day this could be yours. And, um, so they, it never entered their mind that they know that we have money because they couldn't look around. But they've also learned from the very beginning that they, they've gone to public school with kids who have nothing whatsoever at all along. They go to the house of these kids were very, um, humble and they've just learned to accept that there's luck. There is luck when you bought it. You're, you're, you're, you're born in a family that has money. There's other things that are talent and the kid plays soccer 10 times better than you. And if they've found that there are other variations, but the one of, uh, your father's this or that, that one they'd, they've never caught up on. And so that was the whole rationale back there. And I'm very happy that I did it. Now I don't need to, every seven years do anything because of course, nothing else comes in. Anything I get, uh, we, we throw out as it comes in, anything that has my name or is it about me or is from you, etc. We just, we don't keep it. And that way it keeps relatively clean. I want to come back to the parable and the door and the door's being yours and yours alone. This trap that

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       some people fall into in terms of comparison and keeping up with the Joneses. And just as context for people, I live in silicon valley, for those who don't know and irregularly interact with people who might have net worths of hundreds of millions of dollars who are miserable because the other person with hundreds of millions or maybe billions has a larger jet than they do or something like that. And I'm looking at various right yachts or fill in the blank pissing contest. And I'm looking at the notes that I made. I must have been in 2003 in the seven day weekend. So we have, I'll just give you a couple of samples. One 68 find talent than opportunity, not job description. Then talent 71 the reason for work, one oh four Max personal wealth is 12 million. That's what I'm going to dig into in a second one 23 no more than six month business plan or or a six month plans versus long term plans.

Speaker 4:          01:03:18       And I have dozens of these, but what I wanted to do is turn to 104 because that uh, I, I'd love to read a small piece of and then just to hear you perhaps elaborate on it and perhaps your thoughts have changed somewhat, uh, to, to hear is just find out whether I actually wrote it myself or not yet. Exactly, exactly. So this is the paperback. This is on one oh four. I have a theory about wealth. My friends just sigh when they hear this. My theory is that the maximum personal wealth is $12 million. And I've done some calculations with economists to bear out this capitalistic and admittedly provocative number, not a cent over 12 million. After that, all millionaires are the same. And then I'm going to jump down and I'm skipping a few paragraphs, but you call this the Davinci constraint. And then the example is a neighbor, a neighbor of mine in Sao Paulo, built a house that reminds me of a South American dictators compound.

Speaker 4:          01:04:10       He may have spent his entire allotment of 12 billion on this house, but now his problem is Leonardo who points out that human cannot possibly feel at ease in such a disproportionate house. Certainly my neighbor can live, they're open at two photographers from design magazines and be admired from afar. But in winter he'll huddle in the tiny TV room on the second floor, withdrawing from the cavernous rooms to seek a more human scale. And then Jay, I'm going to bump down another two paragraphs. And uh, I really, I like this lion a lot, which is collecting money as like a massing. Any other item, by definition, no collector can ever be happy. So I was, I'd love to just hear your thoughts on this and uh, if, if, if they've changed it all because this is something that a or it's a temptation. This is comparison and growth for the sake of growth. More, I need more and more and more. That leads a lot of people to be very miserable. Uh, could you, could you just elaborate on, uh, on this thinking?

Speaker 6:          01:05:07       I think nowadays when you, and this is what this is about, 15 years old or something. Yeah, a little bit less. Um, I think in these, in last decade

Speaker 5:          01:05:17       and a half left, I think that the number of people who have come to realize or to accept the intellectual concept that money doesn't buy happiness and a growing for growth's sake and comparing yourself to everyone else ends badly. And I think about it, people have accepted this as a thought and then something in the back of their mind says, yeah, but you know, if I had a 12 or 20 or $50 million, everything would be a lot easier. And it's only these guys who really have the money, who keep bullshitting about how money is not important. This is the right, this is where, this is how it, how it comes down with after so much, so much time thinking about this. Basically we're in a world post 1989, let's say when the Berlin Wall came down, we're in a world that says, oh, capitalism has won. So there was no such thing anymore as soviets and communists and so forth.

Speaker 5:          01:06:11       This, this stuff we've now proved in the world, has proven that money is the real kingdom of the world, is a monarchy and the king is money. And, uh, of course guys who do this better than other people, uh, have now taken this to new proportions, which is natural. It's just doing more and more and more and more of the same. So if I, if my house were big enough to huddle to 300 people, and these were some of the people from around your house, let's say, and some of the, most of, some of the wealthiest people in the world. And I were to invite them over for dinner and they were to accept, I would have it, my dinner. Uh, the wealth equivalent to half of the population of the world. So I couldn't have in that that dinner, people who have more money than three or three and a half billion people around the world now that is money is king rationale taken to its most logical extent.

Speaker 5:          01:07:12       And uh, and I started asking myself and a task on a Ted talk and it was the line that that got the most reaction from people over time, which was if you're giving back, it's because you've taken too much. And, and, and people are, you know, I have to give back to that. When you think about this and you say, you know, one of your is not your neighbor, he's in Seattle, but let's say the Bill Gates. So, or, or her Warren Buffet, Warren Buffet says, boy, you know, I've been so good at this stuff. You know, that I've now made according to his calculation a few years ago, I now made $30 billion more than I need. Oh, okay. So what am I going to do this, let me give it to people who really need it and so forth with he gave it to Bill Gates, right? Right. This was the, this was the full Russia now and so there's something wrong with people who have a lot of excess money of course, because you're saying let's find someone who's already trampling around Africa and meeting tribes and trying to give money to aids and so forth.

Speaker 5:          01:08:12       But the fact is that once you start, you're caught in this collection mode, which is you'll always find a reason for thinking. You need more of that, but it is taking away from something. It's taking away from your kids or it's taking away from sitting in the backyard and reading another book or it's taking from somewhere. There's no such thing as a, I will work harder for a time and then I will have the money and then we'll, and then everything will be all right because that moment never arrives. And I think people realize that evermore. They just, people in general of course feel that there is a level of comfort that in your mind about your worries about the future and the money's in the mortgages and so forth that will, boy, if you could have that least that it, you'd be okay. This 12 million almost parable rationale was to say, look, let's put at least an upper limit on this at a point where the have a house here in apartment there and something on the beach, on some of the animal and then having an and do anything you want and go to long vacations in Paris.

Speaker 5:          01:09:19       That was at that time that you'd have to bring it up to date, but it was Tom and the doctors did everything. There was nothing you could not do it Tillman from then on, this was an issue of a ego vanity or obsession. It was something else too and it no longer had anything to do with money. On the lower end. You see all these guys who are doing work on finding a happiness levels and serotonin levels and what it takes to be minimally happy. But people are always looking in India at the people who are untouchable and so forth and finding, uh, levels of happiness that are high. And so I think people kind of accept the idea intellectually, but that I think the feeling inside is always okay, but I had only 200 grand more or finally this then everything would be okay.

Speaker 5:          01:10:08       I think that that isn't going away, Tim, in the sense that I don't think humanity is getting wiser and slowly we'll realize, but intellectually was the first step, which I think humanity took and now starts to accept every time more that there's something dramatically wrong with zero 1%. It's not even the 1% but zero 1% having such tremendous, well end this whole amassing wealth because the wealth is going to the smarter guys and the smarter guys are the smarter guys who are able to siphon money, uh, away from everything else into their own pockets. I'm on. It's a very dismal situation. And you come to think about it today. You think about reading and thinking about the past a little bit, Tim, you think about the robber barons like Rockefeller and Carnegie and Vanderbilt. These guys were all a monopoly players. You know, these are the guys who were setting up trusts and almost everything that they did at the time would be illegal today.

Speaker 5:          01:11:04       Now, these barren Roy, these robber barons are people that we somehow or other are very impressed with. You know, we'd love to be today, uh, called to dinner, buy by one of these rubber barons. But is there a dramatic difference today, Tim, when you think about it in the biggest corporations in the world and these people, many of the people who started writing code and doing wonderful things and so forth, which are now all about monopolies and trusts. And, uh, suddenly the guy like Trump says, come to Washington and play with me and everybody says, where's my play? And I'm ready to play. There's something wrong with this whole process because money keeps calling money. And it makes very, uh, very disappointing people out of the ones who've been seeking money as a big issue, money, power and so forth. And you've seen it in all the films you've read it and all the books you've seen it with people, you know, it doesn't end well, but it doesn't stop any of these people giving up other things in favor of that which in a money world and [inaudible] king oriented money world, uh, people seek.

Speaker 5:          01:12:19       And that's the bit that I think most people have found to be silly, but there's still chasing somehow. And that's was the whole bit about the tournament. And how do you use the question, what for when you, when you do the three why's in a row and so forth, you end up with a process questions and um, and they're, they're very good for, um, removing obstacles and things that, that are silly that you do or that you're involved in doing. But, um, it still doesn't answer the, the question that has to do with wisdom and that one is what the hell far am I doing this? And that's a very, very tough one because you could eventually even answered the three whys of for a process or for way of doing things. And you can fix that by asking the three why's in a row.

Speaker 5:          01:13:11       But when you, when you answer, try to answer in your marriage with your kids in the place where you would work at the chorus, you go toward the church that you attend, when you start trying to answer what I'm doing this for, then I think you're, you're getting to the, to the religious and things, but you're also getting into real trouble because that, those are the really difficult ones to ask. There's, there's really, all of us have only one question in the world in our lifetime, and one kid of mine asked me that when he was three, the other one is four and one. We're sitting in a Jacuzzi when he's three and he said that, why do we exist? There's nothing else to ask and there's nothing, there's no other question to ask for the rest of your life. It will never answer it.

Speaker 5:          01:13:59       And so forth. And this issue of what for am I doing this? Why am I waking up in the morning? I go through this and why am I doing, what am I doing a podcast for? What good is this going to do? And going further because you'll say, oh, because you know, I want to help people and I want all these people to make their lives better as you know. Okay. But what for? Oh, you know, so that the humanity will be better. What for? Oh, what for? Because essentially I cannot live with the idea that I'm not making the world slightly better than it was, uh, when I was born, even though, uh, chances are, and, and statistics tells you this is not the case at all, but I, but for me to feel that way, I need to go do this. So I needed to do the podcast. I need to write a book, I need to speak at need to do all this. But it's not because I hope that people are now driving the car. They'll suddenly stop and get out and skip and jump to the house and say, I've found new ways to do everything in my life and everything we'd better from wrong. But it's about my feeling that I'm, I'm being useless. And so this whole, what four issue is, is used for that as a key to try and answer really why you do the things you do,

Speaker 4:          01:15:19       what people listening. You're very well spoken guy. So they might look at your track record, look at the accolades, listen to you speak and imagine that, uh, you always been confident, always known what to do. Could you share any particular dark, difficult times or time that comes to mind and how you found your way out of that?

Speaker 5:          01:15:44       And on several occasions I've been, let's say, close to the brink of, of things, um, not working to a point of undoing everything. So, uh, a few years after I started was the first time I, I ran into, you know, we rented it to such a financial difficulties. I remembers specifically driving to the plant and thinking what it, what it would take and what it would mean that people have to talk to, to, um, to, to take the company into receivership lists or the company was going broke and what would I do as, and that was to me, the, the, the closest I ever got to the end, let's say, because I was the only, I don't know, 21, 22 and suddenly everything I tried to do was completely wrong or was working. And, uh, we came close to the brink at that point. And so what I found, I think in, in that, and some, some moments later, I've never, we had never come to that same financials to Trish and, uh, anymore.

Speaker 5:          01:16:47       Exactly. But I'd come to that situation looking at a marriage is looking at how I was raising kids, looking at the opportunity to have a much richer life and finding myself stuck in the old traps that I'd set for myself of doing things that I still had to do because I said I was going to do them and trying to, and so this whole process, I think there were many dark moments in which a four in front of let's say, family or business or a wife or, or, or, um, choices for roads were, uh, looking back, I realized either that, uh, it wasn't as dark as I thought it was and I was just scaring myself into things or to that I was, luckily I got through that, that bend in the road, et Cetera. So the answer answers, first of all, no, there's, it's far from easy, even though I've been terribly lucky all along.

Speaker 5:          01:17:50       And so, uh, if, if you say, let me tell me the story of the 10 companies that you started that went bust. That's easy because there's more than 10, uh, the, the amount of people that you've put together to do something that became nothing. The kind of hopes you had four things that you are going to do that went nowhere. You know? And, and I've written plays, I've, I've put on plays and then spent a year in the theater. We're learning all about drama and putting place together and so forth. And I've been lucky enough that most of this stuff kind of wanders off or is reasonably acceptable so that I can move on. And I think that the, the real fears are always when you, you know, somebody calls you and says, Oh, you're the, for example, this two or three weeks ago somebody called me and I, my older kid was snowboarding and he says, I'm calling you from the hospital.

Speaker 5:          01:18:46       We have to operate on your son. You know, things like that where your whole life just kind of falls apart beneath you. You go and do it needs to be done, but you realize how fragile it is to think that you're successful and you have these big houses and you have all these people working for you and so forth. But this stuff is all very, very delicate and very fragile. So I think there was a lot of dark moments in which you realize what, what little it takes for you to kind of lose everything that you were standing on. You know?

Speaker 7:          01:19:17       Are there any, let's say, philosophies or principals that you rely on to handle those situations when you're reminded of how fragile things are or uncertainty strikes or fortune blows in a direction that throws things seemingly off, off balance?

Speaker 5:          01:19:37       Yeah. I have, I have a kind of a nurturing and unwavering belief that we're very, very insignificant and had really no idea what's going on and we're not, we're not given, it's not given to us to understand anything that's really important. You know, any, anything that you say is really, really fundamental in life. We know nothing about, we know nothing about love. We know nothing about, we know know the all the really important things. We don't know. He should take an hour. You'd go to a doctor and you go for a second opinion. That sort of being et cetera. You will always realize that. The first question though, first, why man, do I have this where you have this because you're a nerve on this, the debt, the second when et Cetera, but the third y to any doctor is that we don't know, right? Everything is that we don't know anything that is really important.

Speaker 5:          01:20:30       We don't know. Um, and so my feeling is that because of this, this, uh, insignificance, which is the, let's say, paired with the fact that we're terribly important to ourselves and we're almost a hundred percent of our importance to ourselves. Uh, we're also insignificant any other regard. And we noticed that when, when somebody passes away or when we remember something to, we'd forgotten entirely that this stuff is all becomes dust very quickly. And so my feeling when, when things are darker going badly or is that, um, it doesn't seem reasonable to me. It never seemed reasonable to me to for things to go completely are. And so I, my feeling is that, I'm sorry to go completely one Ari. I mean going completely wrong, are going completely south and you know, and my feeling there Tim, is that, you know, if you're, if you're really not spending most of your time, I'm tricking people into things and finding uh, ways on the side to make things work or to make money and you're not, um, you're doing your, your basic, uh, humanity is basic in place.

Speaker 5:          01:21:42       My feeling is that you'll be alright, you'll be alright. And I think that's what carries me through in the end. Now, it's not religious, it's not structured in any form, but it's this kind of feeling that you don't have to do all that much just to Plod along without, um, without being, um, I'd say it's not even a naive, you know, so the whole rationale of every time we have these small, the choices, the whole day long and by week and month and years as we don't buy, it's very easy to differentiate between that which is a little bit less self serving and that which is, um, which is only for your own good. And if you make enough of these choices along, I think that at these dark moments where it is moments of enormous risk, it's kind of like a destiny or an, uh, a balanced that is in place and that takes care of you somehow. You know?

Speaker 7:          01:22:43       So on a semi related notes, is there any particular, uh, challenge or goal that you're facing right now? You could choose any personal or professional that you could describe and how you're, how you're tackling it, how you're going about it.

Speaker 5:          01:23:01       The other day I told my wife, I think I said this at a talk or something that I'm, that I'm facing an empty bucket list, you know, and, and my empty bucket list is all about saying this, that, um, you know, my family has all, everyone in my trauma had melanoma. I had a former, very drastic cancer, which is very quick. And, um, and I don't know, 15, 20 years ago I was already a scanned and they told me it's a time where we did that on a hundred percent chance of melanoma and cancer. And I've actually had it two, three times and then in the meantime, but if you, if you watch out for it, of course you can be quick and remove it. And I just had surgery again about three, four months ago, found a new one and it, there's nothing to it really.

Speaker 5:          01:23:54       You, you identify, you know what it looks like. You go there, you have it removed and off you go. But I kept thinking, uh, you know, sitting in front of my, my oncologist, my cancer doctor looking at me and saying, well, Ricardo, this time it went, you didn't see it. It was on there in your back and you have three months left or six months. And it happened to my parents and two people to others before them. And I kept thinking she's, I don't want to be in that situation where suddenly now I have to go to ball games with the kids and now I have to travel to places. I haven't been enough to write that play, which I know we're rolling. So that's crazy. So this is just something else. And that's when I started what my wife doesn't like, the name I give, but on Mondays and Thursdays I have what I call terminal days and terminal days are the two days a week in which, um, um, my schedule is always completely clear.

Speaker 5:          01:24:48       I have nothing. And I do on those days what I would've done had I heard this conversation from my oncologist. And so I've been doing this for quite awhile. And so my weekends are with the kids and family and so forth. And Mondays and Thursdays I only do what it is I would do if I had just recently learned that I had a terminal disease and sounds dark. But it isn't really because it's just all about the freedom that you've just gained and these days that you've just gotten back, um, to do whatever you want to do, the way you do it, and trying to answer to yourself what you really want to do. Because in the beginning you, you have these long lists of things you would do if you had the free time, but it's not, not really true. So I'd read all these books which are sitting there and I hadn't read, I listened to all this music, which I hadn't, but you do this for an hour or two or three, but then it gets old as well.

Speaker 5:          01:25:41       And there's a reason why you didn't do enough of it before, but it sounds like you'll be able to do this for hours on end, but you won't. And so if you're healthy and you're in good shape and so forth, and you have your entire day ahead of you and nothing to do, you start answering very, very interesting questions about what, what you really want and what really moves. So it's still going back to answer your question, the fact is that I've, uh, I'm not left with goals and I'm left with a whole set of wonderful processes that I love and I'd love to do again and again, but I no longer need or want to do something that I can measure. The metrics I think have gone away. Um, this, this process of doing what I want with the people I love that I'm on, that's entirely a process on its own.

Speaker 5:          01:26:36       It's a goal on its own. And so there, there's no longer, I have no wishes for things that I could buy with money. Uh, you know, my kids and my wife are constantly frustrated by the fact that there's nothing that they can buy me. Um, you know, because it's, it's gotten to that point where, Eh, I don't, I don't need it or don't want it or it doesn't, doesn't tickle my fancy and so forth. So I'm not left with metrics saying I'd love to have another this or the money. I've, I've been doing math now I think Tim, on my personal finances for 30 something years or more, 40 years on the same rationale, which is how much do I need to have enabled to lead the life that I do? And Swiss bankers used to say that you need to have 20 times more than you spend per year.

Speaker 5:          01:27:26       And it kind of, as a rule of thumb, that's not bad, you know, because that, that says you need about a 5% return on my knees. You have. So if your lifestyle costs too, and you say, it takes me $5,000 a month to live minimally the way I want that 60,000. And so you need the assets in the value of a million to house plus money, whatever. So, because I've been always starting from what it is that I need minimally to have fun and to do the many fun things that you can do with money. Um, uh, I just multiply that by 20. If it, if it's over 20, I don't worry anymore. And I, I, thankfully I haven't worked for a while, but if I looked at the opportunities that boy, if I did this and I put these two companies together and that I would have, uh, something else. If it's going to take away one of my Mondays or Thursdays are going to take one of the Times or many of the times I can't pick up my kids from school, etc. It's certainly a bad deal no matter how much money or what, what metric it is, you know?

Speaker 7:          01:28:31       Definitely. Well, I mean the non renewable resource being that time, and I'd love to hear some details because I'm grappling with some of these issues and structuring. Structuring is too formal a word, but I had a very good 2016 and I think it was in part because I had so much slack in the system, uh, to do deep work and to enjoy and savor certain things. And 2017 because of the book launch few months ago or six weeks ago has just come crashing in with a lot of inbound as most of which is noise. So I'm thinking a lot about this. What are some of the processes that you love and could you walk us through maybe a a Monday or Thursday that comes to mind and what that, what that looks like?

Speaker 5:          01:29:21       Yeah, and going from back to front, um, I've been, you know, writing a book in my head now for the last two, three years and I'm just scared of putting it out there because you are then caught in a vortex of your own making, you know, Andy, right? You get a publisher and then you, you kind of, you kind of sell them the idea that you're, you'll be there and they're kind of saying that I'm going to do this, but if I need you for the today show, you're going to be there. Right? And, and you're kind of, yeah, I'll try. And so what about the fact is that didn't really, one, you never really want to take on the whole, uh, wait of proving yourself, doing your thing and satisfying all the cosponsors sponsors of your effort. Right? And so there's the book launch and there's right, and there's no end, of course, it, it doesn't end that quickly because you trick yourself into thinking this is six months and then it will be okay. But we know it's not because I just had, for example, I got, uh, yesterday, I just got my two copies of the, um, Chinese edition of my book of, uh, 1993. So it takes a little bit.

Speaker 5:          01:30:39       That happened, right? So, you know, I got the, the Czech Republic edition of the seven day weekend, about a month ago. So this stuff just had takes on a life of its own. And then every time a request comes for your time, you, you stutter, you know, you say, well, you know, I don't really want to take this slide and go this way and do news. But on the other hand, you know, I kind of have a responsibility to do that. And it's, it's a little bit like the little prince, you know, the, the French book by science who could, is sentenced to spirity, which says that you are responsible for everything that you captivate, you know, and so you kind of feel that, uh, war, why did I write the book from first place if I wrote it in the first place? And it means that I should go to the syndicated radio show because that'll sell more books and more people will be happy and I'll feel better on and on.

Speaker 5:          01:31:34       And you're caught with metrics because somebody will say, so to him, how many people listen to your [inaudible] minion or this, and I'm number 13 are on number 11 and under six. And people have caught you up in their vortex of metrics as well. And until something happens, you retire, you die and so forth, and it goes away because you're a non contender from there on and then it's perfectly all right. And then you'll have to think, who the hell is going to remember that 20 years from now or 40 years from now? And and so, so you're left with the issue of what am I doing this for? So my, my answer to all of this, because if you take this to its ultimate consequence, you could easily be in a situation where you say, I do nothing anymore because nothing is worth it because nothing will reply to the issue of metrics.

Speaker 5:          01:32:23       Nothing will satisfy me enough. Nothing is really worth it if we are these useless specks of dust on the, in the universe. And so I don't, I don't take it to that Russian now because we are 100% of ourselves in terms of importance at the same time. Um, and so you, you can be worried about the state of nations and poverty and, uh, immigration policies. But if there's a speck of dust in your high, you're going to spend the next hour and a half only dealing with that. There's nothing else of any importance in the world while there's a speck in your eye and your eyes watery. And so what it meant by this is that on Mondays and Thursdays, let's say I stopped the thing, I wake up and one of the first things I do is, is a lounge in bed. Meaning I, uh, I, I haven't had an alarm clock I think for, for 15 or 20 years, but I, I say I will not get out of bed.

Speaker 5:          01:33:18       And of course that doesn't last very long, but the feeling is good. And then, um, I'm with the kids as a fourth end and suddenly they get into the van and mine, they're, and suddenly everything is quiet. Um, in one second. And then I start asking myself, so what I wanted to do, I, I could read the paper, but I don't really want to read the paper. And the news is this and that. I could read that book, but now I'm halfway there and you're stuck. I think many times with the issue that we keep ourselves busy and we have all of these distractions and attractions and things going at such a rate that when you actually turn off all the noise and say, which of these things where I really want to do, um, you, you have much more trouble than you thought you did.

Speaker 5:          01:34:05       And so when we put that book out there or as you did and you have requests and you have opportunities, you really just kind of measure the opportunities of what to do against each other. So you know, in that, in that sense, it's a bit like cafca again, you know, definitely. Um, that, that door's open just for you, but you say, you know, what a, is it better to go talk to these guys in Denver or to do this thing in London? You know, but the real question was, what the hell for am I doing either of these? And I think you'll end up with the, with the reply that the things that you can look back on. You said that was a good one, two hours, three hours of my life because I either shared something, I learned something. Um, I, it felt good.

Speaker 5:          01:34:55       These are all wonderful responses. I, you know, or you went to the baseball game, you're done losing two hours of your life. That's a wonderful way to spend those two hours if you love baseball and or not. And so, um, it, it's not about nothingness or undoing yourself or considering yourself worthless and therefore it's not worth doing anything. Um, and, but it is especially about not comparing the opportunities with each other and rather compare them. What would I do if I had the whole day off? The best feeling I have in my, in my time is never the Monday and Thursday, which I do love when I get up m and bed thinking today I have nothing to do. It is on that Tuesday or on that Friday when I have something set, a conference call or a visit or something and that gets canceled. That's my most wonderful moment is always when I have stuff to do and somebody cancels. It has an enormous sense of relief no matter how important it was or which I was looking forward to. It said when somebody cancels something, I feel elated, you know? And so I think that kind of answers a bit as well. No,

Speaker 4:          01:36:03       no it does. And I mean, I'd love to uncover some of the, some of the quirks I had. Somebody asked me a question a few days ago that I thought was a good question. We'll find out. It may be, it may fall flat, but he asked me, what are, what are some of absurd things that you like doing or love doing? What are some absurd things that you love doing? Does anything come to mind for you? When I asked that question,

Speaker 5:          01:36:28       um, I have, I have all these old, old, old line habits. One of them comes from Winston Churchill, which is to sit in a bathtub with a lit cigar. I'm sure it'll pass a lot of people's tests of absurdity. But, um, so sometimes I'll say, you know, now I will do nothing and I will sit in about for an hour, hour and a half with it, with a very long cigar and sync like Winston Churchill. And I always remember this especially well because Churchill was a guy who was even in power and to an extent as happened to Fdr as well when he had his polio thing in Florida. But I'm, Winston Churchill would go off a bit before Christmas and take a ship to Egypt where he would go to the same winter palace hotel in sir. And he would spend 65 days there a while he was running the country. And so I think we, we give ourselves an enormous amount of importance and to our time. And I think doing absurd things interrelated to wasting time, I think are a wonderful way to remind ourselves that we're neither that important or that nes, her or none of that much happens when you do absurd things with your time. And I think purposely looking like you're wasting it, I think is in an absurdly wonderful thing to do.

Speaker 7:          01:38:04       Do you know, people looking from the outside in, uh, many people will be very impressed with your ability to experiment and to test and to have failures, but also have these successes in home runs. Do you think about risk differently than other people or how do you think about risk? I think that that word is a scary word to a lot of people and they don't really define it for themselves. Um, and so they don't try, but I'd just love to hear your thoughts on risk or perceiving risk, how you think about it. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:38:38       When you, when you try and deconstruct risk, I'd say there, there, there's an objective metric associated with risks. So I'm going to start this business. I'm going to take 32% of my savings and I might lose it all. So that's a kind of metric that I think is less scary because you know that it's 32%, you know, that is, you lose it, you're going to, it's going to be trouble for some time and then some restrictions, et. But it is an outside metric which you are willing to accept. If she'd say, I'm going to take a plane and I know that the statistical risk is zero comments, zero, zero far of this or that, or it'd be coming late then and then a hundred times smaller of the plane falling and I'll, I'll take that risk. That bit I think scares people very little even though they paid bring it up.

Speaker 5:          01:39:30       I think people use it very much was an excuse because the other risk factor is how will I look to myself, to my spouse, to my kids too, my former business partners to micro. Now how would I look if the five flat fall flat on my face? And I think that this element of risk is the one that doesn't bother me almost at all because I think it is so ephemeral. You know, um, you get a bad press or you're getting a bad, uh, opinion from neighbors or your wife has dismayed that you actually did this. I think all this goes away very easily and relatively quickly. It might take a few months. So she, here's where all this goes away. And it's not to say that it's worth doing because if you do succeed, then you will show them all your running or rephrase or EOP happier.

Speaker 5:          01:40:26       Be gratified yourself even because we know that a lot of these apparent successes and apparent things that we call home runs, there are also temporary, right in that sense that you right, you'll do something and the last mile of everything you do is probably what's going to count. This is also an ironic turn on life, which is that you go there and you spend 20, 30 years today. This today, today we had one of our biggest billionaires in Brazil, uh, fall into jail. He was in New York over the weekend and he was arrested and is involved in the corruption charge. And he was the seventh richest man in the world who was by far Brazil's a richest person, is uh, 20, 30 years of an earning successes and one success on top of the other were all wonderful. And uh, he obviously has a genius for business, otherwise he wouldn't have gotten where he got and he has his dark side as well and so forth.

Speaker 5:          01:41:27       So he got to this point, I don't know him personally, I've never met him, but he got to this point where he was this billionaire and he had this enormous projects and he was doing wonderful things. And he had a, on the side you had hobbies and restaurants and yachts and doing things for poor people and on and on and on and on. Now he's in jail. I don't know for how long, maybe maybe even not that long, but the fact is that he has these hair products company and was always very proud of his hair. And you, you know another guy who, who has similar hair and he in jail, the first thing they did was to shave him bald. So you see now, and what I meant to say was, what is success for this guy? You know, it was it the 34 years in which he had yachts and planes and every president and everybody would receive him and you to wonderful things and so forth.

Speaker 5:          01:42:19       Or is it now so tainted by this last image on his health that he will never recover? You know what, I'm, I'm no judgment at all. I'm just saying that when you think about this, who I think about some of the people who were presidents of Brazil, some people who are prisons to the u s who were there at 50 or 60, and their life is over, it's no longer success. It keeps deteriorating as the, as the years go by. You know, you take someone like a, like a planted who has an extraordinary mind, did a lot of good things, but they made a few enormous mistakes with cigars and trainees that you will never recover from. And so what, what is success in that passage? I meant what I meant to say was that your home runs and the businesses you built in the menu haven't framed it is all very, very fragile and it's probably going to be measured with how you handle yourself in a few very few, uh, uh, decisive moments in your life.

Speaker 5:          01:43:21       And, or in the end, you know, the last few things you did are terribly important compared to what you did before. And, uh, or this guy, I could forget his name. Pastorius for pistol Pistorious in South Africa. Yeah. It's tremendous guy, et cetera. Until you kill your girlfriend and then suddenly the, all those other successes don't, don't sit very well. Now can you do your things, have your successes, build up your metrics, et Cetera, and then retire and sit tight for 20, 30 years, enjoying, etc. Probably the feeling inside is that slow your worlds are deteriorating in the sense that your friends are dying, the press no longer interested in you and you become, uh, uh, has been, who still has a few things to, to nail up on the wall or remember jaded photographs of you with someone. Very important, you know? And so I think that the success factor and this metric of how you measure yourself is very, very fragile. And when we stick to it, we stick to something that, uh, won't be there. When we try to hold it in our hands, it has to be held a bit like a bird, you know, as you press it a little bit too hard at that.

Speaker 4:          01:44:35       How do you think of success for yourself then in place of leaning on or depending on the Ephemera and all of these things that can be taken away so easily, uh, or destroyed so easily. How do you, how do you feel at peace with yourself or feel successful? What, what, how do you, what Lens do you use for that?

Speaker 5:          01:45:00       I try to, I try to exchange these lenses of past and future for living in the present, which is the only very difficult thing to do. We talk about it, but nobody knows how to do it. MMM. You know, the James Taylor is set in a song because that, uh, the meaning of life is to enjoy the passing of time and try their best at the time is by far the hardest thing we can ever do in. We take your thought process. We are almost constantly living in the past or in the future. And so success to me is always making sure that this passing of time is worthwhile. That's his past. He knew his time right now that I'm not exchanging it for a hole in the future. I'm not exchanging for um, something I got or had in the past and that you're always kind of ready two survivor to withstand

Speaker 5:          01:45:55       through the use of this wisdom of, of present time, of which I'm, I'm very far still from it, but I just keep hammering it into my own head. This passing of time, if this, uh, podcast and conversation with you was worth it because it made me think because it was saw tool for a sense so far, um, that that is success and that can never be taken away no matter what. Tomorrow I don't have the money or I don't have this sort of things go wrong, God forbid, uh, with, with people. Uh, the fact is that that one hour or two hours, which was spent in the broadcast thinking about licensing and exchanging that, that one was definitely worthwhile and successful and no one can no longer be taken away from you because it's not part and when it becomes part of your history or your past is just building blocks of time that were spent.

Speaker 5:          01:46:48       You know, I had an interesting situation with for a time I was, I was buying much more wine than I should have because I was kind of, I got into the collector's mode about 25, 30 years ago. And so I kept buying at auctions and of course you get into this, uh, thing where you need to have, have that 1959 or otherwise and so forth. And so you'll go crazy at auction, you overpay and so forth. And uh, and one of these days I, Hey, I had a friend over and I, I opened one of these wonderful wines that were extraordinary, extraordinary year and I, I'll be at Ford and so forth. And this stuff can't be used for vinegar was completely spoiled. It was always completely spot when I bought it. It was is already worth nothing whatsoever. And I always thought it was an interesting collection because you, you buy all of this wine that you have all kinds of expectations from and you're learning to say, you know, this has pencil shavings and a bit of mineral that and some marigolds flower in the taste and so far.

Speaker 5:          01:47:52       But you know, there's an enormous amount of bullshit in what you're doing and why you're doing it and so forth. But the interesting part is that once you consume your collectible by drinking the wine, you're left always with 20 cents of glass, which is, and so it's just a way of saying that this whole process of, of wine is it good is a good comparison because, um, one guy told me a few Kitsune what, what, what gets you into your, your seller and makes you take a bottle of wine, which you paid $100 for is now worth $1,000 and drink this and be left with a little bit of glass because you end up probably not even having the courage to drink this wine that now is so, uh, valuable, et Cetera, et cetera. But I, I've always answered that in the following way. If one day I look at my seller and I do now and it's about half empty or more, it is now about half empty. And I think that every time I pulled one of those bottles, it was because I was with friends or because I was feeling good over. This was a great time. This must've been a good life. Looking at those empty holes, you know? And so that's, I think with everything else, if, if you're using that time and you at the end of it, you say, boy, that was a good two hours of this was worth it, then success is, is certainly guaranteed.

Speaker 4:          01:49:17       How did you stop, uh, the collection of wine when you were getting caught up in these auctions and so on? What was the pattern interrupt or the, the, the conversation or the moment when you decided to, to stop doing that?

Speaker 5:          01:49:37       I actually remember it very well. It was very specific. I went to Thailand and, um, and in Thailand I met, this guy was actually Chinese, but he was in Thailand and he was a tomato farmer and he had a mini mills. He had these many steel mills, steel mills, and he was a magnet and he'd made, it was a real tycoon. He'd made enormous amounts of money is set aside. And we were, we went to have dinner with this guy and, um, he was smoking all through the dinner. And I asked him, you know, how many cigarettes? He smokes a day or packs. And he said, no, I light one in bed. And then I lied all the cigarettes with another cigarette. That's why I never did. I never did the math on that, but it can't be very good. But anyway, so he would, he would eat with one hand and he would puff with the other and at no moment to do stop smoking.

Speaker 5:          01:50:29       And, um, then we started talking about, he said that he's has a bit of an obsession for things and so forth. The city collects things. I said, what do you collect? And he said, I collect Mercedes cars. And so you have a lot of these. And he said, yeah, I have a lot of these. I have 111 warehouses, Mercedes. And he said, and I have the mercy of the first Mercedes of 1896, which is a steam Mercedes. And I have all the Mercedes in between. And I said, what do you mean? Every time there is a Mercedes that comes out every year they come out with let's say six models that buy one of each. And when Mercedes needed, uh, Himmler's car and the car that Hitler went into Paris, I lent them the car because I have the car. Okay. And so I was there, obviously stunned at this conversation and all this smoking and I was like, Jesus, what a little do I know about interesting people are free to people around the world.

Speaker 5:          01:51:30       And then I, uh, at one point I said, well, but uh, so what do you, you just keep on collecting? He says that instead of, then of course I have to go, I have to go in a few days I'm going to an auction because there are several Mercedes there, there were a total of 12 Mercedes, which I don't have. And I said to him, now, how much does it bother? Instead of, Oh, I keeps me awake many nights he said, and I keep going at it and I'm going crazy and I work at, I need to have these talk more sense. And at that moment I stopped buying anyone. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:51:59       I don't think I brought a wife since. My God, what a story. Uh, we, we could go for a very long time. I want to be respectful of your time. There's so many things that I'd love to touch on like Lumiar and, and many other areas. But tell me what you think of this. We could do a few rapid fire questions and then maybe if you enjoyed this and everyone enjoys it, which I think they will, we could consider maybe doing, I'll follow up at some point. Uh, I'm certainly happy to stay on and talk about anything you'd like, but I'd, I'd love to ask maybe a few rapid fire questions and then lead people to what you're up to now and where they can, they can find you if that, if that sounds like a plan, but I know we've been on for recording now close two hours. So

Speaker 4:          01:52:45       if, if, if that works for you, we could, we could take that approach, but I'm certainly happy to touch on anything that you'd like to talk about.

Speaker 5:          01:52:53       No, let's do that. And you're, I'm assuming you want rapid fire applies as well, which is not my

Speaker 4:          01:52:58       special, no, the rapid fire questions really just means that I have to stop asking multipart questions with 17 commas. So your answer can be as, as long as you'd like. So I will just keep my questions short. Uh, and I'm certainly not in any rush. Uh, this, uh, number one is what books have you re-read the most yourself?

Speaker 5:          01:53:24       Oh, very. Always go back to, um, two books, one by Carl Young and, and this whole issue of collective unconscious, which is to me a big issue because you either are able to touch in and touch and get involved somehow in this collective unconscious or you're doing things which are very much on your own and, and not significant in a sense that they're trailblazing, et cetera. They're, they're just not connected to the world as they should be. And another one I keep, I keep going back to is very interesting because I come from a Jewish family, even though nobody was, was religious. There's a, there's a cultural unethical issue there, but I only found out actually I was maybe 10 years ago and, um, uh, even though I have suspicious of it, but the one that I read every once in a while I pick up because it's around the house. And because my wife has a bit more religious is, is the Bible, but it was a wonderful set of stories, philosophy, et cetera. And I read it much like you would read Shakespeare, you know, and it's just extraordinary because it has everything. Shakespeare has all of the human traits. If you look somewhere, you will find it either in King Lear and have litter and buck methods there. And, uh, and the, the vibe was very interesting book to keep going back to, to, to get a glimpse of humanity.

Speaker 4:          01:54:53       Do you have any favorite documentaries or movies?

Speaker 5:          01:54:58       Yeah, my favorite documentary is one called up. Are you seeing that?

Speaker 4:          01:55:01       I have, yes. It's fantastic.

Speaker 5:          01:55:04       And, uh, and for, for the people listening to us, it's, it's a Guy Michael apted who were in 1964 decided to follow about a dozen, actually more kids from very different backgrounds and from in the UK and some in orphanages and some very well off to try and establish how much people are stuck to their, um, to their context, to their social context. And so when it's very interesting because he follows them every seven years, right? So it's seven, 14, 2128 and so forth until 56, which was the one. And it's quite an extraordinary way to look at humanity and see, can people really escape their social constraints and their initial, um, lay of life, you know, and in general is the assumption is that they cannot and that great sense that bares itself out. Note Tim in the sense that it doesn't look like you can, you can stray that far from the path on average. No.

Speaker 4:          01:56:10       Yeah, it's, I think they revisited them what, every five years or something like that. Seven, seven I'm sorry. That's right. Because it was seven up and then it became the seven up series. Uh, yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:56:21       all multiples of seven. But it's the same people, which is extraordinary. You seen someone who's seven was 14, it was 21 was 28. It was not 56. And their dreams and their hopes and what they were actually able to do and how close they in these seven year periods, how close they have stayed too. They're calling a parent calling in life before they were born. It's an incredible situation.

Speaker 4:          01:56:47       Yeah, it's a, this is, this is the documentary series. It's come up three or three or four times. Uh, I'd never heard of it before interviewing a number of people on the podcast. So that was actually introduced to the series through the podcast as well.

Speaker 5:          01:57:02       It's wonderful. And, uh, just just on that tone tend to say that, you know, you're, you're in a country that says, boy, anybody can do anything. You May, anybody can be anything. Don't let anybody stand in your way. You can be, et cetera. But it's not really true at all. This is I think, a very interesting take on this documentary and on the American dream, you know, even what's what's happening today in the u s has a reaction to this. So where the fuck is my American dream that was promised to me, you know, but the fact is that you're promising classroom of kids and as a valid the Taurian and speaking at conferences and uh, egging them on at Mbas, the fact is that you cannot, you know, humanity has a programmer and long story in a very, very long proof that I'm in general, your chance of changing walks of life, changing class, changing path from what, for the context which you were started with is a very, very rare situation.

Speaker 5:          01:58:05       And that very, very rare situation makes for wonderful books and speeches and films. But it only makes for these wonderful, uh, for this wonderful entertainment because it's so, so rarely true. Now is that very dismal and disappointing to look at and say, boy, you know, now that you've put this in my face now I'm not going to try anything. It's not even worth it. No, it's just to remember that in the passing of time of the station of life that was, that was created or available to you and your context there could be and should be a wonderful life. The wonderful life is in rising all the time until you're at the top. There's nothing that's particularly interesting at the top. It just seems absolutely wonderful. When you're looking at it from the bottom,

Speaker 4:          01:58:51       what would you say, for instance, if you were teaching again, but instead of at the MBA program at Mit, you were teaching a ninth grade class in some economically disadvantaged area, let's just say, could be the ghetto in Chicago, could be any number of places in the u s w what would you teach in that ninth or 10th grade class to help them improve the odds of not remaining in their current cycle?

Speaker 5:          01:59:25       And I have, you know, we obviously you, you talk way too much, so we haven't had time to talk about education, which I'd love to as well. But of course, I've, I've taken, let's say the last 10, 12 years, I've taken all of this effort and this risk taking what I learned before and taking it to the world of education. And, but, uh, I spent, uh, the first, the first few years of that teaching six year olds in a public school and heavily just disadvantaged bandage kids and so forth. So it was, it was fun to do. Um, what I, what I tried to do most with them was to, um, get them to realize the magic of the accumulated wisdom of human kind. And that poking at this magic of what we've been able to do and think, and all this time, all the rest will take care of itself.

Speaker 5:          02:00:23       And so if I sit there and say, you can do this, you can find the strength within you. It is possible. You can do anything you want. You can be anything you want. I don't, I don't believe in that. And so I kept showing them things like I would say, I remember one day it was stepping outside of there. I said, let's, I'm going to teach you the special relativity theory of Einstein. So it's like you're here with me in this little village, right? Right now you look up and I say, how long would it take you to go to the moon? And so they'd say this and that and rockets and all what it was and promoted to the next and on and on and to Neptune and ranch. Great. And then to the edge of the universe. And then there's the, their, their mind is going all over the place of course.

Speaker 5:          02:01:07       And we're trying to think this through together. And I said, if you come to the end of the world, the end of the universe and there were a little quicker and now you've traveled for thousands and thousands and thousands of years in your rocket ship and so forth. And now according to this man, Mr Einstein, you opened this little curtain at the end of the universe. Where would you be the answer? [inaudible] in, in following the theory. And people will know, this will tell you, you will be in this little village right here. Well was looking up into the sky and these crazy, crazy concepts which are true and which are about us. And to say that he, we are up here in the mountains, so time here moves a little quicker than it does at beach level and so that you have exact twins who were born and one is on the beach. One is an amount by the end of 90 years when they meet again, the one in the mountain will be older, slightly older. This kind of stuff is to me, what unlocks the whole possibility for people to think, boy, I can be anything, do anything. It's harder because they're looking at the magical response of what life looks like, what we've learned all along to this date, and that is the key that they can eventually use to free themselves. Or is it,

Speaker 7:          02:02:28       if you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere and actually now I think a billboards are there. No billboards in Sao Paulo. I feel like that's one of a few cities that has perhaps made the billboards illegal. But that's, that's an aside. The, the, the metaphorical question is if you, if you could have one gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it, in other words, just getting a short message out to millions of people, what would you put on that billboard?

Speaker 5:          02:02:52       No, that's enough. People pay attention to, to now so many other issues, uh, go away because I think so much of everything we do is taken up by the past and the future. And so little of our successes there that

Speaker 7:          02:03:12       remembering,

Speaker 5:          02:03:13       uh, that you're now in a bus, you're not on a train, you're not going somewhere, you don't want, you're not, this is the stuff that I think falls short all the time and somehow it does have a lot of restrictions on, on billboards and it's expensive and it takes authorizations and Soho. So that helps. But some of us, so many other visual problems now we have a new Trump like mayor who is going around and uh, covering up all of the spray paints of the was graffiti artists. That's the newest,

Speaker 7:          02:03:46       well, I think this is a good place to, to wrap up. And do you have any, and I'll ask you where people can find more about you and certainly put that in the show notes as well, but do you have any ask or request for my audience, the people listening, any or any last parting words that you'd like to share?

Speaker 5:          02:04:03       Yeah, I'd say that, you know, again, when I think about, you know, why, why would I, uh, sit with you and a to our podcast, why would I have a few people that I wanted to talk to and that during this little podcast episode of my own, um, it's all to do with, and essentially of course, it's all a, is it songful, is it insightful for myself? And therefore it's always very self serving and very and very narrow, let's say. But on the other hand, my, my very generic wishes always a people will be able to take a little something out of it, which has an insight into something that was already there. Not that we created in this conversation, but to someone takes on a little act of courage in either giving more freedom to people who were with them or for them or their kids or their, anything that's around.

Speaker 5:          02:04:59       And I think that it's terribly gratifying to do just these very small leaps of faith in these very small movements in the direction of what seems like risk and, uh, and is never a risk because it's never a metric issue. It's just getting past your own misgivings about doing something new and that that would be my hope that people take this little leap of fancy or leap of faith and finally decide to make a change on constraints, on restrictions that they either have or that they need to fight against or they need to remove other people from and find that that's a hell of a lot more liberating than it sounds
