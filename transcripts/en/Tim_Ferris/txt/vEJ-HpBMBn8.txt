Speaker 1:          00:00:12       Katie, welcome. Come to the show. Thank you very much. This is fun. And I liked the setup then I liked the view, the view of Beautiful Austin, Texas. Yeah, it's really been fun. Actually. This is my first south by southwest. I know people call it south by, I want to make it even cooler and call it sp. Um, but it's been really fun to be here and it's been a really interesting for me. So thank you for having me on the show.

Speaker 2:          00:00:39       Of course. I really appreciate you making the time and I'll be honest, I feel a little bit like that, that Petulant Luke Skywalker and the first star wars, everyone's like, oh, come on when he's hanging out with Obi wan and just missing the point because I'm sitting here asking questions of someone who's asked more questions of more presidents and dignitaries than I'll ever even have a chance to meet. So I apologize in advance if I make any

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       not mistakes. I think that if you just are curious about people and your curiosity is genuine and you're truly interested in someone, uh, I think any that that's really what makes a good interviewer. And so I am very happy that in state. So I think it'll be fine.

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       I want to jump in to something that I found in the course of doing my homework that led me to a number of different questions and I said if, if I would ever have the chance to ask him, I was like, wait a second. I do have a chance to ask. So this was something I found via NPR and as an interview format and they were asking you if there was any story that made your reputation or if there was a moment like that. And again, the Internet sometimes misquotes things. So I'll, you can correct if need be, but I'll read a little bit and then I want to ask follow up questions. So I think I got noticed when I was doing a tour of the White House and Barbara Bush. I didn't think that President Bush was there. And suddenly I heard this cocker Spaniel or Springer Spaniel ultimately ends up, we arrive at Milly that smelly coming into the room and President Bush was following him and suddenly I had to do an interview with the president of the United States that I wasn't prepared to do.

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       I was just getting a tour of the White House. So that was sort of where I found my career path before my eyes. But I was able to come up with enough questions to keep them there for something like 19 minutes and 20 seconds. So that last sentence was the part was like, okay, I have to ask you, if you could just walk us through that and how on earth, what, do you recall any of the questions? Do you recall how you kept the president on the hook so to speak? Yeah. Or, or just any recollections from that because it's, it's just conjure is such an incredible image in my mind.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       Well, you can imagine, you know, when you've prepared for an interview and something completely unexpected happens. So I had prepared endlessly to talk to Barbara Bush about the White House. It was the anniversary of the White House. And she was giving me a tour and we were going to be talking about Dolly Madison's tea set and we were going to talk about the ball and claw, uh, legs on some of the chairs and all kinds of things and paintings and deaths and accoutrements that are part and parcel of the White House. And suddenly as you described it was like, and I was like, Oh God, Oh God, what's going on? And I for some reason thought that President Bush was out of town or that he had an appointment and that he wasn't going to be around. And it's not often that you have the president of pop in to say hi and you have no questions for him.

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       So you just had it. That was where the rubber met the road. And I just had to pull all these questions, you know, pretty much out of my ass to ask the president, you know, the most powerful man in the free world. So I think I asked him about Iran Contra, I asked him about, he was running against Bill Clinton. So I asked him about that campaign. I'd like to rewatch that actually to, to see how it plays out today and what I remember. But I just kept on firing away. And I remember his upper lip started kind of quivering because I think he too felt suddenly put on the spot. He wasn't prepared either. Exactly. And we just had this very intense kind of ratatat tat back and forth. And finally, I remember Marlin Fitzwater came in and I said, oh my gosh, here's Marlon. And I think Mrs. Bush, everyone was basically saying, okay, that's enough.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       Enough is enough. And I remember saying to the audience at the time, the viewers that Marlin Fitzwater was pulling out whatever was left of his hair because he was pretty bald at the time. And, uh, yeah, that was, that was, uh, that was, uh, a very kind of intense situation for me. But it also showed that I could think on my feet. Now I'm fairness. I also had my executive producer just sucker peppering me with questions behind the scenes through my IFB. I think he was nervous, yeah. That if I had had a moment and suddenly had nothing to say that he was going to leave. And of course is somebody who really understands television and understands audiences. He wanted to keep the president on the hook as long as he could. Yeah. So, uh, but it was fun. And I remember afterwards thinking, Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       And, and it was well received, I think a Tom Shales who's the TV critic for the Washington Post for a very flattering article following that. But that was, I think, very important because, you know, when I did that job and I decided I would be the co-anchor, the today show, it was really important for me as a female in the business to be taken seriously and to not be relegated to the cooking and fashion segments. And in fact, when I got offered the job, I said to Michael Gardner, the then president of NBC News, I'll only do it if it's a 50 50 division of labor between me and Brian Gumbel. And I said, I, I, I had covered the Pentagon. I hated worked very hard and local news and I'd gotten some very good advice early in my career to not be typecast as the cute girl who does features. So, you know, it was important and that was validation in a way that yes, I could have a fun personality, but I could really get serious and s serious questions, penetrating questions when I needed to, even if I wasn't prepared.

Speaker 2:          00:06:34       I mean, I, I want to ask you about the sort of the Chutzpah and where that comes from, but is that a trained skill? Is that something innate to you? How did you end up developing that level of aggression is too strong a word, but that ability to capitalize on an opportunity like that

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       to say, I had a lot of Moxie, which I love that word is a good word. Yeah. And, uh, you know, I don't know. I think it's inherent in my personality. I think I have been pretty guileless if that, if that's kind of a synonym for moxy in a way. I mean, I think I've always been pretty uninhibited and very open and very willing to go there wherever there might be. And, uh, I think I've always had a fair amount of confidence in myself, although it's wavered, you know, from time to time through the years. But um, yeah, I think, I think having super supportive parents obviously probably fed into that. Um, but I also think it's a little bit in my DNA as well. A little hard word. Yeah, I do. I actually do. And, uh, it's sort of always fairly fearless and not hesitant to be out front and running for vice president when I was in fifth grade and president of my elementary school when I was in sixth grade and one it always wanted to be a student leader in that kind of thing. Very Tracey flick from election. Would you like a piece of gum?

Speaker 2:          00:08:04       Did you remember that movie? Did you see that with Reese Witherspoon? It's actually right.

Speaker 1:          00:08:08       Very, very funny movie. It kills me. But, um, I'm not too Tracy flick ish, but a little and um, so, so I think I just have always had had the Chutzpah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:20       All right. So I have you have forgotten more interviews than I'll probably ever do, but even in my short stint doing a podcast, we're just around 300 right now. Wow. That's a lot. It's a decent number. I mean, I'm getting you do it every week. I publish on average six a month, six a month, six months. So there, what is your publishing schedule? Uh, the publishing schedule is two weeks per month. We'll have two episodes and two per month. We'll have a single episode. I'm thinking of reducing that down to once per week, but I record them. I typically record them in batches and then schedule them out in advance, particularly if they're more complex involving video.

Speaker 1:          00:08:59       So, um, do you find that sometimes they're not topical because you don't do them around the

Speaker 2:          00:09:05       publish? Good question. So I deliberately avoid topical subjects and uh, this is smart, I guess. So they can be evergreen. That's right. And this, there are trade offs though. So there are people who I've watched very closely who are in my, let's call it peer group in the, in the podcasting world who are very, very good at tracking the headlines, finding names, inviting those people on and riding the wave of Google juice effectively the, the trend in traffic and search queries to drive traffic to their podcasts. That's very, very effective. But I don't want content if I get hit by a bus tomorrow. And I've been very, uh, I shouldn't say I've been unfortunate and I think it's part of life, but I've had a number of very close friends and also family members pass away in the last, say 12 months. And it just reminds me that I could get hit by a bus tomorrow and I don't want to have put out only subject matter that has an expiration date.

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       I really want it to last. So whether it's a blog post or an interview, I'd love for there at least, even if there are topical components to be themes and lessons that transcend a certain period of time. And that actually leads me to my question, which is even in my relatively short stent. Nice segue. Thank you. Thank you. No, it's true though because what I'm dying to ask you is related to nervousness. I've had a number of interviews and episodes where I've really been nervous for different reasons and that has led me to prepare in different ways and respond in different ways. Are there any interviews that come to mind over your career that you were particularly nervous about beforehand?

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       Yeah, I mean, I think throughout my career, obviously dignitaries, heads of state. I remember I interviewed Yasser Arafat. I was very nervous about that. Ross Perot was very pugnacious and kind of ornery and you never knew what he was going to do. I think, you know, live interviews are really scary. Yeah, for sure. Because you can't, you know, edit things out. You can't ask a question over again in a more eloquent way and you're really on the spot. So I think live interviews would make me nervous. I remember I was supposed to interview with Tom Brokaw. Dot. Oj Simpson, uh, after he was acquitted and I was a nervous wreck at the very thought of it because I thought, first of all, I'm not a prosecutor. I, my husband who had passed away later, but who was alive covering a lot of the Oj trial, knew everything. He was a criminal defense, white collar, criminal defense lawyer.

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       And I just remember thinking that this is just a no win situation. First of all, I can't retry the case, nor could I cause I don't really have the talent or the skills to do that. And secondly, it was so divisive and polarizing that whole situation. And so racially charged and I at the time and still do to a certain extent, just hated like people attacking me. And I thought it was just a no win situation. So when he bailed, I wanted to do a happy dance. I was so excited. So, you know, situations like that would make me extremely nervous when I saw so much risk and so much downside and very little upside. Right. Um, but, but I think whenever I'm interviewing people who are really smart and really knowledgeable about a certain area and I don't know nearly as much as they do, that can be a hard, and I think also when you're interviewing somebody about a wide range of public policy and you're not, you're not necessarily a policy wonk, that's challenging too, but you know, to go to the White House and interview a president either live or even on tape is really stressful.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       Interviewing Sarah Palin when I interviewed her because I thought it was so important to strike the right tone, asked the right questions and, uh, it was a very critical time, I think to understand her motivations and actually her abilities. So, um, I still get nervous when I have big interviews. In the case of, let's take Pailin as an example. How did you prepare for that? Can you walk us through some of your preparation? Well, I think, um, I worked with my friend Brian Goldsmith with whom I do a podcast. He sort of my partner in crime on the podcast. He's a very, very smart person who really follows politics and public policy very closely. And we worked together at CVS and when I found out she was going to do the interview, we just immediately started to read everything we possibly could about her, about Alaska, about um, you know, everything that was Germane to that, the presidential campaign, what was going on in the country.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       I called Madeline Albright, I called Sam Nunn. I called Richard Haas, who's the head of the council on foreign relations. I called people and I said, Hey, I'm interviewing governor Palin. Of course everyone knew was in tune with what was going on in the campaign. And I'd say to them, what do you think are some of the areas that you think are really important that the American people need to know about and hear her perspective on? Um, so I would ask people, I think I asked a few other correspondence about it. Um, read a lot and you know, you also have to make some very difficult choices because as you know, you know, they're probably a lot more questions than you have time for it. Then your guest has time for. So then we'd had had to winnow them down and um, but it was also really important for me to, uh, you know, make sure my tone was right, that my approach was right.

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       That I, I remember going in and saying I would have an almost parkinsonian effect with very little facial expressions. I didn't want people to misinterpret that. I was looking at her like, what are askance? And uh, and, and Madeleine Albright offered me, I think the best piece of advice, she said, just let her talk. And I think so often in conversations, I don't know if you find this true in a podcast because it may be different since things can be edited, but you try to fill the empty spaces and people feel very uncomfortable with silence. And I know I do because I want to make sure that I keep the conversation going. And then of course, in live television you can't have these, you know, that dead air. But I, I really took that advice to heart and I wouldn't jump in. I wouldn't jump into rescue her if she was giving a convoluted answer.

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       I wouldn't jump in if she felt awkward. I wouldn't jump in if she paused. I just let her talk and didn't. And I really resisted that temptation, which I have because I'm a pleaser and I want to make sure people feel comfortable. Um, so we spent probably three solid days preparing for that interview and I really wanted to ask questions that required accumulated knowledge and critical thinking. So I wanted to talk about big issues and you know, honestly I look at some of those questions and I'd say, I don't know how I would answer that, but I'm also not a public policy expert. Um, but I tried to ask questions that weren't Gotcha questions, even though she insisted they were, but that people deserve to know a how much she knew about any given subject and how she would approach it and what her thinking was. And what became abundantly clear is she just wasn't ready to be put in this position. She wasn't ready for prime time and it had nothing to do with her gender. I just think her experience and her perhaps lack of intellectual curiosity, did not equip her to do an interview about substantive issues facing the country or the world.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       Let her talk. I really loved that. I got, I've had the chance to

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       become friends with someone in cal Fussman who was one of the senior writers who worked on the, what I learned column for Esquire for decades and is interviewed million different people. And I asked him for feedback when I was starting the podcast to read some of the transcripts and to see if he saw opportunities for improvement. And he said such a nice guy, real sweetheart of a guy, and he said, let the silence do the work. Because I was trying to rescue people. If I asked a question and it started meandering or something like that, I would jump in and he goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You need to give them more space and give them time to follow up or to add to their answer. But it's, I think it's very unnatural. Even if you're not a pleaser, as a human being in conversation, it's, it's, it's unnatural to leave a lot of space. But as an interviewer, it's really, it seems really, really useful. Uh, you mentioned a Ross Perot and him being pugnacious. Is there a toolkit or a more effective way to respond to someone in an interview if they are ordinary or a pugnacious? Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:57       Um, I don't know. I think, I think it depends on the situation. Uh, I remember he was like, Katie, Katie, you know, sort of admonishing me like I was misbehaving fifth grader or something. Um, but I think, uh, you know, that's a hard, I don't know. I think you just have to kind of stand your ground and not be intimidated. I think people like that want you to back down or want you, want to make you uncomfortable and, and, and make you ill at ease and catch you off guard. So I think you just have to really work at maintaining your composure and not be thrown by it. And that's very hard on national television to not be thrown by someone, kind of scolding you. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:19:45       What's, you mentioned, the facial expressions and so on, which is something I haven't even considered because this is my very first few experiments in video, so I'm not now I'm like, oh my God, what have been doing with my face? But, uh, if you're being scolded on national TV, it's not just what you say, it's also how you respond. Right. Of course. Of course. So you really have to have trained a poker face or at least some awareness. Self awareness. Yeah. Through the profession. That seems really hard.

Speaker 1:          00:20:14       I would definitely get fired if my thought bubbles right.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       Perfect. Came public, that's for damn sure. But on the flip side, are there any interviews that he that come to mind? You've had so many, uh, but where after you're done, you just in the moments of finishing the interview, thank yourself God, I hope the equipment was working. Like I really hope we caught that because it was so good. Are there any that come to mind where like, oh wow, that was really, that's one that I'm really proud of.

Speaker 1:          00:20:46       Yeah, I a lot.

Speaker 3:          00:20:47       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:20:50       I think one that's sort of, that I usually dust off when I'm asked this question is one I did after the massacre it at Columbine high school and it was four, maybe 4:00 AM Colorado time is how many hours behind New York, two or three, three, two. So it was 5:00 AM and it was April and yet, and so this guy was pitch black but it was snowing. So it was this very dramatic, dramatic scene. And I interviewed Michael Shoals who had lost his son, Isaiah and Craig Scott, who had lost his sister Rachel and they were so broken, understandably broken, shattered, not even broken. They were shattered and it had happened the day before

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       and they came on the today show, which I think is always such an interesting thing. Why do people in this grief stricken state come to talk about their loved ones? I've always been fascinated by that and thought it would be a really excellent thesis for a psychology student about grief and sort of the public acknowledgement of grief. And Anyway, they came and uh, and it was just a heartbreaking interview. And to witness them kind of looking to each other for comfort. Michael shoals was a big burly black guy and Craig Scott was this sort of angelic toe headed teenager. And I've actually stayed in touch with Craig Scott and they held hands, uh, during the interview. And it was just, it was sort of the, the personification of loss and sorrow and these two people and just holding onto each other for dear life. It was really profound.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       It was really, I was witnessing it less. Uh, I was Whitney's, I was witnessing it more than interviewing them, you know, because they were in this particular space and I was an observer really. So I always think about that interview as being after it was over a really important interview for people to watch. And I hope I handled it in a sensitive, thoughtful way that both respected them as human beings, but also guided them so they could express themselves, you know, are situations where you just really want people too. You really want to help them get through it. I mean there are all kinds of situations I'm sure, and all the interviews you've done, there's some cases where you know, you want to afflict the comfortable and there are other cases when you want to come to comfort the afflicted. And that was definitely the latter. And so, uh, just helping them through it. And, uh, that was a really, I don't want to say special, but significant experience for me as a person.

Speaker 2:          00:24:18       So I want to, I want to explore this. I'm writing down that one. There times when you want to afflict the comfortable tells me we're going to cover that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:25       Say is the journalist's job. I've never heard that before. No,

Speaker 2:          00:24:28       no, that's really useful. Heuristic, uh, want to talk about grief a bit? So I've, uh, I've lost a number of, like I mentioned close friends and a mentor in the last 12 months. And uh, you mentioned your husband, uh, who passed away earlier. Uh, and if I get any facts wrong, obviously please correct me. But colorectal cancer 42 40, which really caught my attention. And My, the first time I had an opportunity to go abroad outside of the United States was to Japan as an exchange student. And I lived with a family, went to Japanese high school and I'm still close to that family 25 years later. And the father and that host family is my second father effectively. And I plan on bringing my American family to Japan later this year to meet them for the first time, my two families. And I just found out that my host father is in the hospital, uh, late stage, very aggressive cancer diagnosed, uh, as metastasized, probably will pass away in the next two months.

Speaker 2:          00:25:39       And what kind of cancer? Uh, it's, I would have to go back to the email because it was, it was very emotional and then cognitively difficult for me to translate because there's a lot, it's in Japanese and it was all specialized medical terminology, but it's, it's in the lung, it's in the liver. Uh, a lifelong smoker, very typical for Japanese of that age. I think it might be also a soft gel, but um, and it's, uh, I know that it has, it's now also in the lymph nodes, so he's intubated in the hospital and only the mother and the, the brothers can come visit. Uh, so this is ha has had me thinking about grief and uh, is there anything I should do in advance to prepare for that? And they'd just be very curious if you're willing to talk about it to describe your experience of grieving and you could start at any point in time, but as it relates to your experience with, with your husband and certainly after that we can get into it. But I mean, you've done a tremendous job of, of highlighting the types of diagnostic tools and preventative tools that people can use, which we'll talk about. But

Speaker 3:          00:26:51       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:26:51       I don't even know how to think about grief. I mean, I don't know if I've allowed myself to ever experience it before, but I know I'm going to be hit with a hammer. I thought though, you had a couple of friends that I did. No, I did. They have passed away. And it's been very recent that it hasn't been this close. These are friends, but they're not a second father to me. Uh, and I think in a sense the, um, the mentor passed away. It did hit me pretty hard, but if the only in the last six to 12 months actually been allowing myself to feel more things, that's a much longer story. But, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:27:23       have a kind of a conflicted relationship with this person.

Speaker 2:          00:27:28       I know I've had a lot of armor for decades that have built up over time for a lot of different reasons and, um, it's been very useful for some things for protecting me, but I've realized that it also keeps a lot in that is very ultimately corrosive. So I'm trying to develop more of an ability to feel and instead of looking at it as a liability, um,

Speaker 1:          00:27:52       slash I don't know. How do you, how do you describe grief? Um,

Speaker 3:          00:27:57       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       I mean, I, I can talk a little bit about my personal experience. You know, I had a, I was on top of the world, had this great job, had two beautiful children, and of course a wonderful husband. Uh, I have to say we were having challenges, some challenges in our marriage because I think I had this just sort of out of the blue success and some suddenly became a household name and had all this attention, which I think can put a lot of pressure on a relationship or suddenly it doesn't feel the power dynamic doesn't feel as equal. Right. Um, but, uh, you know, we were, we were

Speaker 1:          00:28:43       really, you know, and love and enjoying our lives and, uh, you know, just out of the blue, Jay hadn't been feeling well. He had been tired. He'd been traveling and we kept thinking, oh, east, we have two little kids. He's covering the Oj Simpson trial. He was, uh, you know, his schedule was crazy. And then out of the blue he just was doubled over in pain. And our nanny, who was Irish at the time called and said, Jay's doubled over in pain and, uh, I don't know what to do. So he didn't have a doctor like so many young men, which is, you know, if anybody takes, there are many, I think takeaways from our conversation, I hope. But one is that men especially, I think because women go see gynecologists honestly, that a lot of men don't go and get physicals or they don't even have a GP or an internist.

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       And Shay was one of those guys who played Lacrosse and football and in college and was never smoked ever. I know that he ever even tried a cigarette. I never, I don't think he even tried pot ever. It's sort of crazy when you think about it. Drank moderately, uh, took pretty good care of himself. I mean, and uh, and it just boom, he had stage four metastatic colon cancer. So we went from one day, just everything was great. We were buying a house in the country and, or had a house in the country and we're really enjoying that. And Jay was riding horses in central park and doing his thing professionally. And I was at the today show and our girls were great. And, uh, we had, I mean, Carrie was less than a year at the time or just had turned a year old when he was diagnosed on April 3rd, 1998, 1997.

Speaker 1:          00:30:41       Sorry, he died nine months later in January. But, um, you know, it's just, it's so, it's so debilitating and shattering and destabilizing and you know, it's such a process and I was in such denial and he was one of these very smart people, but he didn't want to know about his health. He didn't want to know the gory details. I don't know why, because he was so smart, intellectually curious and interested and I don't know, maybe he knew. So I kept all this stuff from him, which I really regret. I would say, oh, there's only shadows on your liver. Don't worry. It's going to be okay. Uh, we're going to figure it out. I remember sending his scans to Nih, you know, cause I had a lot of connections because of my job. And I remember very prominent cancer scientists calling me and saying, Oh God, this is, this is really bad.

Speaker 1:          00:31:39       He, I arranged for him to get a hepatic artery pump, which pushed the chemo directly to his liver that was covered. I mean, the tumor burden on his liver was awful. And, uh, anyway, so I was, I went into, I think my, my husband John says I'm very good in an emergency. You know, I get very focused and very proactive and driven and I went into, I am going to try to fix this mode. And uh, so I was sort of doing that I think to avoid the grief because I had to do something and it was just, I mean, what can I say? It's the worst thing in the world to see someone, first of all, your life just changed in an instant then to see someone's suffering then to try to figure out how can you help somebody. I mean, it's just, it's really overwhelming and uh, you know, I think grieving process began the day he was diagnosed because my doctor, who was the internist, Jay went to see when he was in this pain.

Speaker 1:          00:32:50       You know, he pulled me aside and to one of those little patient rooms in the hospital and said, it's, it's the, this is really bad, that the prognosis is very bleak. So what do you do with that? Except for do everything you possibly can to change the outcome, which you realize you probably can't change anyway. It's a very, uh, challenging thing to deal with, but you know, I, maybe my regrets will help you with your situation and that I never really said to Jay, what are your hopes and dreams for your kids? Can you write the girls a letter? Can we videotape you talking to them? Uh, to say everything I wanted to say to him because that was an acknowledgement that he was going to die and I just couldn't do that. So maybe if things are so bleak for this person is so special to you, first of all, you need to tell him no and you need to write him. Maybe go see him and feel that, that you don't have any regrets. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:34:07       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:34:09       So the only segue I can possibly think of from that is very close to, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:34:15       they can always go what I used to do on the today show, on a lighter note,

Speaker 2:          00:34:22       I mean I suppose on a lighter note, although it's, it's a, it's a shade of the same color. Uh, so there's, there's a very interestingly titled Paper in an Academic Journal and the title is quote, the impact of a celebrity promotional campaign on the use of coal, uh, colon cancer screening, the Katie Kirk effect. And it goes on to detail the increase in the number of colonoscopies because of your awareness campaign or campaigns. Uh, so, and I was looking at this, I've read a lot of studies and the p values, so the likelihood that it could be attributed to chance is really, really, really low. I mean it's, the data are really compelling. Looking at this, can you, can you tell us the story of how it happened?

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       Well, that's a university of Michigan study. I think that paper, and I think it was in the annals of internal medicine possibly, which I think in this case should be called the angels. But I basically really wanted to educate people because I didn't understand colon cancer. I didn't, I'd never really heard of it. I guess I had vaguely when President Reagan had a polyp and I thought, Gee, I have this opportunity. I have this bully pulpit pulpit. I have a platform to educate people. So, um, again, Jeff Sucker, who at the time was my executive producer, he ironically had also been diagnosed with colon cancer in his thirties. And so he was a very receptive audience for my idea. And I said, can I get a colonoscopy on television? I don't, I'm too young to get one. You know, was wasn't 50 yet. I was only 41 when my husband died.

Speaker 1:          00:36:05       But I said, we need to demystify this procedure. So that was my thinking to just educate people. And um, and it was sort of, this was before people were doing things like this and talking about it, but it just seemed a perfectly logical thing to do. And I think it was very helpful for me in a situation where I felt so powerless and I don't know about you, but that's the worst feeling in the world world to feel powerless feeling. No. And so here was an opportunity for me to use whatever power I did have to maybe help other people and possibly even save some lives. So that was really the thinking. And uh, you know, that that's sort of started me on a journey to be a cancer advocate for all kinds of cancer and to continue emphasizing the importance of screening. I'm taking a very well known person to get his first colonoscopy next week. And um, you know, I really appreciate people's willingness to talk about this and just spread the word. And because it's so preventable, it has a 92% cure rate if it's detected early and it's the second leading cancer killer of men and women combined. So I feel like, you know, that will probably be the first line in my obituary. I hope it won't be journalists, but it will be sort of cancer advocate and uh, and it's something I'm really proud of that I was willing to do.

Speaker 2:          00:37:44       Well, I would say even at this point, it could be the first line in this, in, in certainly a number of measurable senses, right? So your cofounder of Standup to cancer and that has raised more than 500 million at this point to fund scientific research team. That's a lot of money.

Speaker 1:          00:38:00       That's a big chunk of change. There's a big chunk of change. Yeah. And that's what started by nine women who together, um, we're frustrated with the pace of cancer research. I think standup has really changed the paradigm of how cancer research is done. It's really emphasizing collaboration rather than competition getting these institutions and you know, pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms to actually talk to each other, to pull their re pull pool, their resources and, and their brain power really. And it's since been adapted by people like Sean Parker, Joe Biden, when it comes to the way they're approaching cancer. So it's been a phenomenal thing. I'm so proud of these women. So proud of these scientists. Cause at first they weren't too jiggy about collaborating.

Speaker 2:          00:38:49       Well that's what, that's a really complex potentially complex problem to solve. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:38:55       It's worked better than others. Yeah. Quite candidly. But uh, you know, we've been able to get three drugs approved by the FTA and a lot of promising research done because the scientists are willing to work together and it just makes all the sense in the world. But it does, it's against, are kind of very primal impulses to, you know, be credit mon green and not want to share the spotlight with people. So it's, it, it, at times it's been challenging, but now that it's been great. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       What are the ingredients or the strategies that your team is used to encourage these people who have not previously collaborated to collaborate? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       I don't know. You know, I think their shoe, it's, I, I don't give the organization any credits. Their sheer decency and their, their desire to really help patients and to come up with better treatments for so many people who have suffered from this disease and lost the battle. So I think that, you know, it was just different, you know, people don't like change as you know. Yeah. And it was just a different way of doing things. And as I said, I think in some cases maybe it hasn't been as successful as it could have been. In other cases it's just been amazingly successful. So you know, these are the real heroes, by the way, these cancer scientists, first of all, they are ridiculously intelligent, brilliant people. And you know, these are the people who should be on the cover of celebrity magazines and they, we should be doing award ceremonies for them. They sh they should be the real rock stars of our culture. Unfortunately they don't get much attention. They don't get that much funding. They just don't get what they deserve as far as I'm concerned. So they're amazing. And that's been another really gratifying part of this work is to get, get to getting to know the scientists who are so selfless and so hardworking and so dedicated to helping people.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       I'd love to ask you about how you choose projects because we just discussed as a c it seems like a very natural consequences of your personal experience and then capitalizing on the platform and the assets that you have. So it was a very natural fit. I can only imagine that you get hundreds and thousands of proposals that I'm sure other people help that with basic criteria, but I don't really don't. So how do you select, you must have so much inbound and certainly throughout your career I would imagine. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:41:37       I mean I don't really, I've worked for companies, you know, I uh, in local news and jumped around, which you sort of had, you know, at the time you kind of had to do to get experience and become confident and you know, reporting and doing on air work. And then I worked at companies like NBC for 15 maybe 20 years, if you count my time covering the Pentagon and working in local news. So probably 20 years, then went to CBS for five. Then I did a talk show for two that I worked at Yahoo for four. So I've really worked for big companies servicing them and doing what I needed to do to hopefully contribute to what, you know, their general mission was. And, um, and now I'm sort of, I don't know, I'm just kind of at a weird place. I do things that I believe will have impact that give me creative freedom.

Speaker 1:          00:42:39       Uh, sometimes I miss working for companies because I love working with people. I'm a super sociable person and I like, I really get energy from other people and the atmosphere I'm in. Um, but now I, I'm just trying to figure it out. And it's hard because the landscape is so fragmented and there are so few communal experiences. When I did the today show, I sort of felt like, oh, not everybody. I didn't, I wasn't that egotistical, but I thought, oh, a lot of people are kind of watching this. And it felt kind of like a community. And now, I mean, a lot of people still watch the today show, but it just seems there's so many options and so many things to do with our time and this attention economy that, um, Tristan Harris talks about. Do you know Tristan Harris?

Speaker 2:          00:43:30       Yeah, I know of him. I had stopped him. You would love him. Fascinating guy.

Speaker 1:          00:43:34       33 years old. He's an amazing person. I let, I interviewed him for my nat Geo series, but um, you know, uh, so I just tried to do things that I'm going to enjoy that I think will somehow contribute to the conversation and that will get some attention. But that's hard, you know? So I think right now you just have to do things you really enjoy and like, you know, devoting your time to,

Speaker 2:          00:44:01       what do you do it in your time to right now? And I'm, I'm thinking maybe that's the leading question or am I, I'm suppose, I suppose what I'm hoping to explore a little bit is a America inside out. And if you could tell us what that is and why you chose to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:18       Well, I decided to leave Yahoo when it was bought by Verizon. No hurt feelings. I just, it was never really the right fit for me. And I've, I've talked about that a little bit with Kara Swisher. He pressure, you know, Kara, Kara on the podcast. Yeah, she's great. I really like Cara. I just like her, no bs, very no bs. Yeah. And I, but I also think she's a very kind person. Um, probably not everyone who she's written about feels the same way. But, um, I wanted to, uh, I wanted to explore some of these issues that I thought were not getting attention. Biz Stone in this book I wrote about advice said if you see a need, fill it, you know, in terms of what to do with your life or if you're entrepreneurial or if you want to, if you want to be of service to people.

Speaker 1:          00:45:12       And I think basically, don't we all want our book, our work to matter? I think, I don't think making money is the be all end all for people. Maybe it's easy to say that once you've made some money, but, um, I wanted to explore these topics that I thought were getting short shrift in the media, that, that everything is so ephemeral now. You can't even remember partially because there's so much happening at once. You can't remember what Donald Trump did two days ago or you can't remember. I mean, it's so much. It's TMI, isn't it? Yeah. And I think you see, you can't even digest it and think about it and contemplate it. And I felt like everything's happening so fast. Can we think about things a little more? And what are some of the things that I believe we should be thinking about? And it was, they were things that were happening before our eyes, but we weren't really giving them any considerations.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       So I had done a documentary for National Geographic called gender revolution about our changing notions of gender and how were people are not really binary as much as they used to be with very specific male, female, blue, pink, you know, traits. And you grow up and you're this way. Um, and now I, this whole notion of gender fluidity and kind of being nonbinary and all this stuff was really, they were relatively new concepts for me. And I had whiffed on an interview I did with Laverne Cox and uh, Carmen Carrera and less with Laverne. But with Carmen when I asked her, uh, an inappropriate question about her genitals, basically her private parts and I taped the interview and at the time I thought she was quite offended and told me why. And I said, I'm, when the producers asked, I said, keep that in because I want people to understand why that's an offensive question if you don't mind me asking.

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       What was the question? I said, what's the situation with your private parts, you know, about gender reassignment surgery? And it just grossly inappropriate. But I didn't really that and I was trying to do, believe it or not, a public service by at least talking about transgender individuals and trying to help people understand it. So my motives were actually pure, but my question was really clumsy and I kept it in the show and it got just, I remember I was on a plane going to ces and it was my birthday and I looked on Twitter. Oh my God, I'm surprised there wasn't smoke coming out of my phone because it was just merciless. I need the scathing criticism I got. And I of course regretted that I kept it in, but I kept it in for the right reasons too. But I ended up, long story short, sorry, I'm going on and on about this, but I ended up saying, you know, I want to learn.

Speaker 1:          00:48:16       I want to understand. I felt bad. I also felt, you know, defensive and upset. But ultimately I said, I need to educate myself and I need to help other people understand this community. So I did a documentary called Gender Revolution for National Geographic and they were quite pleased with it and I was happy that I was able to do it and I learned a lot. So then they came back to me and they said, would you like to do some war? So I didn't have a job at the time. Um, and I thought, and I think this is sort of the new way of working, you don't necessarily work for one company, right? You do it more project by project. Um, and I really done so pretty much every job and network news at this point in time. So I said sure, I'd love to. And I came up with six topics that I thought deserved a little more analysis or exploration and that's the series and it's really been interesting and really, really exhausting.

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       What are some of the topics? So I'm doing, the first one is called rewriting history, but I'm spelling it R, I, g, h, t, I, n, g. And it's really about our memorial landscape and confederate iconography, statues, monuments that led me to Charlottesville right before and during that quote unquote outright rally. That by the way, is not Charlottesville, Virginia. People have now associated this kind of bigotry and disgusting white supremacy as being relating to Charlottesville. It has nothing to do with Charlottesville. They picture let's fill because I think it's a progressive town. And um, so it's, it's really on how these confederate statues are dividing us, that they're so important for some southerners who see it as celebrating southern heritage and so offensive to black Americans who feel they are a real poke in the eye and supporting people who wanted to perpetuate the institution of slavery.

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       So I just wanted to peep, I wanted to hear more about that where the controversy started in Charlottesville. It was started by a 16 year old African American high school student who started a petition and I went to see Mitch Landrieu in New Orleans. I talked to Julianne Moore who did a petition to change the name of her high school in Northern Virginia. And then I went and talked to Brian Stevenson of the equal justice initiative, who is just one of my personal heroes about his project, which he's doing. You would love him and lynching project where he is collected soil from the lynching sites from 4,400 lynching sites throughout the south because that's a chapter of our history. Those literally been buried and well not literally, but yes, literally and figuratively and buried. And he has taken the soil with the help of descendants of people who've been lynched and put the soil in Mason jars with the name of the lynching victim on the jar. And he has a home memorial that he's opening in Montgomery in April. He's a very deeply thoughtful person, does a lot of work with mass incarceration and with sort of the long tail of slavery and how it's affected race and African Americans in this country long past the civil war. So anyway, that's kind of like, I mean we're, can you really watch something like that on television

Speaker 2:          00:51:57       and you see is the what, what would be success for you? Not In terms of views or anything like that, but the, the impact of an episode that on say a viewer, is it, is it that they changed their mind? Is it that they see it, they view an issue that before was just a sound bite or two headlines and they see the shades of gray in something that was actually very nuanced. What do you hope it will do?

Speaker 1:          00:52:21       Number two would be really good at deeper understanding. Uh, a, a, uh, I guess remembering what it feels like to have empathy for some of these point of view, to um, have more context, to be able to talk about it in a more educated, intelligent way to, I don't know, you just, there's so much surface stuff you don't really know what's underneath what lies beneath the story. And oftentimes I think if you do a little digging, then you just have, you just understand it more and you can talk about it and, and a less kneejerk way in a more nuanced, less emotional, empathetic, empathetic way. You know, these statues for a lot of people are deeply, deeply offensive and I don't think they belong in public squares, in public spaces, which are very important, you know, in terms of setting the tone for a community.

Speaker 1:          00:53:30       That's why urban planners spend a lot of time thinking about these things and uh, it's, it's just thought provoking and I don't think we think about these things enough or have an opportunity to really talk about them. So that's just one. I'm doing one on what it's like to be a Muslim in America right now. Because there's so many prejudices and misconceptions about Islam, about Muslims, and 50% of Americans say they'd never met a Muslim. And so I'm trying to introduce some of them to those people, to Muslims virtually. And um, you know, I don't know. I'm trying to just foster some kind of deeper understanding and connection for people with things that may seem foreign to them with, with things that they may feel strongly about but don't necessarily know why. Maybe it's because their friends do.

Speaker 2:          00:54:25       Yeah. Maybe their beliefs aren't actually their beliefs at all. The beliefs of their parents or their coworkers or whatever it is that they've absorbed. Yeah. They didn't worry about it through thought. They write farm fed

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       from their, from their news feeds. Sure. Through likeminded people who share their beliefs. And I don't know, it's, it's kind of ambitious to even want to do that. And you know, I just have to keep trying because that's what I enjoy doing. And I do think that I possibly could be a helpful conduit for people. A proxy for the average Joe or chose the dean who is curious about the world and wants to understand it better and wants to meet people and talk to people and see if they can, I don't know, trying to make sense of it all. I Dunno,

Speaker 2:          00:55:17       does that, I think that's it. I think that's a very noble objective. I know that. I think, I think if you aim for that, even if you partially fail, you will still, you will still create a lot of positive change, right. Since I could be, I mean, that would be certainly what I would tell myself that a

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       try. And I do think this younger generation is much more receptive to, you know, trying to change the world in a good way. You know, you see those kids in Parkland, Florida and it's just so moving. And so, um, you know, I'm hoping, I'm hoping that it will, it'll maybe, I don't know, get people to talk to their friends about it and maybe counter some of this stuff that they're seeing and say, actually, you know, white extremists have committed three times the violent acts that Muslim extremists have committed since nine 11 or in the last 15 years. But the media coverage leaves you with the perception that's not the case. Right? And so we can all kind of just be more aware and more critical and not in a negative way, but critical thinkers about the kind of information that's incoming.

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       I know we only have a few minutes left. If you had a billboard, metaphorically speaking, and you could put a word, a phrase, a quote, any type of message or question to get out to millions or billions of people, what might you put on that billboard?

Speaker 1:          00:56:50       I'm watching three billboards right now. All I can think of is the billboards that, uh, Frances McDormand put up. Um, uh, you know, there's so many important things, right? I guess I would say, uh, something about voting, you know, if you don't vote, you can't complain. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:57:12       There are ways to vote too. I mean, I understand the literal.

Speaker 1:          00:57:15       Yeah. I mean, I think for me it's actually the elections, right? Because I think it's what 55% of Americans voted. It was the worst turnout in it since I think 1994 or something. And, and I just don't understand how people can be that apathetic. They have to care about the country and they have to educate themselves about the issues. And I just, uh, it's just infuriating to me that people don't vote. And so, especially in the midterms and they need to, they need to really hold our politicians accountable and if they want to, you know, be the change they wish to see or whatever they need to get involved in the political process. So I think that's what I would do. I get infuriated me if people didn't vote in the last election or they threw it the way their vote by voting for someone, that just would never be a of chance. Right, right. And I felt like saying to them, that's a vote for the other person. If you're comfortable with that, you, you know, just so you know, that's helping elect someone, you may not want to be precedent. And so I just, I just hope people take that really, really seriously. And I, I don't know, I just hope they vote for people for the right reasons too.

Speaker 2:          00:58:48       Yeah. And the focus on action instead of complaining, I think that you can simulate, you can create the illusion of action by jumping on social media and complaining, but,

Speaker 1:          00:58:57       or they call that slacktivism right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:58:59       Slacktivism yeah. You need to actually get up off your ass and make things happen. And part of that is engaging in ways like that.

Speaker 1:          00:59:06       Yeah. Um, but that's, I think, what would you put on a billboard?

Speaker 2:          00:59:13       Damn. Flying Question. I would say I might put up, uh, I've thought about this of course. Cause I asked this question a fair amount. I would, I would put up, uh, I'll give, I'll give two answers. I'm going to cheat. But the one that I usually say is you are the average of the five people you associate with most. So psychologically, emotionally, politically, physically, you are going to be the average of the handful of people you spend the most time with. So pick those people very, very, very carefully. Um, and the, the other, I'm actually stealing from Bj Miller, who's a hospice care physician, also triple amputee. He was a warning story when I attended Princeton because a few years before he had been climbing on this commuter train called the dinky and it was wearing a big watch and electricity art and burned off three of his limbs.

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       And he since became at Princeton and he sent, he as well after that point became an MD, has helped a thousand plus people to die with terminal diagnoses in something called the Zen hospice center. But he, he's, he's since expanded beyond that San Francisco and they have a very uncommon approach to death and, and shepherding people from a terminal diagnosis to ultimately passing. And they do it in a really beautiful way, uh, that, that I think lens piece to a lot of people. And when I asked him this question, he also, in turn, he said, got it from a bumper stickers. Who knows who ultimately said this, but he said, I would put on a billboard, don't believe everything that you think. And I thought that was really profound to contemplate. That's good for my series. Yeah. Don't believe everything that you think. So I revisit that a lot myself.

Speaker 2:          01:01:00       And that can be your beliefs about other people, but also your beliefs about yourself, the stories, the narratives that you escape to that ultimately don't serve you, don't. Sounds like a remarkable person. Has He gotten a lot of attention? Not Enough. Not enough attention. He, he, he's an English readily think this is an APP person. I should, you would love this. You would love him. He's, he's incredible. And he does, he has, he has procecies or prosthetics and, and he, he sees these cities, whatever it is, he has those. And we actually talked to the podcast at some point. He mentioned in passing, it's like, well, the other week when I was riding my motorcycle, and then he kept going and I said, wait, hold on. You're missing three limbs, you have a motorcycle. And he told me about this process he went through with the help of many people to custom modify a motorcycle.

Speaker 2:          01:01:53       He, he wanted to be on a motorcycle to feel the wind in his face and he rides a motorcycle. He's a fascinating guy and hilarious. Bj Miller as I married. Uh, I don't think so, but I'm, I'm unsure. Yeah. You met him when he spoke at Princeton. No worries. I heard about him. I saw him initially in the, I believe it was the Princeton Alumni weekly, the alumni magazine, and I tore out that page and I said one day I'm going to track this guy down. I put it into a scrapbook. And that was before I ever started the podcast. And then at one point, I don't know how it happened exactly. It might've been an email from someone else who said, do you know who it was an email from someone else has from a scientist at UCF? He said, well, Duh, Duh, Dah, something something. Bj Miller. I said, wait a second. That rings a bell. Google search on my God. That's that guy. Years ago I said, someday I'm going to meet. And I said, I'll do one better. I want to interview him. And that's how it came to.

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       And so did have you become friends?

Speaker 2:          01:02:50       I would say we're definitely on friendly terms. I still haven't met him in person.

Speaker 1:          01:02:53       Oh my gosh. Well you have

Speaker 2:          01:02:56       and um, he's a, he's an incredible, incredible man.

Speaker 1:          01:03:00       You should do your podcast, you know, like on location sometimes I would say it really does, uh, Linda different feel to the podcast. You could go to his, actually, it would be incredible. You should go to his hospice. Yeah. And you should talk to some of his patients that would be so profound and then put together. I'm talking to your producers over there. I put together something that would be really beautiful because people, myself included really don't, don't still don't know how to talk about death. Yeah. They are terrified of it. I am. Yeah. Uh, and uh, I think that you would be doing such a public service to help help people kind of get a different perspective on dying if that's possible.

Speaker 2:          01:03:53       If my own thinking about the subject is any indication based on conversations with people like Bj and based on,

Speaker 3:          01:04:01       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:03       Speaking with someone like you and asking you about grief. This is why I'm asking because I don't, I don't yet feel like I have a complete toolkit for even thinking about it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:10       You should also read Sheryl Sandberg's book option B. Yeah. Which I thought was really brave of her to write with Adam Grant, who's also great. You should interview Adam Grant too. I think I should just be, you know me. You Must Know Adam, right? We've treated email before. I need to, but um, you should read that book because I think it might be very useful for you. Great.

Speaker 2:          01:04:31       No, I'll, I'll take a look at it. And uh, yeah, I actually went, was that a group dinner with her? Uh, you know, then husband just a few months before everything happened. You just never know. I mean, what if it's right?

Speaker 1:          01:04:46       I always think, wouldn't it be cool if people had a crystal ball and they would see what's coming that that's such a, you know, it's always such a mystery. Like what's around the corner. And, um, you know, if you could somehow have a glimpse into the future, it's just crazy to think that you course you can. But sometimes I think about that.

Speaker 2:          01:05:10       I do have two friends, uh, bleed, Kevin Kelly's one who's it? Fascinating, fascinating guy. We could talk about another time, uh, as an Amish beard, spends time with the Amish, but he's a technology futurist with an impeccable track record. Looks at Silicon Valley. He's built his own house, spends time with the Amish. Yeah. It's all because he's fascinated by how they choose to adopt technology or not. Oh. And uh, in any case, uh, he and another friend named Antonio have excel spreadsheets or clocks that they'd look at every morning that based on actuarial tables, tell them how many years, months, days, hours and minutes they have left in their life, just as a reminder of their mortality, intense butts, um, and isn't dense. So we are at time and hopefully we can continue

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       the conversation someday talking to you and I would love to interview you at some point.

Speaker 2:          01:06:07       That would be an incredible honor. I would love to do that. And in the meantime people can see you at work and doing what you do best. America inside out, which premieres on national geographic. Uh, I believe right on National Geographic Channel, April 11th at 10:00 PM six park, a docu series. So I will link to that in the show notes as well as to everything that we've talked about already. Those of you, I really appreciate it. Of course, who listen. And those of you who watched him.blog/podcast is where you can find links to everything on social media at Katie Couric on all the socials. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:06:42       I, you know, it's, it's, gosh, it's such a fulltime job servicing the social media platforms, isn't it? It can. It's also really fun. I mean, I have to say I'm really, I really enjoy using Instagram because it's a way to feel, I don't know. You do get a sense of community with Instagram. It has a, it has the feel of a friendlier neighborhood to or just some of the others, which compared to Twitter, more like a neighborhood where you walked on the street whistling and people just throw potted plants at your head. Yeah, exactly. Isn't always how you want to feel. If you want to have, if you want to, if you want to be an insomniac. Yeah. Check your Twitter feed right before you go to bed. Oh yeah. I got out of a very funny situation where right. Couldn't sleep one night and I got on Twitter. I was using my device way too much. I did a whole hour on technology for this series as well. And uh, suddenly I'm in a conversation with Chrissy Tiegen, Valerie Bertinelli and one other person. Uh, I want to say Anna Gas Dyer, we're all talking about not being able to sleep at like three in the morning. It was so insane. And I was like, okay, this is social media. Who'd a thunk thunk? It, you only

Speaker 2:          01:07:57       pitting against companies who put billions of dollars into r and D to, uh, throw everything scientifically vetted at your brain to distract. So you're completely outgunned. You were out.

Speaker 1:          01:08:09       I know. And that's one of my hours. And that's what I talked to Tristan about. Yeah. They manipulate you to keep you addicted with absolutely no responsibility for understanding. And should they, I mean, do you think that tech companies need to be held accountable for that?

Speaker 2:          01:08:28       I think tech companies, uh, ultimately if they're going to be as all encompassing as they certainly appear to be, uh, do you have a moral obligation to think about the, the intermediate and long term implications of some of these technologies, even if they're just trying to protect their bottom line. So for instance, I mean hopefully I'll take another minute or two, but if you look at autonomous cars, all right, so self driving car as well. 3 million jobs, right? So if you, if you, you can look at the job shifting that you can also look at, let's just say the decision making that will have to be embedded into the code itself. So if you have a car, let's say a car gets hit by huge hailstone, which these things happen, right, or whatever it might be, or a ball comes into the street and throws the car off course, it has to choose between hitting say three school children on one side of the street or 10 uh, elderly people.

Speaker 2:          01:09:22       How does it make the decision and it's going to have to make a game time decision or are there times when the car sacrifices the driver? Is that dependent on your insurance premium is that there's a really gnarly moral problems and ethical challenges that previously were relegated to thought experiments like the, you know, that sort of trolley scenarios and things like that. So they will, they will need to have ethicist and so on to help advise the programmers who are developing the code so that these machines can make decisions. So yeah, they have to think about, it's crazy though. It sounds like black mirror. It doesn't, I know the future is here. It's just not evenly distributed. William Gibson, thank you for that. And Katie Couric, thank you so much. That would be a good billboard. It would be a good one. And I would get a Gif dear Mr. Gibson, a lot of credit for that, but uh, everybody check it out, American side out and Katie, hopefully to be continued. Thank you. So nice meeting you. Likewise. Thanks.
