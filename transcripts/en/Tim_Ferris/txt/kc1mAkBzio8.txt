Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Ladies and gentlemen, this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. Thank you for listening. We have an incredible guest today and his name is Ed Catmull. He's the cofounder of Pixar Animation Studios, which you started with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter and president of Pixar animation and Disney animation. It has also received five academy awards and as a computer scientist he has contributed to many of the most important developments in computer graphics. He has done a hell of a lot and in this episode we talk about many different things. The birth of Pixar, his background going from a technician to more of a manager, president in this particular case, the creative process, storytelling, how they embrace it and developed it within Pixar, the mistakes they've made, what they've thrown out and much, much more including the lessons that he's learned, the things he's observed working with people like George Lucas and Steve Jobs.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Before we get to the interview, two things that I like to provide. The first as a quote, and this is from Harry Truman and it is as follows. It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit. And in fact, Ronald Reagan has very, very similar quote to this effect. The next is a Japanese proverb. Of course, you know, I'm a Japanophile. I used to live there and I love sharing Cotto Aza or Japanese proverbs. And there are many, we talked about the Saudi Milky got, oh she did a few episodes back and this time we have sheet on new shit. A Nigga hot, okay, she'd on noon is not knowing God as a subject marker. Basically hotel can. So not knowing is Buddha. What the hell does that mean? She'd on new and got Hotel k means ignorance is bliss or what you don't know can't hurt you.

Speaker 1:          01:49          And the way that I interpreted this as it applies to this particular episode, is sometimes to do the incredible, you have to go in somewhat naive. And if you knew what you were getting yourself into, you probably wouldn't sign up in the first place. So beginner mind or being a novice or jumping into the unknown can sometimes allow you to do what you would otherwise be told that is impossible. Without further ado, I want to get us to the interview. If you want all the transcripts, the links, the show notes and everything else, please go to four hour workweek.com forward slash podcast all spelled out for our work week.com forward slash podcast and if you'd like to support the show, please go to my book club and you can find a number of books that have changed my life. That's four hour work week.com forward slash books hope you enjoy and thank you for listening

Speaker 2:          02:40          at this altitude. I can flat out before my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue. Ed.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Thank you so much for joining me today for a conversation. I hope. I hope you enjoy it and I've been looking forward to it for quite some time.

Speaker 3:          03:07          Oh my pleasure.

Speaker 1:          03:08          This is a somewhat of a landmark moment for me because I feel like destiny has had this in the cards. I remember 1995 very clearly for a lot of reasons, but one of them was that I bought my first ever share of stock and that was in Pixar. Uh, and it was also I guess the last year of Calvin and Hobbes. So it was a very emotional year for me, but I have been following Comic Book Art Animation and Pixar for as long as I've known of it. And of course as as cofounder, you've had a a key role in creating a lot of the stories that I can pretty much play back sort of frame by frame, line by line. And of course I'd like to talk about that, but also creativity inc and the book that you've put out, which Forbes is said might just be the best business book ever written, which is a very strong testimonial. What I'd love to ask you is perhaps starting with a defining moment and maybe it wasn't a defining moment when picks are went public, what did that feel like? Do you remember that day extremely clearly or was it not a defining moment?

Speaker 3:          04:17          Well public, which was in 1995 was actually very close to a number of other events that happened around the same time. So I look at it as a period of time and for me it was a pivotal year, but we went public one week after the movie came out.

Speaker 1:          04:34          Right. Very smart.

Speaker 3:          04:36          So, uh, Steve Jobs, the logic was that, well, he wanted us to go public and he had some reasons for which we were skeptical off, to be honest, but he wanted to do it after the film came out to demonstrate to people that in fact in new art form was being born. And that was right in investing in. So the film came out, it was a big success. It was a success for me in the sense that we had made a film and it wasn't just a technical tour de force. I never thought of this as we can demonstrate technically we can do it, but we actually wanted to make a real honest to goodness complete film. I'll just have that goal in mind. And that's what we achieved. It was also the culmination of 20 years of pursuing this dream. So there is within the short period of time, the culmination of 20 years, the achieving of a goal going public. Starting off on our next film and the accident, we began to think about two films, the other being poor story to having a relationship with Disney. And while all this was going on, hi personally felt a sense of loss. And there was a curious one because I had just achieved this goal. The loss was in having achieved the goal. I was now missing

Speaker 4:          06:02          one of the defining frameworks.

Speaker 3:          06:07          So I went through a period of a year of trying to sort this out and I realized as I went through that year that there were some really exciting things observed along the way. And one of them that I observed was that most successful companies have this arc where they rise. And then with that success, most of them fail, fail quickly. But a lot of them, they take longer. But ultimately they fall apart. And so the question was, okay, how do you make it so that it's sustainable? Because the people that I knew of who were in these companies, and I had a lot of friends in silicon valley or smart and they were creative and they were hardworking. So whatever the problem was there was actually leading them astray was really hard to see. And the implication was that whatever that force was, it would also apply to us at Pixar.

Speaker 3:          07:07          So this then became the interesting question. These forces are at work, can we find them before they do us in? And so at the end of the earth that I realized this is actually the next goal. It's not a film if, how do we have an environment in which we can find an address problems. So, so that was the big thing that I got in the year at a personal level. There was another one also, which was not in the book, but I will tell you about it because it was a personal thing for me. And that was when I was younger, because I remember this thinking at some point I want to be best in the world. It's something, all right. So this is a goal that I had. So now it's 20 years later, the film comes out and then I were successful. And there are these phenomenal people here.

Speaker 3:          07:57          There are the technical people, most of whom aren't well known. But you've got Bill Reeve and Eben Osby, he's liked out of that to help build the technology. Uh, and besides, uh, Jon laster and Steve Jobs, there also is an understanding and Joe ramped and Leon Creech and Pete docter and a whole bunch of people were a part of this. So now being part of this group that had achieved something, there was a question that I asked myself, which I did admit to anybody at the time. And that was, well, all of this work of us were part of this, but how much of it was me?

Speaker 3:          08:35          Right? So this is this background question. So, well, I know I'm part of it and I'm only part of it. But how was critical was I to this, and at the end of the year, as the goal became clear, I also realized that the question was not a useful question. And that in somehow trying to do that, I was actually misleading myself. Now, the only reason I bring this up was that I now recognize that a lot of people when they reach that place where they're successful, they ask that question and most people won't admit it, but they do ask the question and a lot of people reach the wrong conclusion.

Speaker 3:          09:22          Well, what I believe is that what we did together, it was not something that I can separate myself from. And this is true of most enterprises. It's this desire to separate oneself out is like asking for a clean answer to a question when there is no clean answer. And it is true of most of the things in our lives, whether it's personal or business, is that the inner connection between them and the way they're all mixed together is inherently messy and confusing and there aren't clear boundaries. And the desire for complete clarity actually leads one away from addressing the mess that's in the mill

Speaker 1:          10:13          trader on Wall Street is said it's better to be roughly correct than precisely wrong. And it seems like that mess in the middle is something that a lot of people strive to avoid. You. The, an incredible technical pedigree. And of course we could talk about the Arba Group. We could talk about, uh, your work early on with all sorts of technologies that then have, have become standard technologies in the use of animation, texture mapping and so on. One of my close friends actually, who was a musician by training ended up working at Pixar. I believe he's still there because he wrote his thesis at Princeton about texture mapping of all things and coded it himself. But what I'd love to get your thoughts on is as someone who's exceptionally well trained in computer science and engineering, how did you take that precision of, of thought, that logical approach to problem solving and replicating issues and so on, which, which I find translates into many different areas and apply it to storytelling.

Speaker 1:          11:11          And what is in your, in your current role and in previous roles would have been your sort of key observations with how to apply framework. And I'll, and just one more comment that related to my, my one and only tour of Pixar. I live in San Francisco and uh, ended up having a friend of a friend who was an engineer at Pixar besides rob, my previous friend. And I was so impressed by the process. I mean, you do have processes and it doesn't mean everything has a home run. But I remember looking at the color, sort of, uh, the, the color coding of different segments of the films. And I had never observed it and it was, it was so genius to me want to see it laid out in front of me and that it was a deliberate decision. So

Speaker 4:          11:54          that's a mouthful that I just put out there. But with an engineering mind, what have you observed about storytelling and why can't other companies get it right so consistently or people

Speaker 3:          12:08          three or four things through responded. There is one of those. It has to do with the relationship between the precision of the science and then the r side for that. I, I go back to when I was growing up in the 50s and a rather unique time and post World War II, but also a very safe time. And as I was growing up, my two people that I aspire to follow with Walt Disney and, and Albert Einstein, but for most of my childhood, I want it to be an artist. I wanted to be an animator and I studied art and I did very well on arc in high school and I also did very well in physics. But as I got to near the end of high school and going into college, I didn't see the path to get to the level of what the animators were at at Disney. So when I went to college, I switched over into physics. Now the interesting thing to me is that over the years I've actually told that anecdote to people when I've given talks, how I said I switched over and I say it rather abruptly like that when I was talking to, I switched over to physics and usually there's a kid or in the audience

Speaker 4:          13:19          sort of like hello,

Speaker 3:          13:21          that's an incongruous statement.

Speaker 4:          13:25          Right?

Speaker 3:          13:25          But then that caused me to think about it. It's like, okay, why is that in Congress? Because most people to this day think of them as a so radically different from each other. But I want to pause it a different way to look at it. And it comes from I think what is a fundamental misunderstanding of art on the part of most people. Because I think of art as learning to draw or it's an learning, a certain kind of self expression. But in fact what artists do is they learn to see,

Speaker 4:          14:01          yeah,

Speaker 3:          14:01          the actual training is one of observation. So now if you, if you look at it from that point I do is okay, so which are the professions in which observations, not important, how about doctors or

Speaker 4:          14:14          they're scientists.

Speaker 3:          14:18          You want the skills of observing. And for me there are different ways of looking at things. And if you look at the storytelling side, then the first realization I think I understood this fairly early on, is that storytelling is the way we communicate with each other all the way from when you're reading to your children when they're young. But it's also the news magazines and the movies and television and storytelling is a way we do things. But even in higher, our good teachers, the good teachers are telling us good stories, their way of communicating, understanding and what our scientists and biologists and neuroscientists trying to do. They're trying to reach an understanding and then they're trying to find ways of communicating that understanding to other people. These are all different elements of the way we communicate with each other. And, and it's even stronger than most people think.

Speaker 3:          15:19          Because if you, if you take something complicated like making a movie as an example. So you've got a few hundred people working on a movie, like it can be toy story, but it can be more recent films. Well, what is the story of the making of the film? Well, it turns out it's too complicated to tell. Nobody writes that story down. And if you wrote down all the complexities of what it took to do any one of these major complexities, that fullstory is too boring. It's too long. So what do you do when you tell a story but you edit it down and you simplify it? So you simplify in order to convey certain of the ideas that are critical. But you can't capture all of them. So you end up with a kind of mythology and mythology is a way of us teaching basic principles to each other. But then the theologies don't capture everything and they never can.

Speaker 3:          16:22          So we are in a continual state of trying to create our own mythologies. And even when we come up with mythology, like the things we did on toy story to the people who are here at Pixar, a lot of them weren't here when we made towards story too. So the pivotal experiences that are there, which are part of our history, we're not experienced by a lot of the people who are here. And you can't actually pass that on as a story because then begins to take on, you'd like, it fades over time to a pithy essence. But in along there's a personal thing. So what you want is a new crisis and in solving the new crisis, which they experience, then they get something different than they can get by hearing about somebody else's story. So we have a combination of both storytelling and experiencing and we need both

Speaker 1:          17:24          organically appear in the making of every movie or are they things that you deliberately bring to a head or manufacturer in some way to galvanize the troops and and spur creativity?

Speaker 3:          17:40          Well, I think in order for them to be successful, they essentially need to be organic. So if you manufacture a crisis and you can, is somewhat obviously, because like you said it budget or you set a schedule for instance, and it's very difficult then to some extent you are creating a crisis. But even that's a little artificial because the fact is if you don't meet the schedule or can we meet the budget, you have a different crisis, right? So what you want are the kinds of crises that arise out of the thing that you're doing, but, but you don't artificially generated. So I don't think of setting a budget or a schedule as an artificial generation of a crisis. But if we have a surprise that happens because things never go according to plan, then what you wanted to do was use the problem that's there as a way of getting you as a group. The forced the change in the process or is to figure out problems in order to solve it. And in doing so, it becomes a combined joint effort to move everybody forward and everybody has ownership in it.

Speaker 1:          18:55          Joseph Campbell's hero's journey or the hero. Are there any other books or resources besides your own? Of course, which I would recommend everybody that people can use to learn about mythology or these sort of archetypal structures to aid them in developing their own ability to tell stories. Are there any other books or resources that come to mind as being particularly outstanding?

Speaker 3:          19:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:24          Or people, yeah.

Speaker 3:          19:26          Yeah. It's fairly broad because I've been influenced by so many people in so many different things. I will say one thing that I did, which was informative, but in ways that are hard to articulate. You came from this thing and just my brain works differently. It turns out I am unable to read poetry.

Speaker 1:          19:44          No kidding.

Speaker 3:          19:44          Because reading poetry within a few seconds shuts my brain down.

Speaker 1:          19:51          Okay,

Speaker 3:          19:52          well it was just differences that what I was actually describing this to somebody, this is many years ago. And they said, well don't read it, listen to it. And then all this came about because there was a new translation of the Iliad by Thomas Fagles and it was in verse form. So the thing is I couldn't read it. So this woman at a dinner said, well don't read it, listen to it. So I bought the Cape and I listened to it and I found that I was completely enthralled with it. And then I was surprised by the fact that here's a story that was orally transmitted 2,800 years ago in a different language to a different culture. And it was meant for oral transmission of course, cause they have kind of that rhythm to it. But now translated all these years later into English, the fact that I have this oral nature to it still worked and captivated me and I was able to enjoy and pull in this entire story.

Speaker 3:          20:55          So that, so that got me started down this path. So what I did was I then started listening to these lectures from the teaching company and they have these absolutely marvelous lecturers. So what I did was I tried to listen to lectures of all of human history. So there's ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia and Israel in China, on India, uh, and going up through the Roman era, through the dark ages, the Middle Ages, the renaissance. It took a few years. So every day in the car I would listen to this, but I felt like I had this grants sweep of history. Now at some level it's all pretty high level because it's listening to the lectures and the car,

Speaker 4:          21:40          right?

Speaker 3:          21:42          But there was something about that which gave me a sense which I loved and it gave me a different feeling about people and how things relate, like to each other. So that was one level of things. The second is there are like the wisdom books out of various traditions and China and India and meditation and things coming out of Greece and Israel and so forth. And somehow reading all of those. And the way people rest of those things, which are the foundations of our culture. I found informative.

Speaker 4:          22:19          The what type of,

Speaker 3:          22:25          you take all of those and say, okay, there's something about a breath. So I don't try to grab one of them. I try to get some breadth there because I do believe that we are better off if we experience wide breath. That's what a general education is. And then there's some point at which we dive really deep

Speaker 3:          22:44          and some of you will want to specialize. Like I just want to do this, I just want to be an artist so I just want to be a scientist so forth. So I understand that and there's an experience of diving deep into something which is indescribable. So it's good to have that experience and I think one has to breath that you need a combination of the two and once you experienced the depth in something, you're actually in a better position to go deeper into an area. Once you've discovered what your area of love is, then there's the more monitoring in terms of neuroscience and how we work. And then the other is just the observation of if you look at what took place in in silicon valley and continues to take place in Silicon Valley and in San Francisco and the rise and the fall of the companies and the way they interact and the amazing things that happened in the bad things can happen. That human drama I find very interesting and we're kind of in the middle of it.

Speaker 4:          23:40          Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          23:42          That's cool. How do you look at the mess that we, that we're in and the good things that we're in?

Speaker 1:          23:49          Moved to the bay area, up to San Francisco from the peninsula was because of that, that chaos chaos. You mentioned specialization. When you've obviously done a lot of work with George Lucas and Steve Jobs, do you view them as generalists, specialists or both? What were some of the key habits or routines, rituals, anything that either of them had that that still stick in your memory?

Speaker 3:          24:19          Well, what was particularly interesting there is the, while he was a successful filmmaker, he, even though he was not a technical person, he viewed and believed whose core the technology was going to change. The art of filmmaking. So with the success that he had it with star wars, he was willing to do something that was not done anywhere else in the industry. So he was the sole person that did this and he said, I'm going to invest in bringing technology into filmmaking. And so that meant not only graphics and uh, but also meant a digital audio and video editing. So I'm not, was fortunate to be connected with George at that time, but he was unique in this.

Speaker 1:          25:08          Why do you think he decided that? Where it seemed to be lacking in other people? What allowed him,

Speaker 3:          25:17          well, I think the thing that triggered him, and it's not that he ever told me exactly what the trigger was, but in the making of star wars, it required the best use of the advanced state of the art of special effects at that time. And there were two parts to that. One was the precision control of optical printing and blue screen matting. So this is an optical process and required a great deal of technical skill on the part of the people who were there. And the second thing, which was a new idea for star wars, but what's critical for effects whenever appreciates this, but it was I, one of the breakthroughs for the film is that it's important to have objects blurred in the direction of motion.

Speaker 1:          26:06          Oh, interesting. That makes perfect sense.

Speaker 3:          26:10          Okay. And if it doesn't happen because of the way the projection systems work, then I picks it up and we actually see a double image, but we're not conscious of it, but we're conscious of it if something is wrong. So what they did was they had a technical group that moved the spaceships while the shutter was open. So they captured the blur on the blue screen matting film, and then with great precision work to keep that blur of these space ships as they then mad at the objects together. So this was for the time, very high level technical skill. And then star wars is this enormous success. And George realized that technical expertise there was rot in by this amazing group of people was one of the things that helped elevate this cell and put it into a different category. So with asked success, he said, well, let's keep going down this path. How far can we go because of that world outside there is continuing to change. Now what's different about George was he made that little leap or big leap.

Speaker 1:          27:17          Okay.

Speaker 3:          27:19          From saying technology was a key part of this is saying, oh, that world outside is still changing. I'm going to be part of it and try to incorporate it. All right. So that was why he was that way. I don't know. But he was the guy that did it.

Speaker 1:          27:39          Tuxedo park who was an amateur scientist, but he took interest in radio and uh, later had a huge impact on detecting you votes and whatnot in the war itself. Did George and Steve have anything in common or much in common?

Speaker 3:          27:56          Well, I mean they were quite different. I mean, they're very different from each other. Steve was an extraordinary person and I wrote him about him at the end of the book. But there, I allude to him throughout the book. But there was something there, which I find a stressing because I watched the arc of Steve over his life. And the image of Steve that people know publicly about the way he worked was from when he was younger and I wouldn't, some of those behaviors, and a lot of them weren't nice at that time, but as a result of being cast out of apple and starting next and then buying Pixar from Lucas Salomon and being part of starting up Pixar, Steve who was so incredibly intelligent, he actually, he just figured out that some of those things he did in the past didn't work and he changed his behavior and he became a more empathetic person and he changed in the way that he dealt with them.

Speaker 3:          28:54          Now what the outside world sees is the mythology of the young Steve and then this, all of a sudden this gigantic success of apple and then the iPhone and they connect the two together, but they didn't realize the arc that Steve went through. Why did they miss it? And the reason they missed it was that once Steve went through this change in his life, when he figured this out about 15 years ago, then basically everybody that knew Steve stayed with Steve for the rest of his life. Right? So we all witnessed that part of Steve. He was always an intelligent and incisive and what he did. But his way of working with people changed. So when it came to the mythologizing about Steve and would call me from since then to talk about them all, I was not going to psychoanalyze Steve Ali was alive. Right? And nobody would.

Speaker 4:          29:52          So our boss, our friends,

Speaker 3:          29:55          so Steve, my friend is, I mean at the end, it wasn't actually my boss, he was on the board of directors at Disney, but for all those years afterwards that he still checking all the time and talked and he had this passionate interest and it was going on and he was a caring person. You know, when I was in the hospital with my hips being replaced and they were Steven there visiting and checking up and wanting to make sure that had the best medical help. And so that image of Steve was not conveyed to people because the people that knew about them viewed in, there's just, what's their private relationship with Steve? So we talked about it,

Speaker 4:          30:31          right?

Speaker 3:          30:32          So the mythology about Steve was actually a mixture of things when that recognizing that as in, as you're pointing out in Campbell's book, there was this hero's journey, right? And Steve went through that journey and by the end of his life, he was a very different person than he wasn't the first.

Speaker 4:          30:56          What were the reasons for that? People were skeptical of that. He had,

Speaker 3:          31:02          well, okay, so we're, we're now making the first film and to then become a public company for the rest of us because none of us had ever been, even in a public company, let alone knowing what it means. It's like this can be a major distraction. And you guys stories about, well, okay, what does Wall Street expect? Does this actually kind of mislead you into the wrong direction so you have the wrong values in place? So there was the view of what, let's make some films and prove our worth and get that under our belt before we go public. But Steve had a different logic. He said, right now we have a three picture deal with Disney and the financial terms of the deal. While they were as good as we could have gotten under the circumstances, once we're a successful company, then our share of the profits were actually pretty small. So Steve wanted to renegotiate the deal, although he had and always had a very good relationship with Disney. But Steve said at the end of three years, if we then split off as a separate company and we're no longer with Disney, we will be their worst nightmare.

Speaker 4:          32:15          Yeah. Have

Speaker 3:          32:17          they will have helped launch a successful competitor. So what will happen is that when toy story comes out, all of this is before it happens. So we're, we're guessing about scams, but this is Steve prognosticating because he now believes that film's going to be a big success. So he said what will happen is as soon as the film is, is out, that Michael Eisner, we'll realize that he's helped create a competitor. So he will want to renegotiate.

Speaker 3:          32:48          And if we renegotiate, then what we want is to be 50 50 partners, I should say right there. That's a different Steve. Then years before were years where Steve of shot for the fences and try to get almost everything for himself. He now has reached the point we said that's not a good place to be. A good place to be is a 50 50 partnership. So it's like a good standing and it's a high road to pay. But if we're 50 50 partners, it also means that we have to put up half the money. Well, Pixar doesn't have any,

Speaker 3:          33:27          so we need a war chest. So if we go public, we will get a war chest. Then when we would negotiate, we can come in and go for the kind of deal, which is a 50 50 deal. So the film came out and within a few months it's the route, the call from Mike saying, let's renegotiate. And so c says, okay, we want it to be 50 50 and all of that happened as Steve predicted it would. And for me it was rather amazing. Wow. He's completely called it correctly and it was coming from a place of the high ground of a true partnership. That's the way he wanted to think about it.

Speaker 1:          34:10          It's a more sustainable structure

Speaker 3:          34:12          all the years. He ultimately had trouble with Eisner but it's because he didn't think the eyes and was I partner with him. Well you know, it had to do with certain things that I was nervous said about in the public and so forth and about Disney and so forth. You just didn't feel like it was a partner relationship you would expect and at this time Steve had doubt, place value on equitable partnerships and there was a value he brought to the table and in bringing that, because it was a value was actually when we could hang onto, but he was always very careful to say Disney itself as a corporation is one that we really admire. They've done a great job of marketing our films. They've done a fantastic job with the parks and so forth. So through all of this, he worked very hard to keep a great relationship with Disney because he believed in the end that it was going to lead to something good. No guarantees. Mc was always realistic about that. But he believed that if we behave well with them as partners, that would, we would end up in the right place.

Speaker 1:          35:27          I think people would look at Steve or they oftentimes we look at Pixar and say, well my God, they're batting a thousand. They've always gotten it right. What I'd love to you is sort of a two part, it won't be one of my eight parts questions, but what was the hardest film for you to make and why? And then secondly, related to George Lucas. Uh, I've, I've heard on numerous accounts that he was hospitalized at least once during the making of star wars with, you know, and he was, I mean, a really young guy at the time, but it was just from overexertion and panic attacks and whatnot. That's at least what I've heard. Which has been the hardest for you to make and why? And then do you think for a film to truly be a landmark film, that it is necessary for at least one person to make a sacrifice of that magnitude where they just are at the brink of falling to pieces or not?

Speaker 3:          36:18          I wasn't here for star wars for whatever was called the first star wars. In fact, I never heard that. So I don't know whether it was true or false. I just didn't hear so I don't know. But the bigger question is like, which is the hardest? They do vary in their hardness. I would say there have been several, which were extremely difficult and some were only difficult.

Speaker 1:          36:43          Right?

Speaker 3:          36:44          I think originally we thought, well, if you do SQL, it's easier, but we send it out. If you're going to do something original, it's always hard.

Speaker 1:          36:49          Right. I would imagine more difficult in some ways.

Speaker 3:          36:53          Yeah, because you have to take them in a different place and you're, you're constrained by the certain world that you've got, but you're expected to add something in terms of that world that really is interesting. And not obvious. So the only thing that makes a film hard is if you keep going at it and it's not working. So you can't solve the problems. And then what happens is for all directors, they are emotionally invested in their films and they also get lost in them having us, everybody, it doesn't matter who they are, whether they're new or whether their experience. And what we have found is that since it happens to all of them, what you want is this collection of people, we call it the brain trust. But essentially it's a group of colleagues who have been through it to help navigate when you're kind of lost in this swirling mass because it's very difficult.

Speaker 3:          37:51          And so the most difficult thing is on the people themselves. And we've had some films where the original director who had the idea got lost in it and couldn't get out. And so we had to make some changes in order to get the film done. So in our view, we've had failures, but we basically, we tried to keep the failures inside. And it's not that they're secret that we've had failures, but we don't release the film that fails. We will abandon it all. We'll restart and we've had several restarts. We just get a state, it's not working. We have to do a major rethink to get this to be where it is. So we had to do that with toy story and we had there the Ratatouille.

Speaker 1:          38:35          Wow. No kidding. I've seen Reddit's, I've seen both of those movies dozens of times. At what point do you stop trying to fix something and abandoned it? Are there cases of total abandonment and in which case or shelving something permanently, in which case, how do you decide to go completely scorched earth blank slate as opposed to reworking something if that's been done, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          38:56          Well usually there's a buildup to, this says all of our films to begin with,

Speaker 1:          39:05          really rough

Speaker 3:          39:10          that people have is that a new film was like the baby version of the final film when in fact sometimes the final film bears no relationship to what you started off with. And what we found is that first version always sucks. And I don't mean this because I'm self effacing or that were modest about it. I immediate in the sense that they really do, sorry,

Speaker 1:          39:33          the storyboarding level or what? How is it appearing? What's the form?

Speaker 3:          39:39          Yeah, you're going through phases of where we come with the idea that you pitched. The idea is you rework them. Then you'll do a strep and you have a script read, have actors read through it and then you go through a couple of versions of that and then you start to storyboard of the APP and you put it up and it isn't until you get to, you know if Q versions in that you begin to find, okay, these elements of it are sticking their holding. We, we've now, I've got the tent poles for the film that we can build around, but it's a discovery process now and the reason it takes long as you're trying to do something that's new. If we just want to throw up a story, it turns out we know how to do that really quickly and we know how to make it quickly.

Speaker 3:          40:25          But it's not a good movie unless you can try to find some way of touching people's emotions are bringing something new to the story. So the reason we go out on field trips and do an research trips is that we're trying to take ourselves and our directors into a place where they bring something that they didn't know or in the general audience wouldn't know. And I mean I'll, I'll use an example as ratatouille where the filmmakers went to into the, the three star restaurants in France and the one to Thomas Keller's French laundry and so forth. Now a lot of people watching the cooking channel, but the cooking channel is not like a real, the inside of a real,

Speaker 1:          41:09          okay.

Speaker 3:          41:10          The thing is almost nobody has been inside of a real high end restaurant, so they don't actually know what goes on inside there. So when we take elements of the way they work in the audience and we put them in the Ratatouille as elements, then the audience does know whether they are true or not because they haven't been there. But they sense that it is.

Speaker 3:          41:34          So when you're watching those people in that kitchen, the way they're working in and the way she's talking, cause he was teaching him how to cook, right? You have the sense like, oh this is real and you, you only get that by going out into the world and finding something new and then you bring that in. Then you have to Meld it into a story and it's a long, slow, painful process and involves a lot of people and a lot of time. So now the question is, or what your question was like, you know, what do you do if you abandoned it or restart? How'd you do that? Okay. In our history here, we have only abandoned one film if the other ones will either that evolved into what they were or we did a restart and the one that we abandon, the only reason we abandoned it is that we, we realized we needed to bring fresh blood in. And so the person we brought in said, yes, I will do a restart on the film, but essentially we're restarting. I have an idea, which I think is even better, which is a completely different idea. And when he pitched that idea, we said, you're absolutely right. That's a brilliant idea.

Speaker 4:          42:42          What movie?

Speaker 3:          42:43          This is the one that's coming out next to him.

Speaker 4:          42:47          Okay.

Speaker 3:          42:48          So rather than being a restart, it was say, okay, this is, this is the film you're going to do. So because we believe that it was a brilliant idea, but for the others it was a restart. If you compare it with baseball, like baseball has got this notion that you got the starting pitcher and then you've got through the really version and you've got the finisher. So you've got multiple pitchers in the game. So there's an ideal. And the ideal is that you'd like to pitch the perfect game. So one guy takes it all the way through the game and finishes up other wind. So that's the ideal. But the ideal use, it rarely happens. The concept which we accept is there multiple people that do it. Not In film. When we do something, we have someone who starts it, but their idea, which is to take all the way through. If they don't take all the way through, then they think of themselves as having failed.

Speaker 4:          43:41          Right?

Speaker 3:          43:42          You step back and say, you know they launched the idea, they had a good idea, they couldn't see any shit cause it's a different kind of thing when you finish and when you start the value of the world is it frequently you the value the first person and you give high value to the second person. But the reality is it's kind of all parked together and you have to acknowledge the fact that the contributions came from a lot of people over a great length of time. And it's what makes it painful is it in this world, if you have to make that change, it's a personal thing that somebody has and that's where the pain comes. It's not the work.

Speaker 4:          44:30          Rapid fire questions.

Speaker 1:          44:32          Okay. That a very short form. You can answer them as briefly as you'd like. And uh, the first of that is what is the book you've given most often as a gift?

Speaker 3:          44:44          The books I've given most often. I wouldn't say there is a single one.

Speaker 1:          44:56          Okay, got it. Is there any that you've given more multiple times than others?

Speaker 3:          45:01          No, I, I would say there are certain children's books which I've given out a few times. One monster after another by Mercer Meyer.

Speaker 1:          45:10          That's terrific. I love that. Perfect. What is your favorite documentary or any favorite documentaries?

Speaker 3:          45:17          All the documentaries, you know, he used to go to Sundance. I love documentaries is, or favor one though. Honestly I can't remember a favor one for me. The documentary gives us a slice and something we don't see. And so I actually, I liked them as a class. I've been so busy. The last couple

Speaker 1:          45:36          problem,

Speaker 3:          45:37          many recently.

Speaker 1:          45:38          Are there any that stick out in your mind?

Speaker 3:          45:43          Well, for me personally, there it is. They'll have a range of things, similar video, they're science oriented and so forth. They've got them on economics and on Shakespeare and so forth, but the thing that had the greatest impact on me was the set of them, which was the whole sweep of world history. You have to take it like section at a time to do it. Although I must admit there was one which was around the time of King Henry the eighth there's that, the tutors and the stewards. I was so blown away with that that as soon as I listened to it, I listened to it again. The tutors and the stewards, that particular one,

Speaker 1:          46:22          I'll have to check that out. There's a podcast that only three months or so, three to four months called hardcore history, and there's a series called the wrath of the cons, which I highly, highly recommend it. It might have the same effect on you. When you think

Speaker 3:          46:38          hardcore,

Speaker 1:          46:39          hardcore, hardcore histories, the podcast and there's a series, there are four or five parts called the wrath of the cons and it's about as it turns out, Genghis Khan as opposed to gang iskcon. It's incredible and the delivery

Speaker 3:          46:53          read a book thoroughly enjoyed

Speaker 1:          47:00          a covers. It covers a number of different cons but provides the pretext that the current, I would say the then current context and the delivery. It's a synthesis from many different sources, but give the first episode Alyson and I think that you will very quickly then devour the entire series. It's, it's amazing. When you think of the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind?

Speaker 3:          47:26          Oh, and the way I view success is actually in, in terms of people's happiness and so there are people let others normally know about that's the real success and they were friends and so forth. I think while they've achieved this equanimity in life and I just valued it that a lot when they were sheep people,

Speaker 4:          47:48          do you meditate?

Speaker 3:          47:51          I do. I meditate between a half hour, an hour a day and have for several years, single session in the morning,

Speaker 4:          48:02          in the morning or anything else.

Speaker 3:          48:09          I actually got started because of visiting this involvement and center, which is batten, but in fact because I lived in Marina, I live in San Francisco, we're close to spirit rock, right?

Speaker 4:          48:20          Oh wonderful.

Speaker 3:          48:21          Become quite engaged with the community. How to spirit rock, which is of that particular style.

Speaker 4:          48:28          Fantastic. What would it be?

Speaker 3:          48:33          Well, I did your heart to ask because I view myself as is constantly needing to change.

Speaker 4:          48:39          Sure.

Speaker 3:          48:42          Others and looking at saying, okay, well how can I do a better job? So it's not like just one thing. It's like, oh well there are a whole bunch of things where I would like to evolve or improve and alter the view and, and look at the world in different ways. So for me it's not so much changing. Something is can I take on a different perspective so I understand or view things I didn't see before.

Speaker 4:          49:08          A few pieces of advice to your 20 year old self. What would that advice be?

Speaker 3:          49:14          Well, it's a tough one because to some extent, if I had told my 20 year old stuff a lot of things that I know now just about life, I don't know if I would have understood it. So I come to the position where, because I think, I mean the reason I wrote the book was to try to explain things to people,

Speaker 4:          49:36          right?

Speaker 3:          49:39          20 years old. But the way I view this or any other book is that you read things or you learn about them because you want to figure out how to address issues and problems in life. But the danger is always that, whether it's me or somebody else, if we can look at these things as a way of somehow sidestepping the problems and there's a subtle distinction there and not everybody knows what they're doing. But I think advice is actually one of like you always face towards the problem. You actually can't avoid the mess in the middle, what you want or mechanisms to deal with the mess. And in, in doing that, you will end up in a better place and you'll get experiences that you can't get any other way than by experiencing them.

Speaker 4:          50:23          What, what do you think the advice whether he would have taken or not year old self

Speaker 1:          50:28          most would have needed to here would have been?

Speaker 3:          50:31          Well, the reason it's hard is so much enjoying my life and the people around it. And I'm aware that if you make a change and then the little minuscule changes can actually send you down radically different paths. And so I'll say, well, okay, even if I've made mistakes at the time,

Speaker 1:          50:49          right?

Speaker 3:          50:51          What I want to give myself advice, which would have had me avoid that mistake because then steak was part of who am I am that made me where I am?

Speaker 1:          50:58          Right?

Speaker 3:          50:59          So I can look back and say, well, if some of those things were painful, I wish I hadn't done them or done that or said that. But it's not like I could say, well, avoid doing that because to some extent going through the pain of making that mistake helped ultimately.

Speaker 1:          51:15          Right.

Speaker 3:          51:16          Hard to go back and see, okay, do something differently.

Speaker 1:          51:21          Unpredictable butterflies act and what it could do to the rest. Well this has been a lot of fun. I really appreciate you making the time. Where should people learn more about you or what would you encourage them to go check out? Of course I will also put in the show notes, links to the book and other resources. But any, any parting thoughts?

Speaker 3:          51:42          I mean we've really touched on the topics of course and when we've been 15 minutes on this for me, all the issues of what it means to engage with others and dealing with uncertainty and how you address fear and how you make safe environments are critical ones and how you looked at the world and perceive it. And, and uh, our moral and ethical position in that environment are all really important. And I don't have any short way of saying them, but to me they're important and, and the help, I get at least touched on a few of them in the book and then talking about some of our experiences as we grew as a company. And I want to make it clear that we haven't figured it out, the challenges in front of us, every bit as big as they've always been.

Speaker 1:          52:29          Oh, I can't wait to see what you guys produce next and given how many mutual friends we have, hopefully we'll at some point bump into each other in the bay area, but for now at least I will let you get back to your day and thank you very much for taking the time. Thank you very much, Tim. Thanks. Take care. All right, bye. Bye.
