Speaker 2:          00:23          by four sigmatic. I reached out to these Finnish entrepreneurs after a very talented acrobat, introduced me to one of their products, which blew my mind and the best way possible it is mushroom coffee. What on earth is this? Well, it includes Chaga mushroom, very powerful antioxidant, considered a super food. I was introduced to Chaga by Laird Hamilton, the King of Big Wave Surfing of all things, and it includes another mushroom that is considered a no tropic, a smart drug, and this is lion's mane in the entire packet. You just add it to hot water. It tastes like coffee. There is only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so less than half what you would find in a cup of coffee. So I do not get any jitters. I do not get any acid reflux or any type of stomach burn and it put me on fire for an entire day and I only had half of the packet. So this stuff is really amazing. People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement. Right now. This is the answer, so it is legal. It will not give you visuals.

Speaker 2:          01:54          this episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way, set it and forget it. Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than two and a half billion dollars under management. In fact, some of my very good friends, investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. So the question is why? Why is it so popular? Why is it unique? Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only pay pennies on the dollar for them. And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations, bloated sales teams, et cetera. And I'll come back to that in a second. I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk assessment quiz, which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in.

Speaker 2:          02:46          And if you just want to take their advice, run with it, do it yourself. You can do that or as I would, you can set it and forget it. And here's why. The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that investors should be on a regular basis but normally aren't. Great investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and little things that you may or may not be familiar with. Like automatic tax loss harvesting, rebalancing your portfolio, cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large amounts of money over longer periods of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned, since it's using software instead of retail locations, etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely impossible. Right off the bat, you never pay commissions or account fees for everything. They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for free.

Speaker 2:          03:34          If you use my link, wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance. Now, normally when I have a sponsor on this show, it's because I use them and recommend them. In this case it's a little different. I don't use wealth front yet because I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal. They wanted to sponsor this podcast, but because of sec regulations, companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials. So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast, but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant amount of my own money, at least for me, uh, in the team and the company itself. So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client. Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener, you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account. But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you. Take two minutes, fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash. Tim, it's fast, it's free. There's no downside that I can think of.

Speaker 2:          04:34          Little Boys and girls, one bets and squirrels. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers, tease out the habits, routines, favorite books, etc. That you can use in your own life. And I'm speaking in hushed tones cause I'm in the airport in, I don't like to yell and scream like a lunatic one in the airport lest I get a boot on my head. So the guest Mike Birbiglia, I've wanted to interview Mike for years. You can find them on Twitter at [inaudible] Bir vigs. He is one of the best known and busiest working comedians in the world, both behind and in front of the camera. His standup blends a lot of elements, different elements, theater, film, storytelling and comedy. This is of interest to me because he's been very deliberate in studying different crafts and tying them together and this is reflected in his string of successes which include sold out tours as a solar theater act. He just did a hundred cities not too long ago, New York Times bestselling books off Broadway shows, feature film TV, and much more in the last few years has work has started to appear on this American life, which is an incredible show and a podcast for those interested where he began a meaningful collaboration with the host and producer Ira glass who I'd love to have on the podcast at some point. Currently Mike is the creator, writer and star of the new film, don't think twice, which is hilarious. Heartrending

Speaker 3:          05:58          just a wonderful watch. I saw an early preview copy and it blew me away, so I highly recommended. I don't say that lightly. It's a great movie. If you've struggled with notions of feeling like a failure, hoping for success, achieving some degree of success, and then getting more or less than you bargained for, it's, it's an incredible journey. So I do recommend you check that out and had hell does he pull all of this stuff off? He seems to be juggling a million projects. I am to find out. We dig into it. So without further ado, please enjoy Mike Birbiglia.

Speaker 3:          06:34          Mike, Welcome to the show. Thanks. Damn. It's a very exciting and timely for me to be here and uh, because I, because I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm digging into all of your stuff. I'm immersing myself in. It is affecting my life in real time. So speaking with you is almost a virtual reality experience. Well, I think this is a mutual feeling since I've been a consumer and fan of your comedy for so long and I've started thinking after Elon Musk hints that we could be logically speaking players in some sophisticated future entities, video game, uh, that, um, this might all be a virtual reality. I'll be at a very sophisticated one. But if I want it to bring us back to the earth, at least as we understand it for a second, I painted a number of mutual friends of ours, Brian Koppelman of course, fame, screenwriter, all around.

Speaker 3:          07:30          Good guy. Uh, Chris Saka, both of whom had been on the podcast before because they've spent some time with you. And I wanted to ask a number of things that they brought up. So the first was from compliment and I asked very specifically, does he have any obsessions that you know of outside of comedy and one word back pizza. That's correct. So can you elaborate on this please? If that's an embarrassing, uh, session is, it's simple, you know, it's, it's, it's bread and cheese and sauce. I mean, if that, hearing you say that makes me realize how simple of a human being I am. I have a joke for my first album to drink Mike, which is, I love pizza so much. I would marry, it would, it would just be an elaborate ploy to eat her whole family at the reception, but it's a [inaudible]. So seven, so stupid.

Speaker 3:          08:23          Yeah. I love pizza. I think it's just, you know, it's the simplicity of it. It's from my childhood. It's, Eh, there's no deeper meaning other than my, by the time my mom raised me, um, that's, that's Friday and saying that because I was raised by my mother and father, but my mother was around more often. Um, she really kind of gave up on parenting and ordered pizza a lot. Yeah. You know, like she didn't want to cook that much then, so she'd just be like, let's just order pizza. So just got very used to it and now I figure, well, in my adulthood I might as well be a connoisseur and have good pizza. So what now qualifies for you is good pizza. If you could have one type of pizza delivered to you. And I'm sure there are many options, but a is, are you a deep dish? Are you a New York style thin crust? What are we talking? Yeah. Yeah, I think there's two kinds of pizza that I liked most. One is New York, New York, uh, thin crust, uh, coal oven, and um, places like Arturo's and Lucali. Uh, Lewd. So, and then I have this odd, you know, from my childhood, just in Massachusetts, there's a ton of Greek people.
