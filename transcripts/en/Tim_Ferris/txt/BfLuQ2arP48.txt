Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey folks, we're going to talk about meditation for a second. I get a lot of questions about how to start meditating. Keeping in mind that I had a, a very severe allergy to the word and concept of meditation for a very long time, more than a decade, and I've only really consistently started meditating and, uh, implemented meditating for the last two to three years. There are few easy ways to get started, but before I talk about that, what is meditation? There are a few ways you can look at it. I think the simplest way to look at it as a type a personality is either as a warm bath for your mind so that you relax in such a way. Maybe it's only 10% to reduce your anxiety so you can be more effective and productive, less reactive, in other words, don't get carried away by knee jerk emotions and judgments, obsessing on the past, something that happened or something in the future planning, etc.

Speaker 1:          00:56          You're able to actually single task and focus. That is one of the outcomes, one of the benefits of different types of meditating. All right. And that can take the form of something very short or something a little more involved. I'll talk about both the other, and this is why I think meditation can be viewed in a way as stoic training or a in some ways similar to CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy because the objective is to help you to observe your state and your thoughts so that you are less controlled by them. What does this mean? I'll use an analogy that, uh, I think was originally shared with me by Andy Puddicombe, uh, who is the founder of something called headspace, which I'll talk about in a second, which is the difference in effect being, say, standing out in the storm, getting pelted with rain and hail and wind and staying in your eyes and so on, being soaking wet or standing inside, looking through the glass at the storm.

Speaker 1:          02:00          The ladder is meditation the way I've put it before, which is slightly different. It's the difference between being in the washing machine or standing outside looking into the washing machine. And when you have that somewhat detached observer perspective, you can just be much calmer, much more appreciative, and ultimately effective. I do not think that meditation causes you to lose your edge. This was a concern of mine and I think it's a concern of a lot of type a driven people. But even if it did cause you to lose saying 10% who cares ultimately are trying to succeed and make more money and do all these things, build a bigger business to improve the quality of life for yourself, for others. And you achieve that I think more directly, uh, in many cases by even if you had to take, say, a 10% haircut on your edge by improving your present state awareness by, uh, much, much more, 50 to a hundred percent.

Speaker 1:          02:56          So let's jump into a couple of options, right? So if you're not a dog, because dogs are always present, state aware, then you need some human tools. One option, and this is the way I started very early on, meditating was listening to one song. So find one song that puts you into a good mood and in the morning all you're going to do is sit comfortably. So this could be sitting in a chair, feet on the floor, just like this. Hands in your lap, you generally you're going to want some type of backs and forth. Uh, you do not need a dog chewing on a squeaky toy. So I may intervene molecule here, camp or you can sit like this, which is how I tend to sit when I meditate. So this is not full lotus, this is half lotus, not even half load. It's really just one foot tucked into the crease of my calf and thigh.

Speaker 1:          03:53          And then I'm going to kind of pull the butt cheeks. So then I have a nice little seat here, back flat and then my hands are either going to be in my lap like so or I will actually post my hands on my thighs like this, which can also help if you have a tendency of slouching to keep your back straight. All right, listen to one song. For me it was a, we're going to party like it's 1999 prince. It's hard to be as stressed out worrying about things. If you listen to that song, trust me, you can pick whatever poison you like, but this was shared with me by Kemal Robert Kahn and he suggested listening to one song doing nothing in particular other than listening to the song and breathing, and that's three to four minutes. That's it. So you could try that in the morning.

Speaker 1:          04:39          That was one of the first approaches I took. The second approach, which I think is very, very effective and best for many people is some form of guided meditation. This means that instead of sitting by yourself and being completely dependent on whatever's happening in your mind and developing that skill of observation, you're listening to something. And that could be any number of different types of audio. So one would be, and there are many different types and recorded guided meditations by people like Sam Harris. So same harris.org he is a neuroscience phd or Tara Brock said Tara Brock, B R, a, c h who I've had on the podcast and fair shell has a fantastic audio called the 2010 summer smile meditation. You can find it for free and some incredible folks like Maria Popova for instance, who runs brain pickings, listened to that every morning and credit it with a really changing their lives.

Speaker 1:          05:38          So those are two you can find immediately just searching right after this video. You can also use guided meditation that is more progressive. It's almost like weight training. There's progressive resistance or progressive difficulty and there are many good options out there. So I've used say headspace for weeks and weeks at time. Uh, it is a very easy way to meditate. Also, if you're, say sitting in a plane or sitting in a car and you can drop in your ear phones and you're good to go, another would be calm. There are a number of different varieties and options here. Let's say that you've listened this far in. You're like, God, I just, I'm not some hippy woo person. I just want to perform better. Really don't care about this thing that you're calling meditation. Okay, well I have an option for you because even in my own mind, I wonder when I see the benefits of meditation, which are generally better sleep, less dependence on caffeine, you become much more sensitive to things like caffeine and alcohol.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Uh, better ability to execute and focus on the important things. So maybe I'm not doing a hundred things. I'm doing 20, but the 20 or better thought through and more important, in fact, uh, I wonder though, is the benefit coming from simply sitting with really good posture for 10 to 20 minutes? Is it coming from the breathing? Is it coming from closing my eyes and doing the breathing? Is it coming from the exercise that I'm doing inside my own head river that might be, or something else? I happen to think a lot of it is from the breathing. All right? Now if you then want to skip meditation, you could download an APP called apnea trainer, uh, which has pranayama breathing and it is designed for free divers. I do not recommend doing any of these breathing exercises before getting in water. You can cause yourself a lot of trouble unless you have highly qualified professional instruction.

Speaker 1:          07:27          Okay. But the apnea trainer, which was introduced to me by Gabby Reese, who's married to Laird Hamilton, so Gabby, incredible world class athlete in her own right. And then layered, who is the, I think most people would say the undisputed King of Big Wave Surfing at least was for decades, introduced me to this and it will have you do different types of breathing patterns and we'll count you down. So it might say five seconds. Inhale five second, hold ten second, exhale, five second holds. That would be one type that you could use plenty amo or you could do something like five seconds. Inhale 22nd, hold ten second exhale. And then back to repeat that cycle and just listening to the counting and breathing along with it. I find to be extremely calming and centering. Uh, I almost do all of my meditation earlier in the day, in the morning. I try to do it before turning on the phone.

Speaker 1:          08:21          So if you look at my phone right now, well first it was a coyote on it, but that's a longer story. There is an airplane icon up here in the corner because I almost always have my phone on airplane mode when I go to bed. It's an airplane mode and I try not to turn it on because you then you get the barrage of bullets, IEE, text messages, and different notifications, which immediately puts you into a reactive mode. So before that, I like to meditate, feed my pooch, et cetera. And then, and only then, maybe after some journaling, turn on the phone. All right, other options for meditation if you really want to into it. What caused it to finally stick for me? And now I can play around with all these different options. But what really got me to meditate consistently was taking a class and I took a transmittal meditation class.

Speaker 1:          09:07          That's tm.org. These are not cheap. I think there's somewhere between a thousand and $2,000, which is in my mind, kind of silly. Uh, but Rick Rubin, legendary music producer had asked me if I'd ever tried TM at one point. And then, uh, I took his advice, but I, I, I looked into it and I decided that I don't want to have to pay 1000 bucks for someone to give me a month from what the hell's a mantra? Anyway, it's very skeptical, but continued to be very, very stressed out. And then Chase Jarvis, it was a very well known photographer and CEO of critical and creative, live creative, live.com. Check it out. It's fantastic. I said, what do you have to lose? You can afford it. So even if it ends up being a complete waste of money now he was the second person saying, I do TM twice a day.

Speaker 1:          09:56          Why not just do it? You can afford to lose it even if it's a total waste of time. So I did. And Lo and behold, having someone to be accountable to who was teaching me every day, generally during lunch hour and in between sessions was giving me the homework assignment of to meditation sessions, which I then had to report back on it, discuss with sed teacher. It was enough social pressure to get me to finally do it twice a day for four or five days, and at that point that started an unbroken streak. I want to say I have about a year and a half of meditating at least once a day, often twice a day. So that was really, I would say, one of the tipping points for me, if you want to get the gist of TM, and there's some weird aspects of the organization that I'm not a huge fan of, but it's, it's surprisingly secular.

Speaker 1:          10:43          Once you get past the first meeting and the first meeting, you have to bring fruit and flowers and they make an offering to the founder and it's a little culty. But once you get past that, then it's like, okay, what do you do? If you're in a hotel and room service comes in and you're halfway through meditation, what do you do? Do you stop? Do you talk to them? Do you just ignore them? What are the coping mechanisms? So it's very tactical, practical in my experience. Uh, but they insist that you need someone sort of as life support indefinitely to teach UTM. The basics are, you get a mantra, uh, I think they're probably all two syllables. And if you want it to get a flavor for what that type of meditation is like, although I do think there's incredible value in having a teacher who holds you accountable, you could take, and they would disagree with this, but you could take some two syllable word could be nonsense or not.

Speaker 1:          11:34          You could use nature, right? Nature, nature, nature, and say that over and over and literally you're effectively just repeating that ad nauseum for the period of time in which you're doing the meditation for trends and the meditation. And the generally recommend 20 minutes, first thing in the morning, and then 20 minutes, let's say, is chase does it right before dinner. All right? Uh, I almost always just do the morning meditation. Back in the day I was more diligent about doing it twice a day. I do think there's a lot of value there, but if you just get it in the morning, there is a lot of value to be had. And beyond that, I would say if you wanted to start super small, you could just do an experiment and the experiment is not 20 minutes in the morning, not 30 minutes, twice a day. It's not a long guided meditation, nothing like that.

Speaker 1:          12:26          And by the way, the apps I mentioned are generally a modifiable in terms of duration. So you do 10 minutes, 15. I did, I did 10, four weeks at a time when I was on book deadline for instance. But let's make it even shorter. What you could try. They're two different types. So one is something that I started doing for myself whenever I would get anxious or I felt myself may be getting angry or uh, a ground swell of emotion that I felt was unpleasant or unproductive, I would take what I call the three breaths break. So three rough break is exactly what it sounds like. You stop what you're doing.

Speaker 1:          13:04          That's one. Just do that three times and it's amazing how well that diffuses what could otherwise become really stupid or rash decisions, uh, and pretty easy. So try to remember to do a three breath break and you could do that for a day or two. And very important, set that intention in the morning set that is a clear objective for the day. And then at night review how often you used it, when you could have used it when you didn't. This type of pre and post game is very important. If you're going to do an experiment with something very small like that. And then I would say the next you could test, and this was in my latest book, tools of titans, but the basic gist, this is a, I believe his loving kindness meditation. But forget about the label because it sounds too woo woo and it's weird sounding, but, uh, Meng, so chade Meng ton, who was previously at Google's, one of the very early engineers, he developed a course at Google available to employees called, I think it was search inside yourself.

Speaker 1:          14:04          And it quickly became the most popular course within Google. Thousands of employees. There's a waitlist for I think six months. And I taught many different tools laid to mindfulness and meditation and one of them which end, he tells a story that is in tools of titans about a woman who tried it. I'd never done meditation before and she said, I had my best day in seven years. Okay, well what provoked that? It's a very simple approach and I've heard said a number of people have said before that, uh, I think Andy I mentioned before has also said 10 minutes of meditating on other people or the wider world is worth 10 hours of meditating on yourself. All right, so let's assume that's true. One very easy way to test that out is when you're doing, say you're three breath break or you just take a few minutes, five minutes to sit down and in the morning for instance, or whenever you're feeling stressed out, think about a few people you're grateful for and then wish them to be happy.

Speaker 1:          15:05          That's it. So you just imagine three people you're really grateful for. They could be new relationships, old relationships, maybe childhood friends who haven't seen in a really long time, teachers for long ago. Think about them and then you're just going to wish them happiness and hope that they are happy and hold that in your mind for a few minutes. It sounds so silly and so simple. Uh, yet that is what this woman did where she was in her office. And I think every hour she thought of a coworker and wish them happiness. And she did that for a few hours and I had the best day in the office I've had in seven years. So you can try that also. Very, very simple. So if you're like, ah, I don't want to think about my breath or my, this, my, that, track my thoughts, I'm too scattered rent, blah, blah. Okay, fine.

Speaker 1:          15:49          Just think about a handful of other people, two or three and uh, wish them happiness. It's so simple. I did this when I was finishing tools of titans or I was about two thirds of the way through and I was overseas and I did a sauna every night because a bunch of my guests do is every night. So I started doing it and I would sit there and it's sometimes we doing editing by hand. I get too sweaty, get to a point where I couldn't do that. And I would sit there and I'll do this loving kindness meditation. And I remember getting to the end of the week and thinking to myself and asking, why am I so happy? I mean, you kind of know you need to fix things if you asked yourself that. But I tend to be pretty tightly wound, a very aggressive and I focused a lot more on achievement than say contentment or happiness in most of my life.

Speaker 1:          16:33          But man, that week was amazing and there were other elements as well. But the main variable that I tweaked was this tiny, tiny exercise. And so in meditation, as in everything else, I think it pays to look for the very little tweaks that have very big payoffs. So hopefully that helps. Those are a few of the things that helped me to develop a mindfulness meditation habit. And last but not least, if you meditate for a period of time and then you fall off the train, don't beat yourself up. Just get back on the train. It doesn't do any good to self flagellate because you missed one or two meditation sessions. This isn't the Olympics of meditating. So just get back on and uh, then you will see the results and you then have the recipe that you can use anytime you want. Thanks for watching guys. I hope you enjoyed it.
