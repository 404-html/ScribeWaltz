Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So I'm recording. Could you just tell me maybe what you had for breakfast? Yeah, nothing. I had nothing for breakfast. I never eat breakfast just once a day. All right, we're going to talk about that for sure. Let me just pause this optimal

Speaker 2:          00:00:18       and start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism living.

Speaker 1:          00:00:39       This episode is brought to you by audible, which I've used for years. I love audiobooks and I've two to recommend right off the bat. Number one is press my favorite audio book of all time, and that is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman. The only audiobook I've wanted to immediately listen to a second time. As soon as I finished. It's amazing. You will thank me. The graveyard book. The second is vagabonding by Rolf Potts, which had a huge impact on my life and formed the basis for a lot of what became the four hour workweek. So all you need to do to get your free audio book and a Free 30 Day trial is go to audible.com forward slash 10 and you can choose one of those two books, the graveyard book bag, a bonding or more than 180,000 audio programs. So that could be a book. That could be a magazine, that could be a newspaper, could be a class.

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       It's that easy. Go to audible.com forward slash Tim, that's audible.com forward slash Tim and grab a book. Enjoy. This episode is brought to you by a new sponsor. So listen up folks. This is a good one because have you ever wanted to be as powerful as a mullet wearing Ninja from 1980s movie or as flamboyant as big gay Al Big Al in south park or as sleek as a black panther in the Amazon on the hunt wealth? There's great news because I've been testing this product that you wrap around your genitals and it makes you feel like a superhero and it is called [inaudible]. I've spent the last two to three weeks traveling with underwear from these guys and they are comfy. I got to tell you, it feels like a Geisha has giving your groin a hug and it's not just for dudes. But if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim, that's m, e, e, u n, d, I e s.com forward slash Tim, you can see all of the underwear that I've been wearing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       There's some pretty ridiculous ones. And I will also highlight my favorite, you'll probably be able to guess which it is. These underwear made from micro model, which is extruded from Austrian beechwood trees in the Alps. Yes, fancy. And it's two times softer than cotton, scientifically tested using the Calamata method developed in Kyoto. You know, those Japanese very crafty and uh, I will say a few things. Number one, if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim, you get to see all of these spectacular underwear that I've been wearing. And I am a bit of an underwear connoisseur, socks, fashion sense with sweatpants, not so much underwear. I understand. So check them out and if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim you will also be able to see lots of hot ladies wearing me undies, female underwear. And that's just a lot of goodness for both the men and the women out there. So check it out. Me undies.com forward slash Tim, I love these underwear and a, I'm going to be packing tonight probably six to 12 pair to take with me to Australia. They're great. Check em out. [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       Hello Lemurs and leprechauns. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers, whether they are actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger, military strategists or generals like Stanley McChrystal, chess prodigies like Josh Waitzkin or in this particular case, a miracle worker of sorts. In fact you could say he is a daredevil Wim Hoff, otherwise known as the ice man is a Dutch world record holder, adventurer, certainly daredevil and he's nicknamed the ice man for his ability to withstand extreme cold. He is creator of the Wim Hoff method and holds more than 20 world records. He is in my mind the outlier of outliers, not because he does so many absurd things and proves that these impossibles are in fact possible, but he routinely asked scientists to scrutinize and validate these feats. That's what makes him very, very unique and very interesting for this type of conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       What are some of his feet? Well, I'm in 2007 he climbed path, the death zone, the altitude on Mount Everest, which is around a 7,500 meters wearing nothing but shorts. 2009 he completed a full marathon above the polar circle and Finland in temperatures close to negative 20 degrees Celsius. Again dressed and nothing but shorts. He holds the Guinness World record for the longest ice bath, which is around at one hour, 53 minutes and 12 seconds, but it's not just cold. He has run full marathons in the Namib Desert without any water. He has also had toxins injected into himself under doctor supervision and demonstrated that he can effectively control his autonomic immune response. This is crazy talk a, these are things that fly in the face of many textbooks and now he is featured in textbooks himself because he has documented all of this and it's not just a whim specialty, he's not a mutant.

Speaker 1:          00:05:13       Uh, he is able to train others to achieve many of these same effects and abilities in some cases with just four days of training. So we'll dig into all of this and more. I loved this conversation. He is a human Guinea pig of human Guinea pigs. Certainly it makes me feel like an amateur. So without further ado, please enjoy my conversation with Wim Hoff. Welcome to the show women. I'm so pleased to have you. Thank you for welcoming me. Thank you very much. I've been a fan for quite a few years because we have, as we mentioned before, we started recording a mutual friend in ray crow. Nice. And he was in my second book. So I looked very closely at cold exposure and of course you, the ice man came up over and over again. So it's really nice to finally chat with you. It's, I feel like it's been a long time coming and also had to pass guests or three past guests on this podcast, a Laird Hamilton and Brian McKenzie and also, um, Gabby Reese, Laird's wife who are big fans of your methods and techniques who'd been practicing it. So they are, uh, you, you have a lot, a lot of fans out there. I'm sure listening as well. And I thought we could just start with, uh, your name. I've always loved your name. Is Wim your full name?

Speaker 3:          00:06:32       Yes, I am

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       in does that, it doesn't have any particular meaning or how did your parents choose that name?

Speaker 3:          00:06:39       Wait, ms, a common name and a in Holland in the Netherlands at, but I looked it up and, uh, it says it's the protector of the people, you know, any name has got some logical, uh, uh, roots to with my name is, uh, the protector of people. My brother's name. Who Was it? My twin brother is Andray Andre on phone, say a Andrei. Andrew. Andrew is the protector of goods. So who's better? I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       I suppose, I suppose you need both types of protection, right? You have a such a fascinating story and you have a lot of accolades, a lot of records. I think more than 20 world records at this point it seems, uh, what was the first world record that you said

Speaker 3:          00:07:33       at first was in Paris? Uh, just staying or half hour in a immersed and ice. And uh, 12 days later I repeated, uh, uh, the record time. I make it a Ma Ma made it a an hour in a Hollywood actually.

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       Yes. And I saw one also, I mean, you've, you've been, you spend a lot of time in ice baths and I've, uh, uh, largely influenced by you and a handful of other people. Tim Noakes, ray and a huge fan of ice baths in my fans. Always complained about it. But I've seen you in so many containers full of ice. I saw one where it looks like there was a lot of Chinese or Japanese in the background. Uh, what is, what has been the most challenging cold exposure, uh, experience that you've had, whether it's for records or anything else?

Speaker 3:          00:08:24       Maybe, uh, losing my sight while I was swimming underneath, Eh, a eyes deck of a almost one meter and I had no goggles on. So a lot of side at 35 meters, something like a 40 yards. And uh, I lost the whole and uh, yeah, I think it's like she, she had happened, it happened over there, right. That Meta eyes, that above. So, uh, yeah, that was some great experience. And another one was, uh, losing my, uh, way, uh, on Mount Everest in shorts and a at a like 18,000 feet in a, in a blizzard, in a, like a wideout. So things like that happen. Yeah. And uh, they are challenging, but then it throws me back to, you know, the depth of myself to a, which is trust and confidence in, I got it.

Speaker 4:          00:09:27       What do you say to yourself in one of those moments? So I guess physiologically, did your, did your retinas just freeze or when you were swimming under the ice deck in a moment like that, when many people would panic? I mean, did you panic? If, so, what was the mental self talk when you realize that was happening?

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       Very interesting. This, the stress level at the, at that moment is absent, is not there. I'm dealing with the situation. Um, Eh, it has been shown in the university that our stress levels, their stress hormone levels are able to be raised, eh, lying in bed more than somebody in fear for the first time going into a bungee jump.

Speaker 4:          00:10:16       Oh, go and do a better job doing a bunch of jump for the first time.

Speaker 3:          00:10:20       Yeah. Yeah. But not me by because the bang, the jump, yeah, you're attached. But very unexpected situations in, in nature, like a blizzard or swimming beneath the ice and uh, losing a, the whole, because your eyesight is gone. Things like that. Or uh, climbing without gear, steep mountains and uh, having cramps. And what do you do at that moment? That, that's exactly what I learned, how to raise consciously, the stress hormone level, purely controlled. And I'm able to deal with the situation at that moment without panicking. And I think that's one of the crucial findings which could benefit for human mankind as it is, you know, a very subjected to a stress all the time. Panicking, having fair and all that. And I learned in nature how to deal with that. And the cold brought me, uh, but uh, brought me that science brought me that, uh, knowledge, wisdom actually

Speaker 4:          00:11:29       and the, the raising of stress hormones. So, so controlling something that has long been thought to be part of the autonomous nervous system, something that you have no control over. Right. And we'll get to the breathing because breathing is very interesting since it's both autonomous, but you can, you can consciously control it and practice different methods. Uh, I think it was, it was certainly in the vice documentary that recently came, which I recommend to everyone and I'll link to in the show notes, but was it in 2011 that you were injected with some type of virus or bacteria? To see if you could control the immune response that was at the Dutch. I'm going to mispronounce this, the Radboud University, exactly. Wrap out to university in Holland,

Speaker 3:          00:12:11       a intensive care nuclear science. I, uh, underwent a, an experiment and they injected me with the endo talk scene with that toxin actually, which is a part of a bacteria and that creates a very dramatic, a immune response. And as we have no control over the immune response in our body, they thought I was not able to do with as well as expected because nobody showed to be able to serve, press the immune response because it is part of the autonomic nervous system. And uh, nobody is able to do that until now. I showed that I was very able within a quarter of hour instead of ours, uh, suffering from uncontrolled shivering, fever, headaches and all that, uh, I show within a quarter of our, uh, to have a control complete over the symptoms and uh, also decide to kins which is our, which are the flammatory beings and the blood created by the immune response.

Speaker 3:          00:13:25       And I showed in the blood and by blood results to suppress them dramatically, uh, within a quarter. Then they told me, okay, but you are an exception that confirms the rule because you yeah, yeah. You have been trainings so many years. You are the iceman, you do exceptional features, but nobody is able to do that without that proper training of so many years. And I told him no, I can train them within 10 days. And then the professor was really challenged because if this group would show to be able within 10 days, uh, to uh, be able to influence deeply into the autonomous nervous system related to the immune system, then that's for the first time in the scientific history. So, but he, he saw the indication of the possibility but still thought those guys are not going to be able to do that within 10 days.

Speaker 3:          00:14:35       You know what, Eh, it wasn't within 10 days. It wasn't with four days of training that I made them able to undergo the same experiments that that means that the injection of the endotoxin and have them within a quarter of hour completely control over their immune system related to the autonomous nervous system. So they showed a hundred percent score of everybody to be able within a couple of days to go to tap into the autonomous nervous system related to the immune system and yeah, and the training about a trading be a prior to it, Eh, we add our beers, you know, in the evening. And there are a lot of music and very relaxed and their mindset. I said, I guys, uh, probably, uh, you, uh, you guys are the new gladiators, Eh, where we are going to win the worst war ever, which, uh, produced, uh, much, uh, the most casualties, agony, pain and all that.

Speaker 3:          00:15:54       And that's the bacteria that's the back. So that's the virus and we gonna win this war. Are you with me? I, that's the way I talked to them. And so they had a mindset. So in the evening we had a relaxed, they, it was like a hippie movement and the, but this is a new revolution at in four days time. They were able at the fourth day without prior experience in the cold, they were able to go in shorts at bye bye minus stand. That's about, I dunno, Eh, uh, Fahrenheit Celsius. This a selfie. I mean it's freezing all in the twenties. Yes, in one. And then, uh, for hours and hours we were going up hill and up to mountain and we arrived at the summit after hours and it was minus 27 minus 27 Celsius. That that is more than a minus. And then twenties, it's probably 10 or so, something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:17:05       And we danced to Harlem Shaygo there. Then I knew these guys, these guys are ready in four days time when they will be internalized in the, in the hospital and uh, and injected with the endotoxin. They will be able because I feel when somebody is, uh, back into its natural state of his or hers physiology and I know how to do that, the cold trade me, they called is my teacher. And with the, with the subjects, I'm so curious to ask because, uh, the, uh, I mean I am certainly not as proficient as you are in any of these techniques, but I've, I've

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       enjoyed experimenting over the last 10 years in writing about these short experiments, whether it's related to breath holding with David Blaine or, or, or other aspects. Um, obviously you're a professional and I am not, but I'm so I'd be very curious to hear you perhaps elaborate for instance, on the first day of training with these subjects bef uh, in preparation to be injected four days later. Sure. Uh, what did the first day of training look like for them?

Speaker 3:          00:18:18       Um, just in the morning at ease. At eight o'clock without food intake, we do a breathing and they lie on the ground. Oh. Because that's the most relaxed pose. And uh, if you are relaxed, you are able to store up a hold mode. Oh, a lot more oxygen than when intention or in post you. So I say it a it just lay down and relax. Now we are going to begin just breathe in deeply and let go. Breathe in deeply. Let go, make it a rhythm. Breathe in deeply. Let go, not fully out but fully and and let go. And uh, where you repeat that about 30, 40 times until nice indication. So symptoms a comma by and that it means lightheadedness.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:19:23       Loose and the body feeling loose in the body. Tingling contractions. That's because carbon dioxide goes out. Oxygen is a roaming freely through the body and the Ph levels, rice, they are up to me. Lysed so they get to their best condition and uh, that's proven, that's proven. And they saw a, when we do this, uh, they, so they, so all these results chemically then once you feel positively charged with all the symptoms of lightheadedness, feeling loose, contractions and tingling in the buddy asked him, just breathe in deeply, let go. And now the last time, breathe in deeply and had to go after letting go after exhalations stop, reframe from breathing. There is no need. We get a whole lot of oxygen and a measurement devices are not able to detect how much it's more than a hundred percent that's my opinion. But devices still are not able to detect that.

Speaker 3:          00:20:41       They only can go up to a hundred percent as an essay, but there are a hundred the body is able to store up more oxygen than measurement devices have now are able to uh, measure. So then after one and a half minutes, Eh, then you see that the measurement device shows 100% and then it goes dramatically down afterwards. And you're using a pulse oximeter, like something that you clip on your, yes, Paul's ex. So you need a heart beat, you have a heartbeat and you have the saturation of the oxygen in inside the blood. So the amount of oxygen, so after one and a half minute GC with everybody that the saturation of the blood is going down a, you know, people is CLPD that that's lung diseases and all that. They, they suffer from real severe. See your per diem. When they have 85, we go to 90 to 80, 70, 60, 50, people die at 50 and 40, uh, 40% saturation in the blood.

Speaker 3:          00:21:55       We go past, we get, we'll go even to 30. And then the device measurement device, the accumulator shuts down. It is not measuring animal, but we even go past that one. Now why don't you, why don't the subjects pass out at this point? They don't pass out, eh, because they are outlined. I say they're, the Ph degrees, eh, are really perfect at that moment. And in, instead of a person who's dying is very acidic. So that's the difference. So, uh, because we are so alkaline, people maybe sometimes are able to pass out, but just two seconds or three seconds because they get, uh, they are out of their conditioned control, eh, but, uh, in a, in a, you know, after exercising, they have a re a regained, not only control in those moments and in those situations they, uh, they win a new part in the brain.

Speaker 3:          00:23:02       They get a very deep in the brain and it's all new terrain. It's like baby a baby has no problem with, uh, with our legs. But there are no metorik motorical neurones to the legs, yes. Tab. So we are going into different parts of the brain where there is, where the guy or the, the, the, uh, the girl that has been, so it's logic that the people are able to pass out, but nothing happens because they are alkaline. So they just wake up and mostly eh, or mostly almost always they wake up very happy and it's like a drug experience. So, but that's besides of the real effect, um, uh, trying to, uh, not, not try, which we showed scientifically is to be able to tap into the immune system in all the layers. Those are three layers and normally, eh, we are not able to get into the second and the third layer.

Speaker 3:          00:24:13       And I say, now we have found a key to the second and the third layer that means the nonspecific immune system and the specific adaptive immune system. And that makes us looking to disease completely different because our abilities so much more. And, uh, uh, we have been, um, uh, publishing, uh, people in Boston. They published it throughout America on the university's chapter 22 on biology now. And it tells that we have tapped into the autonomous nervous system into the eight innate immune system, which was up til now, not possible. And we did at 100% with a group of nine people showing that they were very able to do it, all, all of them within a quarter of an hour and have spectacular results so that it is science now and now it needs to get to every person in the world how to tap into the deeper layers of our physiology without training, you know, years and years and years and being Joe Gibbs or being a, the super athletes and all that, no, my aim within a couple of days, we are all able to tap into the deepest layers of our physiology and reset our immune system, bring it under our will and that's my aim.

Speaker 3:          00:25:54       But then we make farm to and all that. But for say being serious, that's my goal.

Speaker 4:          00:26:02       Right. No, I was just going to say, I mean it's very hard to get the, I think you're approaching it in a very intelligent way because it's, it's very hard to get truly serious work done if you're serious all the time. So yeah, I enjoy it. It's very fascinating for me as a teacher to watch how you coach your subjects because you use beer, you have guitar and uh, I think it's very important component. Um, it, it would seem to be, and I wanted to ask you about the breathing on day one, just one more time, which is, is, is the breathing exercise on day one something that then the subjects use during the injection or before the injection or is it an exercise to prove to them that they can do more than they think they can do and it's more of a confidence builder that you use to set the tone for the rest of the training?

Speaker 3:          00:26:55       Yes. So it's a confidence builder and is very effective at the moment when something, uh, like an injection has come in and they know it will result in dramatic a immune response and they have to build up and make alert their shield or are protective, uh, uh, alliance of, uh, of defense, which is the immune system. Yes. So both, both.

Speaker 4:          00:27:25       And is this something that you can do after the fact? So for instance, uh, at this point with your, uh, your level of proficiency, if you were to contract a disease without realizing it and then to get very sick, would you be able to reverse that or is it something that needs to be a, is that she, does the shield need to be activated beforehand in order for you to control that autonomous, so-called autonomous response?

Speaker 3:          00:27:54       Interesting. Very nice. [inaudible] it's both preventive and healing. So once a specific hormone or a molecule must be generated to get to a, an uh, an, an invader nonself invader in the body, which could be a bacteria, a virus, or a back sell, which got through the first two lines of defense. Then the third line is more specific, but it takes normally like weeks or sometimes it's not traceable because uh, Eh, an invader is mutated. But uh, we have now, uh, a method that is able to tap into the third layer and make the nuns are the specific adaptive immune system, uh, rapidly active even after something comes in. So it's both a preventive, uh, but is also when you feel you become sick, so a, an invader has gotten in then you are still a very able to restore the balance with it. Got It. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:29:12       And um, the, if we're looking at the, the explanation that the scientists have at this point for your ability and your subject's ability to protect themselves or shield themselves, uh, it seemed like one hypothesis was you being able to increase I think noradrenaline or norepinephrine levels in the body. Uh, do you agree with that or do you think there are other, uh, do you have other series? I

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       do, I do. I'd love to hear it. It's like if you have HIV and I'm, the immune system is still looking for answers up till a moment. That it is not able to specify anymore what's going on. And then we get aids, eh, that, that means that all the defense systems are shut down. Now we have shown by nor a benefit print and no adrenaline, adrenaline, eh, that we can, uh, uh, suppress the inflammation that means the flammatory bodies and creating an immune response and we suppressed it. That would be like a shutting down the immune system that makes us, uh, following the scientific logic that makes us more vulnerable. No what we do. And they still got to find out. But I just use my natural logic and you can read a poem in the, in the, in the, in the papers that we have found a way to awaken the third line, which normally takes weeks or months to, uh, to, uh, find the specific hormone or molecule, which Dan is, uh, going, uh, for, or the target cell to go on the membrane and to Eh,

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       kill this out. So That's interesting. It's almost like internal drug development. You're trying to find the lock that, I'm sorry, the key that fits the proper lock, but you're doing it internally. Yeah. Normally it takes a very long time biologically to, to, to uh, sort of, uh, to conclude with. But you're accelerating that process. Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:31:32       And then days our bones are not needed anymore because there's specific hormone, there's specific, a molecule gets on the cell membrane and then all this, uh, uh, like fire, uh, people, uh, which is nor adrenaline gets through out the system and a pen offering as well. And they suppress the inflammation, the action. And uh, but that is only possible when the target is already a annihilated when the target has a specific molecule on it because of the third line of defense. Right. And that's that, that's what we found. We found a way and its ultimate Dr Kevin Tracey from Manhasset New York who tells them he is very much easier now authority in the biochemistry. And uh, I worked with him in 2007 and I showed, I was able in is a institute, uh, to suppress or to influence the vague nerve,

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       which is the Vegas nerve. Yeah. Yes. And now, uh, he told in nature, he told immunity does not come without neuro regulation. They found a way.

Speaker 4:          00:32:57       So what do you now, for instance, I was a, I did my, uh, undergraduate for a very short period of time. Uh, in college I studied neuroscience. And I remember when I was in college, there was a professor there who determined that for instance, the neurons in the hippocampus could actually be regenerated. And this was very, very big, big news because people had assumed for a very long time in a number of parts of the brain that neurons could not be degenerated or regenerated. Basically as you got older, you just lost neuro neuronal function and it could not be restored. Now we know that's not true. Right? And so you're having this, a similar experience where you are proving to people that things are possible that were thought impossible. What, what do you think, what other impossibles do you think we will prove our possible in the next say, five years in your kind of area of experimentation?

Speaker 3:          00:33:52       Very, very nice. A very good question. Uh, I think depression for example, and the brace itself and we are able to tap into the brain's and do so much more influence. So much more, uh, uh, which is related to the hypothalamus and the pineal gland, the pituitary gland, the hippocampus and the Amygdala, the seed of emotion. All these are part and around the brainstem, which is the reptilian brain, the primitive brain. And because of our comfort way of living and behavior, Eh, this part doesn't get enough a stimulation,

Speaker 4:          00:34:40       right? Got untrained. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:34:43       That doesn't get the stimulation nor oxygen. So there is a certain kind of deregulating p h level we are going on. It's just to a lack of oxygen. There is no action, no stimulation. So in time it begins to malfunction. And that's uh, yeah, that's actually a, yeah, sort of a logic. So we suffer from a whole lot par example of depression in the Western world because, uh, because we go too much into, uh, the, the NEOCORTEX, the, the superficial brain, the new brain, and we have to do all kinds of things and that at that lines and worries and we cannot stop it and it consumes all the energy. What I do and learn is to go into the brainstem again. They said that the simplicity of our reptilian brain, the primitive brain, the brainstem, which is related to all these beautiful eh, glance over that, which is the pineal gland, pituitary gland and the, and the controller of ours, which is the hypothalamus and the seat of emotion itself, which is the Amygdala.

Speaker 3:          00:36:03       It's all there. And so I found a way to get into that and show just by this example of hours to lying in bed, people are able to produce more adrenaline than somebody who is in fear going into a bungee jump for the first time. You see what I mean? That that means fair emotion, uncontrollable emotions and fear. We are able to control that. And that's because we tap controlled into the brainstem and produce any adrenaline or epinephrine or, uh, all these, all these, uh, uh, gland, uh, now not plants hormones we need. And it's the pineal gland in the, in the finally, uh, which is the control of all the other glands in our body. So we are able now to tap into that. So the coming five years, I want to eradicate a depression. I want to eradicate, Eh, the, the, Eh, yeah, actually a disease.

Speaker 3:          00:37:18       I know a big words, but we are into that. I'm not only into, that is a also professors, biochemists who stamp my point and they see it's so simple, so accessible and so effective. But it needs to be translated into our infrastructure of a thinking as well as of interests. But it needs to cooperate with schooling. Now we got on a university that's nice. It's coming top down because our, if the US universities are taking it on than soon, all the universities and the world will follow. So we find the, okay, I rest my 0.4 for now

Speaker 1:          00:38:04       and with the, uh, so with, for instance, depression. So there, I'm sure there are a lot of people listening who have, uh, bouts with depression or even extended depression.

Speaker 3:          00:38:16       Yes. No control over their mood, right? No control over the brainstem. Right? So let's break it back to the brainstem,

Speaker 1:          00:38:23       right? So, for instance, you know, I find that it's very helpful for me at least to use cold exposure. And whether that's cold showers or ice bath, uh, it

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       has a tremendous mood elevating effect or maybe mood, a balancing effect that depending on on how we want to explain it. But for someone who is feeling depressed, what are some simple things that you would recommend that they try potentially get into conscious breathing, deeper breathing, and be consciously doing that? Uh, it showed in the university that I was able just, you know, about consciousness just by thinking that I was going into an experiment. I raised sell on cell level, the metabolic activity in the cell with 300% just by thinking that our minds, so our mind should be with people who are depressed. They just got lost. They have no control. So they have to regain control by consciously going into breathing. Breathing brings about deeper breathing, uh, brings about a better ph level in the body, but not only in the body. Also in the mind and the, Eh, the right Ph level will make the neurotransmitters.

Speaker 5:          00:39:57       That's your mind, eh, electrical signals, finally, uh, work better. And then you are able to do or learn to direct these neurotransmitters or thoughts the mind itself, uh, consciously with the right Ph degree. So, Eh, we make it simple and we say conscious breathing all the time cause you lost track and it takes energy. It takes your mind and you got to bring back your mind under your control. And uh, I mean this I think is related to a broader topic of compulsive behavior, right? Or people who have automatic behaviors that are not serving them. And one of those is oftentimes eating or overeating. And before we started recording, I asked you what you had for breakfast and he said nothing because you eat once per day. So I could you describe what your daily eating ritual is? I eat after six o'clock in the afternoon and that's already for 35 years. And there is, I got a lot of energy and you know why you have a lot of allergies now? Energy. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. Cut It. Maybe allergies as well. Women, you know, uh, okay, just to make fine.

Speaker 5:          00:41:26       Thank you. And I have to have wine next time we do this thing. He's very outdated. How are you? Good. Uh, Eh, the thing is by better breathing conscious breathing, you made this chemical process in the, in the cell happened, which is called aerobic dissimilation. And as a, in the cell production to make energy, mitochondrial energy, you need food. But if you are able to influence by better breathing, a deeper breathing, then you produce simple metabolic activity in the Mitochondria by better breathing. And that creates energy, which was the purpose of food. So food is nice. Hello? I'm here. Oh yeah, food is nice. Food is great. You should do it with a lot of love and they're having a nice time making it and the, because that's the energy you get finally a altar, but eh, Eh, Eh, like uh, me, uh, uh, it's a sort of a fast, but I have to feel your hear the scientists really gets, are going to be much more effective and the cell activity is going to be much more effective and it is using all the food and you can eat after six o'clock. I can eat what I want the other day I'm slim again. And that's making, you know, making the bodywork. But as we eat all the day long, the body is not shutting down. It's not effective. Animal doesn't go deep, doesn't go into survival mode is it's not natural again. So it's beginning to store up all the fats because it doesn't know what to do anymore because the deeper mechanisms are not working anymore. So. Yeah. And how to bring that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       And what do you usually, what do, what are some typical meals that you have after 6:00 PM

Speaker 5:          00:43:33       that uh, uh, I like pasta and I like a couple of beers too. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:43:45       sounds good. I, uh, the eating rituals are interesting. I've interviewed a number of people on this podcast including General Stanley McChrystal is a four star general and he was, he's also famous for, um, getting a lot of exercise early in the day and eating one meal per day. He's also, he's also very well known for that. Uh, you, you described the breathing exercise, uh, some of the breathing exercises that you do. Does the type of breathing that you do have anything, uh, is it similar in any ways to holotropic breathwork? If you're familiar with that? And I heard from someone, and maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, that some scientists had looked at, at whether were

Speaker 4:          00:44:31       producing or releasing more DMT during some of your, uh, breathing activities. Is that accurate or did I get some misinformation from someone? I'll just be very,

Speaker 5:          00:44:42       no, that's a professor who, right. Yeah. I don't know. A Colorado, I don't know. Uh, what is his name again? I don't, I use a, I told her the, in the field, but I had a dialogue with him and he is talking about, uh, uh, you know, I a whiskey guy on the old drugs and all this and experimenting. And I said, I told him I'm able to produce Eh, to Eh, trigger the pineal gland in a way that DMT is released. And uh, and yes, I can make people very, very happy, uh, doing, uh, oh, all these breathing exercises that that's true. But the purpose of DMT actually is to work out the subconscious wild dreaming. And the rapid eye movement sleep and the other one is, uh, when you die, then DMT is released as well as to make it more a Yanno happy, uh, going after, uh, having a, have a, have a nice time zone to the other side, something like that.

Speaker 5:          00:45:49       So there is a natural purpose for DMT, but we are, we are very, I'm very able to trigger that a, that creates a DMT. And I told him, I told him [inaudible] it's not only about the DMT, which is very nice, it's a nice drug and all that. But uh, the better part of it is if we are able to, to trigger the pineal gland, which is related directly to the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. If we are able to trigger that one and to decalcify because of our comfort way of living, uh, the, this pineal gland, then this gland is able to, to direct all the other glands. It's the only gland that is directing all the other glands and we can bring, we can narrowly connect with it without our neocortex is what we do. And it shows them that we are able to prevent from disease or bacteria coming in because we are able to activate it much more directly. Um, um, the, that's the main purpose to, Ya know, uh, looking different at what creates disease is because of our pineal gland or the brainstem is not really active animal because it's neglected because of a comfort style of living and behavior. And we want to make a shortcut and to show it that it is simple, accessible and effective.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       Well, I think the, the, the, the comfort is important to underscore because I was having a conversation with Dean Karnazes several years ago. He's a famous ultra marathoner. You guys would probably have a lot to talk about it. And uh, he, he, uh, he ran need a 50 marathons in 50 days in 50 states. He's one of those guys. And, um, he said that, uh, he lives in northern California near San Francisco where I live and he's in one of his lines and I'm, I'm, I might be paraphrasing this, but he said, you know, people now they confuse being happy with being comfortable and they think being comfortable is being happy, but that's, those are not the same thing. And, uh, I'd like to talk about discomfort for a second. So you ran a marathon in, was it death valley with no water?

Speaker 5:          00:48:18       Yes. Yeah. And that may be, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       Namibia. That's right. Even so, even more dangerous because you have snakes and whatnot. So is it possible to not, so of course, when you are submerged in ice, it's been demonstrated that you can maintain your core body temperature for a very long period of time. Uh, is it possible for you to drop your body temperature in a hot climate or have you just, is it training yourself to withstand the higher temperatures?

Speaker 5:          00:48:48       Yeah, that's exactly a boat. Actually. Your tolerance is rising and that means you are able to endure a whole lot more because you're able to influence their hormonal system. In a way that neutralizes pain signals. That's one. The other one is, uh, because of my training in the cold, I not only trained in Nicole, I trained to endure impact of temperature and those are receptors of hours which I've trained. And then because of that, which is part which is controlled by the Hypothalamus, is the thermal regulator of our body. And uh, because I trained in the cold, I trained the thermo regulation of the body then without training, without training, a meter of running and then not drinking a full marathon in the Namib desert, the eat without prior training or ever been there before. Uh, I was very able to do that because this thermal regulative, uh, mechanism, the hypothalamus I had trained in, uh, in, in the call, which is the temperature impact.

Speaker 5:          00:50:10       So I learned to deal with the temperature and you know, what, and not only the temperature, which is cold and heat, but also that prevention of oxygen. That means going up mount Everest and shorts at that means, eh, very cold out there. There is no oxygen and you need oxygen to and for combustion in the, in the cell to create heat energy and there is no oxygen. So I learned in the cold how to deal with impact on the barrel nervous system on our metabolism. That means cold deprivation of oxygen, a heat, but also stress daily stress. So the secret of our comfort as you say, and the people they are confusing, uh, like the paraphrasing this, this, this great guy, uh, of uh, northern California who is telling the truth. We are confused. We don't know animal what real confidence. Real confidence is the power to regulate. Uh, all the impacts existence in, in life. That means disease, which has impact on our body. Heat, cold deprivation of oxygen, stress in general, any stress. And we are able to control that a whole lot more. And that brings about the real comfort because if you connect yourself with all these older systems within, then you feel really good, real good. It's real connection and that at that, that's something be ago. That's why all these outdoor freaks and the idiots and at teatro like myself are doing this because we just feel good.

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       Well, it seems like it's also a feeling comfort is in a way becoming competent in discomfort, right? So you, you have a confidence that you can handle and adapt to whatever's going to come your way. A much like some of the, I suppose, you know, elite military that I've met who are or were very actually very relaxed. I mean the most, most of the high level guys I've met because they've systematically exposed themselves to discomfort so they don't fear discomfort, if that makes sense. All right.

Speaker 5:          00:52:43       Secondly, they control their stress hormone release completely, right? That's what I'm talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       Now. You speak, how many languages do you speak,

Speaker 5:          00:52:54       Ken?

Speaker 1:          00:52:55       10 that is a lot of languages. How did you learn that many languages?

Speaker 5:          00:53:01       Just be open and love to learn and that's it. I had no real teachers then, you know, people in the street and sometimes had to look for a teacher, like a Japanese teacher or, uh, they were in the Amsterdam and the Hindu teacher pounded. And, uh, so, uh, yeah. Uh, I was just interested. You are interested in life. You get to know and the never stop learning because you love it. Is there is what language of all the languages you've tried, what was the hardest for you Horace? Maybe Polish, Polish shoes because it's a complete different set of a grammatical structures.

Speaker 1:          00:53:44       I see. Polish and Nostrovia I guess I have. I bet you know that one. Yeah. Yeah. We definitely have to have a round two with some, with some wine and beer. But the, um, the next question I'd love to ask is, uh, perhaps a simple one, but why are people fat and how can people develop more brown fat and use it effectively?

Speaker 5:          00:54:14       Yes. People are being fat because it's a protective mechanism of the, of our bodies. It's actually in an answer to, to own too much impact, too much wrong chemistry going on. So it wants to make an installation that's a, that's a natural thing to do of the body. Now we are suffering from that. Now it's called obesity and being overweight and we have no control. Just bringing them back to the control. How do we do that? By, by, by this adipose Bra, Brown fat adipose, because they have a, mostly of those people, I have also an absence of brown fat because they are, have no stimulation anymore for longer time. And then there's insulation. A reflex is beginning to build up a mailed up, but actually the is telling, Hey guy, I'm trying to do my best for you, but you are not doing anything in return. And as long as you're not triggering or stimulating the adipose, the brown fat, then it circums it goes away. And, and, and that it is not able to, uh, to uh, uh, uh, to divert a white fat into energy anymore. Right? So it's gone with people with obesity, they have no brown fat animal. So there is a logic explanation to it and I know it, so they have to bring it back. And it's that whole

Speaker 1:          00:55:50       exposure primarily that would be the first step to try to cold

Speaker 3:          00:55:53       cold exposure. And that's real exposure to the elements. That's one in an adaptive way, gradual way. I mean that we are able to adapt to it, but as these mechanisms are not working really well within these people, so they have to be very uh, sensitive and, and uh, uh, gradual or going into it. And the reading, breathing is chemistry is yeah. Is

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       influencing the chemistry right here, right now. Better breathing, deeper breathing brings about better ph degree in the body, which then finally result in a faster metabolism.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       And if people are practicing this or want to pack, practice this breathing on their own, is there any particular mantra or anything they should focus on or say to themselves as they're doing this? Is any type of meditation okay. To start with? Like using an app like headspace or calm or do you have a particular recommendation? If someone said, I have 10 minutes a day, I'm willing to spend doing this. Um, what would you say to them?

Speaker 5:          00:57:01       Yeah, just have you a favorite music going on. Go really into it and go really into the breathing because it's about chemical changes and whenever you hear the right music you are able to relax more and more. Auctions in Dan is able to get into the body, which is finally changing the, the Ph levels in the body, uh, to the, to its natural state. That's what we have because we live in such a compressed society, uh, uh, too much stress going on. We do not have control of the stress we get out of our natural state. So within 10 minutes we are, I say within four minutes, just do this breathing exercise, which I teach people and do pushups, pushups without air in the lungs. You should do that.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       So you do that after the, after the exhale.

Speaker 5:          00:58:01       Yes. After, yeah, first year do like 30, like I explained deeply within, go deeply with him, Eh, look at her indications, uh, feel feeling loose in the body and lightheaded, uh, contractions a little bit tingling, that's all. Okay. Like 30 or 40 deep breaths and then letting go 40 times. Then you will arrive at that being charged with a oxygen and carbon dioxide gas got awake, Ph levels gotten up. Then you shoot breathing fully laughingo glow after exhalation, you stop and you go do pushups and you will see, you are able to do more pushups without air in the lungs because she influenced into the chemistry.

Speaker 1:          00:58:52       Hmm. That's end, uh, probably a good idea to do on a soft surface first just in case he decided to kiss the floor a little too hard. Now this is something that, uh, that layered in his guys had been working on as well. I mean, a lot of these guys are working in doing pushups or stationary bike. Very interesting. They have free divers that, uh, there's sometimes work out with. It's very fascinating. Great. Well I'm going to try that. I would love to switch gears just a little bit and ask you a couple rapid questions. You can certainly take your time. It doesn't mean you have to answer them quickly, but, uh, the, the first is when you think of the word successful, who is the first person who comes to mind for you? The heart.

Speaker 5:          00:59:38       That heart in any person that, that, that that's success. I'm further maybe Mandela.

Speaker 1:          00:59:48       Nelson Mandela. Yes. And, and with the heart, if someone feels like if someone doesn't feel successful, uh, what would you, what would your advice be to them? Or what would you, what would you say to them?

Speaker 5:          01:00:01       Yeah, just do the method. I mean, there's Methodist, Sherwin, scientifically to be able to tap into the deepest of our physiology if somebody feels he's frustrated is because he is not able to tap in his or hers physiology at the deepest. He has no control. That makes people frustrated. And we, uh, we, we mirror that with society and all that. But you got your vehicle. If you are able to steer your vehicle, your body, your mind to work, whatever you feel, then you will be successful. So any, yes,

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       I'm sorry to interrupt. I was just going to ask him why Nelson Mandela. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:00:45       Ah, yeah, he's just a good guy. He was always smiling. He loved the women and uh, he stayed like 25 years believing in this case. And that makes him, for me really strong. And, uh, I love people who have faith simply because that's what they feel. And yes, I, uh, I've been, uh, so, so many years the galactic and mock to mock and all that, but uh, always had my faith and now it is science for the same like 20 years ago they told me, you're crazy. You're an idiot. You're a lunatic and all that. Yes. And even my, in my family, I was the black sheep and right now I'm the, why does sheep, so it's a lot of hypocrisy going on in the world because people do not know. But I got my faith, I got my belief and I want to go up till the point that we scientifically showed everybody is able to tap in. It's a endocrine system, eh, so much that depression and being unhappy and being frustrated is no longer part of humanity. It's a choice.

Speaker 1:          01:02:06       No, this was, uh, this is a topic I, I'd be, I think we could talk about it for a long time. What is your favorite book or the book that you've given to other people the most as a gift?

Speaker 6:          01:02:17       Whoa.

Speaker 5:          01:02:18       Never gave many books

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       except for the books are right, right. What do you give to people as gifts? What do you like to give people as gifts?

Speaker 5:          01:02:26       Oh, as stones, stones, a lot of sat and natural things. I get people in the natural things. I collected a whole bunch of things and then two months later I'm, I'm fed up with the thing and then I take this one, wants to go with him. And those are beautiful stones. When I told them the first time I got great stone. Beautiful. Oh, this a artifact. Well, what your aid. Wow. Nice. Then two months later it's gone, you know? Then I just gave it away. Add. So, Eh, with books, the same thing as see darker, see data. And Jonathan Livingston Seagull comes to my mind and that's okay. And some scriptures I read about the Bhagavad Gita and the Bible of course, Ebay, all these books. I was reading hundreds of books and uh, at a certain point I could not make the connection with my deepest within myself, which was the seeker. I was sold searching. And I found it finally in the open book of the ice water because the ice water is merciless but righteous. It brings you just within and uh, there is no, uh, there is no chit chatting around that there's no philosophy. You just do it right or you do it wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:04:00       Now you've had of course, some, some very challenging times. Um, perhaps more so than many people I've spoken with. You had very tragic premature death it with your wife. In the case of your wife, what do you do to,

Speaker 5:          01:04:18       to overcome those dark periods? Yes, very uh, very good, very interesting. Very real and deep. God, uh, losing, uh, the person you love. I have four children with her. They work with me and uh, right now they are like 33 years old, the oldest one and then two daughters and another son. And they all work with me right now. Oh, actually one is working right now at the Dutch embassy in Washington DC in America. But the rest is working with me all the time. So losing the love of your life, how deep can you go? And being ted apart, that was what I was experienced at the time. But then, Eh, I was the only person who was, uh, re, uh, Ooh, I was alone and I had to raise four kids alone and that they were like seven years old, eight years, nine years and 11 years.

Speaker 5:          01:05:26       And I had to raise them alone. So I received so much love, Eh, of, of my kids. And I did my training. And as I told you, Eh, the, the brainstem is alter the area of the seat of emotion, which is the Amygdala. And because of this training in the cold, I could control silence myself and go on and always find the energy to go on and to be a father happy and exercising and practical and uh, with my kids. And uh, they gave me a lot of love. But the thing about grief and the emotion is you have to go deep because emotion is going deep. And as we live in the comfort zone, we have no control, mostly over emotion. And I tell you there is a way to, uh, control the seat of emotion, which is the Amygdala connected to the, uh, in the area of the brain stem. So I think this, uh, uh, not think my experience tells me discipline, discipline and believing, believing within there is a weight to silence, a grieved, broken hearts, grieve and Burt emotions. Yes, it's a, it's a way did it

Speaker 4:          01:06:58       and the, um, it's, it's really been fascinating for me to observe a, a number of people, I won't mention some of the other names, but who have used specifically, uh, exposure to the cold too. I suppose the purity of that cold and the attention that requires a sort of purity of attention that it requires to overcome very dark periods or be to act as a very strong component for passing through those difficult periods. It's, it's just a, it's a very fascinating pattern that I've observed in a number of my, a number of my friends. Uh, I recognize what is, what is your morning, the first 60 minutes of your day look like? When do you wake up? What do you do in those first 60 minutes if you have complete control over that morning

Speaker 5:          01:07:44       was time to get into conscious breathing, where consciously breathe when you wake up. And your setup is all about vital for us, created by oxygen. It's for free and it's there and I said it's to me it's so, it's God itself, they'll like for Noma, the vital force, the Prana, it's all a different names of God and they tell all the uh, the, the uh, belief systems still that that's the vital for us of any off of life itself. So that's the, that's a very logic, natural way. I begin brief

Speaker 4:          01:08:29       still still laying in bed.

Speaker 5:          01:08:32       Yeah, still laying in bed and then uh, to uh, doing the exercise, uh, which I explained prior in this interview. Uh, it is, yeah, it is very nice because you are still very relaxed and about the body is without tension. So you then are able to go tap deeply into the system.

Speaker 4:          01:08:58       And how long will you do that in bed typically?

Speaker 5:          01:09:01       Yeah, it's a stay a half hour, something like that before going into action could be an hour because it's never, never boring.

Speaker 4:          01:09:14       What would you say to someone who says, you know, actually I find it really boring. I'm not saying that I feel that way, but if, if someone felt boring, what would you, what would you advise them or what would you tell them?

Speaker 5:          01:09:23       It's [inaudible] once again, the same thing as this California and a great guy, Dean, Dean. Dean Cortez. Yeah. The income assets and they don't know what come for this all about. So, uh, going d just by breathing into the depth of our physiology, it's like Galen, the aim of all those people going into outdoor or taking drugs or eh, doing extremes or a goal for a rush. Now you can our age old to learn, to control the depth of your physiology by just breathing properly and going into that system. And a boring is something if you are doing things repetitiously but not breaking through the conditioning. And I learned to go through the conditioning,

Speaker 4:          01:10:19       right? So if you have to be conscious about the activity, you can't be daydreaming. It's, it seems you just have to be attentive to your breathing when you're doing something like this.

Speaker 5:          01:10:29       Yes, yes. Just go into it. It's like the past meditation. That's what they do. They sit and they just listen and focus on grieving. That's all at what I do. And they get into a deeper layer of their brain because they are not giving their focus to something else than just mayor breathing. It is so simple, but so effective.

Speaker 4:          01:10:58       I'll try that tomorrow morning. The, so let's say you do that for a half hour, then what do you do for the next half hour?

Speaker 5:          01:11:06       Um, nowadays I do a lot to do with a lot of workshops and lectures and then, uh, into science. But yeah, uh, for in between I do exercising. I like exercising.

Speaker 4:          01:11:23       What type of exercise do you, if you had to choose one type of exercise are two types of exercise for yourself, what would you choose? A strength and flexibility. What would you do for both of those

Speaker 5:          01:11:34       as strength? Power example, stay on two arms. Save four minutes like a planet or just different types of poses onto our mat with one hand or to a plank or a handstands or, uh, pullups pushups of course, eh, those, uh, you know, power exercises or stand in a horse stance for an hour. That is sometimes just to with stones in my hands and I make all kinds of food, like, uh, movements, just make them up and, but you know, to battle my aesthetic, the aesthetic processes in my body. So I go deeply into the horse stance and breathe in a way that a acid is not [inaudible] in the body. So that makes me control the body and uh, yeah, it feels good. And then for flexibility, yeah, all kinds of splits and then put a couple of lags and Maya behind my head, the things, you know, uh, do balancing a exercises. It's nice. Uh, Eh, I, I maintained the body that way.

Speaker 4:          01:12:48       What do you listen to music when you're exercising or do you do without music?

Speaker 5:          01:12:54       I simply have no record system. So, but eh, Eh, right now I'm a w we bought a center. So I will have my big doe, Joe and a Whoa. A cascade and all that, and a swimming pool and all those things. And that I will have the right music and make music myself. I, uh, I played the guitar, I saying I want to make a CD very soon. And people like me singing, uh, doing all kinds of mantras because I, you know, learned about the sunscreen and a Spanish songs, a English songs and all kinds of songs. I just make up my sort of a wrapper

Speaker 4:          01:13:38       too. So. Yeah, I'd love to hear it. And what, uh, what musician do you look up to the most? Is there a particular musician that you admire that you would like to emulate or look up?

Speaker 5:          01:13:53       I like a lot, a lot, a lot of lounge, EH, easy music. I like Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson's great. Yeah, he is a fit. Do you have a favorite song or a favorite album? Uh, of, of uh, Michael Jackson? Yes. Yeah, all the songs. This is it, for example, it's a great oh yeah, great deal is great. And his voice is mass Merrick. Oh yeah, totally. Yeah. Yeah. So I uh, get my son his name, which is Michael, which is one of my songs. So things like that, but also pink Floyd, also Gypsy kings, you know, plumbing, Flamenco and all the goop music and there's a lot of good music going on

Speaker 1:          01:14:41       and uh, yes, I can't wait to visit the, uh, the center. Is that going to be in Holland?

Speaker 5:          01:14:47       Yes. Okay. For now, I would say in Holland, I was looking to make a center in the near San Francisco as well. I get some very good friends over there.

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       You should, you should, you should come up. Maybe we'll do a workshop and I could introduce you to, I'll invite Dean as well. You could meet dean. Yes. Yes. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He would love to meet you. I'm sure. The, just a few more questions. I want to be obviously respectful of your time. What, uh, what purchase in the last, you know, six months or a year of less than $100. So something you bought for less than $100 has most positively impacted your life. Stones, stones. I love these stones. I want to talk about. So how do you find these stones and what makes you pick one? Uh, do you have any favorites?

Speaker 5:          01:15:35       I always take a stones out. Whatever touches matter meets the eye. Uh, I take them from the mountains had climbed, but I also like these tests and a old pills and all kinds of, you know, beautiful stones where the beautiful colors. I like that. But uh, yeah, I always take stones from the uh, uh, I just found a big for sale in the, in the Spanish period. Knees, you know, big, big means like two to three kilos. That's a big, big bottle there and forced out. And uh, and uh, I couldn't get it down because a, it was there where the group, the ad, the ad, no, a backpack. And I had to carry the ropes because we were doing canyon and all that. So, but, uh, there was a girl from Austin, Texas, Austin, Elizabeth Lee, and she had a backpack. And See, she carried it there for me. It's a good friend. Yeah. Always. Yeah. I love it.

Speaker 1:          01:16:43       Yeah. Yeah. So the what, what effect do, and did you, do you put that in your kitchen? Where do you put such a, such a stone and what effect does it have on you?

Speaker 5:          01:16:54       Everywhere they, they have a solid I've hacked is hey, yeah, simply there and they are beautiful and I always pass them on to other people except for the big ones.

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       What, uh, what advice would you give your 30 year old self?

Speaker 5:          01:17:14       My 30th and just have faith. Have faith. Faith. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:17:21       What type of faith that things will work out? The things will be okay.

Speaker 5:          01:17:26       [inaudible] simple logic, half simple logic and understanding I things simply and, and listen to you. You're feeling listened to. You're feeling, you're feeling it knows it. It is simply sense making and that if you are letting it in your way of thinking and never lose track of whatever makes sense, which is feeling, which is instinct and intuition.

Speaker 1:          01:17:56       Right, right. This is something I've been trying to work on a lot because it's easy for me at least to get trapped in my neocortex to get trapped exactly in the front of my brain where I can make pro and con lists. But the answer is so obvious sometimes because you know that something's wrong or you know that someone isn't a good fit or you don't trust someone just like, yeah, you have that feeling like a dog. Where are you immediately either like or dislike something? Yes. It's, I've been trying to train myself to go back to that simplicity. It's, I'm making sense. It can be challenging. Yeah. So what one or two more questions, the, if, if you could have one billboard, one huge sign anywhere with anything on it, uh, what would it say and where would you put it?

Speaker 5:          01:18:42       I would say a brief motherfucker. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:18:49       You could put that on like a busy highway. You can put that on like sunset boulevard in Los Angeles. Or

Speaker 5:          01:18:54       I got maybe a brief, a, Eh, you know, I don't know why their way day. I noticed that it, but it's really meant lovable. Right. And you know which strength is the answer to the APP till the DNA itself. And it's not me telling that anymore because of the blood results. Professors have confirmed that we are in the middle of DNA. And what is the trigger breathing?

Speaker 1:          01:19:25       So this is a, so you could, you could have it say breathe, breathe motherfucker within a smiley, a smiley face, like a smiley emoticon. That'd be perfect.

Speaker 5:          01:19:34       Yes. It's, so we got a t shirt at, says I'm the front please. You know, it's about the cold enough and that the other side is Britain. Motherfucker.
