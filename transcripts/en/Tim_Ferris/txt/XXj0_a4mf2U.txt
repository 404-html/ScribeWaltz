This is an addendum, an urgent update recorded after this episode is completed because I was going through a roster of all of the most amazing things I've been able to experience in my life and at the top of the list was floating at zero gravity, experiencing weightlessness in a shuttle and being able to say chase after globules of water floating in midair or chase skittles that you've tossed into the air. It's floating right in front of your face, say five feet away or scurrying around all the way around the perimeter of the shuttle, like a hamster in a hamster wheel if you were inverted. In a way, it's really amazing and I loved it so much that I decided to give away a flight. So I am giving away a flight at zero gravity and you can get it. There's no cost involved, but it's only possible this week. That is the week of Monday, April 20th so jump on this right now. I would suggest that you pause this and check it out.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       Hello Ladies and gentlemen, this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. I am drinking tea with coconut oil in it because I am in Ketosis. So my brain is running like speedy Gonzales on some type of biochemical advantage, but that's not what I'm here to talk about. I am here to do what I do every episode and that is deconstruct world class performers to find the tools, tricks, routines, habits, and so on that you can use whether those people are billionaire investors. Like for instance Peter Teal, who was the first money into Facebook, also co founder of paypal and Palentier or celebrities and actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger, uh, tech icons like Matt Mullenweg behind a wordpress and wordpress.com and so on and so forth. Musicians, we've got everybody and I have wanted to interview a professional wrestler for a very long time now after seeing the movie, the wrestler, but also having wrestled myself and uh, having watched WWE and WWF f before that and then the, the rise of MMA and I managed to get ahold of a fantastic, fantastic performer and incredible athlete, triple h.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       So triple h who is a 13 time world champion in the WWE, but that is not all. He's also the executive vice president of talent live events and creative at the WWE. And we talk about just about everything in this episode. His real name is Paul Levesque and we dig into the questions of misconceptions related to both triple h, his, uh, his stage name, his stage persona and WWE the important lessons he learned while training with a wrestler named killer Kuwalski, including getting hit in the back of the head with a phone book in a garbage bag. Ouch. Uh, and, uh, we get into his longevity, how he avoids and also repairs injuries, pregame rituals, including input from a trainer named Joe to Franco. Of course his colleague and arms. The undertaker and even Floyd Mayweather. And who does he model? Uh, how does he view parenting? He has a bunch of daughters, uh, and uh, it goes on and on. We really dig deep. It's a turned out

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       better than I could have expected and I expected it to be good. So I hope you really enjoy this. Of course I'll show notes. Can Be found a four hour workweek.com forward slash podcast all spelled out and please enjoy my conversation with the one and only triple h Paul Levesque. Paul, welcome to the show. Thank you very much medicine honor to be here. I am so excited for this. You are a massive human being. It makes your job requirement then. It does seem to be a job requirement and the eye, you have worn a lot of hats and I've had a lot of different titles, a lot of different jobs. When someone asks you what do you do if they don't recognize you, how do you answer that question?

Speaker 4:          00:06:38       Oh God, it's funny now because I'm kind of in that, this weird kind of Combo twilight zone of the last bits of my, my in ring wrestling career, you know? Um, even then when I did it then I used to say I was an entertainer and because if people are the WWE is a weird thing, like one of those things, like if you, if you're not into it, no explanation can explain it to you to make you like it and then you are into it. There's no explanation necessary, you know, it, it just is what it is. And, um,

Speaker 4:          00:07:13       so to say, sometimes it, oh, WWE, like it would go like, oh, look at the rest of them, you know? And it just had a weird connotation to it. When you say entertainer, oh, what kind of, Oh, you know, WWE, it just took on a different meaning. Sure. Uh, to people that don't understand what we do. Um, so I was went with that. Right now it's, um, it's kind of a combo. You know, we have a saying that we use that WWE, which is our job is to put smiles on people's faces and it's kind of the overall thing of what we do. But I spend 90% of my day as an executive. So there you go.

Speaker 3:          00:07:47       Okay. We're going to also, we're going to dig into that and rewind the clock and look at the trajectory, but what are misconceptions that people have about you or

Speaker 4:          00:07:58       triple h or at WWT? Um, I think they don't, you know, they just see what they see on TV. They see, you know, um,

Speaker 5:          00:08:08       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:08:08       The, the misconception for me is that I'm very much what you see on, on television or him that I'm this character or they see the simplistic things of what we do. You know, it's funny, even if you have this huge fan of the WWE, they get so upset over things like, um, well good. Why would this guy be that guy? Just Co, you know, it's one of the terms right now. It's buried them, you know, it's, um, it's a show. And what they don't get about our show is we are like this never ending. If you can compare it to whatever you want, comic books, soap, opera, TV, drama, movie, but it never ends. There's always another chapter. And they get so upset in the moment of not knowing that, you know, not liking maybe the end of the chapter that they're on, there's another chapter to search tomorrow. It actually started right now when this one ended, you know, and they don't get that and they can't wait for that and they don't understand all the complexities that goes on, you know, go on behind the scenes. So it's that, that's probably the biggest misconception is that we're just, you know, the, that the WWE is just a bunch of guys, um, at its simplest form that just go to the ring in their underwear and pretend to fight with each other, you know? Um, but when you really break it down, it's a massive global business.

Speaker 3:          00:09:22       Oh, there's a lot behind it. Oh my God. I've been so impressed by it for so, so long. Not The least of which, and we'll certainly explore the, the physical and mental stamina. How many matches would you say you have had

Speaker 4:          00:09:38       total to date? Televised or otherwise? Thousands, you know, if, if you break it down simplistically in math is not my strong suit. So, but you know, I started wrestling I think in like 93 ish, just just training. 92 93 training. And was this in New Hampshire or was this in New Hampshire? I went to, um, I trained with a guy named [inaudible] wall ski and old who my Mama loves by the way. Oh really? Yeah. I wanted to dig into that. Yeah, he was, uh, you know, one of the first guys to become kind of like globally known and I started training with a Meta camp, a school, if you want to call it that. It was like a little rundown mill building with a boxing ring in it and a in Malden, Massachusetts. And I started training under there. So if you break it down from there to today of 20 plus years and then when you know, once I made it to the WWE, which was 95 even if you just want to look at it from there and just say 20 years, 20 years, I probably for a lot of those years wrestled 250 280 days a year.

Speaker 4:          00:10:42       Sometimes on the weekends we did double shots, so we'd wrestle a matinee in the afternoon and then a night show. So it's a lot. A lot of mileage. Yeah, it's a lot of mileage. Yeah. What were the most thing we always said, it's not the years, it's the miles

Speaker 3:          00:10:56       it both figuratively and literally and it's a hell of a lot of travel. But before I get to asking you about travel and all of these different training aspects, what were the most important lessons you learned while training with killer call scheme?

Speaker 4:          00:11:12       It's funny. A lot of the things I think as in life he taught me a lot of things. Um, that I didn't know he was teaching me at the time. He would tell me a lot of things that I would be like, ah, he's, he's just like the Mr Miyagi approach. Yeah, yeah. It was a very, it would have worked very well in today's millennial age, but like he had that his theory of telling you, you did something wrong was hitting you in the back of the head with a phone book that was in like a shopping bag, you know? And, um, but yeah, he, he would just teach all the, he wouldn't say a whole lot and then all of a sudden he'd come in and he would say, um, you know, it needs to, you need to be spectacular. Make everybody look at you, no one else.

Speaker 4:          00:11:55       And then he would just walk away and then you'd be like, well, what does that mean? Like, I don't, you know what I mean? You kind of had to figure it out. Now there's a lot of things that he said to me then that I find myself telling the young guys now in a different way. Um, but it's the same lessons kind of, you know? Um, are there any examples that come to mind? Well, just, just in how to be spectacular, but also out of to break things down into, to just look at what you do. Like never be, never be satisfied with what you do. If you don't do something well don't do it unless you want to spend the time to improve that. Like it's still to this day, I see a lot of guys do stuff in the ring that I'm like, hm.

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       He doesn't do that. Well he does it all the time. It's just, you know, you shouldn't do that. I have things that I don't do well in the ring. Just don't know. It's just what would be, oh man. For example, there's this one thing that guys take where they, they um, they go through the top and middle turnbuckle and hit the post right from the inside and uh, hit it with their shoulder. I just, it's one of those mental block things for me. Like I can't, I just can't seem to navigate going between the two turnbuckles and getting the thing. Like I always get stuck somehow or ab tried to do it before and it's just one of those things like it doesn't work out well for me, so I never do it. And if guys will grab me in the ring over the years and say like, take the post and I'll just, no, no.

Speaker 4:          00:13:23       You know what I mean? Cause I don't midflight correction, I just don't do that. Well I'm not going to do it. And I think there's little things like that that guys don't analyze what they do, they do what they do and then they go and they say, oh, that was really good in the overall picture of things. Right. It was really good. People really liked it. It was, but there were some things in there that weren't really good. So the, it averaged out well, but there are things they should have admitted. Yeah. You know, and to me, I don't know, I've always been the kind of guy, if, if you're, if you're doing it, why, why wasn't everything, which you wanted it to be in there, there shouldn't be wasted movement. There shouldn't be things that aren't what you want them to be. I don't want to do something just to get to the next thing, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:14:04       No, I do. And what are you particularly good at in the, in that, in that environment, what are the things that you, the strengths that you focused on? For me it was never about, um, he was never about individual moves. And I think as the business, maybe some guys now look at that and they, they think differently because they might look at my style and say, look, I was never over the top spectacular guy, but I wasn't supposed to be. I was usually the bad guy. So I wanted to have that. I want it to be that constant and let the other guy be spectacular around me. And it, for me, it was never about the spectacular moves. It was about the drama of the, the match. And I look at what we do is, um, we're, we're more like rocky the movie, then we are legitimate, you know, like boxing, right?

Speaker 4:          00:14:59       It's about the story that you tell. So if the story is really good going in and you care about the two characters, and then you make that emotional story play out through those two characters, non-verbally in the ring, that's the magic of what we do. It doesn't matter if, you know, um, yeah, it makes the highlight reel like, oh my God, he did this one spectacular move was crazy. I don't know how he, he made it through that or whatever. It's not really about that because tomorrow there'll be, I get another guy can do that move better than you just did it and it will be even more spectacular. He'll come up with another way to do it. That's even crazier.

Speaker 3:          00:15:32       Well, you mentioned rocky, right? It's, it's, it's a, it's about the story arc, not just a handful of really good lines of dialogue.

Speaker 4:          00:15:37       Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And, and that's the thing of it. And you'll watch, it's one of the things that works. We have the WWE network. It's a lot of old content. People will go back and they'll watch wrestlemania one, you know, um, over and over again and how great it is and, or wrestlemania three and all these things is because it's an emotional story. If it was just about the moves, it wouldn't be so impactful to you still it the, the emotional story of why people will go back and watch the movie rocky over and over again because it's a great story. Um, they very rarely go back and watch now there's exceptions, Muhammad Ali and, and for men or something, you know, um, moments in time, but the average person, unless they're like a boxing connoisseur, doesn't go back and watch boxing over and over again.

Speaker 3:          00:16:23       No. And you know, it's fascinating about the examples you just gave, like a, whether it's Ali Frazier or whatever, those, those in real life ended up being like story arcs because you would have this back and forth in this drama and the Thrilla in Manila. And there were all the elements of sort of the, the monomyth or the, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:42       Well, and even when you go back and usually watch those fights, you go back and you watch them in a show that now chronicles the story of the ties them together. Yeah, yeah. It chronicles the story of those, those epic contests, you know, and that's the reality of the story. You know, it's, um, you know, said all the time, if you know who's in the ring fighting, you'll tune in and your watch to just watch two guys fight for no apparent reason. It's not that interesting unless you're a connoisseur of the, of what they're doing. You know, if you're watching the UFC and you're a big mixed martial arts fan or all those things, and there's a lot of those, but they're very into the, what's going on scientifically and you know, the, the chess game, the technical chess game that's going on. But that's not the general public to hit the general public. They need to know something about the two guys and why they're fighting. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:17:35       the, uh, the fighting at your peak point in, in your, your onstage wrestling career, he mentioned 200 and something like 250 to 300 days of the year. You're probably traveling something like that and traveling. Yeah. And uh, what were some of the keys to your longevity being able to maintain that? And I know we have a common connection and Joe to Franco and he's mentioned that you very, very rarely if ever miss training days and then maybe you could speak to that, but even if that means coming in at two to three in the morning to train, what are, what have been some of the keys are practices that have allowed you to sustain that type of torturous schedule? Um,

Speaker 4:          00:18:21       I think you know, you, you speak a lot in your, in your podcast, in, in, in your books and everything about routines and having things that you do. And I'm very big in that way. And I like, I like to have my life kind of like when it, when it gets chaotic and bothers me and it's, which sounds silly because like what we do is chaotic at all times. Like my day varies and you know, people talk about when you do live TV, like Monday night raw for us, we work on that show and edited and done and sometimes you guys are walking up the curtain and somebody shouting a change to them as they're walking through the curtain. You know, it's, it's, so the chaos is there, but having that consistent thing. So for me, I had very distinct things. Like if I was in the beginning there wasn't as much supplements and there is a little bit more difficult, but as supplements became more available, I would, I'm like big on the preparation part.

Speaker 4:          00:19:22       So like if I was going to get on a plane to fly to Japan, I would take, um, either containers or, or later when they were there, the, I would make my own protein shakes. Right. I'd put the two scoops of protein and the thing, I'd put some oil in there, I'd whatever I needed, I'd put the top on it, no liquid in there, and I'd stick it inside my carry on bag so, and I would time it in my head. So I'm on the flight for, it's a 16 hour flight. I've gotten three hours. I need to eat every three hours. I'm not going to count on the food on the plane. That will just be bonus food. So every three hours I have a shake for every three hours and then set my watch to go off every three hours, time to eat, and I'd get a shake out, get water, drink my shake, put it in and go back to sleep.

Speaker 4:          00:20:02       Right. Whatever I needed to do. When I landed, I would check into the hotel. Second we checked in, I'd ask them to the gym open, can I go train? Even if it was to get on a bike and ride for 15 minutes, reset that I learned early that it seemed to me anytime I did that I didn't get jet lag. Anytime I did that, I seem to like we can kit, we use wrestling terms like I've got to kick out faster, right? So while everybody else would be in the building dragon that day, I'd be like feminine. I feel great. You know, I don't feel so bad. I'm getting your blood flowing, resetting your clock. Um, you know, if we were in Australia, I would always like that last day there I would force myself to stay up because then I could sleep the whole way home.

Speaker 4:          00:20:45       And by the time I landed I was landing in the morning and it's perfect. Like I'm just waking up and it's great. You want to do the same thing Atlanta, try to find a gym, whether it hotel something, ride a bike, you set my clock, do the deal, you know? Um, so those routines and regimented stuff and same with my training. Um, when new guys would start a lot. I'm on the road like internationally when we're all traveling together. It's hard when you go overseas, you're on a bus there, there's a gym set up for you, but they don't know how, like how do I get to the gym? I'm not sure. Am I supposed to go downstairs, get on a bus? I don't know. The guys would always come to me and say, hey look, we've always heard that you go to the gym every day.

Speaker 4:          00:21:25       Can I go with you? So yeah, I'd meet downstairs, bunch of guys who come down, we'd all go to the gym together cause I would go every day. I didn't like missing it. I didn't like, you know, it was to me was that regimented thing and I can look back at my career and say, I think part of that regimented stuff is why I was able to maintain it or, or maintain that schedule because I was one of the guides also that really, truly believed in that when you make it, the job gets harder. It's not the other way around. You don't make it and then go, okay, now I can cruise because now I'm the guy. And now that means I can say no, and I can not do these things. I felt the opposite. When you get there, now it's your responsibility to not say no.

Speaker 4:          00:22:07       So, you know, I, I've had times where I've worked 64 straight days and just everybody else went home. I went on a media tour, everybody else went back home. I went to something else. I did that for years, you know, and, and that, um, that regimented, having those distinct patterns so to speak, um, I think helped help keep that. I think it helps preserve your bandwidth also for making decisions about other things. So you don't have to decide each morning or each day what all the elements that your teen are going to look like. A, it's funny, I heard you talk, uh, it just recently, I listen to podcasts and my research for this because I've read your books, but you're hearing somebody speak is different than what you put in your mind of how they speak. Right? So I want to feel like, God, that guy sounds a hot dumber on audio, but you know, you put something if you had to then get there and go vote. It's not what I expected at all. So I listened to it.

Speaker 4:          00:23:07       Yes. Um, you, um, you spoke, uh, and I forgot what I was talking about. That was bad interview etiquette on my, no, no, no. Yeah, we were talking about routines. It's bad memory on routine. Oh, I know what I was going to say. Yeah. I believe that um, like training is almost like a meditation. Right? I totally agree. The Anthony Robbins say he didn't, didn't meditate cause you like shutting off. He's the opposite. He wants to just keep going. But I also believe you need to reboot your brain because your brain will get stuck in like, it's like when you go to sleep and you can't stop thinking about something you got going on at work and you can't get it out. And in the morning you realize that it was actually jibberish that was in your brain going on. Um, I think training when you do it well, if you're into it, like you can't focus, you can't be in the middle of trying to do a heavy set of something and be thinking about another project. You have to be in that moment and it allows you to reboot, which I kind of believe is what meditation and all that stuff is. Anyways. It's just a reset button for a second that just allows you to go like, okay, start over, clean the plate and knowledge, do this again. You know? And that's really to me what training is. Definitely

Speaker 3:          00:24:25       digging a little bit more on the routines. For instance, on in the last, let's just say as you've gotten older in the last handful of years, how do you, what is your pregame ritual if you have one before you're going to go out and compete and perform?

Speaker 4:          00:24:41       Yeah, that's all that. But it just became this as the of, uh, of age of I never, and just for people listening, if you don't mind me asking, how old are you at the 45? But, so, you know, for years when I was doing all that stuff with wrestling, you know, wrestling all those dates and everything. Um, it's funny because some of the younger guys would, would joke with me about it. Like you're like the old school guy. Like I would literally be sitting in a chair up at, we call it gorilla position right before you walk out the curtain, uh, named after an old wrestler, grill monsoon. But um, I would just be sitting in a chair. My music, it is, I'd get up and go to the ring and say, you don't warm up at all. So I'll walk to the ring as good to get a good warm up. You know, I'll start slow, it'll be fine. Now I have to like stretch and warm up. And Joe Franco, you mentioned my strength and conditioning guys. One of the things when I'm really bad with years and dates, but the four years ago was my career was kind of winding down and I was, but I was, I was still wrestling fairly regularly and I had had this problem, I thought it was a neck injury and a really having all this problem with my neck and my shoulder.

Speaker 4:          00:25:52       And I, I um, I got a new position with a company where I needed to go make a couple of movies for them. Long story, but I went to go make two movies. I ended up taking about a month off from the ring to go make these two movies and then was supposed to come back while I was making the movies. One day I went to the gym to train and um, it had gotten to a point where I couldn't raise my left arm up over my shoulder and my neck was really bad and I'd been going to see our team physician, you know, the guy that runs our medical. And I'd been, you know, getting stuck with needles and die and Mris and things and they kept saying like, it looks great. We don't see this clearly something nerve going on here, but we don't know what it is. And they kept doing all this stuff and when the gym one day and tore my bicep and it didn't hurt at all, it likes snap. I looked down, I have the big gap in my arm. I was just mad more than anything. I was like, Oh, you just rolled up

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       like a Venetian blind toward the top. So just talk down and made like this divot there. Right. And I heard, I had headphones on, I heard it and I looked down and it was just

Speaker 4:          00:26:52       David, I was like, son of a bitch, I can't believe you tore my bicep. So I'm like mad. I put my weights down and like literally I was done training. It was just going to do like a couple of extra sets of Bicep to wherever and, and uh, I called the guy to come back and get me. And as I went to go outside, like I was sweating and out and piss off, just going to leave and I go to put my sweatshirt on. And as I did, I put my sweatshirt, like through my arm up over my head to put my sweatshirt on and realize it,

Speaker 2:          00:27:16       wait a minute,

Speaker 4:          00:27:18       I can move my,

Speaker 3:          00:27:20       my arm all the way around my head like that. I couldn't do their shoulder mobility. Yeah. I was like, everything came back and hey, wait my neck,

Speaker 4:          00:27:27       it doesn't hurt. It was all from like this a bicep. And um, I had to get surgery and the whole thing and it, but it got me to a point in my head like, I'm getting older, I'm falling apart a little bit. Like I have to start, maybe I should think about trying to train like an athlete instead of just like going to the gym, being a bodybuilder and just looking good or whatever. So I'm not like a guy that just like to call the local gym, like I have to them, like dig into it. So I started like researching trainers and everything and um,

Speaker 2:          00:28:04       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:28:04       Ironically, I ended up probably where you did in your quest to do when you did for our body, which is you start researching all these guys that become the best at what they do. And I, I come across Joe de Franco, it keeps coming back up. Joda Franco. So then I called Joe to Franco out of the blue one day and just say, um, you know, hey, I was, I was actually, because he was in Jersey and I was in Connecticut and I was thinking maybe he could recommend me to somebody. And uh, he said, can I come and meet with you? I'd like to meet with you. And just so I can analyze thing. I still had my arm in a sling and everything had just finished making the movies. I didn't have the surgery until after I finish making the movies. And um, he came and said, uh, after we met, he's like, you seem like a really great guy. I like to take a stab at doing this with you. I'll drive up here, I'm willing to do it, drive up. And uh, there's the thing, he's awesome.

Speaker 3:          00:28:50       He's a great guy. And for people who aren't familiar, uh, he's, he's very well known for a lot of reasons, but it does a lot of work with, uh, football athletes training for the NFL combine. Yeah. And, uh, that's how he ended up that the chapters in the four hour body where I, I showed how unathletic I am. Uh, but how much Joe could improve my performance, attempting to simulate the combine for, for a handful of chapters. But please continue. I just want to give some context for you. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:29:15       yeah, yeah. Great Guy. Yeah. And I'm just wealth of knowledge, incredibly smart. And um, he said to me, um, so this will be a difficult transition for you because your mindset is totally different. You know, I'd never been with a strength and conditioning guy. Everything I learned in the gym was from bodybuilders were power lifters. I just, I just went to the gym and trained with guys and learned everything I could, but I was a sponge, you know, Arnold was my hero and you know, I'd like just was a sponge for all that stuff. But that's how I learned it. So strength and conditioning and the whole stretching and mobility was totally foreign to me. And he said, uh, this is going to be a tough thing for you. We'll see if you can do it. Cause tough with old dogs, new tricks. And I just want him.

Speaker 4:          00:30:01       And I said, dude, I will tell you this. I am, I'm all in. Tell me what to do. I'll go do it. But it changed my life, changed my life athletically. I went from a guy with, you know, gimping going upstairs because my knees were killing me. I've torn both of my quads and my knees were really bad and all that. I had zero knee pain now as strong as they've ever been. I don't have physical issues, but it's because of that type of training. And Joe and um, you know, he was one of the guys that got me. Like when you do wrestle, here's what we're going to do. We're going to get you in this kind of shape and then you're going to, he's going to be your pre match ritual of, you know, you're stretching in your mobility. We're going to light your body up, get your nerves kicking in and firing, and then you're going to go, you know, and, um, that's what I do now and it works out a whole lot better.

Speaker 3:          00:30:49       Well, what are, what are, as opposed to going from the gorilla position straight out to the, to the ring, what are a, and I can prep what I'll provide for folks. Uh, obviously lots of links to everything that you're up to, but also I'll pin gel and get some links to exercises and some videos. What, what does that look like now? What are some of the exercises or the sequence?

Speaker 4:          00:31:08       It's, um, it's a lot of mobility stuff. Kasik squats. Um, you know, um, is that a weighted caustic squatters? Oh, no, he'll, well, it's depends, but usually I don't like if I'm getting ready to go for a match, but like he'll have me do caustic squats into, um, maybe just like a, uh, a squat. But when I come down and pushing my knees out to decide to stretch my groin out into some type of like, um, uh, he centric explosive pushup. But just getting things to fire my nervous system, wake my nervous system up, but then also just open my joints up a little bit and just warm my body up. But it's never anything like I see guys running down hallways and doing all these things to get a sweat going. I'm never at that point. But when I'm done it, I always feel like alive, you know, as opposed to just kind of physically shutdown, but mentally aware because I'm about to go to the ring. So you know, no matter how many years you've been doing this, you still like nervous and like freaking out and um, to, to then have your body just kick in and wake up, boom when you're there. You know what I mean? And that's really what it is. But it's, it's just the, he varies it, but it's a little series of exercises. It just makes me go,

Speaker 3:          00:32:25       how long does it typically take? Five, 10 minutes. Not Short and sweet. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:32:29       It's not the, I just go white right from one thing to the other.

Speaker 3:          00:32:34       Awesome. Good little deal. Yeah. I'll Ping Joe. So people you can find that at the show notes at a four hour blog com. Uh, the fear factor, what you guys do is it can be very dangerous. I mean there are risks involved when you're, when you're nervous or have been nervous. Uh, what is your inner dialogue sound like when you're preparing yourself to go out, when you've been most nervous? What are you saying to yourself?

Speaker 4:          00:33:01       Um, so it's changed over the years. I used to get really intense and really like almost like I'm that same level of intensity. If you are going to go for a personal record squat or something where you know, you just get in that zone of intensity and just nothing else is around you in your, in your own little world and just on fire ready to tear through this thing. And that when I was younger, that used to be the thing for me. Now it's much more of an inner dialogue of you had been doing this for 20 years, you know how to do this. Like relax and this is fun. Like, and in some way there's that inner dialogue and me saying, could be the last time you do this, enjoy it. You know what I mean? Like, um, uh, an undertaker and I had a conversation a couple of years ago about this, like, you, you, it's, it's a little bit of like, you can still do this, like in calming yourself down, but at the same point in time, like, don't forget to enjoy this moment, like when you're out there, because you might not get another one.

Speaker 4:          00:34:12       You don't know. You know, and, and, and injuries do happen, especially as you get older. So, and you can't think about it once you're out there. And that's the thing for me, it's always been this emotion and nerve and the s my music hits and the second I walk out, it's gone. Like, I don't have any of it when I'm in the ring waiting for the other guy or whatever. I don't have any of it. Um, and it's an interesting thing to me that, um, I'm friends with Floyd Mayweather and incredible athlete. Yeah. And I was walking him to the ring one time and, uh, I think we fought Marquez and, um, we have the early in the guys came and got me and I wanted to watch some of the undercard and then they came and got me and they said, you know, Florida, just want to say hi before he starts getting ready and stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:34:56       Chat with me for a few minutes. So I came, we, Steph and I went backstage with my wife and, um, we in his locker room and he's laying down on the couch watching basketball game and we come in and say hello and all that. And he's a guy I haven't seen, you know, now we're talking a little bit, but I'm trying to be ultra respectful of him. He's about to go in, you know, massive fight. And so I, uh, the second, there's like a lull in the conversation. I'm like, all right man, well we're going to get out of your hair and head back in and we'll come back here when it's time for us to get ready for your deal. And he's like, man, you don't gotta take off. She could sit down and we're, I'm, I'm enjoying the conversation. Have funny. And he's like completely relaxed. And I said, so another low in the conversation, I go, we're going to run flood. I, I don't want to be in your way. And he goes,

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       honor,

Speaker 4:          00:35:40       I'm telling you I'm not. I'm just chilling, watching the game. And I said, you're not wound up about this at all. And he goes, why would I be wound up? I'm either ready or I'm not worrying

Speaker 3:          00:35:52       bottle right now. I get to change a damn thing. Right? It was going to happen. It's going to happen here. Right. So I've either done everything I can to be ready for this or I'm not. It's a fair point. I sat back down, we watch a game. You're like, all right, I want to be here. Right? Yeah. Just as very calm and relaxed. And I think when you feel in your mind that you're ready, you're ready and you're going to have those nerves, but it's, you know, it's there. When you were coming up, let's just say when you, when you would hit your stride somewhat. So you're starting to, uh, make the ascent through the ranks and really become popular. When you thought of the word successful, who was the person in your head at that time?

Speaker 6:          00:36:36       MMM,

Speaker 4:          00:36:39       I don't know. It's hard to say because I looked at an inside of the inside of our business. There were guys like for me, um, you know, my favorite performer character was ric flair. Um, just kind of felt like overall he had the best package of everything to offer. You know, there were guys that were great showman, very popular, or guys that were great at one thing or Bobby, he had the kind of the Combo of great in ring performer. It made everybody look good, does great character, all, all these things inside the wrestling business. That was a component of success for me. Um, just that level of performer, the way he handled himself in the ring. I always want it to be the in ring kind of general and understand. And I just, one of the things I prided myself on at the peak of my career was

Speaker 6:          00:37:27       mmm.

Speaker 4:          00:37:29       I could tell you at any given time if there was six people involved in something, I can tell you at any given time, if I close my eyes in the ring where they all were like no matter how much they were moving around and what they were doing, I knew where they were. I knew what they had in their hands. I knew like just on glimpses as I was moving around the ring, I always felt like it was my job. If something was going to screw up, that was my fault. It wasn't because he didn't know what was coming. It was because I didn't control that. Um, so I was felling to control was mine to take because it was what I could count on. I couldn't rely on, you know, this might get screwed up because maybe there's a confusion between those two guys over there.

Speaker 4:          00:38:08       It's supposed to do their thing. So I always took it on me to make sure I was there to tell them this is coming up, be ready, here we go, get the chair, whatever. You know, um, flare was very good at that. So that was like, for me, from that point of view was a success, um, component. But there was a lot of things that I looked for. Wrestling didn't define me as far as what I saw was successful. I looked at and um, you know, I looked at my, and one now Vince, I looked at that is a guy that saw business that was one thing, but had a vision of it being something else. He saw this little territory business and thought they should be one global brand that everybody watches because the world's getting smaller. Cable is taking over. And so he had this vision and then he just kind of set out doing it.

Speaker 4:          00:38:59       I looked at Arnold, I remember as a kid reading education of a bodybuilder and very structured, methodical set of here's what I want to do. Here's what I want to be and here's how I'm going to get there. You know, that those kind of things in those kind of people were success models for me. Arnold. Um, was that in the structure? You know, I just said it to him a few weeks ago. Like for me, I say this in interviews a lot. The Jim taught me everything I need to know for life. You know, I walked into Jim at 14, I fell in love with it. I fell in love with the end result. Look right as always in awe of these big, powerful, impressive guys. I think it's part of what I dug about wrestling. You know, I enjoyed the physical and all that stuff of it and fell in love with that really holy, that's probably what led me to the gym at first.

Speaker 4:          00:39:59       But, but just the discipline of it and the going to the gym. And when I say it's like life, the more you put it in, the more you get out, the harder you work, the better the results, you know, if you're willing to prepare to sacrifice. It touches about going to the gym, lifting weights, and then going out and goofing off. The rest of the time, it's your life. So if you discipline your diet, if you discipline your rest, if you don't go to the party with your friends, if you don't do all these things, your results follow suit. Um, you know, I, I just did, um, I just got inducted into the international sports hall of fame. Arnold's international sports, all friends. But I bring it up because Evander Holyfield was there and he told his story and I never heard it said this way before and I'm sorry of Andrew, but I'm going to steal this.

Speaker 4:          00:40:44       Um, he told me that, you know, he was giving his speech and he said that his coach at one point in time told them very, very first day, he said, you could be Muhammad Ali, you could be the next Muhammad Ali. And uh, he said, do you want to do that? And he, he said he had to ask his mom and then he went back home and he came back and he said, I want to do that. And he said, okay, is that a dream or a goal? This is a difference. I'd never heard it said that way before, but it struck to me so much so that I've said it to my kid now. Is that a dream or goal cause a dream to something you fantasize about that just will never happen? Probably the goal is something you set a plan and work towards and achieve and set a dream or goal. Um, kind of always looked at my stuff that way. So the people that were successful models to me were people that had structured goals and then put a plan in place to get to those things. And I think that's what impressed me about Arnold. You weren't impressed me about my father in law to this day. He's still very much a, you know, here's the goal, here's how I'm going to get there.

Speaker 3:          00:41:53       Energizer bunny. That's amazing. Yeah. You guys seem like peas in a pod from us. Stamina and endurance. Stamina.

Speaker 4:          00:41:59       And do you, I've heard you say it before when when you have that goal in mind, now it's not, I got to do this thing to get that done. It's, you can't wait to do that thing to get that done because it's going to get you closer to your goal.

Speaker 3:          00:42:11       Right. Well, since the compass that allows you to find order in the chaos to the, uh, parenting. I don't, I don't yet have kids now that I know of. Uh, at some point I would love to have a family. How do you think about being a father? What type of father do you want to be? What do you think is, is important in that, in that role?

Speaker 4:          00:42:34       That's a tough one. I have three girls. Three, uh, I have, uh, an eight, six and four. Very well spaced. Yeah. And that's it. We're done. Yeah. But, um, it's, man, it's, it's hard when the pressure as a parent, if you, you know, hopefully if everybody takes the job seriously, you know this, you're giving them the examples of how they're going to live their life. Kids don't do what you say. They do what they see. Um, so how you live your life. Is there an example? You know, I've heard it said, and I believe this is like the way I treat their mother and the way I treat them is what they're going to look for in a, in a significant other. Um, well you got to think, oh yeah, like so what are, what do I want them to have in their life? Holy cow and I got to do all that stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:43:29       It's a lot, you know, and then you add in all the other things of life. It's a very, it's a very difficult challenge. Um, but you, you want to, you want to teach them right from wrong. You want to teach them, you want to give them a path and a direction. But also same point in time, you know, you learn as much from you failures as you do from your successes. So you can't, you can't give them everything that you want to help them. Ouzo bad. Like I'm watching you make a mistake and I want to help you, but go ahead and make the mistake because you got to learn from that mistake. You know what I mean? Um, and it's, it's tough to do, but you have to and there's no manual. That's the hard thing about kids, right? There's no manual that comes with and you're just doing the best you can. I remember when we got our first one home, we, the boss battle, they put it in the car seat and you'd take the thing home and then we walked in the door and we put it on the step and we were like, what do we do now? We just stood there looking at her for a little bit like what, what do we like? What do we do? Like eventually it, she cried and he had a feeder and whatever. You don't know what to do.

Speaker 4:          00:44:40       We have a kid only cap. Yeah. Luckily I was a, I've got to go on the road.

Speaker 3:          00:44:54       The aspect of routines that we touched on earlier, I'd love to, to, to bring back into focus for a second, uh, specifically morning routines. What is, what, what does the first 60 minutes of your day look like? And I'll probably ask a bunch of really irritating nit picky questions because that's how I am. But what does, what does, what does, uh, when do you wake up? What does the first 60 to 90 days, 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like? Yeah. So

Speaker 4:          00:45:17       I, I wish I had a really cool example of that. Like, you know, Robin don't wake up, I go on a Cryo Chamber, Cryo Chamber. He's like, if this elaborate ritual of mind altering spiritual, like jumping into a hot tank and a cold tagging of mine involves my kids waking me up at an ungodly hour after I, you know, like we, we work under the premise of my wife and I and to me, she gets us even more than I do because she's got all the roles and all this stuff and then she's mom. And when you're the dad, it's, it's, um, it's a big responsibility. But the mom, like if anything happens, if they wake up, they go to her first. You know, when the kids wake up in the middle of the night, unless they're scared, they might call dad if they're scared. But usually it's mom because they just more of the comforter, right?

Speaker 4:          00:46:06       So it's all those things. So that's an even harder job. But, um, you know, we, we train late at night, we get home, we tried to get home every night, no matter what, to spend a little bit of time with them and put them down and, and, uh, you know, read them a book, whatever, get them in bed. So Joe comes to my house around 10 o'clock. So by him, yeah. So I get them done, you know, we get them in bed, um, change and then Joe's there and we start training. And usually by, you know, by the time you warm up takes me a while to warm up at 10 o'clock at night, train and do all this stuff. By the time we get done, usually it's one o'clock, you know, in that ballpark. And then, you know, you get in the bed after one o'clock, they were up at like six at the latest, you know, and they're in the room.

Speaker 4:          00:46:54       So there's no really cool ritual. I wish I could say jumping in a cryo chamber. It's usually me stumbling downstairs with them, um, to try to make every morning. My ritual is, um, I, um, I'm also ironically out of your book, Dave Palumbo. Jumbo Palumbo. Yeah. Dave has, I've been friends with them for years and he, um, he's a big um, uh, ketogenic diet guy. So he like works with my diet a lot when I'm getting ready for wrestlemania stuff. So Dave's kind of my diet guy uses protein powder species protein is every morning roll downstairs, two scoops of whey protein, a bunch of Starbucks coffee, powdered Starbucks coffee, uh, some Macadamia nut oil and I make a shake and that's the start. Like did you just got to get the kick in the ass?

Speaker 3:          00:47:47       Starbucks macadamia nut oil.

Speaker 4:          00:47:50       What else was in there? A two scoops of ice, ally's protein and some ice blend it all up. It's a Starbucks, a smoothie kind of concoction, but very healthy and has enough caffeine in there to at least make me realize what's going on. Get them ready for school. My wife and I get them ready for school, uh, jump in the shower either, depending if I'm getting ready for like Wrestlemania, it's either throw sweats on, cause I'm gonna bring them to school. And then get a workout in because usually I train twice a day when I'm getting ready for Wrestlemania or something, but a train and then off to work. If I'm not getting ready for Wrestlemania, it's shower, get ready, suit, bring them to school, you know, we drive them to their school, get them to school, get them in their class to all this stuff and then drive to the office, start the day, get home at, you know, seven 38 o'clock at night and repeat. And this is all in Connecticut is they're all in Connecticut. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:48:48       indeed. The HQ is, I want to say stem that can get this wrong. So Stanford is it separate is, yeah. Yup. See it right from 95. Right off the highway. Close to the UBS building. Yeah. Yeah. Down the street. Not Far. And he used to lift and I used to work there, the slip of the tongue and lived there. It's probably appropriate. He pretty much lived in the office. What is your, uh, what is your role currently at WWE in the, in the executive capacity?

Speaker 4:          00:49:14       So I am the executive vice president of talent, live events and creative. So if you look at the core of what we do as a company, like from the product itself, raw, smackdown, all that. And we're a lot more than that because we have movies and music and like it's, I say all the time, it's like saying Marvel's a comic book company. But that's the core of what we do. I control those aspects. So talent and that goes from, we have a department tallow relations, which is like their HR and they handle everything that has to do with talent from their travel to and anything that has to do with them. All the logistics of Wrestlemania Week, you know, what talents are doing. There's a thousand appearances for talent. Literally in the week of Wrestlemania. They have to handle all the logistics of getting who were making sure nobody's late and all of it.

Speaker 4:          00:50:13       It's amazing. Um, from to talent development, which is the biggest probably thing that's closest to my heart that I do, which is where do we find talent? What are we re recruit them from? Where do we, where do we, um, where do we recruit them from? How do we train them? We opened a performance center in Orlando, Florida, um, to a developmental territory or a developmental, um, system that I have called NXT that has become kind of like an alternative brand, um, through to how do they then evolve and get into the main roster of the WWE. So basically what we did is kind of created college football to get guys ready for the NFL. And then, um, the last part of what I do is creative, which Vince is kind of the ultimate filter of creative. I'm more, um, while I, I weigh in and a lot on that stuff and the content that's going to go in the network and all these things that I weigh in on it from a creative concept.

Speaker 4:          00:51:21       But I'm also approving tee shirt designs and banner designs and going through all that stuff through all the different departments and doing the approvals of all that day to day process. Sounds like quite a few hats. It's a lot of hats. It's funny, I used to marvel at Vince ability when I first started coming in the office. Um, I, I've had a working kind of behind the scenes relationship with Vince since probably I started in the WWE and 95 since like early 96. I just was always fascinated with a behind the scenes of the business and how it actually all came together as much as I was doing it in the ring. And he and I just kind of clicked in that sense. And we started working together and I didn't meet staff, his daughter until quite a few years later. And then we ended up having a relationship and the whole thing.

Speaker 4:          00:52:10       But I had this working relationship with Vince and as time went on and I got more and more involved in that and then kind of later in my career, he kept always asking me like, when are you going to stop messing around in the ring and come do some real work in the office? You know, you need to be in the office. I need to get you in the office. And, um, I used to marvel at how many hats he wore and how quickly he could change them. You know, he'd be talking about a foreign tour and box office receipts or, or you know, I'm a touring strategy or marketing strategy for that. And then two seconds later he's looking at it, a tee shirt design and approving colors and that, and then that would go away. And now he's, he's, you know, looking at some new talent or he's like, it's just was so many hats that he, that he wore and it used to amaze me how quickly he could change gears and I find myself now having to do that same thing. Um, and it's, it's really cool to see yourself growing that way cause they used to think about how does he keep that all straight. And at first I couldn't keep it straight and now you just, you learn it, you know, you, you, you learned that you adapt to that process. I know we only have a few minutes left. I feel like I can ask you questions for hours. So maybe we'll do a round two sometimes. I love it. This is great. The, I'd love to ask you some rapid

Speaker 3:          00:53:25       fire questions and, uh, I think we could do an entire session just on productivity, but just really quickly, what is the, the book that you have gifted most to other people?

Speaker 6:          00:53:35       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:53:36       Or any book you've gifted a lot to other people. Um

Speaker 6:          00:53:44       hmm.

Speaker 4:          00:53:46       I don't know that I could answer that question. I don't give books, watch.

Speaker 3:          00:53:50       Not a problem. Well, you, my friends aren't big readers need to work on that. We can come back to that. What, uh, what, what band or song have you been playing most on your iPhone or, or, uh, in the car or otherwise?

Speaker 4:          00:54:04       It's lot lately it's been anything heavy. Metallica, Motorhead, I'm, you know, I'm in training mode for Wrestlemania, so I, I at 10 o'clock at night I need to put something on the stereo that just makes me, gets me an ass kicking mode.

Speaker 3:          00:54:19       Uh, if you could only do one or two physical exercises for the rest of your life movements, what would they be?

Speaker 4:          00:54:28       Wow. Um, I think if, if, if at this age, if I could do like a free standing, just bodyweight squats and pushups and, um, kind of bodyweight exercises would be where I'd be at because I think you can stay in phenomenal shape doing them and you don't need a whole lot of space or equipment.

Speaker 3:          00:54:47       I should dive at some point. Introduce juicy to a buddy of mine named Travis brewer who is a top competitor on American Ninja Warrior and you guys could, could trade work outs. I think that'd be amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:54:56       Yeah. Easily. Yeah, I bet you that's awesome

Speaker 3:          00:54:59       monster. I bet. What advice, this will be the last question before I ask you where people can find out more about you online, but, uh, what advice would you give your 20 year old self?

Speaker 4:          00:55:15       Don't take it all so serious, you know, and, and, and be more open. Um, it's, it's man, when you're so focused on making it and you're, um, I always had fun in the business and it was one of the things that I like. I could, I, I can look at it now and say like, I didn't take everything so seriously that it was detrimental to me, but like there were times when it just, something happened and just eat me up, you know what I mean? And I would be call. Yes. Just couldn't take it because I was so hungry to get to that next place. And, um, there you need to keep that, that perspective of where everything lays out. You know, there's times when I, uh, when over the years when we've looked at each other and my friends within the business, little group of guys, and we'd always look at each other and at a certain point in time you just laugh and go like, hey, it's the phony fight business. We're wrestling our underwear, you know what I mean? Like, what am I getting all worked up about? You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:56:20       And, and

Speaker 4:          00:56:20       I think that that is the biggest thing is just not taking it so seriously. And then, and then being open to stuff. You know, it's funny, I mentioned that I listened to the Anthony Robbins interview with you and I was fascinated with it. I met Anthony one time and it was probably 2000. I was just kinda like getting to a high spot in my career and just happened to be in a hotel. I look over next to me, he's checking in next minute. It's just a big giant dude, you know? And uh, but I recognize him from TV and he looked over at me and said, how you doing? I'm great. How are you? Good. And then he got my keys and I went and get in the elevator and he gets in the elevator with me and he looked at me and said, um, forgive me.

Speaker 4:          00:57:05       I don't know. I don't know what you do, but I clearly see people looking at you and I clearly see your somebody and I don't what, what do you do? And so I tell them who I am and what I do. And I said, I've seen you on TV, you know, and um, you know, one of those two second chance meetings in an elevator, right? And this really impressed me that I get back a couple of weeks later and I get a big box of like the cassette and his books and all his stuff that he had written me this handwritten letter and sent it, didn't know how to get ahold of me, send it to the WWE office, whatever, two weeks, a month later when I come back through the office at some point in time in my travels, they give it to me and I'm like, wow, this is amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:57:43       I was too young and stupid and unopened at the time to foster a relationship or I listened to the tapes and I, and I read the books and all that stuff. And if I'd have thought about it, maybe I would have reached back out to say thank you and like, hey, like this is really cool. Can you know? And he invited me to one of his seminars and, and you know, I was just at that time like I'm doing good. Like I don't, you know, it was close to it. I wish I was more open to it. I wish I could have had the bandwidth to not be so absorbed in what I was doing and my moments going for that I could have said by this guy who could teach me so much and Matt I should call it. And just, you know, to foster that relationship cause he, he put the, put the, put the handout and I was a guy who know I don't need to him, you know, and, and it's, um, and those are things that I look, there's other opportunities in my life that I wish, Oh man, I wish that was right in front of me and I could have grabbed that, but I was too narrow minded to see it, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:58:40       Well, this has been fascinating and you're fascinating guy. I would love to do around two sometime, but we're out of time. I know your schedules incredibly impressive to me. Ah, where can people find more about you online? Say Hi and so on. It's uh, so uh, Twitter, uh, what, what's my Twitter handle? It's like a triple H. I don't know. I just know how to push the buttons on it. I don't use search, easy peasy. ww.com is for our, our, um, for our company and our site and all that. Um, you know, I do stuff on Twitter and whether anybody believes in or not, I actually do it. It's not somebody else doing it. It's me. So if it's terrible, it was me. If it was really good, it was me. Um, you know, uh, if you want us to go back and look at my career, um, the WWE network is a great place to do it.

Speaker 4:          00:59:35       All the historical content is on there. Um, you know, that's, that's really me. But, uh, you know, for me, I'm a, I know you say, I'm fascinated, I'm fascinated by this process and what you do and how you do it. Um, and I'd love to do this again because I think these kinds of things, it's funny, a lot of things I said in here when you ask me questions today, like I'm, I feel like I gave you long winded answers. I apologize if I did, but like, so I'm, I'm almost, I'm almost explaining it to myself as you.

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       Well, like I never thought about it that way, so I'm kind of explaining it to you going like, yeah, that's really cool. You know, not long winded at all. They were, uh, you're a great storyteller. You're a great story creator, uh, an incredible performer and I hope I am, I'll never be as big as you, but hopefully I will be as bulletproof as you are when I'm 45 so until next time. Thank you so much. Thank you very much man.
