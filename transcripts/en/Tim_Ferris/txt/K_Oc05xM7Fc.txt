Speaker 1:          00:00          Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism.

Speaker 2:          00:24          This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic. You might remember four sigmatic for their mushroom coffee, which was created by those clever finished founders and when I first mentioned that coffee on this podcast, the product sold out in less than a week. It lights you up like a Christmas tree, which can be really useful. However, recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum and new product and that is their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep. As you guys may know, longtime listeners, at least I struggled with insomnia for decades. I have a largely fixed that, but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy, still isn't easy very often and I found Reishi, which I've been fascinated by for a few years now, has been very, very effective and calming their old formula. However, four sigmatic old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners, all sweeteners for a host of reasons, and I then just ping them and asked, hey guys, I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested, but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it, if too much of a headache, don't worry.

Speaker 2:          01:31          And they are always game for experimentation. And so they created a special custom version without the Stevia, without sweeteners. Now it is part of my nightly routine. Their ratio elixir comes in single serving packets, which are perfect for travel and in fact I'm about to leave the country right now and I have a packet in front of me. This just going to sit in the end of my carry on bag. You only need hot water and it mixes very, very easily. Here's some recommended copy that they put in the read, so I'm going to read it and then I'll give you my take quote, a warning. For those in the experimental mindset, Reishi is strong and bitter in parentheses like any great medicine. So if the bitterness is too much, I recommend trying it with honey and or nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

Speaker 2:          02:16          So I'm going to say no, you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter. And maybe you should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing young ins. When they say Boone should a cool, which means you're not able to eat bitterness. Bitter is in many cases and indication of things that help liver detoxification and so on. Not saying that's the case here, but I've tested this ratio lecture on family members, on friends, everybody has liked it. It's a little bit, or if the, it's not that hard. So I would just say suck it up and no, don't put in honey or not milk or any of that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea. It's delicious I think. Right? If you like poo air, that kind of stuff, that type of tea, you're going to dig it.

Speaker 2:          02:59          So just try it. Okay. Back to then my read. If you'd like to naturally improve your sleep, both onset and quality, I think naturally you might just enjoy this ratio lecture without any sweeteners.

Speaker 2:          06:06          Hello, boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. Longtime. No, see, long time no hear. How'd you cope with gin or should I say, how'd you owe me a [inaudible]? Something along those lines. Little rusty, but I digress. The Tim Ferriss show is typically where I share the habits and routines of world class performers as well as try to spot and discuss the patterns amongst them. This episode is going to be a role reversal and since I am a professional dilutant professional amateur of sorts, a little self conscious about this. However, recently cal Fussman at Cal Fussman, F, U, s s, m, a, n the man who's transformed oral history into an art form. That's not my quote. And it's not his, that's what people say about him because he's interviewed everyone from Clooney to Gorbachev to Reagan to you name it. He's a big deal.

Speaker 2:          06:59          And uh, he is also one of the principle writers or was one of the senior writers behind the, what I learned column for Esquire magazine forever. Just how he got to kick the tires and meet many of these folks interviewed me for his podcast. He interviewed me in two separate interviews and in true cal fashion, he took the conversation to places I never could have expected. He really is a master of the craft of asking questions, and I love speaking with him as a friend, but I also love studying him as an interviewer. Cal said this interview was one of his favorites he's ever heard from me because the way he put it was quote, we get to learn what made Tim Tim and quote. We dug into some of the childhood stories that I typically hold back. I don't like to talk about some of the early days and childhood stuff.

Speaker 2:          07:56          Uh, but cal can pry it out of me. Cal said he wanted to build a story to understand what happened to me on my journey, how it explains where I am now, what makes me tick, and where I still hope to improve and grow. And I think he was able to unearth all of that. So if you're looking for a true world class performer, someone who's the best at what they do, then you should probably look for one of my other episodes, Tim. Dot. Blog forward slash, podcast, there are 300 other people you can find Jamie Foxx, you can find Arnold Schwarzenegger, you can find chess prodigies like Josh Waitzkin. But if you want to hear about my somewhat odd, maybe quirky path that took me from my days as a wee lad to where I am now, then this may be an episode of interest. Cal is really, really a fascinating specimen, and I've interviewed him twice.

Speaker 2:          08:49          If you want to hear cal side of the story, his entire insane meandering adventure of life, which includes taking shots with hunter s Thompson and working alongside hunter, uh, for a period of time, you can hear that at Tim. Dot. Blog forward slash cow and you should absolutely listen to more of cows interviews. So check out his new podcast for which I was interviewed. Big questions with cal Fussman. So does Google big questions with cal Fussman, F, U, s, s, m, a, n, where he interviews all sorts of folks like Coby Bryant and Daymond John and Seth Goden and on and on and on. And then there's me odd man out. So without further ado and preamble, I'm kind of stalling with this intro. I apologize guys. Here is my interview, Aka being interviewed by Cal Fussman.

Speaker 3:          09:44          Just went off to spring board rather just one off the springboard. So I've been thinking about this conversation for a long time and I basically had two ways to prepare. I thought I won. I know you, uh, we been in the sauna together. We have met your mom. That's right. Met Your Dad. They've gone out to eat. You won't let me pick up the cheque. Listen to your podcasts, read your books. So I do in some ways, no, you and I thought, well I could do even more research or I could try to just wipe my memory clean and approach this in a way that I really don't know Tim. And I'm going to try and forget a little about what I know and just act like I bumped him to Tim Ferriss on the train. Holy Shit. This is Tim Ferriss. How are you doing?

Speaker 2:          10:55          You're pretty good at trains for my term, my memory here. There you go. I'm good

Speaker 3:          10:59          trains. So, and it's funny, when I went out to see you, I went on a train. And so I thought that would be an interesting way to go. And the more I think about it, that thing that really hits me about you goes to a story about Brian Grazer and Ron Howard. Okay. So one is a producer and the other's a filmmaker, their partners, and I'm interviewing them and the Claridge Hotel in London, and we're talking, we're having a great conversation. And in the middle of this interview, a fire alarm goes off and waters.
