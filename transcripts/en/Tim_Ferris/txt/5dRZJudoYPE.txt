Speaker 2:          00:02:45       this episode is brought to you by Charlotte's web, which makes a CBD oil, a hemp extract that has become one of my goto tools. No, I have never really talked about CBD oil and cannabis has never really been the plant for me and, and we're talking about hemp, but nonetheless, after several nights of inexplicably insomnia, this is about a year ago, I just could not get to sleep, saved my life and after other fixes failed. So Melatonin, California poppy extract, Dah Dah in elite athlete introduced me to this non psychoactive extract and Bam, problem solved. I had some of the best sleep that I'd had in months. Now I don't use sleep aids on a daily basis, but this has become part of my toolkit and I hope to be exploring other applications soon. CBD oil products have exploded in popularity in the health and wellness and fitness worlds. And Charlotte's web is one of the top players that offers a broad spectrum hemp extract with CBD in the form of oils, capsules and topical products.

Endo meaning from within like endo versus Exoskeleton for instance. So endocannabinoid system works with your body.

Speaker 3:          00:05:45       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:46       Well, hello you sexy little minx. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to interview and deconstruct world class performers. Whether they come from the worlds of chess, sports, business, it really doesn't matter. We're trying to spot patterns of excellence. What are the habits, the routines, the favorite books, the morning exercises, whatever it might be that you can test and apply in your own lives. And my guest today is a friend we've been trying to make. The podcast happened for quite a few years now and he is a polymath. You need to listen to this episode. Nick Kokona says his name, last name is spelledK , o. K. O, Nas. Nick OCONUS on Instagram at n Kokona us on Twitter at Nick Kokonas. Nick is the CO owner and cofounder of the Alinea Group of restaurants, which includes a linea next, the aviary Royster. I think I'm getting that right, and the Aviary, New York City and YC.

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       That is, he's also the founder and CEO of [inaudible] Inc a reservations and CRM system for restaurants with more than two and a half million diners and clients in more than 20 countries. Now you might be thinking, wait a second. Restaurants food, that's not my thing. Doesn't matter. We're going to get into philosophy. We're going to get into derivatives trading. We're going to get into books like fooled by randomness, the problems philosophy. Hi. Let's see peregrinations of an epicurean and how nick seems to break every industry or type of business he goes into and the most productive way possible. It's a really fun conversation. But back to the bio Alinea, a, l, I, N, e, a, which by the way, I based basically an entire section of the four hour chef on, which was one of my books because I was so impressed. Alinea has been named the best restaurant in America and best restaurant in the world by organizations and lists as diverse as the James Beard Foundation.

Speaker 2:          00:07:43       They give James Beard awards out, which kind of like the Oscars in the food world, world's 50 best TripAdvisor, Yelp, gourmet magazine and elite traveler. His restaurants have won nearly every accolade afford them despite the fact that uh, he does not or didn't at least have any experience whatsoever in restaurants. And he had some amazing, amazing partners we get into. But that set of beginner's eyes is really, really crucial. And we dig into how he cultivates that a lot. Nick has been a, he uses this word, a subversive entrepreneur, which I agree with. And Angel investors since 1996 he spent a decade is a very successful derivatives trader, has co written three books and believes in radical transparency and markets and business. His latest effort is the aviary cocktail book, which is perhaps the most gorgeous book I've ever seen. I got an early copy. It is stunning.

Speaker 2:          00:08:40       It is just unbelievable what they've done. It is self published, has already sold that is presold nearly a million dollars in copies and is being released right now shipped right now in October of 2018 it is truly, I think the most beautiful book I have ever seen and held in my hands so you can find out all about it. You can see all sorts of photos and samples at the Aviary, book.com that's Dubdubdub dot the Aviary, book.com a v. I. E. A. R. Y. Check it out so I'll leave it at that. Please listen to this episode even if you have no interest in food, it doesn't matter. We span so many different businesses, industries, life lessons. I had a blast with this and I hope you do as well here to Nick Kokonas.

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       Nick, welcome to the show. Thanks Tim. Awesome to be here finally. Yeah, yeah, we have the benefit of having spent some time together and I've been fed a lot of caffeine by you and you're also a great help with the four hour chef. So I wanted it to right off the bat. Thank you for that. It was a really lovely experience. It was kind of a fun thing cause I remember when you sent me like a preview of the book and then you called me to say like, Hey, you know, do you want to say anything about it? And I was like on a chairlift and I was like, by the time I get off this chair lift, I will have a blurb for you with such pressure. We, well, which, which meant a lot. And pressure I think is the word to describe, uh, so much about you and your life.

Speaker 2:          00:10:26       I want to say trajectory, but I'm not even sure that is the right word. And I thought a fun way to kick off the conversation would be to share with people listening, some of the back and forth that we had when we were brainstorming what a podcast might look like. Because certainly I, I don't think of you first and foremost as a food guy per se. And we were, we were having this exchange via text and then via email. And I thought I'd just read one of your responses as we were swapping different ideas and uh, I, I, I'll probably edit for space a little bit here, but not by much. And here we go. I'm a huge believer in radical transparency in business. I give numbers and burn bridges with big companies because I think that a lot of times people don't ask the basic questions and publishing, for instance, how much did that book cost to print?

Speaker 2:          00:11:21       How many did it sell? Oddly, those numbers are very hard to come by. I dug for months, years ago to do the Alinea book the right way for bars. Why does a bartender wash dishes and talk to customers? We've redesigned the bar experience in one best bar in the world for restaurants. Why is it the only form of entertainment that has only mutual promise to show up and then it goes into behavioral economics and in parentheses, I don't even know how to pronounce his last name correctly, Richard Thaler, or is it Taylor? Taylor is a friend and investor just won the Nobel prize investing, been beating the market for nearly 30 years. Everything in all caps is about asymmetric risk taking in information and yet people, people's perception of risk or of what I do is that it's risky. It is not. And a in a separate exchange, when we were talking about many of the topics that you could talk about outside of say restaurants, bars and so on, even though that's been a big part of your life in reason, history, many of these different experiments, explorations, portions of your career, topics that you could talk about and then going into what you said, they come down to a single thought, really wherever there is opaque information that should be obvious, run to that gap.

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       So I struggle with where to even begin with the 20, the 20 options that we have here. But maybe you, maybe you could, maybe you could explain to me how behavioral economics and Richard Thaler fit into this. Uh, just just for curiosity's sake.

Speaker 4:          00:12:55       Yeah. I mean, well, I'll go back to the word you used options because I started out, um, back in 1992 or three studying options, trading derivatives trading. And I think there's a huge misconception about what that is because of movies, because of the big short, because of, you know, Wall Street, all of that. Um, it's a bit like playing a game of chess for a living or being the house at a casino, that sort of thing. It's about taking, you know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of decision per day and pretending it's like a big decision tree. And any given decision is, is probably got, you know, if you're really good, 48% chance of being wrong. So you have to be, you have to be really, really good at constantly being comfortable being wrong. But knowing that your overall number of, of decisions that you're going to be right more than Iran.

Speaker 4:          00:13:53       And so like I know there's like a big theme, a lot of the folks that you have on, like they talked about success or failure or how to measure those things. And I kind of don't look at it as a success or failure with anything. I look at it as just like is my pattern of decisions. Correct. Um, and then getting back to your actual question with Professor Thaler and behavioral economics, and I mean essentially what they're looking at is, is decision making, what drives people to make certain decisions? What's rational about those decisions? What is mostly irrational or emotional or what decisions do we make that people don't even realize they're making a decision, which is often the case as well. And then if you think about it, every single form of what we do, art, commerce, science, you know, I'm picking a mate, like all those things, um, it comes down to a whole bunch of decisions that you make without often really thinking about the decision itself.

Speaker 4:          00:14:51       Um, not that you can go around walking around going, wow, I've just made another decision, but when you are doing, you know, business or, or starting a company or publishing a book or whatever it may be, you can be intentional about that and realize that it's going to be an iterative process. And so I think that's, that's been not only the case for me in learning how to filter things through that mindset. But you like when you said there isn't really a trajectory, like I kind of look at everything I've done is, is the same in a way, even though other people look at it and go like, wow, you went from being a derivatives trader to owning restaurants. Like that's weird. And I studied philosophy in college, so like people are like, how do you go from philosophy to finance, you know? And to me it was all the same thing.

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       How was that that particular transition or rather a progression I suppose from philosophy to finance is one that you and I haven't really talked about and that that one is interesting too. I'd love to explore for a second and we're going to go into a million different nooks and crannies. Was Do you feel like philosophy was studying philosophy undergrad was an asset that then leader helped you or was it just an interest you explored on route to other things?

Speaker 4:          00:16:07       No, I, I can't remotely imagine having not not done that. And the way that actually I did it was really interesting. I had no intention of when I got to college I thought I'd study political science, economics, pre law kind of thing, something like that. And um, my very like second week at Colgate University, a wonderful professor who just passed away last year at 94 years old, really great mentor to me, Professor Jerome Bel Myth, I was a tenured professor at Colgate for almost 60 years. Pulled me aside, um, introduction to logic one o one, and basically said, what do you, what are you studying here? And uh, I told him and he said, nope, you're going to be a philosophy major. I'm going to tell you, I'm going to teach you how to think. Um, and, and he would, he was the kind of guy, like, there's like, there's this great scene in a river runs through it where the, where the dad, you know, every time the kid writes an essay, like the young, uh, you know, fishermen kid writes an essay and he brings it to his father to be graded.

Speaker 4:          00:17:05       He gives it back to him and says half as long again. And that's like long before that movie ever came out, um, professor Balmouth would, would essentially assigned a paper to the class and say it should be about 15 pages. And people would be like, well, how long? And he'd always say like, you know, how long has the piece of string? Like it's however long it needs to be. And then he would tell me years can't be longer than three pages. And, and people would be like jealous. Like, wow, you only have to write three pages if you take it seriously. That is a much, much harder thing to do. So he really trained me as well as a number of other professors there to be clear and thinking succinct to, to you know, understand what logic was to process information and really to look for parallels in different fields and different fields of thought.

Speaker 4:          00:17:52       Um, and so man, like when I got out of school, I went to law school for like a day and a half. I don't need to pay. I got into Penn like a joint JD PhD program at Penn and as soon as I kind of knew who the other folks were and what their, their desires and trajectories where I was like, oh, this isn't actually a good fit for me. And, um, I remember my future father in law told my now wife then girlfriend that I was in danger of becoming an intellectual bum because I, I dropped out of a dropped out of law school before I really entered law school. And, um, you know, I floundered around for a little while. Um, but you know, if you grew up in Chicago, you end up meeting people who, who had this unusual lifestyle. And that was back in the days pre, pre Internet, pre, pre electronic trading.

Speaker 4:          00:18:42       I'm pretty high frequency trading where there was literally people on a giant trading floor that shouting at each other and you either were attracted to the, I don't know, almost animalistic nature of that. Um, and for me it was like a huge challenge because there are people down there that were, had phd's from Mit and then there was people who were like, you know, butchers that went down there with $100,000 and just kicked ass. And, and, and so it was, it wasn't about your level of education or any of the stuff I already talked about. It was about can you show up every day and every day is game day and be really disciplined and very clear, headed in with chaos around you and you get introduced to that world. You know, if you grow up in Chicago, you know, some of these guys and some of them are flashy and I can remember the exact moment, and I'm not going to name a name here as you'll find out why in a second.

Speaker 4:          00:19:37       But I was walking down the street. I, I was like, you know, six months out of college, kind of didn't know what I was going to do. And I was walking down the street and I bumped into Guy I knew in high school and you know, he wasn't the best student. He didn't try the hardest. And I was like, Hey, what are you doing now? And, and he was like, well, I'm just rehabbing these homes. I thought literally like, oh, he's a construction worker. And I was like, you know, what are you doing with him? And he's like, well, I just bought this block. I'm turning this all over. This is a true story, but this is so not like, you know, a good reason to do something. But, but I looked at him and I was like, what are you talking about? And he's like, yeah, I skipped college.

Speaker 4:          00:20:16       And I started out as a runner on the floor of the merch. And now I, you know, I own like 25 condos and three town homes and I trade. And I kind of went like, wow, you know, I don't know what I knew a little bit about it. I'd been down on the floor before it just visiting, but I was kind of like, that's fascinating life. That is truly fascinating thing. And you know, I, I went down, visited the floor, I had to fake my resume in the wrong direction to get a job. That's true story. Um, like people lie on their resume all the time. I'm probably the only person that got rid of like, you know, my degree in my, my, uh, academic awards and all that because you know, to get a clerk job on the floor, the last thing they wanted was someone with a good degree, Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude, all that stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:21:02       Um, so I faked my resume, got a $5 an hour job and look for a mentor. And I found a guy named Frank Serino who, um, was it Chicago research and trading, who's, which also was founded by a philosophy major. It's actually very common. And, um, why is that common? I don't wish I knew the answer. I don't know the answer. I do know that there's three or four of the largest trading firms in the world, uh, run by philosophy majors. Um, and if you look back at my, my class just of of, you know, there's a few professors in there, but there are people who make movies. There's a guy who runs an ad agency, a large ad agency like it was, it's a really interesting path. It's not dislike studying physics, you know, like I know some great physicists who, who are great in whatever they do. And I think it's, I think it's a similar discipline of abstract thought. Like I can't think of anything worse than studying business.

Speaker 4:          00:22:05       It just seems like a terrible thing to study to me. Is that because it's like the surface of the waves in the ocean topically, it's just so nontransferable in a sense. And then as you go lower and lower to the, it's going to slower moving layers. That's just more multidisciplinary in terms of studying, like the basics of how things work or how people think. Yeah, I think it's, it's almost like it's how to do something or how to manage something, but not why to do it. Right. And, and so if, if you're taught in 1992, if I went and got an Mba, I would have been taught a certain kind of management that six years later with the Internet would have gotten blown up. And so for me, it's like, I always ask the why question, you know, um, when were, you know, you were mentioning like the book publishing or, or a bar, like, you know, I just looked at some things and just go like, why is that?

Speaker 4:          00:23:02       Why is it work that way? Um, and oftentimes the people most entrenched in the system have no idea why they like the third or fourth generation of person within that system. And they have no idea why a school bell rings in the morning, for example, or why a bartender is washing the dishes. Um, and often I don't know the real answer. Um, but I come up with alternative ones, at least that student find narrative, I guess undervalued skill, by the way, in some cases, right. You gotta be careful, but, uh, very, uh, uh, very, very, very, very, very interesting. I, I, I want to pause. You're partially because I'm over caffeinated and it was inspired by my nostalgia related

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       to your double expressors up. But why did the professor pull you aside? What did that early undergrad professor in logic one o one c in you, whether he explained it or not later, I don't know, that led him to take a special interest in you.

Speaker 4:          00:24:04       Well, I, you know, I think, I think I was prepared in earnest because I was mostly terrified. Um, you know, he had a reputation of being kind of like a, um, you know, he is a Socratic method teacher. He was pretty harsh. Um, Colgate was very small classes and there was a class of 80 people and he kind of wanted to widdle it down to a more manageable number. And his method to do that was just to kick your ass. And I, I remember, I mean he probably as great as he was, he, I doubt he would survive starting out at a college campus now. I mean, I've literally, I literally saw him like fire to someone's notebook once when he was asking people like examples of how to put out a fire. And this one guy was just stuttering cause he was so unfair.

Speaker 4:          00:24:51       And so you just lose notebook on fire and you stamped it. And the kid threw it on the ground stamp down. He's like, you could smother it. And he called everyone, he memorized every person's last name. And it was Mr and Ms. And um, I remember the specific day, um, he was literally at, you know, back to the, there's like right out of a movie. He is back to the class writing on a chalkboard, you know, some, some logic problems, symbolic logic. And um, the guy next to me, um, uh, had no shot at getting it right and done, done right. And so he, he said his name and um, and I wrote on the paper on my desk so he could see it, like what, what the answer was. And then without missing a beat or turning around, he was like, Mister conus, please do not help him.

Speaker 4:          00:25:37       There's no way in hell he could possibly have done that without your help. And, and this is like two or three weeks in. Right. And he spun around and he saw that I didn't have my book and he said, Mr Dakota's, where's your book? And I said, it's at my, it's in my dorm room, you know, professor. And he said, well, a lot of good, it's doing you there. I said, on the contrary, it must apparently be doing me a lot of good there. And he said, I'll see you after class. So I thought I was getting kicked out and there was like a line forming to create office hours or like asked to be transferred out or whatever. And when I got to the front, he said, follow me. And I followed him to his office and I swear, I mean he's, you know, running through the fall, New England fall. And I thought I was going to get kicked out of the class and when I closed the door I turned around, he has for you up on the desk. And he said, where are you from? What do you want to do here? And that was it. He took me under his wing. I was very fortunate. I, um, and you know, it's like I never knew. Here's the amazing part. I never knew the guy liked me until 10 years after I graduated and then I was treated like a member of his and his funeral

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       30 years later. Huh. Right. So really fascinating. A person really fascinating, uh, you know, uh, a moment in my life where, um, I don't know, someone saw something in me and kind of went like, I'm going to make an investment in this person and never asked for anything back, you know, ever. How did you not know that he liked you? Did he withhold in some ways so that you wouldn't get a big head or something along those lines? I did he not want to get too overly attached to you so he wouldn't express it? No, I, I think I was 19 years old and I didn't know that the people you like, you hold to a higher standard probably. Right. Um, and so consequently, uh, you know, I like, it was really like, he beat the shit out of me in a good way. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:27:29       He, it's like if you have someone who's teaching you something and they invest their time in you and they think you have a chance of being good, they work you harder than the folks around you. So the people that I thought he liked, he was just being nice too because they didn't, he didn't think they had a chance, you know? Yeah. He didn't care. It wasn't invested. Yeah. And, and so with, with me, I think it would be like, he wouldn't be talking to my English professor without me even knowing and being like, you know, that paper sucks. He can do a lot better than that. Give them a c on that one. And it was just like, I was like, what's going on? Like all of a sudden that class got hard. I didn't know. I had no idea. Um, and uh, it was just, it was an interesting, uh, lucky, fortunate place to be at that time.

Speaker 5:          00:28:15       So we're going to get back to the mark. But before we do philosophy, I'm endlessly fascinated by philosophy, but I'm also a nerd and kind of academic and pedantic and have spent a lot of time in school for people who are listening to this who are say already in their careers or maybe they're in their early twenties thinking of starting a company but are entrepreneurially either involved or inclined, would you suggest if they don't have any exposure to philosophy that they read any particular books or resources or explore it in any way? Or would you say actually, you know what, that was an intermediate step to something else. You would probably be better off studying x, Y and Z. Is there like a starter kit or something you would recommend to folks who don't have the philosophy exposure?

Speaker 5:          00:29:03       You know, I think part of it is if you read a book in isolation, um, it's not as rich of an experience as discussing those ideas within that context. That said, if it's, if you're the kind of person that loves to read and explore ideas, I mean there's hardly a better place. It's a matter of finding what you enjoy. Um, you know, I happen to love, um, the problems of philosophy, which Bertrand Russel wrote, um, sort of about Victor's dines ideas, but before Vichtenstein published, um, and it's, it's written in plain language. It's not hard to understand. Um, certainly need

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       Jay is more like philosophy with some weird sugar coating of something on top of it. Um, and man, like as a young male, you know, reading Nietzsche, that for the first time, I was like, fuck yeah. You know, like, like, it's not like it's that passive, like I think people think of philosophers as like Zen monks sitting there quietly contemplating the universe. Um, I think what it is, is it's people grappling with all of the same questions and curiosity that, that we all have. If you pause to think about it. And so there, it's, it's so big, you know, um, that it's, it's not just, you know, Descartes, I think therefore I am, it's, it's, it's kind of every little bit of that, um, back to like, you know, read Luke reaches like he had the atomic. Could you spell that? I'm going to do this first one to admit that increase.

Speaker 4:          00:30:34       Yes. Yeah. I mean, you know, he, Luc, R, I t I. U s yeah, I'm a terrible speller, so never asked me to it. We'll put it in the show notes. Right, right. But like, you know, it's like you read, read that or read this great book called the swerve, which you know, is, is uh, you know about this, this monk ages ago. Um, that, that sort of found that book and then rewrote it and saved it for history. Like that reads like a murder mystery. Like you don't necessarily need to start with the philosophy. You can start with the things around it. Um, but I, you know, it's like I continue to find sort of the world of ideas endlessly inspirational and, and then by the way, you know, steal them and use them in whatever you're doing like that. They're there for you.

Speaker 2:          00:31:22       The Cretia, Luc, r e t, I, U s Titus Lucretius Charisse was a Roman poet and philosopher. We'll put that in the show notes. The, I want to second Bertrand Russell. Also, I haven't read Bertrand Russell and so many ages, but it is very digestible. It is not dressed up in $10 words when 10 cent words would suffice. Uh, a lot of his writing is, is really powerful. And I also just wanted to mention for folks that, and I just thought about this ages and ages ago, I felt like I had certain gaps in my education, uh, after college and I ended up, I don't know why this didn't occur to me earlier, but somebody mentioned that Stanford, UC Berkeley, these top tier universities all had extended or adult education classes taught by professors in junior professors. I mean these, this is the same team who's teaching and uh, those are very readily accessible.

Speaker 4:          00:32:31       Well and even MIT open courseware, like so many colleges now have taken that model and put great, great classes online. Um, and I know that every now and then I'm surprised what I, what I find on there and get sucked into like an all nighter of, of taking some college class, you know, that I know nothing about. And it's so far over my head, but it kind of refuels you again to go like, oh, like there are huge gaps where I know nothing. And the older you get, the harder it is to, to start into something new, I find at least, um, because it feels like the mountains too big. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:33:13       I would, I would actually, uh, not, not to pull a nick. Actually on the contrary, on the contrary, sir, my book is doing me a lot of good in my dorm room. I think one of your superpowers is that you ask the fundamental why questions about long standing assumptions or a conventional wisdom in different fields. And the more you have done that, the more obvious it is to you to do it as a starting point, uh, in, in a way. So let's go back to the Merck. Uh, we, we can go in any direction of course, but yeah, you, you get used to step into this lord of the flies slash gladiatorial arena with butchers and phd. He is and so on. Then what like at what point is there a point when you're like, okay, I actually do think I could be good at this?

Speaker 4:          00:34:13       No, I for real, no, I was down there and I, I had made a fatal error of leaving school and everyone told me it was a fatal error and um, this is leading the little school. Yeah. And, and I, I, I remember being down there and you know, what I was doing was so brainless. It was literally you take this piece of paper over to that guy and then that guy would yell at you and you'd rip the paper out of your hand and then you go get another one. It was literally that dead and I was desperately looking to learn what was going on around me. Um, and of course I bought books on finance and commodities and options and all that and they were completely ridiculous and opaque and academic that it looked like they had no relationship to what was going on there at all.

Speaker 4:          00:35:04       Um, I started taking classes that were run at the merch on mock trading and just learning the hand signals and things like that, which were fine but didn't really teach you how to trade. And I spent time interviewing with big companies like Goldman Sachs and society in general and whatnot because I did have the academic background where I would get the interview, I would be able to take the test, I would do well in their math and psychology tests. I would get offered a job as a trader. Uh, and then I would look at the contract. This is a key thing people get out of college to get offered a job. I think I'm the only one who ever read the employment contract. And what it said in there was basically like they can do anything they want with me for three years. Like I don't even necessarily need to be a trader like I, that's why I was interested in doing, but they could, they could ship me to France and have me do something totally different.

Speaker 4:          00:35:55       I can be an analyst or you know, God knows what. And so when I would question that, there'd be like, man, you should be really happy. Like, we had 300 applicants for this and we offered eight positions, like just take it. And I was kind of like totally your style, kind of like, you know, I, I grew up, you know, like, I'd be remiss not to say that like my dad modeled, um, my dad was an entrepreneur by necessity because his dad died when he was really young. He fought both at the end of World War II. He was drafted into the navy at the end of World War Two, was dismissed honorably after 16, 18 months because they were downsizing the navy. And then he was barely young enough to be drafted into the army for the Korean War. And when he got out, like, you know, he had no usable skills.

Speaker 4:          00:36:42       So he went to work at the grocery store that he started working at when he was 12 years old, save the ball of his money from the army and the navy and bought the store. And so as I was growing up, uh, you know, my hero was my dad who was not an academic, who was not, um, what people would think of as like an executive and a suit or whatever, but did really well. Um, you know, he had, uh, uh, bought property in real estate. He, he owned a temporary labor office that's applied on skilled laborers to factory and conventions and whatnot. Um, that was a really good business, you know, and he had a lot of common sense smarts. Um, he was horrified that I didn't go to law school, you know, but meanwhile I was modeling what he did. And so when I got down there, I was like, you got to own, you have to own your own situation, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:37:33       Um, and so when I was offered those jobs, I was like, well, I don't really see myself working for someone else, you know? And I found a guy who also felt that way and he was working for a big company and they didn't want to make him a trader because he was too much of a quant. Like he was really well educated. He was really mathematical. He wanted to prove them wrong. So he took a small amount of money and started trading currency options. And when I found him, I instantly knew that this was the right person because I talked to dozens of people and no one was like him. And then he said he didn't want to hire me. Like, do you want to hire anyone? How did you meet him? Do you remember how you guys, I was just introduced to him through, he was back then, they were, you know, it's, if you're a trader, um, or even a trading company, you have a clearing firm like Goldman Sachs.

Speaker 4:          00:38:25       Um, at the time there was a company called first options, um, and he cleared first options and back then you literally have to take the elevator up to keep punching in all of the cards into like a computer that was, you know, up on 17 floors away. Um, you know, wow. Ancient Times. And uh, I met him through, uh, being introduced to him there. Uh, after talking to him, I knew he was a sort of Geeky intellectual that I, that I needed. Um, and then when he told me that he didn't want to hire me cause he just heard some clerk, I was like, no, no, no, no, no, like I will pay you to work for you. And he was, he was like, this is really strange, you know. And I explained to him, like I said, it's like I look up video six months, I set a goal for myself of, of getting, you know, becoming like getting on a badge.

Speaker 4:          00:39:11       It was called like leasing a seat and actually trading within a year. And I was like, I need to get going on this. Like I need someone that's going to teach me options. And um, it's fascinating because, you know, he, he then hired me for, I mean, I want to say it was $400 a week or something like that. And, uh, you know, I stood right next to him all day, every day and he taught me options, theory from scratch, better than any college ever could. Um, to the point where you're looking, you know, three derivatives in, um, you know, the such as volatility curve but the curve of the curve and, um, you know, as soon as I started grasping this and going deeper, deeper down that rabbit hole, the more, the more I liked it as, as a puzzle. It wasn't certainly the money had an appeal, but it was also, hey, here's this, this giant competition.

Speaker 4:          00:40:04       It's like paying a huge multifaceted chess game that no one's going to get. Exactly right. But like I said earlier, it's about making hundreds of decisions a day. And even when you get 10 in a row that come up, tails, you know, that the next one's 50, 50, you know, and uh, that discipline was interesting. That was more about teaching yourself the psychology of standing there while everyone told you you were wrong or you were like physically small or you are too educated or too serious. I mean, you can't imagine how much of a fraternity house that place was. I everything in Wolf of Wall Street, I've seen, I haven't lived, but I've seen it all. Yeah. And, um, you know, I started hiring very shortly after I started trading. And about a year later I left and started my own company with almost nothing. And I hired my first employee who became my business partner for the last 25 years.

Speaker 4:          00:41:07       And I taught him what I, what I learned and I hired people that I considered corporate refugees, um, people who worked for companies and decided that independence was better. Why did you leave after a year? Um, you know, he, he was moving over to the Chicago Board of trade and I had found a couple of awesome programmers, um, to help build this options analysis software. And he sort of offered me up, um, to run like some of the operations at the Mercantile Exchange when he went over to trade the bonds at the board of trade. And, you know, I mean, he was really, really smart guy and he, he made me a deal that when you analyzed it very carefully, you got worse over time. And I just kind of went, you know, I like, it's been great and I've learned a ton and we've made each other a bunch of money and it's a win win.

Speaker 4:          00:42:04       But I really wanted to do my own thing. Like I want it to be the captain of my own ship I guess. And uh, thankfully this Guy Jim Hansen who is still one of my dearest friends, um, sort of had an option to, to stay with that company or come at it completely underfunded company. I mean, thinking back, it was so stupid, you know, um, from a risk perspective. But um, it was asymmetric, you know, I'm far more upside than downside and uh, it worked out really well and we spent most of our time as we hired people and taught them how to do this. It was mostly like psychology training. It was mostly standing around after hours and saying what's seven times 28 and screaming at each other like a drill sergeant until the person couldn't remember what nine times three was anymore. And wait, why didn't you do that while you had to be quick?

Speaker 4:          00:43:02       You have to be quick on basic mental agility. If you bought 450 contracts and it was a 20 delta, you needed to be able to do what's 20% of four 50. It's 90, but you need to do that precisely with numbers that are not so round. Right. Uh, you need to be willing to not be perfect and you need to make that decision instantaneously and realizing that it could cost you 50 to a hundred thousand dollars if you get it right or wrong and you, and you have to be really, really comfortable with that. Um, and so what did we do while we stood around and we'd be, we turned people's brains into mush until like, literally I've had people punch me, cry, run out. It was, um, it was, no, I mean, it sounds awful, but it was, it's amazing training because the rest of the world moves much slower. So any other decisions that I've made in business since then, um, have felt glacial in pace. Yeah. Um, and also

Speaker 2:          00:43:59       something to be said for making the trainer the training in some or all respects harder than the competition. Right? I mean, the adage of the more you sweat during peace time, the less you bleed during war time. I mean, the, the best competitors I've met in many, many fields often strive to make their training and the toil of their preparation harder than what they expect to face when they actually, that's why we love watching big time sports. Like when it, when it matters,

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       there are certain people that you know, are, are, you can almost look at them and go, ah, at port that port person's gonna fade and then you, you hope they don't. Right. You hope all that training, you know, pays off. Um, when you see someone, I love golf for all the same reasons. It's like, you know, just a, a series of constant failures. And then, so, um, when you look at someone who, who can pull that rabbit out of the hat, you know, at the exactly the right moment, um, it's, it's pretty, pretty wonderful to see. And, and I, the thing I loved about my time down there, even though I burned out of it after 10 years, is that I, uh, there were moments where I did absolutely, I mean, I have friends, they'll listen to this and they'll be like, oh yeah, I remember that time, the Sop, but you really get this right.

Speaker 5:          00:45:18       And, um, but I, I made some completely stupid decisions. Um, but, but mostly on the measure, um, when things got crazy, I was able to perform more than not. I remember like Greenspan's irrational exuberance speech was like a formative moment where I kind of went like, wow, I can actually, I can not only hang in this environment, I can thrive in it. And, you know, you get home soaking wet with sweat. It was a physical job like as a people, it was really blue collar and a lot of ways and um, you know, it's like I got home that day and I was like, that was, that was what I prep my last six years for. It was very satisfying. It sounds like an awful, it is an awful thing in a way. Right. Like, it's, it's just about pure commerce. Um, it, it, it serves a purpose of price discovery and all of that.

Speaker 5:          00:46:10       But any individual person isn't really the one doing that, you know? So I think that there are negatives to the whole system as well in hindsight. But man, at the time it just felt like great mental training. What would you recommend to people who are listening and are having this flashback to the introductory text exchange about beating the market over a long period of time who are hoping to become better investors? And you can take that anywhere you want, but are there any particular tools through mental models? Anything that you would recommend? Really, really hard. Um, I think the mental model is asymmetric risk. I always look for something that the, the upside is, you know, three to four x the downside. Um, obviously quantifying those is very difficult. Um, but that's, that's the key. Everything I tried to do is asymmetric. Um, and then even though I'm Nesson Taleb is a bit of a pen Dantic goofball on Twitter, um, his book fooled by randomness is awesome.

Speaker 5:          00:47:13       Yeah. That was the one that proceeded Black Swan. And, um, I think black swans great. It's fine. But, um, fooled by randomness is, is I think the better of all his books because it, it just, man, it just encapsulates everything that people price things incorrectly. It's have to casino. Yeah. Yeah. You Walk through a casino and you see everybody pricing their outcomes and correctly the entire city is built on that. And um, you know, if you could get in your head, literally, literally, yeah. Literally. And I don't take any pleasure. Like people are like, oh, you must do, you must love gambling or whatever. And it's like I would never sit down to a blackjack table because I know that, you know, there's a 49 and a half percent chance that I'm going to win and that's the wrong way. Yeah. Yeah. The fuller randomness is, uh, has come up a number of times.

Speaker 5:          00:48:04       I haven't read it in ages because it is one of his earlier books, but, uh, you know, Howard marks also brought this up recently when I was chatting with him and, uh, it is an exceptional book. I think for developing a new lens on life, not just investing when you are investing for yourself now, how do you think about, how do you think about risk, because this is a word that has popped up a few times, uh, but a lot of, uh, how do you proceed? How do you personally think about risk in your life? Do you, for instance, like some startup founders look at the risk as the various early stage startups, restaurants, bars, and so on that you're involved with and then you play it safe in your other kind of asset allocation. How do you think about risk in, in your life or in investing?

Speaker 5:          00:49:00       Yeah, it's pretty difficult question. Yeah, I think that, um, if you look at everything that I've done business wise, everybody would say that the failure rate is super high in what we do. So trading these to say one out of a hundred people that goes down there at breaks, even their first year and fewer out of, out of that one take another hundred of those ones and less than one in a hundred of those becomes a millionaire. And I went, great. It's like the old Jim Carrey. So you're saying there's chance, you know? Right. You know, and, and uh, and then you go to, uh, to the restaurant business and people, oh yeah. 95% of all the restaurants go out of business and their first two years, and I'm like, going great. You know, that's, that's perfect. Um, why do you, why do you have that response? Is it because then I'm going to start, I'm doing a software startup now. Go for it. So the higher the smaller the hoop, um, the more interesting it is to figure it out. Um, and once you're up there and you know how to jump up through that little hoop, um, there's, there's fewer people playing that game, you know? And, and the other thing is, I remember right when I was going to start building Alinea with, with grant, I was talking to a restaurant owner.

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       And by all accounts he was pretty successful. He had four or five restaurants, and one of them I really liked a lot. And we'd go there a lot and I kinda got to know him a little bit. And he said, so you know, what are you up to? And I said, well actually I'm building a restaurant now. And he looked at me, said, ah, it's a terrible business. You don't want to do it, like incredible failure rate. Terrible. And I was like, why did you build the next four? What did you, how did you respond to that? You know, no one does. That's kind of like, you know, we'll get to it, I'm sure. But that's like the way I was with the publishing thing. It's like, it's like, hey man, people keep printing books and yet I can't figure out any of the information.

Speaker 4:          00:51:07       And yet they're going to give me like three or $400,000 to write a book. Like somethings remiss here. Like, you know what I mean? I've never written a book before, but yet someone's going to pay me $400,000 check is there must be a lot of money on the other side of that bet. And, um, and so consequently you, like I always try to look for the high small hoops and then I spend my time learning as much as I can and then I jump through that hoop. It's both more interesting I think. And I also think getting back to the asymmetry of risk, um, those are the ones that, you know, yeah, you might have a, you know, well first of all, do you really have a 95% failure rate if you put in all that effort? Yeah, I don't think so. You know? Um, and second of all, you know, so I think they priced it wrong so to speak. Um, and then second of all, like, man, that's, that's where the fun is. Like that gets you up in the morning and going to work.

Speaker 2:          00:52:00       Yeah. Yeah. This is, this is where, uh, in among many, many other places, averages can be very, very misleading. Right. And, uh, I always end up in public Q and A's and things of this type, hearing various numbers and stats thrown around, many of which I think have no basis on any data whatsoever. But there's the, we only use 10% of our brands, not true. There is the nine out of 10 startups fail within the first year or whatever the stat is stat is. And the first question that occurs to me with a number like the, uh, the ladder or I guess a ratio is, well, is it because the model is difficult? Is it because startups are inherently that high risk or is it, is, are there other plausible explanations? Is it that nine out of 10 people who attempt to start a startup don't do any of the necessary due diligence? Correct.

Speaker 4:          00:53:03       Yeah. I mean the number of the number of, I, you know, I've been on a couple of, uh, like graduate school, you know, entrepreneurship, um, like you know, contests and whatnot. And one of the things that always happens there is what I call, like the time machine. Someone comes up with a business plan that is like, you know, you know, I'm going to build a time machine. Now of course it's not really a time machine, but I have seen ones at defy, the laws of physics for example. Um, or, you know, new pipeline technology, but they have no idea. Like it's just a pipe dream. They've done none of the engineering, you know. Um, so you, you kind of look at that and you go, you know, you haven't really done the homework yet at all. Um, and then there's a lot of people that come to me and they've spent like six months doing their logo and the name of the company, but they don't actually have a piece of software yet. Right. I'm just going to hire someone to build that for me or I'm an APP. Uh, y'all get so many apps pitch to me and you know, they don't know how to build an APP, but they've got a logo in an idea. And I was like, that's a good way to blow a half million dollars in a consultant.

Speaker 2:          00:54:12       Oh Man, I, we're going to get all that. You must get that 50 times worse than I. Uh, I need to, what I tend to get, and this is part of the reason why I stopped all the startup stuff, uh, a couple of years ago, is it got to the point where 90% of the pitches I received, which were unsolicited would be along the lines of, uh, hi comma, like not even a first name or it'd be like, Hi Tim, or hate him even better. Uh, I am the CEO or cofounder of X. Uh, we are raising this at this valuation. We are oversubscribed, but we could squeeze you in and for 25 k if you're really interested because we admire of ABC, uh, here, the docs attached, let us know if your interest in the next 60 minutes, which I ended up my default response to anything like that where people are pressuring me for a fast decision is no.

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       Like, it's just a, it's like I've, I've lost very little money saying no to those things. Um, but the, the goal coming back to the, the examples that you were giving and what we were talking about, uh, bridging over to restaurants and food. Um, so you're, you're being told how restaurants are an awful business. Food is an awful business. And I remember someone told me long, long time ago, they were like, Yep, if you want to lose money, go into magazines or restaurants. Right. And at what point, and I have a little bit of the backstory, but not all the details, like at what point do you decide to go into or get involved with restaurants and why?

Speaker 4:          00:55:51       Well, so I, I left trading in about 2002, um, 2001, uh, knew it was a tough year between nine 11, which was my father had died in February of that year. Um, I was burnt out after, you know, going really hard for so long and um, you know, we'd built up a pretty good size company too. And I merged with a firm in New York and I just, I kind of needed a break but didn't know how to, how to really take one at the time. Um, and so I left, I left trading and I immediately kind panicked because here's

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       something that I, I really genuinely enjoyed but didn't, didn't kind of know what I wanted to do next and started doing consulting for a small hedge fund and, and then, you know, I just didn't know what to do. And I, I had, you know, an awesome wife and a young son and things were good, you know, but I was kind of panicked. I was, I was playing golf with like, you know, ex athletes because who else is 34 years old and complete golf on a Wednesday afternoon. Um, and so it was just a weird thing and I kind of looked at them and I'm like, oh, they don't really seem all that happy, even though they're, they've got this lifestyle. And so, um, I met grant Achatz, um, the chef, uh, at dwell dining, a trio, um, went to a lunch there one afternoon that some friends set up and it was a transformative experience.

Speaker 5:          00:57:17       It was artistic, it was intellectual, it was thought provoking. Most of all, it was emotional and those are all things that I would never have associated with eating at dinner. Right. Um, and so from, from a perspective of like great art experiences, like seeing a great movie or a great play or going to an amazing museum opening, um, we kept getting drawing back there, like we kept going back and we would go back so frequently that it was absurd because, you know, as a big meal and it wasn't cheap. And every time we'd go somewhere else, we'd go like, wow, why are, why is no one else thinking this way? And as I got to know grants a little bit, I think like sometimes people bring, um, you know, the chefs and wine or beer or whatever, and it's like, that's kind of sand to the beach.

Speaker 5:          00:58:04       You know, I would, I would bring him books and I didn't figure he had a lot of time to read. So I would put like a post it note on a page of an old book. So I remember I brought him this book called the peregrinations of an epicure. Hold on. It's like the peregrinations, like a Peregrine Falcon. I don't even know what that paragraph nation is like a wondering about. Uh, okay. So it was written just after World War Two, um, by an ex servicemen. Um, and he, he kind of goes around, um, you know, Paris, I want to say maybe late forties, early fifties. I can't recall exactly. And, uh, there was, um, a chapter in there, unloved pair Meade, uh, which was a very classical restaurant, kind of the best in the world at the time. And he described to me a meal there in emotional terms that resonated with what grant was doing, even though his technique, his cuisine, everything was completely different.

Speaker 5:          00:58:57       And so I literally just highlight like a couple lines in there and give him this book, which was out of print at the time. And, um, we kind of developed this email relationship back and forth where he would sort of try out some new food down us. And, um, I would give, you know, direct, honest feedback, but not like, oh, it was delicious. It was more or less, it was more like the, you know, like you're going for a provocation there, but if you, you know, and we would go back and forth and he wrote a, at the time on a, on a forum called Eagle it. Uh, and I went down there and his spelling and grammar, not with standing. I mean it was like reading someone who's just really thinking hard about what they were doing. Everything we just talked about here was this young 28 year old chef from Michigan who looked like captain America who would come out, not, you know, he was like how you would in the sense of like, he was good looking and very driven, very clean cut, but he didn't look like, you know, the stereotype central casting of a chef.

Speaker 5:          00:59:59       Right. You know, Chubby, gregarious guy. He was really quiet and introspective, shy. But then you read and you know these which are still up, you know, I, you can still Google it and you'd go like, you know, he'd go on for like four pages about bread service. Like what's the point of bread? You know, and this is the kind that I could wrap my head around. And so, um, I remember on January 20th, 2004, uh, it's my wife's birthday and she said, yeah, I want to go back there. And we'd never been in the kitchen before and they have a table there, but we never eaten in there. And, um, I remember I emailed him and said, she's ethnically Latvian, speaks Japanese and loves Thai food. Good fucking luck.

Speaker 5:          01:00:43       And I knew exactly what that would do to them that would put into 10 days of pure hell because he human research Latvian food, he would have to read, like he would redo a whole menu, 20 courses. Right. And I didn't know they were going to put us in the kitchen. And, um, they put us in the kitchen. I mean, it sounds like a jerky thing to do now, but we did have a relationship a little bit at the time and he served us like the most amazing meal of my life, you know. Um, and it started out with Latvians sorrel soup with braised ham hocks, and, you know, it had flavors of the sea, which was a Japanese dish. It had, it had Thai dishes, it, but it was all in his style. And so it was his own, and yet it had elements of all these things.

Speaker 5:          01:01:30       And at the end of that meal, um, he said to me, you know, well, what do you think? And I'd watched the kitchen and it was like a watchmaker shop. It was not screaming and yelling. It is, it is just as it is. So unlike anything that the vast majority of people listening to this would possibly expect, right. Ramsay Gordon Ramsay, right? Yeah. It is just complete silence. It is like a watchmaking factory. It is. Uh, it is really something else. Anyway, I started to jump in. Yeah, no, no, no. It's, it's, that's, that's totally fine. And so at the end I said, you know, I doubt anybody anywhere in the world had a better meal tonight. And he was like, well, well, thank you. And I said, what are you planning on doing with yourself? You know, I mean, I was like kind of, I had a lot of wine and I kind of looked at him, you know, he down with us and I said, what do you, what are you going to do?

Speaker 5:          01:02:22       And he goes, well, what do you mean? I said, well, you're not going to be here forever. And he said, well, I want to build my own restaurant. I said, I'd be, I'd be happy to help you do that. And he said, well, what kind of restaurant do you want to build? I said, I don't know. I've never built a restaurant before. That was it. And then like a week later I got an email with his business plan and I invited him by my house in a year to the day later of that. That was May 4th. Um, you know, I, we went back and forth on email on May 4th, we held a dinner at my house for potential investors. And on May 4th, 2005, we opened Alinea is nuts in terms of each other that, can you put that in perspective for people? I actually did not realize that was the, the timeframe. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:03:07       I mean, can you just in the context of like normal restaurant world, we argued like, so we didn't really know each other very well, but he would come by my house and he, and he didn't let, let me, let me, let me interject for a second because you've, you've said we didn't know each other very well. What did you know about each other nonetheless that gave you guys the, like the push, like the impulse and the, the sufficient level of trust slash excitement to actually pursue it. Right. There had to be something there. It couldn't just be nothing. So what was it, you didn't know each other? Well, I mean, you maybe you didn't know the full scope of each other's back thoughts. Yeah, I mean, I actually studied that like, that I actually knew I knew the facts, you know, um, and I knew what he was putting in front of me. Um, but I didn't know him, you know, like the way you know someone that you're going to become a business partner with. Um, and I think he just thought I was rich.

Speaker 5:          01:04:08       I'd be curious like I think everyone else wanted this is, this is really true cause he has said this to me. Um, everyone else wanted to offer him a, a restaurant that they had already built or wanted to build. And I actually answered that question correctly. The, I don't know is an awesome thing to say, like 90% of the time for your life. Right. And so when he said, what can a restaurant do you want to build? I could have waxed on about some dream I had or just made some bullshit up at the time. But I just said like, I have no idea. Like we, that's a big question. We need to sort that out. Um, and I think that was the right answer for him. I think that's all he needed to know. It was like, okay, the guy's got an open mind.

Speaker 5:          01:04:51       He seems to have done well in business. He knows like, you know, apparently how to build something. Well, it was really funny is that the stuff that I was concerned about, which was like architecture, design, plumbing, you know, building, lease, all of that. He was like, the word oblivious is not too strong of a word. Um, like, you know, this is not a criticism of him either, right? It's just like he came to my house and he was just like, yeah, I, you know, I want Martin to design everything. And Martin Kastner, who is a genius designer, has crucial detail, which we've been involved with for 15 years now. Um, he's a, like a designer. He's like, uh, uh, an artisan, like he built plateware and he wanted the book who's to, or for the platter he designed for Thomas Keller, Daniel Boulud's team for the team USA and all that.

Speaker 5:          01:05:37       Now, but back then, like, I mean, this guy's not gonna design plumbing or electrical. So I would just look at them going like, well, no, he can't. We need an architect and you need to get, you know, like city stamps and all that and all that. So, um, I think grant was just like, yeah, you find a place, you put tables in it and you know, build a kitchen and you go, um, you know, in terms of like, obviously he knew that her health inspectors and all that, but the process of all this just about, you know, you either were going to not build it ever eight weeks in because we would have hated each other where we really kind of people that figured everything out and we just talked it out like right down to like, what kind of tables, what kind of glass where, what kind of this like, you know, we wanted to rethink the why again if everything, like why do you put a candle on the table?

Speaker 5:          01:06:24       Why is it candle romantic? Like that's a question we asked. Why do we need candles? That's kind of like, why is that romantic? Why is, um, why do people put a little bud vase on the table? Why shouldn't that be an edible thing? That'd be cool. So, so we did all of that and we designed the experience to create emotional responses from the moment that you walked in the front door. So we didn't have the podium. Um, you know, we went, what is a good greeting feel like not just, you know, if you're at someone's house, what does that feel like if you're at a restaurant, what shouldn't it feel like? Well, it shouldn't feel like a computer in front of your face saying, what's your name? You know, and all that. So we, we went through every aspect of that and no, I lost almost 20 pounds that year.

Speaker 5:          01:07:09       Not in a healthy way. Um, just like, gee, seeing the construction, I laid tile in the basement like three days before we open. Let me, let me pause for one second. So the why question that comes to mind for me is after the finance, after battling it out on the front lines and going through 2001, why this as your next thing? Like, why, why was this the thing that captured your imagination as you had to know on some level once you started getting into the details? Like, fuck, I mean, this is going to be, yeah, it's all in. This has to be a big, this is going to be all my chips and energetically. So why, why this, you know, there, there are occasional times when you wake up in the morning and like, that thought comes back to you that, that like, hey, um, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm really sucked into this.

Speaker 5:          01:08:05       Right. You know, and for about three or four months without telling anybody, even like, even not telling her, like, telling no one, I kept going like, I should build a restaurant with this guy. Like it would be the best restaurant in the world if it was done all the way. Right. And I recognized my inner voice saying, that's a really dumb idea. You know, and you don't know what you're doing. I'd never worked a day in my life and a restaurant. Right. And, and I also recognized, and this is also critical, I recognized that so many people built their living room after they made some money. So they went like, oh, well I know how to host a good dinner party and I know good wine, so I'm going to build me a restaurant. And then they sit there like it's their living room. And that's not good.

Speaker 5:          01:08:54       Like I didn't want to be that, that DC guy that built the restaurant, um, because my ego was needed to host a party. Um, and so whenever I would kind of lead her on broach that subject and people would say like, well, you know, I can almost hear their brain whispering, well of course that's what he's going to do. And, and, and so that was again, not the best of motivations in the world perhaps, but the honest one that was hugely motivating. Um, eventually, but when we first started, it was this nagging thing. Like I'd wake up in the morning and I would go, you know, I'm not really into what I'm doing right now, and I've just met somebody who's the best in the world. At what they do and no one knows it yet. Like, and, and you know, it was probably met. That's probably happened to be, I'm really fortunate that that's probably happened to be seven or eight times in my life.

Speaker 5:          01:09:47       And when it happens and I meet that person, whoever it may be, no matter what they're doing, I, I, I pause, I kind of acknowledged that directly and then I just go like, you know, can we, can we, you know, grab a glass of wine or coffee or something and like that's something worth marking and going like, wow, this person's really invested in something. And grant had every aspect of being, being that at 28 years old. And, and it, I, you know, I mean in hindsight, like it looks, it looks smart, but I got to tell you, it was years before it felt smart because you mentioned just now that you've met these people seven or eight times, who are the best in the world, uh, or potentially the best thing, most of them among them. But the, the, the, the key point that jumps out for me is in the world, didn't know it yet.

Speaker 5:          01:10:42       So my question for you is that, that sort of brings to the forefront, in my mind, at least the question of what is Nick's seeing or feeling that other people are not. Could you talk to that? And I mean, is there a feeling or a particular type of observation, a particular type of detail that you noticed in these people that allows you to scout the talent where other people might miss it or not pay enough attention to it? Yeah, I mean, I think you've written a couple about, about that. Um, it's, it's, it's definitely intangible. Um, you know, it's, I think it's different in every case. Um, but it's, it's interesting because you can tell when someone is fully committed, I guess to their craft or their art or their business or whatever it is that they're doing their sport. Um, and it's not because they, they talk it about it all the time though.

Speaker 5:          01:11:43       Of course, you know, if you, if you push a little, they're happy to do so. But it's more that like if you look around, like the vast majority of people are not fully committed to whatever, you know, and I think part of what you do is you try to steer people to find those things that, that they can commit to, or you can try to lower a barrier to show them like, hey, the commitment's not as hard as you think in this particular area. Right. Right. But these folks are like, they're all in their 99%, and that's what they do often to the detriment, frankly, of, of other aspects of their lives. Um, and I guess you get better at noticing them, you know? Um, and I mean now, like that's like, boy, I live for that. Like I love meeting people that, um, even if it's not something I'm interested in that are all in, you know, and, and that's, that's an interesting, you know, I really, I've never really thought about it that way, but like, it was this very clear to me that grant was all in.

Speaker 5:          01:12:49       Like, if, here's the thing, if, if he wasn't gonna do it with me, he was still gonna do it. Yeah, I was, I was, uh, I was a helper. I, you know, over time I certainly contributed, um, you know, a great deal to it, not just he contributed a great deal of the business. And then I also contributed to the art, but that took time, you know, but I could tell that he was all in and, and that was fun. I mean, it's fun to work with somebody who is basically like, okay man, if you're not in like get out of the way. Cause I'm still going [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:13:22       and for anyone who has the opportunity, I don't even know if they would have the opportunity, but to watch, observe grant even for 60 seconds. Well, chef's table on Netflix is a great chef's table. Yeah. Perfect. So everybody should have the experience of observing grant working and focusing. It is. I've, I've met a lot of people who are good at focusing, who have abnormal focusing abilities and spending the time that we did together in Chicago and the time that I had to observe grant is, it is a next level of focus. It's, it's really hard to encapsulate and words. So chef's table, fantastic people should check it out. And just the level of focus that is permeates the appearance, the air, the atmosphere. It's really something else. Uh, so to, to to to that point focus, one of the, my favorite aspects of, of speaking with you and having conversations is the question, the questions that you raised, right?

Speaker 2:          01:14:36       Like what candle? Not just should we have candles? Like that's maybe a good question, but it's probably not the right first question. Like why do restaurants use candles in the first place? Furthermore, wire candles consider romantic, right? Like kind of stepping basic basic stuff. Yeah. What are other questions that you asked related to a linea or you, he can certainly bridge to two other, uh, you know, I think it makes sense to, to chat about aviary as well. But what are, what are some other questions that, that you guys asked that, uh, people might, might not think to ask?

Speaker 5:          01:15:11       Yeah, I mean, it, you know, grants at the tone for that. Um, in our first meeting, not really knowing me and we started talking, but we didn't even know where to start. Right? And he said, well, I know one thing, I want to have wooden tables, like I want to have bare wood tables. And I said, why? He said, well, why do tables while your fancy restaurants have white tablecloths? They literally call it a white tablecloth restaurant if it's fancy. Why? And I couldn't really, I came up with dumb answers like, oh, it feels good or it absorbs like a spill or whatever it may be. Um, and he said, no, it's because of the table underneath as a piece of shit.

Speaker 5:          01:15:50       And he's like, he goes, and you know that like, as soon as you say it, everyone goes, oh yeah, I knew that. And you've been at weddings and stuff where you feel under the table and you're like, oh, it's plywood. Right? But if you go to like a really fancy restaurant, you feel under the table, guess what? Also applied with just a little thicker. Um, and he's like, you know, when you rest your arms on the table, even if it doesn't come forefront in your mind, you kind of subconsciously know that they're kind of fooling you. And he's like, why can't we just have like black beautiful tables? It'll show the food grade, they'll show the plate where great. And then I kind of went like, well, yeah, but like, you know, um, the health department doesn't let you put in Chicago, doesn't let you put silverware right on the table.

Speaker 5:          01:16:32       And if you put a glass, they're the kind of sensational form, a little ring, and then you have a wear issue. Um, but you'll save $70,000 a year in laundering linens. And so we started going like, well, how did we solve the water problem? Well, you create a fridge that's just above the duty point 44 degrees in the winter, maybe a little warmer in the summer because it's higher humidity in Chicago and you just get rid of ice. It's, you know, it says, so you have these cascading decisions that like become part of the art of the place that some of them start from like a really practical thing. Like, Hey, we want to have a table. And then all of a sudden you need a little pillow that the silverware goes on because that Martin designed, because you can't put, we didn't want to have place mats that's too cheap.

Speaker 5:          01:17:20       So all of a sudden we had to design like, you know, a silverware holder. So it just became this cascade of like interesting little art projects, um, that were there for good reasons and really created a unique atmosphere. And it was like one of the things, like we never tested it until the day we opened. Like you couldn't test those things. And the very first guy through the door was, um, is now a famous chef, chef Sean Brock of husk plastic. Yeah. So he was, he was not yet a chef then 2005, and he was the first guy through the door and he wrote this giant blog post and eagle it with pictures and everything. You can go see it. And every single thing that we hoped would create an emotional trigger, an emotional reaction, it's almost at all. They're like, I remember going home and seeing that the next day and going, wow, like, that should actually work, you know, and it's like right down to the front hallway that was, you know, a reverse perspective and, you know, stolen from sharp cathedral and, and an inverted, you know, um, so all of my interests of architecture and art and science and all of grants, you know, food and all that, like all came together in like a year long conversation on how to do something.

Speaker 5:          01:18:39       And we really fought with the architect and designers and all of that because people would tell us the practical reasons why you needed to do this or that. And we would just go, nope, no host Dan. Like, you know, we want to greet people in a, in an open way. Um, and so just little things like that. And then we've taken that on, you know, um, through everything that we've, we've done where we took, you know, seven years, six years to, to build our next place because we didn't have that idea that kept us up at night again. Um, and so, you know, when we did, then we did it. And I think, I think editing, editing yourself and each other is in an open way is really, really painful, but really, really important. And coming back to something you mentioned relate to the living room, uh, the, uh, the well off, uh, yes. Who then create saying art project that is not, uh, may be beautiful, but is most often not a viable business. What, how did you apply those questions and rethink the business model to make any of this work financially? Yeah. Well, I mean, you don't want to be a dill town, right? Um, and, and so, you know, my biggest fear is that, um, it would work

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       in an artistic way, but wouldn't work as a business. Uh, and so, you know, the, the, the answer is, at the beginning we didn't, I didn't do much. Um, I handled all of our marketing and PR, like I wrote everything, you know, myself. Um, really thought about open sourcing the, the building of the restaurant. Um, you can still go on line and see that the original business plans and what logos we were considering using and to the test kitchen, which was in my house. You know, we didn't tell anyone at the time, but that was my house at the time and, and see the development of this restaurant. Um, and I felt like the open source movement in that way, it was a good model for what we were trying to, to accomplish. And part of that was people would say like a restaurant, like this can't make money.

Speaker 4:          01:21:02       And you know, I wrote this little spreadsheet that I called the universal restaurant calculator and can people find that online? No, no, no. But it would be very unimpressive. Um, if they could. But it was, it was basically like how many covers per night. I mean this is back of the envelope stuff. How many covers per night can you do? What's the check average for food check every for beverage. What are your food costs, beverage costs, labor costs was insurance costs, you know, your, your lease, your rent, like all those things. Right. Um, and I had enough experience with most of those things to at least give good estimates to it. And so I started doing is I started modeling other restaurants using the universal restaurant calculator. And um, I had, again, this goes to the transparency of data. I had real data for only two restaurants and from those two I would then make assumptions about restaurants like the French laundry where grant used to work.

Speaker 4:          01:21:53       Well, while the greatest restaurants in the history of America, certainly. And you know, I came up with a number that grant went, there's no way the revenues that high or they make that much money, that's impossible. And it was really funny because years later, um, you know, I now work with, with chef Keller, um, and he's, he's a friend all these years later. And I literally pulled that out one day with grant being there and went like, how close am I on this back in 2005? And he's like, oh, you're within like two or 3%. You know? And, and grant was just like, and it's, we're talking about back of the envelope stuff. And so, you know, you asked like, where can people start to start a business? Start on the back of an envelope. Like one of my favorite exercises is to sit in a restaurant or a small business of some sort and just literally do the back of the envelope.

Speaker 4:          01:22:38       That is the kind of calculation my dad called it the two shoe box method. Put me through college, right? Like money coming in and once you bucks money going out and the other, whatever's left is profit, you know, um, you know, start that basic. And, and we did that and I didn't really think about the, we did well, but we didn't make a ton of money. Um, Alinea cost of two point $2 million to build, um, I up a little over a quarter of that myself and found investors for the rest, all of whom I knew. And, um, you know, in the first year we did, you know, we made about 450 to $500,000 on four or $5 million in sales. I'm not a great return, not a terrible return. Um, we then one, you know, best restaurant in America from Gourmet magazine and I was horrified that we won that frankly.

Speaker 4:          01:23:31       Um, I remember Greg called me and said, Yep, I just got a call from Ruth Reichle. And like we had some stated goals of like, how would we know if this is a success? And one of the things we wrote down was Ruth Reichl declares it best restaurant in America. And we wrote that because in 1997, she wrote the most exciting place to eat in America as the French laundry and grant was there and cook that meal and said that the energy of having someone that he respected so much, because Ruth is just a great writer. She's one of the unimpeachable food critics in the history of America. And having her write that in New York Times propelled that restaurant to its permanent status. Um, I think that can't happen nowadays, honestly for other reasons, but this is kind of pre, pre, you know, Internet for Yelp, all that. And then all of a sudden we got that and I was like horrified because, you know, one of the goals was completed so early we would have, we wouldn't have our, like our Lodestar, you know, and so, um, he was like, Dear God, can you let me enjoy it for like a minute

Speaker 6:          01:24:37       to you? Yeah. All right. You know, I was happy, but I was also like, oh no, now what do we do? We need to find another artificial constructs here. Like go after enough of this, I need to find happiness and get this other happiness. I that in head out of my face. So it's about, I really do believe that actually, that it's often the process is so real or

Speaker 4:          01:25:04       wording that when you get something done, it can be a letdown, you know? And, um, I wanted that process to go. And then unfortunately, six months later at grant was diagnosed with stage four cancer and given six months to live. Um, and so weirdly, that was the moment where after he was going through treatment where I started going into the restaurant at night, cause remember I'm not a service professional, I was running the business of the restaurant. Um, I would start going in at night and asking really dumb questions again. And you know, weirdly, um, our goal was to keep Alinea open for when he came back and my do, he only missed like, you know, 12 days, 14 days of service during really intense chemo and radiation and, but he was given six months to live. And you know, when people are in that situation and their livelihood is tied to this restaurant, um,

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       even despite their loyalties, oftentimes they just need to find another job because they were like, hey, in four months, this place is going to be closed. So it was in, in, in the midst of that, we decided to do our first book, really, Dick Chronicle. Um, you know, his, his, you know, what he had accomplished because for him he felt like that'd be his legacy. Um, he thought he was going to die. He was told he was going to die. So in the midst of managing a self created self published book, um, and trying to do that differently and then keeping a dwindling staff motivated, I'm trying to let him know that it would still be there when he got, well, all of that I started going, this place is run in strange ways, man, this industry is, is, is not run right. You know, and I started asking like basic questions, like if we have a waitlist for a hundred people on a, on a Wednesday, why do we do 74 people on a Wednesday but 86 on a Saturday?

Speaker 5:          01:27:07       And the answer was, because our incentives are misaligned, you know, the service industry as a whole can't run it 100% every single day of the week and less they're incentivized to do so. And you could go like, well yeah, but every server there will make an extra hundred bucks a night or whatever. But they're kind of going like, look, if every night was Saturday I'd be dead. It's really hard work, you know? So you need to figure out ways of load balancing that, um, and making every day the same and you end up way ahead. So from a business perspective, um, that's when my sort of self education, uh, in this industry came, came forward and it came forward in a way that I think I was less patient with everything because we were also going through this really difficult emotional time. Um, and so consequently when I didn't get answers that made any sense, instead of being diplomatic about it, I would just be like, well that's stupid, you know, and it was, which cut some of the normal social filter off and I'm sure it wasn't a pleasant time to be around anybody.

Speaker 5:          01:28:12       But I also think it was accepted within that environment at that time because everyone knew what we were going through. And so when we, you know, years, years later when we finally like, we're kind of like, hey, we've got some ideas to build next. And the Aviary, that's when I kind of went like, well, we're going to do things totally differently here. And anyone who's not on board, even though they work for us, like if you're not on board all the way in, like on getting rid of normal reservations on not using telephones on doing all these things, I'm like, you know, you just, we don't have a place for you here. Um, and man, it really worked. You know, that was the basis of, you know, I talked to every software company in the industry asking for their API and is asking to build essentially what's options pricing software on top of reservation and open table told me no.

Speaker 5:          01:29:03       And the pos systems told me no. Um, I called theaters and went like, what ticketing system do you use? [inaudible] and all those told me no. And um, so I heard a single programmer, um, and he and I in six weeks built a really rudimentary booking system, but the first day we turned it on and we sold $562,000 of tickets to a restaurant for the first time. First time ever. Okay. So pause here for a second. No, no, no. This is great. This is great. So a few a few things for folks who are not familiar. Api, APP application programming interface. It's how you can effectively link into someone else's software. Pos point of sale, not piece of shit. And it is a piece of shit. Oh, it may also be a piece of shit. What was, what were the design specs that you were looking for?

Speaker 5:          01:29:48       In other words, before you get to the 500,000 plus gay at the snap of a fingers, like what were you trying to fix or what were you trying to create? So I get a lot of grief for this, for saying this, um, in the industry and in the press, but basically whenever you make a restaurant reservation, one of the two of you talking is lying to each other. If you think about it, nor their industry form of entertainment, uh, which dining out is a form of entertainment. I know it's sustenance. I know there's so much culture embedded in it and all that, but you could eat at home, right? Um, no other form of entertainment. You just call them up and say, Hey, hold a seat to the bears game or the cubs game or the opera and I'll show up around seven 30 and then they tell you, yeah, yeah, we'll have a seat ready for you at seven 30.

Speaker 5:          01:30:43       And then when you get there, they go, oh, you know what, go wait over there for 30 or 40 minutes because we're running a little behind tonight. You know? Um, the reason that they're running behind is because they overbooked because about 15 to 18% of the people just don't show up. So they overbook. They also know that if they tell you that they'll really see you at nine and you wanted an eight 15, you'll just go to the restaurant down the street from them that will lie to them. Right? Right. So, so they, so they do that and ultimately it's just bad all around. It's bad for the restaurant. It's wasteful for food. Um, and it's bad hospitality, like, and that's like, there are so many pop culture references and entire Sitcom, you know, episodes built around someone trying to get into a restaurant. Right. It's absurd. It's completely absurd. And you know, I looked at our no show rate at Alinea datadriven tracked it. I looked at our, what we call short seated tables, like the number of tables that were four people, but only two showed up. And the dirty secret there is like people would go like, well what do you have available a while? I have an eight 30 for four okay, we'll take that. And they never intended to bring the other two people. Well that's just as bad as a to tap Shawn,

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       we only have 74 people in there and so it's a yield manager or 74 seats. So it's a yield management problem. And so we, five to 8% of our revenue every night was was being lost to that transaction. That was a non transaction. Right. And so I wanted to figure out ways to do two things. One, what to figure out ways to make it transactional. Because again, you asked about Professor Thaler, one of the key tenants is as a little bit of skin in the game, right? When people have small vested interest in something and the outcome of something. Or even if I gave you a pencil as a gift and then 30 minutes later I want to take it back, you will get so mad even though you didn't care about that pencil. Right, right. Cause you're like, what was, that dude gave me a gift.

Speaker 4:          01:32:44       Now he's pulling it back and you know, it's like the expected, it's like the expected value of a mug. If you ask them how much they would spend to buy the mug versus giving them the Mug and saying, how much will you accept to sell it? You know the differential. Yes. Huge. So you know, that came to me one day because my, my kids wanted to go see a movie at night that I did not want to go see. And I was really, really like I would have easily paid 50 bucks to not go to this movie. Right? Yeah. And then my wife basically says, Hey, well let's go to that movie. So I go on Fandango, I buy four tickets, 60 bucks, whatever it was, and it like five 30 at night. It's pouring rain and everyone's napping and they're like, yeah, I don't want to go.

Speaker 4:          01:33:26       And I'm like, get your asses in the car. We're going to the movie man, easily paid that $60 to not go to the movie. But once I had the sunk cost of, of paying for the movie, my psychology totally flipped. And I was like, we're going to this movie that I don't want to go to like, and I literally irrationally made everyone go to the movie. Like, which weirdly costs, you know, I mean, from an emotional family standpoint, all bad, all the way around. Right. And um, so I, I thought about it and I was like, wow, what if people, what do people put down a small deposit on times when demand exceeds supply? Like, right. So Saturday night, eight o'clock, great. That's uh, that's the best seats at the Opera House. Let's see if people will prepaid for that or put down 20 bucks for it.

Speaker 4:          01:34:14       That's fully credited at the end of their meal. It's not a cover charge. I'm not trying to squeeze people in the actual cost of the meal. I'm just trying to go like, yeah, let's see if people will make a commitment. And everybody told me, no, no one's going to do that. Like this is not the way it works. But if you look back historically, and this is the interesting part again, it's about like digging in deep on something and if you look back historically, um, restaurant reservations started with the telephone and at the time that we were starting to do this, the telephone was dying. And I didn't know that at the time, you know, it was eight years ago, but I have a computer in my pocket and if you ring me and I don't know your number, I don't want to talk to you, I don't answer it. I'd much rather receive like a little piece

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       of text letting me know what's going on. Then a phone call. Um, similarly like calling a restaurant is an antiquated thing to do at this point. But long before the telephone people got room and board and what room and board was literally, it was like you go to an inn and you, you get a room for the night and then do you need food? Okay, well you got a board of food that was literally it and you'd prepay for it. And so, you know, there was hundreds of years of that long before there was a telephone and people called and said, Yep, like, you know, I'd like to eat at your restaurant. Sure, we'll let you know. And um, and so as the technology for the telephone has morphed into, you know, what we all have in our pockets now, um, I just wanted to update that whole transaction.

Speaker 5:          01:35:47       And so I also wanted to acknowledge that Tuesday nights it should be cheaper than a Saturday night. So it has to work in both ways. I always thought Uber could to fix their, their surge pricing issues by having discounted pricing when there was no demand, like just move pricing in two directions. And if you have pricing in two directions, then like that whole argument goes away. Right. Um, and so, so we did that. We, we, we priced out different prices by day of the week and times a day. So 5:00 PM on Wednesday at Alinea is still cheaper than 8:00 PM on a Saturday by a lot, by 80 to a hundred dollars a person. Wow. Um, and, and you know, what happens, um, and this is now we have, you know, hundreds of restaurants doing this on our software called talk. Um, what happens is people buy the most expensive seats first and the cheapest seats first, which is exactly what you'd expect actually, right?

Speaker 5:          01:36:42       Because there's some people who are price conscious and go like, wow, this is a really expensive meal, but holy cow, I don't really care if I eat at five o'clock on a Tuesday. Great. Like I can save 400 bucks. Um, and then there's some people that go like, I only eat at 8:00 PM on Saturday. Well, okay, that's fine. Pay a little more. Or they're attracted to the fact that it is the most expensive. Sure. That happens too. And then there's, there's a whole bunch of tools. Then over time, we built on top of that to sell wine pairings or sell books. You know, we sell 20 Alinea books a day on checkout with the booking process. That's all ton because we're not going to exit through the gift shop at Alinea. It's a Michelin Three Star restaurant. So we would suddenly have like one book, like near the restrooms that people could peruse, but it didn't say like by the book or anything like that.

Speaker 5:          01:37:27       So typically we'd sell like one or two per night. Um, now on checkout, when you book Alinea, it says, hey, would you like to buy and Alinea book personalized and 20 people a night get it at that has $400,000 in revenue a year. Yeah. That's incredible. Easy. Right? And it's amazing to me that no one did that beforehand because ultimately people can't buy what they don't see and people don't want to be upsold inside of a restaurant. There's nothing worse in my mind then, you know, some places that today's special is today's special and it's real and you, you kind of know that, but sometimes it's just the old fish,

Speaker 6:          01:38:07       right? Uh, Sunday night and we all know these things. And like,

Speaker 5:          01:38:15       I think no restaurant wants to like raise their hand to go, Yep, that's all true. We were aligned to our customers and we're not going to release it you at eight 15. And so I think when I said that, like you can look back through some articles, um, I remember that there's an article, I think it was in Gq that they interviewed like a grizzled veteran, you know, and he didn't use his name and said, you know, um, overbook in a bar to weight and has always worked for me. And I was just like, how does that not sound like terrible hospitality to everyone reading that, you know? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. There's, there's so many systems that have a similar overbooking load balancing issues, right? You'd look at airlines, you look at hospitality. Yep. Eat dentist. Yeah. I have a great dentist. They only do it via phone call or email. And so I have to play a guessing game. It's like going into a clothing store and going like, yeah, I'm looking for a blue v-neck cashmere sweater. Like, Nah, don't have one guest again,

Speaker 6:          01:39:20       put the shit on display man. Like, just tell me what days you could clean my teeth, show me and I'll just go online and hit the button, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:39:30       So when you then debuted the, uh, the, the ticketing option, if I'm, if I'm, if I'm labeling it properly, how did you prime the pump for that? Was there anything, did you need to prime the pump to have this, what seems like certainly a windfall? Yeah, we did a, a, a, a video where, you know, next restaurant was about a restaurant that's always knew essentially like what's, what's one of the big problems of the restaurant industry? Well, when you open a new restaurant, it doesn't matter what it is, people are gonna show up for like five or six months. And then after that, um, you know, you got to struggle to like get regulars and, and you know, like find new audiences and all of that. But people like the new quote unquote. Right. Um, the other problem is, is that our own staff in chefs where the kind of people who I said to grant one time, he cooked this amazing French dish for me.

Speaker 5:          01:40:28       It'll neo right in the middle of his sickness because I had driven down from Michigan, I've never eaten before or after in the Alinea kitchen, but he whipped up this little French dish for me of duck. And I was like, man, let's open a French restaurant some day. And he went like, ah, we'll get bored after six months. And then I was at, um, one of our chefs homes on a day off Tuesday and he made, he loves Thai food and he made this amazing Thai meal. Amazing. And I like, wow, like I had no idea. These guys are so versatile, you know? And then it made sense, hey, these are passionate, amazingly talented people. And it kind of dawned on me like, let's just change the restaurant every four months, you know, let's, let's do, and then we dwelled on that for like a year thinking like it was kind of impossible to do.

Speaker 5:          01:41:12       And then you know, grandson, I said, well let's start with the French menu. And he's like, well what does that mean? Like there's southern France, there's lower valley, there's France, that's the nouvelle cuisine. And then there's friends from like, you know, a hundred years ago. Totally different. And I was like, Yup, Paris 1906 I don't need to explain to you what that is you'd want to eat that. If I just said like if someone said, Hey, new restaurant opening, what's the menu? It's Paris 1906 I'd go like, cool. Like I want to do a little time travel and see what that was like. And so as soon as we had like a city in a time, we instantly knew that was the idea that kept us up at night. You know, where we went, like, wow, look at all these different places we can travel and what does that restaurant look like and how do you create a kitchen versatile enough to make all these different cuisines and how do you make it not feel like Disneyland where one time you have a theme of Paris and next time you have a theme of Japan.

Speaker 5:          01:42:04       So you have to go for like an austere minimalism, you know. And um, is this, what's usually the reason why you chose the year 1906, you know, I'm doing some research. Um, uh, and I may get the exact date wrong cause this is eight years ago I did the research, but I believe the sen flooded in 1908, somewhere around there. Um, and so, um, a scuff ea, um, like the father of French cuisine, um, was at the Ritz then. And that was kind of like the height of that era of cuisine. And then after the sen flooded, that's where you got sort of your bras reason bistros because they had to kind of go to a more casual, it opened up for more people. Took the price point down, it made it more approachable and it wiped out dozens of these fancy restaurants. And so like rent got cheap and all of a sudden like, hey, like we're gonna get this new style of restaurant that's roughly, as I recall it, somebody's going to listen to this and tell me I'm all wrong. But um, that's where we landed because we could do this a scuff ea menu and boy, we argued about that too, like in their blenders then so, so like electric blenders. So I mean we just like, so you wanted to mimic the production? Well, I did. Grant did not so, so, so we, we, we were, I remember we were at a, we invited the press to a practice and it's like, Hey pal, you don't have to make the food. He was like, should we make it intentionally worse than we can?

Speaker 5:          01:43:36       Yeah. I guess the recipes were really vague. They didn't even call for salt. Yeah. So, so in the middle of this press dinner where we had like the New York Times that we had all sorts of these people there, which I will never do again. Right. That was just a genuine error. Like and like, like we were still arguing out conceptually what this thing would be and then we serve dinner and we were like openly, like he'd come out of the kitchen and we would openly argue about it, you know? And this is at the press dinner? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember he brought the soup out and it was like, you know, he was like, I was like, oh they must have used like the actual blenders, right, like modern blenders. Cause it was like the mouth feel is like perfect. Right. And so I was like, oh you, you use the blenders, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:44:25       And he was like, the recipe didn't call for salt either did it, but I should, I have not used that and had it tastes like shit. And then I was like, well maybe you don't know that they didn't have refrigeration then either. And they packed the vegetables insult as a desiccant. And so there were almost all pretty self did by the time they get to Paris. And that was it. Like people were just like, these guys don't like each other. But that was, that was, that's our method. That's what we did, you know. And um, I mean to the day we opened, we had those, those arguments. Um, and then, you know, in terms of the software, like, man, like I didn't sleep for a week. Um, we set it up on Rackspace. It didn't work right. I had never done anything like that before. Um, you know, it was like no one would help, I think.

Speaker 5:          01:45:12       Like, like, you know, nobody would help no one. We, and I say nobody would help. You mean competitors potential. Uh, I don't even know to tell potential. Like, these are people, I got it. Why wouldn't they help? Don't, you know, like in the case of open table, they had a monopoly. So why, what makes sense to me? That makes sense. In terms of everyone else, I think they didn't just didn't get it, but even people within my own company thought this was a fool's errand. You know, like grant for sure. Like he will fully admit this now. I thought it was a terrible idea. Why did he think it was a terrible idea? Because it's not hospitable, it's not hospitality. It's not, it's not, it's not. It's low touch, high touch. Correct. And, and, and hugely the case where, you know, I'll, I'll send the price is different every day.

Speaker 5:          01:46:00       Like are people going to get that? And I just kept looking to other industries and I'm like, no one has a problem with it. When they go to a baseball game then they're not sitting on the, uh, you know, above the dugout. And then like the guy who's in the third deck back row looks down and go, oh, that guy. Like he totally stole that ticket from me. Two different price points, you know? And I just feel like people inherently get that without having to explain it to them. How, if I, if I may. How far in advance of the opening where you were you hoping to launch the software and when did you end up launching the software? Yeah, I launched it about seven hours before the first dinner. Holy Shit. Um, I hope to have done it four to five weeks ahead of that. It was literally one man operation plus me, like one programmer and me. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       when we launched it, um, Rackspace, this is 2010. I'm not saying anything about, about Rackspace. It was, I didn't, I probably set it up. We're on a 2010, um, it did not like it's supposed to auto load correct. And self propagate. And it neither happened. I was expecting we had 17,000 people on our email list that it's signed up on the website to like be notified when when their bookings went on sale. And I was expecting maybe, you know, 700 show up, like it should be fine. And something like eight or 9,000 showed up and everyone just kept hitting the refresh key. And he has another fatal error, um, of stupidity. And this is not the way our software is built now because we have professionals here. But, uh, basically my admin login was on the very same server. Everybody's public access God. So I couldn't even go into configure it, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:47:44       So the good news is that I couldn't answer like hundreds of angry emails all at once. So I created a Facebook group for the business, which in 2010, not very many people did. And so if you go back and screw all the way down to the beginning of that, you'll see me going like, hey, if everyone could please stop refreshing, I can sort this out. And what was really cool is that people felt part of something. Um, they felt like, wow, holy shit, this guy is actually doing this himself. Um, we're part of this experiment. Um, and we're on the inside of it. Um, I got a lot of empathy from the customers even though they were the ones that were unable to get what they wanted. And then when it finally started working, I mean, I literally not showered in five days. I had pizza boxes linear and it looked like a bad movie startup thing.

Speaker 4:          01:48:33       I had a beard, like I was, you know, just strung out manic. And I remember I called grant and it was opening day and he said, how many should I prep for? And I said prep for full, like cause if not, we'll turn on the phones. But I didn't tell him was that I didn't order the phones cause I didn't want to have a fail safe. You'd burn the ships. I, yeah, I, I would, I just wanted to make sure I, I forced myself to work. So we had no phone line. And um, I it, when it started working, I would double click, you know, one of the functions, it was like a double click on a table. And if it was yellow, it was held, the public can see it. I can make it available up by double clicking it, who would turn green. And then when it was sold, it would turn red.

Speaker 4:          01:49:16       But the first time I did that, um, to act, to let more inventory out, um, and clearly things were working. It turned red so fast. I thought it was broken. And so then I went into the credit card processing and saw, oh my gosh, someone bought that that fast. And I called grant, I said, dude, you got to come to my house. And he was like, uh, we're opening a restaurant and like six hours, what's going on? I said, as the guy who helped save your life, getting a fucking taxi, you can come over here cause I need to show you something. And

Speaker 5:          01:49:47       he looked at me and kind of went like, what is wrong with you? Right. And, and I took him upstairs to my office and I said, I explained what I just to him, I just explained to you and I said, click on one of those, make it available. And he said, which one? I go, anyone in the next month. And he clicked like three weeks out at nine 30 and it instantly turned red and another window I had the credit card thing up and I go, look, Mr. Jones bought that. And he went, really? And I'm like, Yep, there are, you know, 4,000 people waiting for you to do that right now. And that was the moment at which I, I was basically like, this is the best thing I've ever built.

Speaker 5:          01:50:27       Because, because it was, it was, it was, it was functionally different than any way that anybody was doing this. It wasn't novel. It was just applied in a novel way. And so, you know, what was interesting is that of course the software itself sucked, but as a proof of concept, it was awesome. Quick question on that. If you're comfortable answering how much, how much money had you put into developing the software at that point? Roughly, I'm going to say $115,000. Yeah. Okay. In your mind, were you completely confident it would work or, and there's, it doesn't have to be a or B. There can be CDF or where you, like you don't have 415 k or whatever it might be. Even if you budgeted for less than it overran the, even if there is a 20% chance that this works is it is worth risking the hours and time because it will so completely transformed what we're doing and if it fucking fails, who cares?

Speaker 5:          01:51:31       Correct. Yeah, the latter one. Yeah. Again, it's about the asymmetric risk. Right? And it was also about this thing and that as I dug into how Alinea ran, there's like things that you can fix and control and there's things you can't. Right. And this was the one that, you know, I would answer phones, it'll linea. And I would, it was like being a therapist. People would go like, I would like to, you know, make a reservation on my anniversary, you know, seven weeks from now on a Thursday, and you're like, I'm really sorry. Start. It's totally full. And 100% of time they thought you were lying to them. And, and, and so consequently I realized that we were saying no to people more than we were saying yes. And that even when we said no in a nice way and took 10 minutes to do so, um, people thought that we were lying or that they weren't important to us or any of those things.

Speaker 5:          01:52:26       And so I felt that transparency was actually more important than the actual money. And at the actual yield management, I felt like, like allowing people to see the entirety of the inventory was the most important thing. And I had this re like same thing with like, you know, the trading markets. Um, they've moved to more and more and more transparency, um, more and more speed. This is true across every industry. And I just felt like, wow, this industry I found myself in was so backwards. And so I just wanted to make the whole thing more transparent. And so even if it didn't go beyond my own restaurants, I was totally fine with that. In fact, I didn't do anything with it for four years. Um, and I didn't really intend on making it like a software product. I intended on fixing my own problems. And I think often that's where, that's where good ideas come from.

Speaker 5:          01:53:25       Oh, super often. Yeah. The scratching of your own edge, at least, you know, you have a market of one guy's guaranteed market of one. And I also want to point out when we're talking about asymmetric risk earlier and you're like, well, I want to stand to make three to four x what I stand to lose. And if you run the math, and I'm sure I'm missing a lot of subtleties here, but when you said we booked 500 x thousand dollars and it cost 115 we're getting very much within the ballpark of that. But I didn't even like, I mean, well, I mean since then it's like we've taken our margins at our restaurants from 10 to 12% to, you know, at times in good month, 20 to 25%. I'm in an industry that over the last five years, if you read, I give a talk called Tuesday's not Saturday and seven things you already know but are doing nothing about.

Speaker 5:          01:54:13       Um, it's a talk that I give to the restaurant industry. And, you know, one of the things that, that I point out in there is that, you know, there's so many obvious things that you could be doing to improve your hospitality, to improve your booking process, to get rid of food waste. Um, but people tend to just kind of move along because it's a really chaotic environment. It's hard to make change in it because every day is game day. Like you wake up every day and a hundred people are going to come through the door and if your fishmonger doesn't show up, all you need to figure out what to do with that, you know? And so it's, it's not really about the return on that one investment at that one moment. It's more like, you know, a thousand small improvements over time. And you know, what, if I look back at that system that I built then compared to what we have now, um, you know, it's a minuscule part of what it turned into.

Speaker 5:          01:55:07       Um, but it was the seed of an idea, which is more important, which is, hey, let's, let's shake things up. And then I, I got a great CFO who was at Bain consulting and he, he came on to like help manage the building of the project of next. Um, and when he started wanting to build out a business team, I was like, great, like run with it. And so we've built out food cost analysis that uses Marimekko charts. It's totally different because it's visual and you give that to the chef uses what shirts. Ah, Marimekko uh, if you, if you don't know Marimekko if you get nothing out of this, one of the greatest visualizations, um, in, in charts that you could like, you know, do an excel or whatever, um, hard to do vocally. Um, but imagine a square where each, um, of your x axis is the percentage of let's say food costs.

Speaker 5:          01:56:00       And then, um, each square within there is like, I don't know, meat or produce, but the whole of the square is 100%. The y access is 100% of one metric and the x axis is 100% of another. So you could kind of look at any given square and see how much that impacts the whole, it becomes like a big lego building with different colors. Um, if you give a busy chef 400 receipts and say, Hey, every Friday looked through all these and you know, figure out what we're spending too much on or worse, Hey, your food costs last month for 36%, I need him at 32%. Um, you can't take percentages to the bank. Let's talk about dollars. Let's see where we can say some dollars. Um, or the revenue. You could have just gone down that month for whatever reasons, August in New York. And so as, it's not really a good way to look at it, but you give this person, this, this chart, this mere Meco know Marimekko his name, m a r I m e k k o chart.

Speaker 5:          01:57:01       Is that right? Again, not good. I think so there is a Google result, which is how to make a Marimekko chart in excel. So I'm guessing that's probably it. There's medicine, youtube videos as well. So I'll, I'll put this in the show notes for people. Man, I got to tell you, like from a utility perspective, you show that to a person, you explain it visually, like when you see it, it makes much more sense. And they instantly get it and they look at it and they're like, oh, there's no way I spent that much on facial last month. You know, and this can be, this can be used for things outside. Okay. Everything. Yeah. It's not just food, not just restaurants. Oh, no, no, no. It's, it's just a great visualization of utility and they're like, consultants love it. And I got to tell you, I don't love consultants in general, but, but, but if I've learned anything from, from the best consultant that I've ever hired, like who is now my partner and CFO, um, he, you know, he came up with this and as soon as I saw it, I was like, how did this not enter my life until my 40th year?

Speaker 5:          01:58:01       This makes no sense. You know? Um, it's just incredibly useful. But my point is, is that we, we kind of went through everything in the restaurant and went like, well, what are the biggest spending areas that we can like analyze? And, um, it's true in any endeavor that you're doing, you know, there's no point in looking at, at the dimes if you've got something that costs $1,000, start there. So, um, you know, and that's, you know, getting into like our thoughts on our publicity or PR. Like we don't have a professional PR person and haven't in 14 and a half years. Um, we, we don't spend money on any promotions other than social media. Um, and then with the social media, we track all of that, you know, um, we can see what our Roi is on a boosted post. Um, we can see what our ROI is if we advertise on your podcast.

Speaker 5:          01:58:55       And you know, those are, that's, that's why these mediums are working, um, is because there are measurable, you know, I, I was looking up just as you were chatting and as I was also looking for a Marimekko, a quote that I think applies and you may certainly feel free to disagree but applies very well to a lot of the breakthroughs that, that you have experienced and also help to catalyze in a lot of what you've done. And it's quote from Charlie Munger who for those who don't know, you should definitely take a look at poor Charlie's Almanack. He's the, the the right hand or I shouldn't even say that he is the investing partner of Warren Buffet and a fascinating, fascinating human being. But one of, one of the quotes of his that I really returned to a lot when I think I might be outsmarting myself in some way, uh, or in general as a reminder is quote, it is remarkable how much long term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid instead of trying to be very intelligent.

Speaker 5:          02:00:04       Yeah. Because you, you've, as you noted earlier, you have these practices that are being implemented by otherwise, in many cases, smart people who've just not taken the time to ask, why are we doing this? Why does this exist as a thing? Why would, why does, like you pointed out, it's so obvious once you reframe it, like you walk into a clothing store and they're like, okay, what are you looking for him? Nope. Sorry, it gets again. It's like, that's fucking ridiculous. Right? And yet that's exactly the way it works in many other places. Yeah. Yeah. And that's it. Once you start down that road of thinking that way, it will drive you a little nutty because you stuck. Like you can't do every business, you know? And um, you know, there's a couple things that I've got my back pocket that I'm kind of like, you know, one day I'm going to arbitrage truffles because it's like there's an opaque market that's absurd.

Speaker 5:          02:01:05       Like, you know, it's like there, here's an example, I'm gonna give somebody out there, call me up because this is a real business idea. Um, and I've been wanting to do it for years, but you know, black and white truffles, not the kind, not the chocolate ones, but the kind that the dogs dig up in France and Italy are as expensive as the most expensive drugs in the world. Um, you order them is if it were an illegal drug, of course they're perfectly legal, but you call it a truffle dealer. Um, and you go like, you know, what do they cost while they're, you know, 650 a pound right now for black truffles, 16 for White. You'd try to talk them down a little bit. You make sure that you get the best quality because hey, we're Alinea and we will ship you back. This stuff we don't like and all that.

Speaker 5:          02:01:47       And then in an unmarked box stacked with newspaper will come $20,000 of truffles. Good for like a week by the way. Like, not like this is not like a big supply and is completely opaque as a market. Um, there is no mycologists touching these. Um, there are knock offs from Minot, not knock outs. There's different species and quality from Australia, from Tennessee, from, from China, um, etc. Etc. That they cut into it so familiar. Um, and, and like it was my, like we spend a lot of money on truffles every year, um, and try to figure out what the u s market in the fall truffle season is worth. You can't, it's exactly like publishing. You can't find numbers, you know, and so whenever I, whenever I see something like that, I'm like, someone's guarding their, their golden goose, you know, that whatever, whenever it's a black box, you're like, I feel like I am not on the best side of this trade.

Speaker 5:          02:02:53       That's right. That's right. And that's what I did. Um, you know, I did, um, a closing insular network between the merch and the Amex to arbitrage ETFs to get rid of the phone brokers in the middle. That took me like a year and a half to get through the murk and Amex, um, powers that be, um, red, like most of the CFTC. So when they would tell me it's not like in the rules or not legal or notice this CFTC Chicago trade, which is the, uh, the federal commodities trading commission. I see. Okay. It's like the sec, but for commodities. I gotcha. Um, and you know, again, sit down and actually read that someday. Like what's amazing is that the experts and never, it's like, it's like the members of Congress who don't read the bill and then if you ask them detailed instructions on it, they're like, oh yeah, I don't really know, but the general tenor is this or that.

Speaker 5:          02:03:44       Um, the people who were governing the exchanges had never read the rules, so they would just quote to me, they would just quote to me like, you're not, it's against the rules. And I'd be like, well, here are the seven volumes police show me where if not, I'm going to do it. You know? Um, and so similarly, like truffles, same thing. Um, the, the, you know, the booking for the restaurant, same thing. Open table had a monopoly. They wouldn't tell you who your customers were. They would sell your customers. They still do. To other restaurants. If you, if you're full one night, they'll just send you down the street to a Japanese restaurant down the street. They don't care. So I wanted to get rid of all that. So I built the software for that. Truffles, I will someday build a truffle exchange. So question for you. This is, this is, uh, this is something also for, this is maybe just turning this into a therapy session slash coaching sessions for myself, but I get attracted like a moth to the flame to puzzles

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       and I've got a puzzle. No, no, no. I don't need any more thoughts on this. I need to do more puzzles. But you, there are many, many black boxes out there, right? You have, you have truffles. And like you said, it's like, all right, what's the market size of the truffle exchange at x point in time? Don't know. Right? Uh, although you guys, uh, as one establishment or multiple sessions by a lot, there might be a hundred different black boxes like that that you run into. How do you choose the black boxes worth trying to shine light on like a detective? Because it's going to consume energy, it's going to consume time. How do you pick and choose which to go after?

Speaker 4:          02:05:23       It's, it's, it's, it's like the manic test, right? Like it's like the one that bothers me the most, like I kind of start doing, you know, um, and then, uh, you know, and then it's iterative from there. Like sometimes you find yourself in a construction of your own doing that was accidental. Like all of a sudden, you know, you kind of opened your mouth and said something like the truffle thing and all of a sudden like, well, okay, I guess we're building the truffle exchange. I feel like the boring company is like that from us. Like, like, like he opened his mouth and be like, yeah, just big, big, you know, dig big tunnels and he's got enough credibility now where some engineer's went like, yeah, we could build, you know, we can dig tunnels that are seismically fine and like, hey, you work for space X. Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:06:08       Like, let's see if you can build a dig a tunnel. I don't think that was like a business plan, you know? And, and he just has a lot of credibility. Um, you know, at this point, um, I think that to a certain extent, like a lot of people have a lot of ideas, they just don't dig down that rabbit hole. And, um, so, you know, I, I do some as like a hobby. Um, I do somewhere, I kind of have someone that I like within our company and say, well, if you really wanted to be independent and do something cool, like, here's a project, like learn more about this and start researching it. You know, we have, you know, 300 and some employees on the restaurant side and about 50 on talk. Um, many of them are incredibly hardworking and intelligent. And when someone says, Hey, I want to learn how to be more entrepreneurial, I take one of my black boxes out and say, well, let's see if that's true because it's going to take you six months of independent work without any guidance and you're going to get tired of it really fast.

Speaker 4:          02:07:08       Or we're going to come back to me and say, Hey, you know what? Like, I can't figure out the total value of the truffle market in the United States. And I'm like, yeah, no shit. That's why I asked you to do it.

Speaker 2:          02:07:19       Now, would you give them an assignment like this? Or like, you know what boss, I really want to be an entrepreneur. You're like, congratulations. I'm now giving you a project and a, it's on your time and you're not getting paid for it.

Speaker 4:          02:07:31       Oh, no, no, no. It's not. No, no, no, no. I, I never, never, never take every single

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       intern that works at our restaurants for a minute is paid. Gotcha. So even if you get paid for the black box time, oh yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah. I would never, like, I think one of the things that I really dislike actually our industries, like where they say, hey, like you're, you know, you're in college or whatever, you know, be an intern and then, you know, your parents say, yeah, that's a great opportunity for you to learn something and all that. And it's like, well, you're probably not, if you're not getting paid, you're not being valued, frankly. And, um, for me, I, we, we pay everybody. Like I don't nobody who's working here. Um, I, I do expect that, you know, salaried people are going to work more than just the time here. And I think that people who are passionately curious will be given a problem like that and we'll come up with interesting solutions to finding out what the answer may be and that that's enough.

Speaker 5:          02:08:30       You know. So I want to add some sort of commentary on the question that I asked, which is a, I think it's incredible that you do pay them for that independent research, which is also acting as entrepreneurial training slash filtering for them. Uh, but I wouldn't have judged too harshly at all if you said no, that's on their own time. And the reason I say that is that if you are going to be investigating black boxes as an entrepreneur, there are going to be periods of time where you are doing it in the evenings. You were doing it on the weekends. You are doing it without a clear road to immediate cash flow. Right. So I wouldn't have judged you if you said, you know what, I am paying them full time for their normal job, but if they want to tackle one of these black boxes, that's considered extracurricular time.

Speaker 5:          02:09:16       Uh, so I wouldn't have judged too harshly if you had respond in the, uh, in the negative on that. Yeah. I mean, I guess, I guess, you know, to, to back up a little bit, like when there are people who I don't know, who do not work for our company, and they called me up and say, Hey, I've got this idea for x, y, Z or whatever. And it's intriguing enough, I will, I will pose some more difficult questions, but they're not working for me. You know what I mean? Like there's, there's a guy who brought me a food product that I, you know, uh, about a year ago and it was interesting but not super compelling. And I said, hey, if you did these five things, it would be a lot more compelling for me to be involved and to help with it and all of that.

Speaker 5:          02:09:59       And yesterday I got a box in the mail and he had done not only the five things I said, but said, hey, when I started doing those, these seven other things popped up. Here's where the product is, here's the people we signed, here's the airline we just signed to carry the product. And I would love to have you still involved, even though we're so much farther down the road than I thought it'd be a year later. That's super cool. Like, Hey, that guy obviously, but there's a person who's truly entrepreneurial, right? And did this on his own time. Um, but if they're working here, if they worked for the ALINEA group, if they work for talk, like for sure there, you know, you could take time during your day, like doing your normal business. That's a project that we're working on. And, um, you know, we, we also try not to have such harshly defined rules and that within the restaurant, like, look, if you're a server, if you're a captain, if you're a aligned cook, um, you're probably not working on my truffle project.

Speaker 5:          02:10:53       I mean realistically, you know, that's not, but on the business side, um, we certainly have, um, people who, who work in roles, um, as like a lawyer or an analyst or something like that who want to get involved with our publishing project or who want to get involved with the truffle project or whatever it may be. And you know, I'm happy to pull them in and try to include them. And you know, like you said, you used the word as an entrepreneurial filter. Um, I would say 95% of the time people filter themselves up. Right? Yeah, I agree with that. I mean, they're going to sell self, select your self, select out. Yeah. Uh, are there any particular books or resources that you've found useful on a hiring or managing God if you found one? Let me know. Now. Hiring is so hard. I think it's the hardest of all things to do.

Speaker 5:          02:11:50       Um, and I think my style of interviewing people is totally different than it was 20 years ago. Um, we use the word self selecting just a moment ago and it's exactly what I do. I kind of bring people in, I let them know what I'm about, what the company's about. They've probably already been interviewed by other people before they, they get to me. And so at that point I let them know like what are the upsides and downsides of working here, you know, and I kind of let them know what the expectations are. And I, I tell them like, people self select into a job and you don't want to come here if you're going to fail because that would be terrible and I don't want you to come here and fail because that would be a waste of my time and resources and would also feel awful.

Speaker 5:          02:12:37       It's never good to like go if someone feels terrible. So let's see. If you are self selecting in, what do you want to know? Like I'll be completely transparent about what's good, what's bad, what's good about working for me personally, the fact that you maybe you'll never see me again. I mean this, it's like a big enough organization where, you know, there are definitely people working here who, who I don't know at all. Um, but people tend to join organizations where they want to work. And so I tried to make that process. I tried to make them be able to say no easier than they can say yes. What would be some examples of how you do that? You know, I kind of judge the person by what they're pain points are. And so if someone says like, you know, one of the things like to ask, you know, which it kind of resonates probably with, with you as I say, hey, we're less five books he read.

Speaker 5:          02:13:38       And I gotta tell you, that's a really hard question to answer. Um, because even if you're a voracious reader, it's really like, you remember like a book from two years ago, but you can't remember the one you read two months ago sometimes. Totally. At least I can't, you know. And so that is a great filter on people because a couple of things will happen. One, the person who is a veracious reader will go like, oh my God, I swear to God, I read like 20 bucks this year. Um, let's see. And then we'll really start going, oh, well I read one like three months ago that was this. And it was about that. And you can tell that they're intellectually curious and, and read a lot. Um, you'll also get a person who goes, look, I haven't read a book in 20 years, but every night I go home and I do woodworking and that's my outlet.

Speaker 5:          02:14:21       That's where I focus, that's my zen moment. And that's a valid answer to that question too. You know, like you don't have to be a reader. Some people will just lie through their teeth and they'll, they'll answer what they think is the smart answer to that question. And I don't want that person there. I read war and peace and then I went to the problems of philosophy and uh, yes, yes, yes. The four hour work week. So definitely not the right answer. So, so, um, so there's that and I asked that kind of question, but then like things like, do you enjoy writing? Like, I like one of my, like one of my things is like, if someone doesn't like to write, what do we, when people ask what I do for a living, I say I'm a writer. And they go like, Oh, you've written a couple books.

Speaker 5:          02:15:04       And I go, no, no, no. I read about 400 emails a day. And that skill is hugely important right now. If someone doesn't like to write, they're not gonna want to work for me because when, when they send out an email and I cc'd on it and it isn't a well thought out little thing, the answer coming back is like, hey, here's four ways to improve this. Um, and at some point it will be like, really, you did that same mistake again? Like it comes off kind of harsh and email, you know? Um, and so if you're the kind of person that doesn't take feedback well or doesn't want to learn, like, man, I don't, I, I'm lacking patients for that at this point in my life. Um, and I let them know that. And some people like look at and you can just go like, yeah dude, I don't want to work there.

Speaker 5:          02:15:52       Like more than I would think, which is great. You know, simplifies matters and it's not, it's not, it's done with a smile. You know, I'm not like trying to like terrorize people and they come in and interview and then there's some people that go like, awesome, that's exactly what I want. And um, you know, we've everything from like, you know, double phd engineers to um, people who've never attended a university for a minute and um, but they've, they've self selected into an organization that, um, people ask a lot of questions. I love that. Like I can be in room and of the idea and everyone there, I'll just be like, well, that's a great idea. There's no way we're going to be able to do that next six months because that's not, that's not in our, it's not in our capacity at our size right now. I think a question on a lot of people's minds and a pain point for most people listening will be email. So you seem to be at least confident in your treatment of email. Uh, 400 is a lot of email. Do you have any particular commandments, do's do nots times you check things you check first. Any types of systems or approaches that allow you to maintain a degree of sanity with, with the amount of email that you must receive?

Speaker 5:          02:17:14       You're going to hate this answer? I am terrible at it. Um, it used to be, uh, not so long ago that I personally replied to absolutely every single email that came in myself and I used to have an auto sign that basically it was like, if I don't reply to you within five minutes, I'm dead or asleep. And it's the opposite of everything that you stand for. I know that I was listening to Jason, so Jason Fried's a friend, I was listening to his, his podcast with you. And um, I don't get it at all. Like I am not, I would love nothing more than, um, you know, it's a rework or to not work, um, you know, you know, work four day weeks or to have six week projects. And all of this stuff that he espouses. Um, he's a friend, he's an investor in, in one of my businesses.

Speaker 5:          02:18:15       Um, but man, I don't, that's not how I function at all. Um, and I really think that he misses cause and effect a little bit. Like he has a very successful company and that's the cause that allows the effect, which is the ability to manage your time really well. Um, I live really paranoid, I'm more comfortable that way. And also I kind of feel like a weird moral responsibility to, um, reply to the people who've taken their time out of their day to write us a note, you know, um, even if it's not like critical business for me. Um, and one of the things I did for about 10 years that I loved doing, uh, when we first started linea, is that I would have Google alerts set up and I would find some blog, you know, that only like some woman in her mother red, you know, and I would reply personally, like say, wow, thank you for the great writeup for Millennia.

Speaker 5:          02:19:06       And there'd be kind of mind blown that I found it and you know, all that. Um, I treated email that way for a long period of time. Um, unfortunately now I can't quite do that, so I do have a bunch of filters and whatnot, but I didn't even set them up. Um, my business partner, Brian Fitzpatrick, who used to be the head of Google Chicago and he's my, he runs the engineering, he's the CTO of talk. He kinda said like, dude, you're, you're slipping man. Like, you know, you need to grate some filters and, and, and get some stuff that's directly to you. So he went into my Gmail accounts and kind of kind of forced the issue for me. Um, but so now I can't quite do that. Um, I do wake up in the morning and look at sort of our, our bazillion social media, um, uh, messages and whatnot.

Speaker 5:          02:19:51       Kind of pick a random one and just answer it. Like, I, I want to be involved in knowing what our customers are asking, what they're doing, what they're saying, what they're applying, anything that's a complaint actually gets brought directly via email to a complaint tracker that me and grant see. Um, and so luckily there are that many of those, but anytime you serve five or 6,000 people a week, you're going to get, you know, some, something going wrong. Um, but man, I'm terrible at it, honestly, and I think I've tried, I won't tell you a funny thing is that when I go on vacation, I do try to concoct a, a, a, a pretty funny, um, I basically say like, look, I'm going to be in a mountain or on a boat or whatever and you're, I'm not gonna be able to apply. Um, what? And so I would make these elaborate stories up almost as like a fun piece of art project as to why I couldn't do it. And so one year, um, I, uh, every year, every time I went away, I would basically say like, I'm going to visit a panda that I adopted

Speaker 4:          02:20:52       Chicago. And it ended the year around Christmas time when I went on break with a, with a, with a, a picture of a baby panda and a really kind of mediocre Photoshop job of me standing there and attribute and called me up like three days later going, you know, is it going to the Lincoln Park Zoo? Like, and I was like, no dear God, it's not. And the following, there was no panda. I look back though, those might tell you reply to that. And then the following year I said like, um, I like to talk as you might be able to tell. And so everyone who knows me knows that like I can just go on and on. Right. And so I said, I was going to a combination of a tantric sex retreat and silence retreat for eight days to explore my both inner and outer self. And, um, and you know, this is your out of office reply.

Speaker 4:          02:21:45       That's my out of office replies and, and, and anybody would get that. Right. And so I thought that was really funny. And then about two years later, I bumped into some guy who worked for a very big corporation and they wanted to do some work with, with the one group, and it was like kind of a consulting project, very lucrative. And he was looking at me really funny, you know, and I said, like, what's up? And he said, well, you know, I really wish we had worked together, but you know, then you went to that sex retreats. I just couldn't get it past everybody and I was just like, I was looking at him going like, what are you talking about? And then I remembered like four years earlier auto

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       out of office reply. And I told him like, that it was kind of a joke, like the panda and uh, and he did not find any humor in it. And I did. I thought it was hilarious, even though we lost the business. I thought it was really funny. Um, so if you ever get a really unusual out of office reply for me, it's fiction probably. I love that. Uh, I mean if you're serious all the time, you're never going to get the actual series work done. You're going to burn out before that ever happens. I also want to underscore one thing and then I want to ask you about a black box at you and I have talked about quite a bit, which is publishing. Uh, the fact that you pick a message to reply to even if it's one is really important. And I've noticed this certainly with the audience that I have, listeners, readers, et Cetera, it is not physically possible for me to reply to everyone.

Speaker 5:          02:23:21       It would also be anathema to everything that I'm espousing a in many of the books. But I do want to, I do want to demonstrate that I am listening and I think that it, it goes a really long way, even if you do not personally reply to people, if you are able to prove that you're paying attention and that seems to resolve a lot or at least act as a solve for people out there who very seldom feel heard, which does not always necessitate a response. So I just wanted to point out that it might seem like a drop in the ocean, but it actually has much further reaching implications when you, when you do it, what, what you were describing. I feel like, um, it's genuine. First of all, I'm always curious like what, what, what are people writing about, um, to the restaurants?

Speaker 5:          02:24:14       What are they writing about? To me? Um, my linkedin profile basically, like I don't really read Linkedin at all. I keep it, I think it's important to have it. Um, but I don't ever read the messages on there, but in my bio it basically says, if you can find my email address, I will, I will incite this, I will reply to you. Um, and so that gets rid of all of the marketing crap that comes in. But every now and then I get like, you know, a subject line, um, to the email address that's on there that says basically like, you know, hey, via your linkedin bio, and I'll, I'll read that and reply. And it just shows me that like, hey, there's an actual human on the other line. It's not just a marketing thing and be like, they really, really do have something that they want to talk about. Um, and so you know, it's like little things like that are kind of puzzle filters I guess that I call them. Like where I just create like a little bit of a little bit of a barrier. And if you, um, if you're really into it and you really want to talk to me, you can pretty much find me pretty easily. I'm not that hidden. Yeah, the detail is really important here. The mini hurdle. I have a friend, I'm not going to mention by name because get delusion, but

Speaker 2:          02:25:23       he is a very, very successful author and journalist. And when he is hiring for different positions part time or full time at the bottom of the job description on a job site or wherever it might be in, in small print, at the very bottom it will say, do not send a message on this platform. Do not send an email, even though email addresses given earlier, call this number and leave a voicemail answering the following things and automatically he takes the pool of a thousand people who are going to do the wrong thing and finds the 10 people who are actually paying attention. Yeah, 100%. Uh, so publishing, what is, I, we didn't really, we didn't really talk much about it, but can you give a little bit, just a tiny bit of background on the aviary and then some of your, uh, related publishing investigations, which I think is, is not, I think it's not a miss, uh, in unappropriate word. Uh, if, if you could give people a little bit of of context.

Speaker 4:          02:26:30       Yeah. I mean, I'm going to back up before the aviary just a little bit and just go like, you know, for a chef, doing a cookbook is something that they dream about. If there are serious chef from the time they're 15, you know, just like if you're a basketball player, you want to make the NBA or you know, if you're a runner, you're going to want to be in the Olympics or whatever. Like to grant, um, to a bunch of chefs having their own ideas in a physical beautiful cookbook, um, is kind of a holy grail for them. It's very sacred. And what was interesting is that, um, just before grant was sick, we started getting a lot of publishing offers and the natural inclination was to go to what he knew, which was artisan press, um, which published at the French laundry book, which is one of the bestselling, um, high end cookbooks ever.

Speaker 4:          02:27:22       And it's certainly beautiful. It was very revolutionary at its time. Uh, I think it was published in about [inaudible] 98 [inaudible] 99, something like that. And, um, the typical publishing deal like kind of came into us, which was great that they were coming in and it was, you know, 250 to $300,000. And they would basically say, well, out of that, like you're going to pay for the designer and the photographer and you need like a 30 day photo shoot and you know, here are the guidelines for how many photos you want in the book and you know, to keep costs down and this and that. And I kind of looked at all of that and all the offers came in within about 10% of each other, which immediately, you know, the hair on the back of my neck, like the spidey sense, spidey sense just telling me that something back there is pricing this in an unusual way. And then, um, and then I started going like, oh, this is actually, you liked the music industry.

Speaker 5:          02:28:23       I knew people in, in bands that would get signed to a record label back in the day and they would get a quarter million dollar advance. You know, shit that's seems like a lot of money, right? And then all of a sudden, all your studio time comes out of that and you don't recoup another dime until you've sold, you know, x number of records or cds or in this case books. And then in the, in the contract it actually said, and the restaurant guarantees that they will buy 2,500 bucks at half of retail price. And I was like, Whoa, that's, you know, you're looking at something like $80,000 right there that goes right back to them in essence. Like, and then I kind of went like, well, I wonder what a book costs to print. And I mean, I just call it, I asked them like, well, how much does this book and the cost of print?

Speaker 5:          02:29:15       Well, I don't really know. And so what they would do is that they would always have layers of people so that they said, well, that's not what I do. Like I am the person that does this. The lawyers give the contract, the printer does the printing. Like I, there's always plan a plausible deniability or plausible ignorance. Yes. Willful plausibly ignorance. Yeah. Um, and, and so I, I do what I started doing. I'm like, well, let's just Google that up and see what it costs to print a book or hey, how many, how many copies of the French laundry books sold, how many copies of 50 other books that we wanted to emulate or that we, that we thought were well done sold. And, um, man, it's like asking for like, you know, keys to the Vatican or something when you call a publisher and asked them that, um, they, I'm sure you know this, right?

Speaker 5:          02:30:08       You probably know now because you've, you've been so entrenched in the industry, like you know your numbers and you might know who the head of some of your colleagues and friends, right? Um, but if you want it to actually do a meaningful comparison across the industry, it's almost impossible to do it. Even though that there is a company that does that, then you start trying to reverse engineer it and you go to the New York Times, which you can go to the New York Times website and just look at how has the New York Times, uh, you know, bestseller list, um, created and on their own site they say it's a compendium of known publishers like publishing houses as well as these like top 50 retailers, you know, back in the day. Um, and it's a game mobile system, right? Like the way that, that the publisher publishers want to do it is that they want to ship out all the books at the same time because that's how they're counted for the New York Times bestseller list and stuff. I should also know it's not only gainable, but it's also conversely s highly subjective within the New York Times. So there, there's a lot of wiggle room. In other words, it is not like the Olympics. We were like, okay, clear gold, silver, bronze video replay. We know exactly how this was, was, uh, was it was

Speaker 4:          02:31:19       tabulated. Um, yeah. So the more that we dug, the more that, um, we got like Curie, like more and more curious, a little bit angry actually. And, but grant was weirdly angry at me because he's going like, well dude, like, why do you care? I, you know, it's like I've been wanting this since I was 15 and I was like, well, look, if this is our budget, it's not going to be the book you want this. I can be as good as you want it to be because we're not going to able to spend six months doing the photography. We're not going to be able to get great pages. We're not gonna be able to get a picture of every dish. Like if, what do people cook in a cookbook while they tend to cook those pages where they see a picture of the final dish, because you know what?

Speaker 4:          02:31:59       It looks delicious. You know, it's supposed to look like you've got something to emulate at least. Right. And so when we did the specs for the book, I had one of the best publishers in America say, if you do that book, there's no way you sell more than 5,000 oh no way. And no one's going to publish it and you can't use metric and you can't use a gram scale and you can't have that font and you can't have those pictures and full bleed and it'll cost way too much to print. And so it took about a month and a half before I got lucky and I called a print broker who had actually printed, you know, brokered the print job of one of the famous books and I was expecting that the book retails for $60 it would cost like 15 to print 20 I didn't know anything about it.

Speaker 4:          02:32:45       And when he told me it was like $2 and 23 cents per book to print per thirty thousand thirty thousand copy run. I went no way like that. And he went, well, it's probably less now. Like you thought I meant it was like too much. And instantaneously I went, oh shit. Like everything makes sense. And when I would call publishers and tell them this, there we go. Oh yeah, but look like we did 40 different prints, la, you know, 40 different books last year. Only five of them did well. And I'm like, that's your problem man. Like I know what we're going to sell. Well I don't really give a shit if you lost 35% of the time and it needs to spread your portfolio risk, I'm the one you're spreading it on. Right. And so, um, so we decided, um, with the Alinea book, um, we put together like 20 pages and Martin made this beautiful stainless steel bracketing system and we shipped it out to eight different publishers.

Speaker 4:          02:33:46       We like two of which were art houses that had never done a cookbook. And they all came back and, and same all the usual criticism except for Aaron Wayner. It tends to be press smart, smart, smart guy, by the way. Yeah. And he basically said, I'm going to make you an unusual offer, no advance at all. And we can negotiate, essentially, we'll just be the distributor and we'll negotiate out like what that looks like. And we'll help you with the printing and we'll help you with the editing, which were both really good at. And within 10, we had struck a deal whereby any of the books that we bought or sold for ourselves, for our restaurant, we paid actual printing costs, not wholesale, a actual printing costs. Um, anything that they sold and distributed through their channels, they would get about 27% of the sale price, which means that we've got 73% of that.

Speaker 4:          02:34:39       Um, these are like state secrets, right? Like, like nobody tells this stuff. And so for years I was walking around with this knowledge where if we sold 100000 bucks, say, um, that would be the equivalent of selling like 500,000 bucks on any other deal. And we got to control the quality of it. And we won both the James Beard Award for best, um, cooking from a professional point of view, best cookbook of the year. And we won. I say we, Martin and Laura Kasner one, the communication arts award where if you're a designer that's like their annual is like, that's like getting the the Oscar right. Similarly for people who don't know what I mean, the James Beard awards are also very much like the Oscars. Yeah. So, so we felt like really vindicated on that. Um, the book still sells. This is eight years later, we still sell seven, 8,000 copies a year.

Speaker 4:          02:35:34       Um, and when we did the Aviary, um, which is our bar, that's a non bar, um, that we talked about earlier. Um, you know, we started getting all of the same offers again and this time it was really easy to go, like, just kinda like, oh, like, oh, that's cute. Like, you know, um, and so I should add that we did, I wrote a, a book of grant, I wrote his memoir together that we didn't use a ghost writer. We wrote it ourselves called life on the line. And for that one, we did a traditional book deal, but after our agent kind of got it halfway, I got on our plane and flew out there and then brokered the deal myself. Um, and I got, um, a giant multiple of the highest bid by doing essentially a reverse Dutch auction, starting at a really high price and working my way downward.

Speaker 4:          02:36:27       Can you explain to people just briefly with them? Yeah, yeah. So basically like here, I'll do this, like let's say I, so I think one of the great problems like to solve one of the black boxes is the agency problem. Let's say you want to sell your house, you put it on the market, and the agent's going to get, I don't know, four to 5% of the sale price. That's a lot for something. It's like your most biggest investment in your life. Um, but they kind of say like, they control the information, they control the mls, all that. Um, will they, if they're the seller's agent, get the highest price for you? And the answer is almost certainly not. Um, because they, let's say a house is gonna sell for $500,000, they're going to get 4% of that. That's $20,000. If they get, um, $490,000, um, it's almost no difference to them write 400

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       bucks difference. But if they lose the deal over that last 10,000, it's a lot. So they want to price a home, um, so that it sells quickly so that they can keep their deal flow going and they don't really care about maximizing their last dollar. Whereas for you, that last dollar is actually like $9,600. It's a lot more money. Um, so what I do whenever I've sold real estate is that I figured out what the intrinsic value is of the house. Like what's the bare minimum that I'd be willing to sell it for? And I price it just slightly higher than that. And I tell all the agents and the whole town, I will pay you 50% of everything over 10% higher than that.

Speaker 5:          02:37:53       And they all say, oh, that's against the real state ethics code. Or I would never do that deal because it was a vert all my other deals or whatever. And then what happens is two days later you get like a dozen phone calls and they've priced it like 40% higher and they're like the, it sells in two days. Yeah. Cause now they're actually working for you. Right. Well, it similarly I went into that, that publishing negotiation and I was kind of like, by the way, the agent, um, it's probably look up until she's great like great person. I don't think she even knows that that's what was happening. Do you know what I mean? Like, I don't even think she knows it. Like, Hey, she was brought up in this, in this industry for this company and that's the way it works. And shoot for sure.

Speaker 5:          02:38:39       Dispute everything I just said. She would say, I always try to get the highest price, but I went in and I just went like, look, I'm not gonna spend my time doing this for x. So I need four times that. And she was like, there's no way you'll ever get that. You've never written a book before. And I said, well, we did the Alinea book. That's a cookbook, doesn't count. These are words, you know, so, so I, I went to the publishers that I'll bid on it and I just got them all on a, on a conference call and just started at a really high price and every couple of seconds I went down $10,000 and then one of them blinked and bought it.

Speaker 5:          02:39:17       What was the great way? That's a great method of price discovery. Um, like if you think about it, most auctions even like you go to a charity event or whatever and they start low and they try to get interest going high. It's often the case that if they start really, really high and start going down, people start going like, oh my God, someone's gonna say something like, I would pay that someone else must as well. They could be off by a factor of 30% and they'll never even know it because there's only one bid that ever happened. So no one knows how off they are. No. On that phone call where he's like, hey guys, would love to get you on the phone and then publish right away. So I guess my question is, did they know that they were signing up for a Mexican standoff slash Jesse?

Speaker 5:          02:40:02       Oh, they did. They did. I went and met with them all personally. Kind of said, if you're like, John, I'd love to get you on the phone. And that's like, all right, congratulations guys. Yeah, you can't, you can't ambush people to a Mexican standoff. Yes, you can't do that. Um, I, I mean, you could, it might be fun, but I didn't do that. All right. I went and talked. I created enticement. I sold on my ability to actually do it. Um, it was a bit like, um, doing the no phones, um, with the software. Like I was like, well, if I get a really big contract off to figure out how to write and book and there'll be a lot of pressure. Um, and so, so I did that and, um, and, and, and I wrote it and I turned it in on time, which apparently no one does.

Speaker 5:          02:40:41       Very, very rare. But yeah, to them, like under David's do, they went, what's this? And I'm like, that's the manuscript. Yeah. Oh that's cute. Well, it's kind of like showing up at the restaurant on time as a diner and then being seated at the appointment time. It's just this like open, open lie teaching your books in time. I do actually. Yeah, I believe that. Yeah. I do turn my books in on time. Uh, and we, we could get into that separate topic. I just want to ask you a question. I do. I do. I do not turn them in at the, uh, expected length longer perhaps. I do tend to turn on. So what happened with that, but the aviary is that we, like, we basically couldn't figure out how to do another book, um, because the Alinea book was such a project and Martin was on to other things and we didn't want to do it traditionally.

Speaker 5:          02:41:40       And I didn't know anyone who could do what we wanted to do. And then there was this guy, Ellen hamburger and boy, if you get nothing else from this whole talk and you've made it this far, um, go see, go Google, uh, Allen and Alinea. Um, Allen is a procedural effects artists. Uh, he worked at what a studios and all the hobbit movies doing like hair and water and things like that. Um, so he writes the physics that then makes the, makes the magic. Right. Um, and then, uh, he worked at Pixar and while he was at Pixar and his wife Sarah worked at industrial light and magic as a graphics designer. Um, he was given by Sarah a copy of the Alinea book to go full circle and became, just fascinated with it. Was Not a cook, didn't know how to cook and did the Julie and Julia thing, he spent five years not only, um, cooking his way through the entire book, but also would do things like, well, I don't know where to get this plate.

Speaker 5:          02:42:41       And I've always wanted to learn how to fire porcelain. Alan for people wondering is a l l e n there are also videos of Allen and Alinea. Yeah. And he's an autodidact. Like this guy learns and learns and learns and is the kind of person that goes to the black box and goes, I'm going to learn how to forge knives and I'm going to learn how to fire porcelain. And by the way, I'm going to cook everything in there and I'm gonna take pictures of him and make a book documenting that. And when he asked if he could use like we had kind of a little email

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       relationship and he came out to linea wants to ask grant some questions about how to make something cause it wasn't working and when grant kind of threw up his arms to go by, the book might be wrong. Like Ellen's world view was shattered. It was like fine. And he was kind of like, what you mean? It could be wrong. He goes, well yeah we did have some Murata in there. Like I mean we documented hundreds of recipes. It could be wrong. And at that point like his mentality change. It's in the video and, and we got to know him and I got to know him and when he sent me the book, it wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting like a homegrown book. And what I got was, you know, a 400 page beautifully, beautifully illustrated, beautifully written book about a person's journey of learning, um, and it was called the Alinea project.

Speaker 4:          02:43:59       And I had no, no idea that he had done anything like this. And so suddenly, um, I thought to myself immediately, and it's in the intro to the aviary book, um, I texted him and said, Holy Shit, you're crazy. And I have ideas. And after waiting for like four or five years to do a book on the Aviary, I immediately was like, this is the guy to do the book. Now I need to lure him out of Pixar, which is about the best place to work in the world. And then I found out his wife worked at industrial light and magic and she did all the graphic design and I was like, this is perfect. You guys need to quit your jobs and moved to Chicago. And they flew out, we had some conversations about what that might look like. Um, it was very much a partnership.

Speaker 4:          02:44:49       Um, they would have equity in the book. We would have creative freedom to do it exactly the way we wanted. Um, we knew more about the printing and the bidding and all of that. So I wasn't worried about the economics of it anymore. I was worried about trying to make something really awesome and right as they were about to say yes, they were, they found out that they were going to have a baby. So they called me up one day and said, oh my God, like, and I was like, oh, they got cold feet. Oh No. And he said, you know, we're pregnant, we're going to have a baby. And I said, okay, well we're going to wait a year because there's no way in the world I'm letting you move out out of your comfort zone and have a child and to have that change of life.

Speaker 4:          02:45:27       And they thought I was like punting on them just because like in a discriminatory way. And I said, nope, we're not going to do this with anyone else. We will wait as long as it takes. And about a year and a half later, they moved to Chicago and we spent the last year and a half, um, set up a studio of our own, spent the last year and a half doing this book. Um, did a Kickstarter to just essentially raise awareness for it. We raised almost half a million dollars in the Kickstarter. We sold about another $300,000 a book since then. Uh, it comes out in October. Um, you can go the Alinea book.com. And the coolest part of that website is that if you look at the Alinea book, I'll, sorry, DVD book.com, very ugly, very late. It's marketing right there. So, um,

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       yeah, the Aviary book.com. But if you, the coolest part of that is other than of course your ability to buy said book is um, Alan kept a blog on there called our progress. And in it he details every single aspect of what it takes to make a book like this right down to line screens. And compositing photos of, you know, like one of the things that every single book publisher told me is that you can't sell a cocktail book from earning $30. There's no market for it and you don't need pictures because it's just a liquid in a glass. And I think we blew that out of the water with what the book looks like. Um, I think that because certain things like fire are really hard to photograph. Um, there's a great picture in there of this one cocktail where we, we spray some antidotes and we light it on fire and it creates an aroma into the bowl that it's served in.

Speaker 5:          02:47:04       It's called loaded to the gun walls. Um, it's a Batavia rock cocktail. And like that took a composite of 18 different photographs. And so he breaks down the photography techniques and also the New York Times bestseller list. And I showed him like how, you know, Google target marketing works and Facebook ads work and all that. And all of a sudden he went, Holy Shit, I had no idea you could do this. So we are going completely without a distributor and publisher of this time. Um, and I think we're going to set a man, I don't know, like I, I'm either completely delusional. It wouldn't surprise me if we sold a half a million of these. Yeah. And in the next two or three years and it's, yeah, it's not a, not a nine 95 book either, which it shouldn't be. Right. I mean, this is, it's $85. Um, we've invested close to a million dollars all the way in around it and it looks like it.

Speaker 5:          02:47:58       I think, I hope, um, yeah. From what about, from what I've seen, it looks like it would cost more than that. Yeah. Well we did, you know, we did it all ourselves too. Um, you know, it's really like a five person project. Um, it's, it's deep enough that if, if a professional gets it, they're gonna learn a lot. Um, but I'd say about 35, 40% of it can be done at home because unlike the Alinea book where Hey, you've got to go out and buy duck, like, you know, in your local grocery might not have this kind of duck or whatever. If you need some Florida kind of run or you know, um, you know, a certain kind of Tequila or whatever, you just go to your local liquor store and it's exactly the same thing that we use. Um, you know, that product is universal.

Speaker 5:          02:48:37       I read somewhere that the, I don't think it's taking us too far afield. I read somewhere that you consider yourself as Keela guy or at least in part a Tequila guy. Do you have any favorite tequilas or concoctions? Well, there's, so I just am going to do a little video promo for um, for the book that we just filmed last week where essentially I work with Eric [inaudible] who's one of our bartenders in the office, which is our little speakeasy below the aviary, which is amazing if people have the opportunity to check it out. It's basically grant said, hey, everything upstairs. People are gonna think it's Alinea smoke and mirrors. We need to prove we can make a real cocktail. So one of the foundational cocktails for me is, is a Daiquiri. It's a, I say three ingredients in a million ways to fuck it up. You know, it's, it's just lime, sugar and rum.

Speaker 5:          02:49:27       That's all it is. And, uh, and yet like most bars you go into will make a terrible Daiquiri or they'll blend it or blah, blah, blah. Right? But a great Daiquiri is really, really transformative. So did a video on that. Um, and then I always make a half mescal Margarita. That's my favorite drink. All I'm doing is I'm taking some reposado and a little bit of mezcal and equal weights along with, um, some, uh, you know, uh, grandma or nay or quantro equivalent and lime and simple syrup. That's it. That's all there is to it. Um, man, I love the simple stuff like that. And then we have a whole section in the book on old whiskeys, dusty bottles, um, old gins. Like there's a growing movement to kind of rediscover some of the distilleries in America that were really, really, really great, um, that don't exist anymore.

Speaker 5:          02:50:17       Um, that were more artisinal at the time. And you can still find those bottles, um, around, uh, it's a little bit easier than like, you know, someone like wine collecting or something like that. And um, I mean it's, it's like an endlessly fascinating thing. I don't consider myself a cocktail person 10 years ago. I really loved wine. Um, I felt like from a health perspective it was better as well. But just like anything else, if you have a well constructed cocktail and something of high quality, um, it's an additive thing. Like you can have it in a meal and it can make the meal better. Um, you know, whereas it's like, you know, a vodka tonics just boozing, um, has just getting drunk. Um, that's not what we're trying to do here. We're trying to make things that are, it's really a culinary approach to cocktails and a man.

Speaker 5:          02:51:03       It's, it's endlessly fascinating. Just like anything else in this world. And the, the, the, I would also say just contrasting, say someone who wants to recreate something from Alinea, which you certainly could do. I mean Ellen prove that with something from the aviary. The, there's also a tremendous amount of theater and presentation dynamism that you can create with cocktails that does not have to be super expensive or super complicated. Uh, that, uh, I mean certainly you guys are able to go as complex as you want to go, which is stunning and I've spent time at the Aviary, but it's all, you can easily make some ice with patriots bitters in it or something like that. And then as the ice melts and the cocktail, it's going to change the flavor and it's going to look really cool too. I'm doing some of these things at home is, is not hard. Um, I did a dinner party once where it was like, you know, a cocktail party probably had 40 people at my house and each room in my house had all of the ingredients for the cocktail and then a little instructions

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       on how to make it themselves. So that took away the need for a bartender because they're terrible anyway. Anyone that you'd bring in and you know that, you know, a caterer or something like that. And the other cool thing is that people got really into it. They went like, oh, like I only know how to make an old fashion. Now I know how to make a Manhattan. Um, you know, uh, the one that I discovered that party was a Frisco's sour had like Benedictine whiskey and lemon, you know, it was really delicious. So it can be, it can be more than just like a strong cocktail. It can be really delicate and interesting

Speaker 2:          02:52:38       and people can learn all about this@theaviarybook.com. Is that right? Right. Yup. Well, nick, I've have to rapid fire questions that are unrelated. And then I think we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna bring this neat and tidy round one podcast, uh, to, uh, to, uh, to a close. But we've talked about books and everybody should not only check out the aviary book, but also if they have a chance to go to the aviary. It is, it is tremendous. And you can also get some delicious bites and food. Uh, at least last time I was there stuck in at the aviary. So it is a bit of a, I hesitate to call it a work around, but you guys have some very, very popular establishments. If you want to sample the food, this is also a great way to do it. Uh, and the drinks are just incredible. So it's, it's a real sort of destination that makes a trip to Chicago a worth it and of itself. So I would recommend not only checking out the book, but also checking out a lot of what you guys are up to. Aside from that books you've gifted the most other people outside of those that you've made yourself, what are the books that you've gifted the most to other people?

Speaker 4:          02:53:57       Yeah, I named one of them already. Um, the fooled by randomness, almost everyone in my office is forced to read that. Um, you know, um, and I've, I've definitely given that away. Um, boy, that's a tricky one because I just, like I said, I can't remember. I can't remember books. Um, very well, but that's certainly probably number one. Um, on a business side of things. And then the, on the other side, um, I tend to give away what I would call vintage art books. So it's not a book people can buy, I'm sorry to say, but occasionally I'll be like, you used bookstore and I'll find some of these great old art books and I buy a few of them. And then when I, when I want to thank someone for something, I send him that

Speaker 2:          02:54:41       peregrinations of an epicurean, something like that. Yeah. I mean at the end of the day, like

Speaker 4:          02:54:46       I bought like when I want to give someone something, I tried to make it something that you and I really want to make it a great gift. Um, I try to get it something that you can't buy. Right. And so I bought an old typewriter and I write, when I write a thank you note, I type it up on the old typewriter and it is the most confounding thing to people because they look at it and they go, how did you do that? I'm like on a 1922 type writer. Um, it's like a personal artisinal thing. Um, but I, I know that that's not what you're getting at. No, I can't, I can't really think of, I can't really think of like the number one. I'm sure once we, we, we end this, I'll immediately think of it. And if I do, I'll send it to you so you can link to it.

Speaker 2:          02:55:33       I think the answer, the answer is more interesting with the typewriter. So I, I think, uh, what I'm getting at was whatever you just offered, so that's perfect. And if you come up with anything else, we can put it in the show notes. Uh, this, this next one. It can be tough at times for folks, but the billboard questions, so metaphorically speaking, noncommercial, no advertising, but if you could get a, a word, a quote, a sentence, a question up on a billboard to transmit something to millions or billions of people. Does anything come to mind that you might put on that billboard? I don't know why this came to mind, but the, but the word would be pause. Hmm.

Speaker 4:          02:56:13       As it, I have no idea why that came to mind, but I think in, in talking through this whole thing, you know, it's, you, you kept asking me like, why are you digging this black box or whatever, or it'd be like, um, curiosity, like, and I think those are two, I'm thinking of those in the same way. I'm not saying pause, like stop. I'm saying think right. And so I think, um, you know, the, the hallmark of, of the people that I like as friends the best is what we try to instill in our kids. Uh, you know, and, and the reason I like my wife so much and all that is that intellectual curiosity is everything. And so, um, I dunno, how do you get that on a billboard? I think pause or, you know, be curious or something like that. I know it's Cliche, but I, I think that's the thing, the thread that ties everything together.

Speaker 2:          02:57:05       Yeah. You do pause a lot. Even though on a macro level you seem to be moving, uh, at hyper speed a lot of the time. There are a lot of pauses built into that. Speed, if that makes sense. From what I've noticed. I mean your assignment, you are simultaneously one of the craziest fuckers I know and uh, least craziest fuckers. I know. If that makes,

Speaker 4:          02:57:29       that's a great counselor. I'll take, I'll take it. I'll take it.

Speaker 2:          02:57:34       And uh, where can people find you?
