You may have heard coach summer on the podcast who designed the program, former national team coach for men's gymnastics. I am not easily impressed and I've just been completely blown away by the sophistication of his programming and the elegance of his programming. I've been using gymnastic bodies for just a few months now and I feel more flexible, stronger and younger than I have in years and it sounds cheesy to hear myself say that, but it's true.

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic. I reached out to these Finnish entrepreneurs after a very talented acrobat, introduced me to one of their products, which blew my mind and the best way possible it is mushroom coffee. What on earth is this? Well, it includes Chaga mushroom, very powerful antioxidant, considered a super food. I was introduced to Chaga by Laird Hamilton, the King of Big Wave Surfing of all things and it includes another mushroom that is considered a no tropic, a smart drug and this is lion's mane in the entire packet. You just add it to hot water. Tastes like coffee. There is only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so less than half what you would find in a cup of coffee. So I do not get any jitters. I do not get any acid reflux or any type of stomach burn and it put me on fire for an entire day and I only had half of the packet. So this stuff is really amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       hello

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where each episode I deconstruct a world class performer to tease out the rituals, routines, habits, purchasing decisions, et Cetera, that you can emulate, test in your own life, whether they are from athletics, entertainment, business, military or otherwise. This episode is a round two with dom D'Agostino dom that is doctor Dominic D'agostino is an assistant professor in the department of Molecular Pharmacology and physiology at the University of South Florida. Morsani College of medicine and that is a mouthful and a senior research scientist at the Institute for human and machine cognition IHMC. He's also dead, lifted 500 pounds for 10 reps after a seven day fast and I consider him a friend. I call him, he's on speed dial for me with many of my metabolic and nutritional questions and many, many of you after the last, I think it was two to two and a half hour conversation with dom and if you haven't heard that you can go to four hour work week.com forward slash dom dom and it will take you to that URL.

Speaker 2:          00:04:05       After that episode, he and I were just delusion with enthusiastic followup questions about Ketosis, ketones, cancer, et cetera. The following is dom answering your most popular questions with a particular focus on ketones, ketosis, ketogenetic diet, et cetera. And for that reason you could consider it the sort of Ketosis masterclasses, especially if you combine both episodes. But this one stands alone if you want to listen to it. There are a couple of things that are not mentioned at length, uh, necessarily. We're in detail. For instance, the types of canned sardines and oysters that he eats, King Oscar and wild planet foods. This is from the first episode in the show notes is where you can find the sardines. It's also why whole foods around the country sold out of wild planet food. Sardines is this episode and then the canned oysters would be crowned Prince Natural Oysters, but you can find all of that in the show notes@fourhourworkweek.com forward slash dom for the first episode.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       And we cover a lot. And what I would suggest is dom did this on the road. It takes a few minutes for him to get warmed up, be patient, listened to it. And if you want to skip around, I mean there are a few things, for instance around I believe eight minutes, 55 seconds, let's just call it nine minutes after this intro ends. Can you gain muscle on the ketogenic diet and a related questions around 52 and 20 seconds after this intro. How does he handle travel? What does he pack? And if you're really considering exploring ketosis or just consuming exogenous ketones like the Kido Kana and Quito force that I've discussed with dom and also with Patrick Arnold, very famous biochemist for performance enhancing compounds, shall we say. Uh, then this is also relevant because there is data to suggest that you can slow, for instance, tumor growth by consuming these synthetic exogenous ketones.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       Even if you are still consuming glucose or producing glucose, which is very, very exciting for all sorts of reasons. In any case, this is going to be dense. It's going to be worth it and just be patient. And, uh, I think that if you have an interest in these types of metabolic therapies, whether it is for performance enhancement and let's say endurance or for anticancer purposes or otherwise, that you will find a gem within this conversation, which is more of a monologue I suppose. So please enjoy this conversation with dom D'Agostino. If you want to say hello to him, you can certainly do so on Twitter. It's imagine that at Dominic d, O m I n I c. Dot. Agastein o d a g o s t, I and then the number two, I guess it was t Dominic D'Agostino has taken. So at Dominic d a gusty to is his Twitter. And that will also be in the show notes. Uh, you can find all show notes at [inaudible] four hour work week.com forward slash podcast. And what a fucking long intro. I'm sorry folks. Enjoy

Speaker 4:          00:07:03       first question, uh, is still be under the ketogenic diet category. Under that court category is also some questions on fasting. I think Alex, David writes, despite all the evidence, it seems that many Dietitians and researchers, uh, I'd had a clinicians to that still frown heavily on Ketosis. Why is there so much resistance? So I think the main reason would be the lack of education in the medical community and even in the dietetics programs. So having gone through and nutrition science program in my Undergrad, um, 20 so years ago, uh, there was a little bit of discussion on low carb diets, very little if any discussion about a key to genic diet. There was a discussion, uh, kind of a negative discussion one day I remember on the actins Diet. So my particular professor at the time really sort of spies that tie. So that's the problem.

Speaker 4:          00:08:10       Like, you know, registered dieticians who were supposed to be at the cusp, the, the, the front of, of understanding sort of nutrition and how to manipulate nutrition for optimum health or weight loss. And most of the patients that they deal with are really trying to lose weight or manage type two diabetes. And we know the ketogenic diet is like a, a big hammer, you know, for type two diabetes is Jeff Volak would say put it type two diabetic intermission within like two weeks or so. You could see that, you know, that that's known. I think the big stigma comes from the dietetic community is that it's just not feasible for people to follow. And you know, if you lower the carbs, what type of macro nutrient are you adding? You're adding fat, right in. Saturated fat has been demonized. Certainly it was demonized back when I was in, in college, you know, over 20 years ago.

Speaker 4:          00:09:09       And that's going to be hard to change. I think our stance on that has softened up considerably, but it's going to take some time to change the minds of the people who are the major influencers, which would be kind of the medical community and dietetic program. They need to accept that the low carb ketogenic diet really has a place. And right now it's really doesn't have a place. Uh, it's getting more attention, which is good, but it doesn't have a place in the medical community too. So the lack of education there. I teach in the medical college and I'm on the, I was on the medical curriculum committee for medical school for a number of years, like three years. And the, the curriculum is already so compressed and it's tries to fit in as much as possible. The information is sort of biased if you want to say that towards covering what's on the, the boards that the medical students have to take.

Speaker 4:          00:10:18       The U s Emily. So they, there's just no room to fit in nutrition into the medical curriculum. So doctors are not going to have an appreciation of nutrition. There's certainly not going to have an appreciation for the ketogenic diet. So the medical school that I teach at though does have a functional medicine sort of group of kids that are very enthusiastic and really smart and they, they really want this information and they have a, a lunch sort of seminar series that they have people come in and talk and I've given a talk and my students, uh, are research associates have given a talk in this. And the feedback has been really good. I mean they, they want the information but it's just not taught in the general curriculum. And it needs to be. So nutrition is really the foundation of our health. And uh, and if medicine wants to focus on prevention, there's no better tool than nutrition.

Speaker 4:          00:11:21       Exercise helps, but probably not as good as nutrition. So nutrition research too. There's just a, a lack of good research on low carb diets. The ketogenic diets are sun out there if you look, but the, the rigorous sort of controlled multi university trials, looking at the effects of a high carb diet verse Mediterranean verse, low carb or Ketogenic Diet. These are really difficult studies to do and they're really expensive. And uh, you know, it comes, you have the question of who's going to fund these studies? What kind of institutional support do you have to run these studies? Are The people at the institute knowledgeable? Do they have a team of Dietitians that can control the parameters that are needed to ensure a diet compliance, for example, are they measuring blood ketones for all the participants in the Ketogenic Diet Group? So that rarely happens. And that's the kind of, you know, oversight that needs to happen to be able to do this kind of research.

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       And um, you know, the research is really going to be important because that's what the medical community who are not taught nutrition, that's what they're going to look at. They're going to want evidence so that they say, you know, if you tell them that this is a powerful metabolic therapy and even the standards of care for drug resistant or refractory epilepsy, it works remarkably well for that application. And I think it can work equally well for a number of other applications. They're going to want that, the research to support that. And I think that research is in progress and I think the low hanging fruit would be looking at type two diabetes and obesity. And I think that's going to be one of the most important applications for a key to genic or maybe not even KeyJack low carb diet. So a low carb diet is relatively easy to do, but nutritional ketosis is considered really considered extreme and difficult to implement.

Speaker 4:          00:13:46       Right? So that's why, you know, the question is why are researchers or dieticians frowning on this? So it dietician is gonna have a difficult job getting their, their patients to comply with this kind of diet. And I could just tell you, buy people come to me and uh, many of them that attempt the Ketogenic Diet just can't follow it. It's really hard to follow. And that's what I think something like a modified Atkins Diet, you'll get four times the amount of compliance. Uh, if you can get maybe 10% of people that can follow a ketogenic diet, I would say if you screen them properly, you can get at least 40% of the people to adhere to and modify ketogenic diet defined as sort of following in a way that they consistently have an elevation of blood ketones day in and day out. So it's just a much easier diet to follow.

Speaker 4:          00:14:49       Talk a little bit more about that. A leader I think with questions and there's also some resistance from the exercise community too. Um, if people, the question is what do you, what are you using the Ketogenic Diet for? And there's clearly saw on social media, there's a lot of talk and discussion and debate about the ketogenic diet for endurance athletes, long distance runners. And I think it definitely has an application. They're bigger question that I get a lot. Is it the ideal diet or can you gain muscle size and strength, you know, doing resistance training, doing bodybuilding power, lifting with a ketogenic diet. And I think you can, I know you can, uh, the question is, you know, is it optimal? Probably not for everybody, but I think it is for, I think it can be for a subpopulation of people. And I think, you know, as we age, our carbohydrate tolerance decreases with age.

Speaker 4:          00:15:57       So the, the over 40 crowd and I would fit into that response remarkably well to a ketogenic diet, I think in the context of resistance training or a low carb diet. But we really need more research on that. So hopefully we're, we plan to do that. So, um, uh, the next question probably spent too long on that question, so I'll try to hit these more rapid fire. The next question comes from Grad Gross. Could you please ask him about protein intake, uh, on, on Ketosis. So it seems like there's a thousands of different answers out there to this question. And yes, everybody's got an answer to how much protein you should take on a ketogenic diet. So in the case of me and then the case in the context of treating kids with epilepsy, it's been found that keeping your protein between one and 1.5 grams per kilogram per day is really, you need to kind of stay within that range to consistently stay in nutritional ketosis as protein is can be insulinogenic so you could excess protein can feed into gluconeogenic pathway and kick you out of Ketosis or decrease your ketone levels.

Speaker 4:          00:17:22       Um, so I would say the higher protein though is probably needed in people that are more active and also heavy training. And I think when you get the person who's an ectomorph and is super fast metabolism and maybe on top of that, you know, from mine, he's an Ectomorph and he has a very high output, you know, cause he, he works outside all day so he needs two grams per kilogram day. And that would, that's typically far above what most people would take for a ketogenic diet. But his ketones stave remarkably high off fat cause its output is really high. Uh, typical ketogenic diet, quote unquote, the classical ketogenic diet, a four to one ratio, four parts fat, one part combination protein, carbs has like 10% calories coming from protein that's really low. So a modified ketogenic diet is 25 to 30% calories and protein from protein percentage protein.

Speaker 4:          00:18:31       And that's also called the modified Atkins Diet. And, uh, it really evolved out of work done at Johns Hopkins. Uh, Eric Kossoff. Uh, it was probably the leader in sort of advancing the modified Atkins as a metabolic therapy for, for uh, kids and adults with the seizures. And that's really the Diet that, that a lot of athletes are using. So my, myself included kind of not an athlete, but I think most of the people who say they're on a ketogenic diet are not doing the classical ketogenic diet, which is like 10% protein. So yeah, the protein intake, very general recommendation, one to 1.5 grams per kilogram. Matt Nelson Ass. The impact of the Ketogenic Diet on type one diabetes. So it's an interesting situations that I have a type one diabetic student in my lab and he's a phd student. Remarkable student, Vic guys, six, four, 250. Uh, Andrew Coot. Nick is his name and join the lab with an intense interest in this subject and took it upon himself to try the ketogenic diet as a type one diabetic.

Speaker 4:          00:19:49       Right? So, um, he tracks everything including his blood glucose continuously cause he has one of the, uh, sort of Dex con units that continuously measures his blood glucose levels. And, um, he's a remarkable subject for testing ketogenic food products because we could just turn his insulin off so he has a glucose monitoring system and an insulin pump. If we want to examine the glycaemic index or the glycaemic response, I guess you would say at different foods, we can use Andrew and turn off his, uh, his insulin pump and then look at his, uh, glycaemic response to the food. So it comes in very handy. Uh, so Andrew, uh, is a great sport and he decided to try the Ketogenic Diet and his written up some notes here that things just sort of describing his response to, to the Diet. And Andrew kind of is very, um, kind of perceptive about many different things, including, uh, his insulin sensitivity.

Speaker 4:          00:21:06       So he has a really good handle on how changes in his body composition, his exercise. So when he does kind of brutal exercises training in the gym, uh, the frequency that consistency, uh, how that affects his, his blood glucose, that type of insulin that he uses and how that influences his caffeine use is fiber, the composition of his meal, the types of foods, what he adds to his foods, things like cinnamon. So he's tracked like all these different variables and, and how these variables influence his blood glucose and the amount of insulin that he needs. When he got around to the Ketogenic Diet, he realized there was some really big perks to being a type one diabetic and being on a kid Jank Diet. And the biggest would be the lack of blood glucose fluctuations. So tremendous difference between a in glucose fluctuations on a high carb diet versus the Ketogenic Diet.

Speaker 4:          00:22:16       The daily fluctuations were remarkably tighter and he's been conversing with other type two diabetics who have switched from the Diet that they have been prescribed and the ketogenic diet. And, um, I mean it's, it's amazing the, uh, the control of blood glucose that you have when you're on a ketogenic diet and not only is your blood glucose, his blood glucose, remarkably a kind of controlled when he switched to ketogenic diet, but he was able to reduce his insulin levels, uh, to about one third of the amount of insulin that he was using before. So whenever you can reduce the amount of insulin for a type one diabetic can do that, that's a good thing. So, um, doctors need to acknowledge that. So he, uh, had a similar reduction in 24 hour insulin levels, uh, or no hidden in his notes here. He noted that there was a similar reduction in 24 hour insulin levels, uh, reported in individuals who were underweight, uh, who underwent and ketogenic diet, but maintain body weight.

Speaker 4:          00:23:35       So, and he lists a number of different publications to support sort of the same observation that he saw when he switched from a high carb diet to a ketogenic diet for managing his type one diabetes. Uh, his insulin sensitivity increase tremendously. So in this has major implications, uh, potential protection against hypoglycemia, right? Uh, in my talks, I always talk about the work of, uh, George Cahill from Harvard in 1967 and the mid sixties and 1967 he published then observation fastest subjects who when adapted to a state of starvation, ketosis were remarkably resilient against insulin induced hypoglycemia. Uh, so they suppressed their blood glucose levels with ivy infuse insulin down to something between one to 2 million molar. And that would be kind of universally, if not fatal, would put someone into a coma or a seizure. So, uh, and we know that having blood ketones elevated make you remarkably protected against hypoglycemia.

Speaker 4:          00:24:59       So that has real practical consequences from a safety standpoint. Uh, if you're driving, you know, how many accidents are caused by, uh, or result from hypoglycemia and people who are diabetic. So that much of that could probably be mitigated if they were on a ketogenic diet. So these benefits, and he described many benefits, you know, in our daily talks in the lab and these benefits essentially eliminate the potential downside of type one diabetes. Uh, initially the short term and the long term, right? So short term you're talking, you know, acute hypoglycemia, mitigating that is really important but also the long term. So if you're on a high carbohydrate diet and you have huge postprandial excursions in your blood glucose, that's gonna and you do that repeatedly, that that's gonna cause a lot of harm, you know, in the longterm. And that can be completely eliminated or significantly attenuated in type one diabetics using a low carb approach or a ketogenic diet approach.

Speaker 4:          00:26:18       So I noticed a controversial subject and I don't want to kind of base my comments or suggestions off, you know, the, the people that communicate to me and seeing firsthand what it did to Andrew who not only has much better control over is type one diabetes but is incredibly, has incredible amount of muscle and strength and continues to surpass a lot of his lifts in the gym while following a ketogenic diet or low carb approach. So He's more or less transitions from a ketogenic diet to low carb and kind of bounces back and forth then stay, keep genic all the time now. But he told me that he feels best while he's on a ketogenic diet and certainly uses much less insulin. So there's some resources out there to point people to, cause I do get about at least one or two questions are week on this.

Speaker 4:          00:27:17       I would point people to the ketogenic diet for type one diabetes ebook and that's on ketogenic diet resource.com and the authors of those books are Ellen Davis and Dr. Keith Runyan. And I knew doctor Runyon has been on several podcasts talking about his use key is a type one diabetic. He's a medical doctor with type one diabetes. Next question I want to address is by Oh Himba narco swath and asked the question kenogenic breath analyzer versus blood. So which one, which one's best here? So the blood glucose slash ketone meter by Abbott labs, the precision Xtra and one that I use personally is the freestyle Neal, I think it's called. It's really the gold standard if you're getting into this and you want to, if you're not on a tight budget, I would recommend measuring every day if you're really serious and to do it the same time of day every day.

Speaker 4:          00:28:24       And I think that's really important. And the breath acetone meter, uh, that would be the, uh, the ketone tonics meter is really useful and it just really needs more development and testing from my perspective. Um, so we know from at least, you know, one, maybe two studies breath acetone levels correlate with seizure control. So I think if you have kids that are managing a disorder and they don't want to be their fingers, you know, prefer not to be pricked. I think these breath acetone meters are great for kids. And I've talked to, you know, parents and kids that enjoy doing them. Kids you blow in and you have like these pretty colors. You get the blue and with low ketones are green and then orange and yellow I think in red. So they're very convenient, uh, for giving you a range of breath acetone that can correlate with seizure control.

Speaker 4:          00:29:35       So I think more work needs to be sort of done with them. Um, they're noninvasive and I think there's what I'm interested in and is actually using these devices to look at other volatile organic compounds that may be important. Health biomarkers for example. You know, it gives you information on oxidative stress, so you have things like Iso Cross Danes, uh, things that could detect from what I'm interested in is like oxygen toxicity, pulmonary oxygen toxicity, uh, will kind of be characterized by blowing off certain Baltara organic compounds. And I think our gut microbiome to influence the gut microbiome will influence the volatile organic compounds that are coming out of our mouth. And I think these things can be picked up. And once we understand and we can develop devices to measure these things in our breath and I think don't, no one has done it yet, but I, I don't know why it's not possible, but saliva ketone measurements, I think that might be, you know, something to look into.

Speaker 4:          00:30:45       So if anyone out there is listening, so maybe a saliva ketone measurement system could be useful. The next question is Jeff Henderson and he writes, I'd be really curious about how ketosis affects performance at altitude. So I live in big sky, Montana, do a lot of back country ski touring, climbing mountaineering. I've noticed a significant performance increase while in ketosis. I'm currently trying to get in a friend's willing to do a ketogenic diet so I can put together an actual experiment with a decent sized Dataset. So I don't know what he measure. If he did that. Uh, we'd love to hear dumps thoughts on this. Okay. Um, so there's any increase in brain blood flow when you are in a state of nutritional ketosis. So that may reverse some of the, the things that we know happen as a response to altitude. There's, uh, some individuals can have hypo Kapnik cerebral vasoconstriction, so that could maybe be reversed or mitigated in part, uh, with nutritional ketosis, there's also things like, uh, at altitude you can have an increased intercranial pressure and uh, the Diet actually has, uh, uh, well-described diuretic effect.

Speaker 4:          00:32:16       It's fairly mild, but it can maybe reduce some of the intercranial pressure that people at really high altitudes can experience. So we know too that, uh, the energy production and our, our bodies in general probably can generate energy more efficiently with ketones than it can with other types of fuels with glucose in particular. And then we can probably derive more energy per oxygen molecule. And I would probably direct you to some of the work that was done by Richard Veech is lab. And they did work with a working profused heart preparation and they looked at the delta g of ATP hydrolysis and they look at the hydraulic efficiency of the heart, which increased significantly when, uh, the preparation was perfused with ketones relative to glucose. Right? So there's also a book written by Andrew Murray and Hugh Montgomery and that book, the title of it, uh, how wasting is saving weight loss at altitude might result from an evolutionary adaptation.

Speaker 4:          00:33:34       So this will kind of describes how nutritional ketosis may mitigate some of the weight loss that's associated with being at altitude. Peter at Tia also give a talk, if I remember correctly at Ihmc, if you Google Peter Tia Ihmc lecture, he gave a discussion on the performance enhancement as facts that he had with the Ketogenic Diet and also describes cycling at high altitude. Uh, I think the balance of the data from a scientific perspective and from feedback that I get would suggest that being in a state of Ketosis can enhance exercise performance at altitude. Another person I think communicating with recently is Patrick Sweeney. Uh, he t he actually recently teamed up with Professional Mountain biker. Rebecca Rush I think is her name. And they did a climb and descend a on Mount Kilimanjaro on their mountain bikes. Right? So this was a mountain bike climb and the, the mission was totally self supported, meaning that they didn't have any porters to carry their bags or anything and they didn't, they abstained from using, uh, see it as old mine, which is diamox the medication that you take for altitude.

Speaker 4:          00:35:02       And so they didn't get altitude sickness. So the goal of what they're trying to do, Patrick Sweeney and we're bucket brush, the goal of the expedition was to raise $1 for every foot of climbing they did. So that amounted to a little over $19,000 for an organization called world bicycle relief. And Patrick had communicated with me prior to attempting this Mount Kilimanjaro bike ride and uh, and it kind of coached him a little bit and just talked about the Ketogenic Diet and how you do it and sent a number of emails. Um, just Google Patrick Sweeney bike ride and should bring you probably to this event and get, gives you more information on it. And the next question is from Lindsey Watkins in Z ass. I'd like to hear about any differences or considerations females, uh, need to have with the ketogenic diet. So what I've observed is that, uh, and this may even apply to our rodent models, uh, the transition into ketosis can be more difficult for females in general.

Speaker 4:          00:36:22       It seems that they're more variable in their responses. Reactive, I would say to low blood glucose levels, especially initially. And I would recommend that a female's trying this sort of ease into it, uh, before just going all out ketogenic. And so it was slow transition into a ketogenic diet, maybe dropping your carbohydrates if you're at 200 down to 150 and just do it in 50 gram increments and titrating it down. Another option would be the use of exogenous ketones. You know, when you go on a ketogenic diet, your brain goes through what I'd call glucose withdrawal effects and you might be able to fill that gap initially until your body starts making ketones. Upregulating the transport and utilization of ketones. You might be able to fill that gap by taking exogenous ketones are just simply using something like medium chain triglyceride. The C eight would be the kind of the most key to genic fat out there.

Speaker 4:          00:37:33       Another issue that females run into is that when a lot of women start this, they tend to start a ketogenic diet in a calorie deficit. So they go right into a calorie restricted ketogenic diet. So you have sort of the double whammy. You have, uh, no glucose, very little glucose getting to the brain and then calorie restriction on top of a radical shift in macro nutrient profile of their diet. And so that they're going to get a reactive response from that hypoglycemia. And, uh, in some women it can manifest itself in a strange ways from fainting to irritability to foggy headedness. Um, so the idea would be, my suggestion would be to keep your, your calories actually higher when you start QT tank diet. So you want a calorie surplus at least initially to help with the transition that's high in fat to do, not as hard for some people, especially in the fitness industry when they started to Jank by it, they have to be, uh, not afraid of eating fat.

Speaker 4:          00:38:54       So, you know, a hundred grams of fat per day. It is really not a lot of fat. Some getting upwards of about 200, 250, 300 even on some days. So for the average size female, you want to get at least a hundred grams of fat upwards to, you know, depending on your size and your output, maybe even up to 200 grams of fat. That would be my suggestions there to help with with females. Uh, now the hormonal changes that have been reported by some females following a ketogenic diet, suppression of thyroid. So I'm just looking through my emails here, different females. Uh, yeah, that seems to be sort of the, one of the major concerns, uh, when I probe a little deeper, the people that are getting, you know, a suppression of some of their hormones, they're exercising a minimum of two, sometimes four, six hours a day training for an event.

Speaker 4:          00:40:04       So the scenario that you have is you're transitioning your body to a new diet, high carb to low carb on top of calorie restriction. Do you do have an energy deficits that's caused by a restriction of calories, it appears. And also overtraining and overtraining is the fastest way to, uh, to really kick down your hormones. Uh, for males, manifest is low testosterone. For females it can manifest in many different ways. Most the thing that I see most is a reduction and t three. So the next question comes from Cammie Orion and she asks, can a female obtain a sub 10% body fat with a Ketogenic Diet? And if so, is there a daily Calorie threshold relative to my basal metabolic rate or other factors to reach that level of body fat? Also kind of another common question, women wanting to do the ketogenic diet to get as lean as possible.

Speaker 4:          00:41:14       Of course there's a lot of women in the fitness industry or fitness competitors that are using this approach. So at, so the first question is, I don't know what she's doing. If this is for a cosmetic reasons or if she is an athlete and wanting just perform as optimally as possible and thinks she gets needs to get below 10% body fat. So the first question I would have for her is why do you want to get below 10% body fat? So essential fat from my understanding in women is between eight and 12% so roughly 10% fat is needed for normal physiological hormonal and body functions and women. And I think it's important to keep above that and it's highly dependent upon the person. You know, some women are just naturally very lean and and other women have a higher set point. I would advise against trying to achieve a 10% body fat for performance unless you're genetically exceptionally lean to begin with.

Speaker 4:          00:42:25       When highly trained women at just 15% body fat, which is very lean for women, trains and diets to sub 10% body fat, they tend to get these hormonal issues. Uh, I would call it functional hypothalmic amenorrhea. So it even has a term, I believe, I just read an article on this and this is extremely common in the fitness industry and, and sometimes it's not easily, readily reversible. So if a ketogenic diet approach is use, it will be a greater fat turnover. And I would advise sort of like the last question against consuming less than 100 grams of fat. So some of the macros that were sent to me by women that were doing a ketogenic diet or like 60 grams of fat, upwards of 70 and 80 grams of fat, and they thought that was very high. So I would event, I would advise against consuming less than 100 grams fat, especially for a female athlete.

Speaker 4:          00:43:32       So consuming this high level of fat keeps your fat metabolism sort of optimized. And uh, it also, you know, is the source of, of ketones is making ketones. So probably the most experienced individuals on this topic achieving some 10% body fat would be female fitness competitors who routinely get below 10%. And this mentioned that they do report a lot of ministration irregularities for women who have successfully implemented a huge ANC diet and are aware of how to do so. This is some of the women that come to mind would be uh, Shannon, uh, Pena or Shannon Yorkton Pena from quest nutrition who is really a very experienced fitness competitor and just an overall great person around. And she has, um, been in a state of Ketosis I think for at least two years now. And quest nutrition is sort of developing testing. Ultimately there'll be marketing ketogenic diet food products.

Speaker 4:          00:44:49       They already have the quest MCT oil powder, which is fantastic. So the next question comes from Renee volt show. How does ketosis affect the Microbiota specifically that balance of for making ease to bacteria? So that's a great question and it's highly dependent upon the Diet that you're following, right? It's really, we're just at the cusp of understanding the gut microbiome. And there's, so relating this question to the key to genic diet and to give an answer on it, it is kind of difficult because there's many variations of the key to genic diet, right? The modified Atkins would be much more liberal in the amount of vegetables that you consume. What I've garnered just from reading what I can, uh, as far as studies that have been done that and talking with, uh, the scientists who were at this area of research is that you can train your gut microbiome to sort of be key to genic.

Speaker 4:          00:46:00       There's bacterial species in your gut. And I don't know, I have a list of them that actually thrive off fat. And these bacterial species tend to be the beneficial ones. They're very good for us. So that changes dramatically. You know, as when we change our diet, our gut microbiome also changes it's diet and we'll adjust the ratios of various species in the gut and a shift towards more bacterial species that thrive off fat. My general recommendations, uh, to optimize the microbiome and my knowledge is nowhere near that of, you know, researchers out there like Alessio Fasano. I'm just the chair of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Uh, he actually gave it fantastic IHMC lecture. So IHMC is the Institute for Human and machine cognition lecture on this topic. So I would recommend that listeners go to that lecture and uh, and look up, uh, Alesio Fasano. Uh, he does not study the ketogenic diet, but he's the leading expert and most knowledgeable person out there on the gut microbiome.

Speaker 4:          00:47:18       So for those following a ketogenic diet, things that I think could optimize the microbiome would be sort of the obvious things we always talk about or hear about would be probiotics. So green vegetables, preferably in a raw form, salads, things like asparagus, trying to think. Artichoke cinnamon is kind of prebiotic and probiotics. So lactobacillus Bifidus, there's a number of other bacteria out there that could be supplemented, don't have, I don't feel like the cute Jank diet would compromise the gut microbiome in any way, even in those individuals that limit their, their fiber. So I haven't heard that that's been a problem for them, but to prevent it from being a potential problem they use of these prebiotics and probiotics, fermented foods, things like sour cream are part of my diet and it's important to pick a sour cream that has a good compliment of a live cultures in it too.

Speaker 4:          00:48:31       Another thing that people have emailed me about, and I think Rhonda Patrick Actually mentioned this to me in passing and a couple people emailed me about the benefits of a supplement. It's called V s l three or VSL number three supplement. And I think that, uh, I haven't taken it myself, but just from the number of emails I got from people who have taken the supplement and they've taken it with a ketogenic diet, not that they had problems before the ketogenic diet, but they felt that it was a good compliment to the key to genic diet. The VSL three supplement is a probiotic supplement. It's used for people, people with Crohn's disease, Colitis, IBS, if you've used an antibiotic, which I just did, actually just finished a course of antibiotics. I got a strange bug bite and southeast Asia that sort of got infected in was like Murcia.

Speaker 4:          00:49:30       Uh, so I took a full course of antibiotics and use a probiotic supplement that was similar to VSL number three and had absolutely no issue with, uh, any kind of gut problems. And typically the last time I use an antibiotic was over 20 years ago and it completely destroyed my gut. And this time, uh, I took a probiotic supplement and had absolutely no problems. I don't know if I would have had problems if I didn't take the supplement, but it helped. And to a probiotic supplement, males would be good. I guess the lesson I learned and when you travel to, when you move someone to a different location and there for any sufficient amount of time, weeks, you, you're changing their gut microbiome. And I think that really needs to be studied. And I think in general we need to understand and we need to understand if the ketogenic diet disrupts the microbiome.

Speaker 4:          00:50:31       And we have to understand if things like travel, uh, can disrupt the microbiome. I imagine there's many things that are disruptors of the gut microbiome. And, uh, as we start to do research, I think these things will be more clear and, uh, things that can optimize the microbiome. And I think probably more importantly, even for our servicemen, and I knew the Department of Defense is interested in this. NASA judged in this obviously the space environment, it's probably not, uh, or putting guys and you know, moving them continuously across the globe is probably not the best way to optimize the gut microbiome. But, uh, there's also questions like things like artificial sweeteners, if we're drinking chlorinated water, antibiotics in our food, so many things to consider when we consider the gut microbiome. So, relating back, I went off on a tangent, but when it comes to the key to genic diet and the gut microbiome, we still have a lot to learn, but recommendations would be to have a diverse diet, uh, as much as possible.

Speaker 4:          00:51:42       And from my understanding, the bacteria, there's going to be a bacterial shift from carbohydrate thriving bacteria to bacterial species that thrive off fat. So, and my, uh, from my understanding, that's not a negative thing. So the next question comes from Mary to Kala, Adi and she asks, currently she's currently on the QT Jank Diet. However, she's confused, should I count my calories? I'm definitely restricting my carbs and increasing my fat intake. But keeping track of calories along with meal planning seems overwhelming if I don't worry about calories a, will I gain weight on the key to genic diet? So yes, of course you will. So there's that simple thermodynamics. If you, if you're putting in more calories into your body, then you're burning off those surplus calories are going to end up, uh, as stored body fat or manifests itself and sort of metabolic derangement over time. A number of times, uh, when people transition to a ketogenic diet, they will, you know, just kind of go crazy with some of the ketogenetic diet foods that are sort of indulgent.

Speaker 4:          00:53:02       And that would be things like butter or sour cream or you know, I can sit down with a bag of macadamia nuts or cashews and policy that off pretty quick. You know, that's a thousand plus calories. And this is really important to understand. The Keytruda, the energy density of the Ketogenic Diet is about twice that of a normal diet. So the amount, the volume of food that you're eating is smaller and it may seem like you're restricting. So then the volume of food that's on your plate will be much less than when you are not on a kid. Think Diet if you're keeping it ISO cohort. But chances are that over time that you'll, you'll inadvertently self restrict on the kid genic diet. So your blood glucose will be, there's far less fluctuations. You won't have these big postprandial excursions and your glucose that kickoff a surge of insulin that make you hypoglycemic, you know, a few hours later, uh, and make you kind of craving another Bolus of food again.

Speaker 4:          00:54:05       So that sort of whole cycle is eliminated and that was really eliminated in me. Probably one of the most practical advantages that I've been able to realize from the ketogenic diet is the, the control of hunger. And I think that has a huge carry over effect when it comes to being able to have control of your food intake. And not having your food intake sort of control you. So tracking is a very tedious process, but after you do it, after a certain point, you really don't have to. I can look at a piece of meat or oil or, uh, some green vegetables on my plate and just calculate the macros in my head really. And sometimes I'll just sort of wait it out and do it in double checks and times to make sure I'm right. But it's not a just nowadays it's after you follow the ketogenic diet, it's not a laborious process.

Speaker 4:          00:55:00       A one trick I've learned is that before dinner, which is my main meal of the day, I'll have a bowl of soup and it kind of soup that I have is usually broccoli cream soup or cream of mushroom soup. And instead of using whole dairy cream, I used concentrated coconut milk in place of the dairy cream. So, uh, and I thin it out so it's not super dense in calories. But after eating that, the amount of food that I want to consume this like cut in half. Uh, obviously that, that's a lot of calories too. But, uh, it's really super cute. Agentic so the next question comes from Dominic. A bushman is his name and he asks, how do you feel about the usual crappy food served at scientific conferences? And in parentheses, the smartest people seem to have the worst lifestyle. And he asked, what are my nutritional tricks?

Speaker 4:          00:55:58       Just survive attending these scientific conferences, which I'm about to jump on a plane now and go to a scientific conference in Europe. And I know that the foods are going to be very tempting over there. Um, in Budapest, actually a very good food over there. Luckily it's pretty key to Quito friendly. So I am not a purist when it comes to really fallen occasioning die. So if someone was to follow me around when I'm traveling and looking at what I'm getting off the menu, they probably wouldn't think I'm falling any kind of weird dietary patterns. Uh, I, you can almost always get a salad and you can almost always asked for extra butter, extra olive oil, uh, to put on the chicken beef or fish that it put on salad. Um, but generally a limit dairy protein when I'm home, but we'll indulge a little bit when I'm traveling.

Speaker 4:          00:57:01       Of course, cheeses, ketogenic. Um, so my, my recommendations for what I do, uh, as I've probably mentioned before is that my bags are packed now and I have a case of sardines in a case of oysters and they are packed in a extra virgin olive oil. Um, and I also go to a store near me and I buy bulk macadamia nuts and I think macadamia nuts are agree with me more than almonds and other types of nuts. Yeah. The conferences that I attend, they actually do have an appreciation for nutrition and they had fantastic array of food there. Other conferences, not so much, but I think, you know, it's, it's always people, people say, I can't follow the ketogenic diet because you know, on the businessperson I'm traveling all the time. It's just not possible for me to follow this diet. So what should I do?

Speaker 4:          00:57:58       I think it's actually easier. The ketogenic diet is far easier to follow if you are that kind of person who's on the move all the time. So that the food that you're consuming as much more energy dense, it's less weight, it's less things that you have to carry in your bag. Sardines and oysters and macadamia nuts take up a very small amount of weight, relatively speaking, and they have a really high energy density. So I can, uh, I tend not to like to take a check bag when I travel. Just scientific conferences, I can bring, uh, just my carry on and get, and if calculated this, I can get about 10,000 calories a, you know, a food on my carry on really easily and kept all my clothes for a week. So I couldn't do that if I wasn't on occasion and Diet. So. So the next question comes from Willie men, do stimulants eight and Ketosis.

Speaker 4:          00:59:02       And are there any particular stimulants that are good? Yeah, I think caffeine has a ton of research behind it. The military is a big fan of caffeine and the military has a really high bar in regards to, uh, in regards to their safety in regards to their efficacy and their incorporated into different food products. Like, uh, let me say the first trash, if first strike ration is something, you know, that they make up their in Natick on that feeding center there and it's basically just sugar and caffeine. So I think they need to change that. But caffeine has long been a staple in my diet, in the form of coffee. Um, right now the sipping on my coffee with MCT, the caffeine is just starting to kick in and, and I feel it and I feel good on caffeine and I don't feel any negative effects from it.

Speaker 4:          00:59:58       Over 200 milligrams of caffeine in me raises my blood sugar. A 100 milligrams seems to be the sweet spot. Uh, 200 milligrams of caffeine will cause a, an overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system maybe produce some anxiety and it tends to caffeine mobilizes free fatty acids from adipose, but it also kind of breaks down glycogen from the liver. If my glucose is sitting at 70 70 and I take 200 milligrams of caffeine, I'll see a bump up to 75, maybe even 80, uh, with that amount of caffeine. But a hundred milligrams seems to be a good sweet spot for me. Uh, there's caffeine is an appetite. Suppression has antioxidant effects in the form of coffee and have a couple of papers on my desk. I started reading about the, uh, the effects of coffee on liver function to an improvement in liver function. So another stimulant that I like to talk about, and that used a lot when I was younger, uh, is a federal and ephedrin hydrochloride.

Speaker 4:          01:01:07       I don't know if it's so available. Uh, it's, it's, we use it in the lab. We did experiments on pseudoephedrine and CNS, oxygen toxicity. You know, divers will pop lots of sudafed before they go diving because he went their sinuses to, to be clear. So they can equalize, right. If you're not, if you can't equalize, if you reserve a whole day to go diving and you're stuffed up and you can't equalize, then you're, you're out of luck. You know, you can't, you can't dye it. It's too painful and can be really dangerous. So ephedrine is actually pretty big in the diving community. I mean, I always took it before I went diving that we did a study showing that ephedrine can actually decrease latency to seizure, uh, at a particular level of hyperbaric oxygen that would stimulate the navy seal dive to say 130, two feet of seawater.

Speaker 4:          01:02:02       So you're, you're getting an overstimulation of the brain, uh, with, with a federal and uh, so I think with, with a high dose, so that's the thing. It's all relating to the dose. I think ephedrine is a great stimulant that could aid ketosis and it can help the release of fat from adipose and enhanced Beta oxidation of fat in the liver. Personally, I've seen that a federation can kick me into ketosis pretty fast. And ephedrine, caffeine stack, uh, it can kick on a fib in some people. So especially at the dose gets high, you know, 50 milligrams or more per day, but 25 milligram, those to the federation, uh, or less per day can elevate your mood, can cause pretty significant noticeable appetite suppression. And it's more of a, a psychological effect when it comes to getting a physiological response. 50 milligrams, 200 milligrams a day of ephedrine to get a really measurable increase in fat oxidation rates.

Speaker 4:          01:03:09       And that would give me side effects. So, and again, I don't, I don't even, I'm not sure if the veteran is to legal, so don't, don't take this as a recommendation, but I think 25 milligrams of ephedrine can, uh, improve your adherence to a nutritional protocol just simply by suppressing your appetite and giving you more energy, which you're going to go wanting to go workout, you're going to want to exercise longer. Um, and I would strongly advise against the use of amphetamines. I don't see they're addictive and generally people who take these things just have a bad outcome. They get addictive too, if not physiologically, psychologically. Uh, Modafinil is something. Uh, I've kind of been interested in testing and I've, but I've never taken it, but I've talked to people who have taken it. Um, I did get an email just yesterday actually from a woman who's been on Modafinil for over 15 years continuously, and she was able to get off of it.

Speaker 4:          01:04:16       And, well, she had a narcolepsy I think, but she was able to get off of it, uh, when she got into a state of nutritional ketosis and, um, and wrote me a kind of a really nice email along emails just saying that, uh, like this basically the key Jank die. It kind of saved her from this continuous abuse. She thought, you know, her use of Modafinil was sort of more or less like an abuse of it for, for many years. So it's approved for military use and before mission. And so in a state where sleep deprivation is unavoidable and you need to maintain cognitive resilience, the use of Modafinil can be a good idea. Tim Actually asked me to, uh, to address this question, can a vegetarian or Vegan follow a Ketogenic Diet? You can look up. Beth is you peck. Kenya is the lead dietician for the Charlie Foundation and it may not be posted on the website, but I know she works directly with patients.

Speaker 4:          01:05:23       Uh, and customize is a vegetarian or even Vegan ketogenic diet and many of her patients and uses, uh, to achieve ketosis shoes as higher amounts of MCT oil. So there's a couple websites too that I noticed who did a quick search online, Kido motive, k e t o m o t ivy and Keto Diet App are two websites that I find were really helpful in regards to listening to foods and listing the type of different recipes that are vegetarian or Vegan ketogenic diet could be sort of adjusted to how do we help people that are Vegan follicular Cenk Diet. And I think the solution, the main problem would be the protein. It's just hard to put together foods that have a compliment of essential amino acids. So you could just supplement with essential amino acids and that's one option. And the other option would be plant based protein isolates that are hemp.

Speaker 4:          01:06:33       You have, you have rice protein isolate, you have a pea protein isolate. No, 10 years ago there was plant protein but it had a lot of carbs in it. And nowadays you can get 30 grams of protein with like one or two or maybe three grams of carbs. And that completely fits in with uh, a Vegan ketogenic diet. So one of the products that kind of stood out and it just looking at the reviews and, and with the taste on the macro nutrient profile would be a product called Mrm veggie elite protein powder. And the chocolate Mocha is very good. So if you take this a Mrm veggie elite protein powder and mix it with coconut cream or what, what would be concentrated coconut milk throw and a half of avocado or in some MCT oil, the ca oil and do it. So the little mixture that I made up was 80% of the calories were from fat and 25% of the calories were from protein.

Speaker 4:          01:07:44       So it just titrate. It is just like one scoop of protein powder, I think. And a in 15% of the calories were from uh, carbohydrates and it was really pretty much fiber, a high fiber carbohydrates. So this gives a ratio of two to one if we go. So two would be fat. And the one would be a combination of carbs and protein. So if we're kind of relating it back to the classical Johns Hopkins ketogenic ratio ratios that they use and it's 900 calories and, and that was a really good kind of example of a pure Vegan and I posted that on my Facebook yesterday. So yeah, the Ketogenic Diet as possible, pretty easy for your vegetarian, a little more difficult for Vegan. Uh, I'm gonna work on this and maybe even work with a colleague of mine to write a book that covered this subject. And if someone hasn't kind of written book already, I see some, some blogs on online, but not a whole lot of resources out there for vegans that want to do with kitchen jank diet.

Speaker 4:          01:08:55       So many people. The next question, should I be concerned if the key to genic die increases my LDL or Ldl particle number? Uh, I'm a little, little bit concerned and I'm still learning about it. But if your LDL or Ldl p skyrockets and stays elevated after several months, uh, you might want to be concerned about it. So or just kind of be more, pay more attention to tracking certain aspects of your, your uh, your health, particularly your inflammation in your blood lipid levels. So the number of LDL particles maybe increase because you're also carrying more triglycerides before you get a lipid profile test done and you start looking at these numbers, make sure that you're rested, make sure you're not stressed, make sure you don't have any kind of infection, which will increase it. So what I think seeing with the kids, I think diet is that the LDL will go up and about 50% of the, the, the people who follow a ketogenic diet and especially at the calories are not restricted.

Speaker 4:          01:10:11       So if you're restricting calories on a ketogenic diet, which many people do that use the diet to manage for the management of epilepsy or cancer. Uh, even in that population with accused bank Dai is sort of calorie restricted. About 25% of them will sort of email back and say, well, my doctor is following me and this is going up. But a lot less if calories are restricted, uh, see this phenomenon. So I think it's important not to stressed out about it and to kind of look at the big picture. So the first book I had was the book from Johns Hopkins, uh, that was written by John Freeman and Erick Coats off and that described, you know, the classical kind of a dairy based four to one ratio, classical ketogenic diet. Uh, and that kind of shifted my numbers in interesting ways. My, my LDL went up a suited, my HDL doubled almost from like 50 to almost a hundred after about four to six months, I think.

Speaker 4:          01:11:16       So right now my HDLs 98 my, or right now I've, I've transitioned into what I call a supplemented modified Atkins or modified ketogenic diet and supplemented because they do take in c eight and I do take in some exemptions, ketones in the form of some of the products that are on the market. I'll talk about that a little bit more. Uh, so I'm, I'm using a supplemented modified ketogenic diet similar to the macronutrient ratios that's described, you know, on the, on the website, uh, Billy foundation website has a description, a good description of the modified ketogenic diet. My ratio is looking pretty good. My total cholesterol to HDL ratio is like 2.4 right now for my last blood test. So my total cholesterol is two 38 and my HDL is 98. Triglycerides range from 40 to 70. He's numbers are really similar to other people that have emailed me that were concerned.

Speaker 4:          01:12:23       And my inflammation marker of inflammation, CRP was really low. I'm going to do a whole cytokine ask. Say when I was on a high carb diet, my CRP was two, 2.4 a couple of times. Now it's like 0.2. So literally in the last three blood work, uh, that are looking, looking at now, uh, it ranged from 0.1 to 0.3. So when I was on a high carb diet, it's literally 10 times higher, rarely have gotten sick when I'm on the Ketogenic Diet. And I do think that it helps with immune function. And that's another area I could talk about. You know, we talk about the ketogenic diet being kind of a panacea for everything. It cures the common cold. A, uh, I have not had a cold, probably, maybe one cold in the last six years and I used to routinely get a cold every year at least once or twice a year.

Speaker 4:          01:13:25       So in the last five years, I have one cold that I could remember, but, uh, infection I did get, I traveled overseas, I believe it was to hung bureaus and I picked up some kind of stomach bug or probably a virus, I think. And um, and this really skyrocketed my LDL. So we talked a little bit about stress and infection, sort of increasing that and that, um, it was really surprising. I mean, it was like a, like off the charts. So it may have been sort of, you know, something wrong with the test, but, um, but I think something to consider that when you do get these tests done, you want to make sure your body is truly at baseline. Uh, when you're looking at the effects of the key to genic diet. So in general, I would not be concerned with an elevated LDL unless it was in other biomarkers.

Speaker 4:          01:14:27       We're, we're also out of whack. So the things to look at would be your triglycerides, your CRP, and if your HDL goes down, that's not a good thing. I think thing that I kind of focus on most is triglycerides. If your triglycerides are elevated, that means your body's just not adapting to the ketogenic diet. You know, some people's triglycerides are elevated even with their calories are restricted and that's a sign that, you know, you're just the Yank die. It's not for you. So you can't deny that and just, it's not a one size fits all diet. Do you find about a quarter to a third of people just, you know, have these abnormalities in their blood work that would indicate they're not adapting to the Diet? Maybe they could give it more time, but, um, it's some people, you know, I've given it three to four months and still have elevated triglycerides.

Speaker 4:          01:15:18       Pretty rare. And you know, most of the people that I talked to kind of thrive on a ketogenic diet, but you do have many people who just, you know, should not follow it. The next kind of branch of questions and I'm going to address would be exogenous ketones. This is a question that popped up recently and it comes from Carson row. Dozens of people have asked me this question, so I want to address it right up front. So is it dangerous to use ketone salts which are receiving WIC? So there's, uh, the ketone salts that are on the market. Now, from my understanding, uh, have a d and an l configuration. Dr. Richard Veech on, he was a ketone expert on bulletproof podcast and Dr Veech said that he would avoid ketone salts at all costs. Something about real verse mimicked molecules, et Cetera, is dom and others like Patrick Arnold have said, these are good and fine, uh, what gives, what's going on?

Speaker 4:          01:16:22       So, so Dr Veatch's, uh, I admire for like Dr Veech was kind of a mentor to me getting into this area and I think it was back in 2008 I didn't even know that. 2008 and nine I didn't know that exogenous ketones existed until I found some of his patents and patents that even predated his were from, um, Dr Henri Brunon grabber at Case Western. I think the first was like a Canadian patent in the early nineties on a ketone ester. So Dr Veech has been sort of a mentor to me in this process and making, helping me understand sort of the benefits of exotic gems, ketones. So his comments on they've Asprey's podcast and more recently been greenfield pause podcast have created a lot of confusion because his comments were not scientific fact, they were his opinion. And that's really important to keep in mind. Uh, also keep in mind that Dr Veech has a lot of intellectual property, sort of tied up in the, are an antitumor of the ketone ester.

Speaker 4:          01:17:34       So more specifically the r one, three butane dial, our Beta hydroxybutyrate Mano Esther would be like the means, sort of like this single Esther that he's focused on. Uh, so the, the appearance of these ketone salts and the salt, the Beta hydroxy butyrate is not, you know, completely tied up with sodium. So it's actually balanced across four different monovalent and divalent Ken Ions, right? You have a sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, um, that many of these products are using like the key gen x product. And I think, uh, prove that product. I'm not exactly sure what the blend is, but uh, but Dr Veech is kind of critical about the sodium content and about the, the uh, what he called the non-natural isomer that was found in there. It could, a new doctor beaches is working very hard to commercialize. He's been working hard for a decade or more to commercialize the mono ester of the, our Beta hydroxybutyrate.

Speaker 4:          01:18:49       So unrewarding grabber who is features colleague, they've actually published together, demonstrated the metabolism of [inaudible] ketones and a number of elegant studies. He actually used a, these are tracer based studies, were sort of labeled the carbons, the ketones and could see where they go. And it was clear from the science that the, the s an antitumor just simply goes, gets broken down to a cdot Kobe and can even enter, convert back to buy sort of further elevating levels of Acetol coa that can actually kind of feed back into the biosynthesis of the our Beta hydroxybutyrate. And uh, there's a couple of Nice papers that kind of show that. The first one, uh, the one that I'm thinking about looked at the r and the s one three butane dial metabolism in the liver of rats. There's no data to support. Dr Veech is claim that the ketone salts that are on the market are dangerous or ineffective and that would include Quito sports.

Speaker 4:          01:20:03       Kido CAINA prove its product. Uh, k o, uh, you have the key gen x product is also using the rear simic salt forever green has product. He tonics are key. Topia so many emails, dozens, if not hundreds of emails I've gotten from it, from this, the people that were concerned. Uh, and it's, it's kind of easy. The doctor of each is a very esteemed kind of researcher and I think he firmly believes that the are an antitumor is um, sort of the way to go when it comes to exogenous ketones. And I did too. I think our lab, actually, the first ketone ester that we tested for CNS oxygen toxicity was the one three butane dial, uh, uh, Beta hydroxybutyrate mono ester and the RN and tumor. And it didn't prevent oxygen toxicity seizures, so elevated pretty much exclusively Beta hydroxybutyrate. And um, I was going to give up on the project and then I discovered an earlier patent by Henri burning grabber that had a one three butane dial combined with a cdot acetate.

Speaker 4:          01:21:17       And that to me it made perfect sense, right? Because when you consume it, the it hydrolyzes in your gut. So you released to Acetoacetate and that's one of the ketones at the body uses. And then the one three butane dial, um, goes to the liver and gets broken down completely to Beta hydroxybutyrate. And the pharmacokinetics are beautiful. You get a kind of a one to one ratio of Beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate and the liver. And it was in that particular ketone Ester gave remarkable neuroprotection against CNS oxygen toxicity. So that was like the second ketone Ester that we tested a Patrick Arnold's help me synthesize it. And once we got the synthesis formula and unrewarding grabber was very kind to just give it to me in and tell us how to do it too. And that was rare. Simic so that was received Mc one three butane dial, which breaks down to the, the two enantiomers of Beta hydroxybutyrate.

Speaker 4:          01:22:17       So it was remarkably effective in our hands. So I, I knew there was more to the story than this. Um, I'm also, you know, served with Dr Veech on various workshops and can say that he's very, uh, he's very opinionated when it comes to the key to genic diet and he thinks to diet is sort of a horrible diet and the high fat is very dangerous. And, uh, and we know that that's not the case, you know, and there's not a whole lot of science to back up his claim. But I think there's one paper in kids in Johns Hopkins that followed the four to one sort of classical key to genic diet. And I think many of the kids were put on a product called Keto cow, which is like hydrogenated vegetable oils and things like that. And they had an elevated triglycerides. Not very surprising.

Speaker 4:          01:23:12       Right. Uh, so I think when we talk about the ketogenic diet, it's, it's really important to acknowledge, and most people don't acknowledge this in the medical community that the Diet, there's many, many versions of the Diet and we still, we have very little research. We still need to determine the optimal key to genic diet, uh, in regards to the fatty acid profile. So we know we need it. A much greater omega three to Omega six ratio is going to be really important. The, the level of mono unsaturated fats for saturated. Um, I'll say that no scientist when it relates to the, the ketone salts, no scientists are toxicologists that I'm aware of would find to be just comments to be true that the receive, make salts are dangerous in any way, unless of course they're consumed at really high amounts. As we know, water is toxic in high amounts.

Speaker 4:          01:24:13       All things are dangerous. Caffeine of course I talked about a Tylenol, we'll quickly kill you. Uh, if you take too much of it. Um, many studies actually show, there's clinical studies that actually show these receiving salts are very safe in high doses, even in kids given pure sodium Beta hydroxybutyrate over periods of years. And that actually leads me to the next question that was asked by Emily bent and she asked what's dawn's advice for fatty acid oxidation disorders like mad or VLC add a medium chain are very long chain Acetol coa dehydrogenase deficiency. So mad, uh, is short for multiple esal Kobe dehydrogenase deficiency. And since being added two new gorn screenings, diagnosis have increased massively. So there's a lot of kids, more kids being diagnosed. So the complications of this particular disorder can involve and acidosis the hypoglycemia. Other symptoms such as general weakness, uh, enlargement of the liver, enlargement of the heart is really a problem.

Speaker 4:          01:25:38       So essentially what this disorder, multiple ACL co a dehydrogenase deficiency is, is a mitochondrial inefficiency. And it's interesting if you just go to pub med and type in mad m a d d and ketones, you get a, this is one just one of the disorders that can be effectively treated with receipt. Mick Beta hydroxybutyrate salts and there's a number of studies. Um, I'm just going to pub med now. First study pops up, highly efficient ketone body treatment and multiple acyl coa dehydrogenase deficiency related leukodystrophy. So, and that was published in pediatric research. So that was using the ketone salts essentially that are on the market, at least the sodium [inaudible], sodium Beta hydroxybutyrate assaults and these kids, it's a nice description, a summary of that. Uh, another study by a different investigator, a favorable outcome after physiological dose of Sodium d l three hydroxybutyrate and severe Matt.

Speaker 4:          01:26:56       So sodium receive Mech, Beta hydroxy butyrate was given. And this can be given in an oral dose or it can be given ivy in very high doses and no, No side effects from this. The dose that you need to get a miserable boost in blood key tones is not giving you a dangerous dose of sodium. So that needs to be acknowledged. And I think that was touched upon in Dr Veech has sort of talk to that. There's no way I think quote unquote, he said there's no way that these ketone salts could even increase ketones even 0.1 or 0.2 millimolar. But that's not the case. We know that we can get levels into the one to $2 million range if you take enough. And I think as the technology sort of evolves and we're creating various types of Beta hydroxybutyrate salts from monovalent and divalent con cannons in addition to alkaline amino acids will combine nicely with Beta hydroxybutyrate and that's another avenue.

Speaker 4:          01:28:03       So you can kind of envision a blend of Beta hydroxy buttery spread across, you know, monovalent divalent, cad ions and alkaline amino acids like lysine and arginine history, histamine, a stitch or lean. These are all, these are all combined pretty nicely with the Beta hydroxy butyrate. So another study actually comes from the Lancet shows DL, three hydroxy butyrate. So receive Beta hydroxybutyrate treatment as a sodium salt, uh, and treatment of multiple ACL Kobe dehydrogenase deficiency. So it's a really nice study describing the use of uh, this exogenous ketone and several patients that have this disorder. And it was really, um, highly effective in treating that. So, so in short, the ketone salts, there were simic Beta hydroxybutyrate salts are not dangerous and they're definitely not ineffective or research needs to be done on all forms of exogenous ketone salts and also, uh, exogenous ketone esters. So a lot of work has already been done.

Speaker 4:          01:29:22       You know, one could be more confident in, you know, the medical applications of this and even potential performance applications because when they're consumed, the liver function and kidney function is normal, has been shown even with really high doses. So the next question is Jeff Urbane, is he truly behind? Involved in Ketogenics? The website is kind of sketchy and the product itself has a surprising number of carbs, not sugars, carbs, but obviously, uh, but still, so he's asking am I behind? He genex are involved in key genex. The key genics formula or product on the market uses the exonerees ketone product is a great product. I use it myself. I used it yesterday. Sometimes I rotate, you know, different things. If I'm testing a, it uses a ketone formula, a Beta hydroxybutyrate medium chain triglyceride blend that we sort of developed and tested initially in the lab.

Speaker 4:          01:30:31       And we found, we found that if you just take ketone salts and at the time these were sort of the liquid sodium potassium salts, uh, founding Keto force, uh, we weren't really able to get an elevation of blood ketones. That was really impressive. And before we started getting some GI discomfort and diarrhea, so, uh, we started tweaking and playing around with different formulas and found that if we took medium change triglycerides and blended it together, we got a formula that the fat essentially was, was functioning like a controlled delivery system. So instead of, uh, the rapid peak was a little less rapid but kept going up peak, they're around 60 to 90 minutes and then extended out in additional hour or two beyond just taking the ketone salts. So when we blended it with MCT, it allowed if the sustainment of blood ketones over time, which is kind of the big thing.

Speaker 4:          01:31:34       And that's why, you know, with the kids that were administered a sodium Beta hydroxybutyrate, they were given ivy formulas, um, the Gi sometimes to tolerate it. And when you bowl a sit in, eh, the blood levels shoot up and quickly come down fat and fiber and protein, even fat as especially is a good sort of controlled delivery system. And there's ways to even package that and formulate it to optimize that. Uh, so the key gen x product is not my product, but they incorporate a patented formula that we developed. And, uh, I don't own the patent. The university owns the patents. So Keith genics, as you know, his, his work with our university to get the rights to, so I used the product. Uh, I don't endorse the product. If I used, I need to use 1.5 packets blood into the one millimolar range. Uh, when you take it, you definitely feel it.

Speaker 4:          01:32:35       You don't want to take it after like three or four in the afternoon, but you take it early in the afternoon. I'll probably take it around lunchtime one or two. The energy focus you feel is definitely real. I blood work, uh, when I've taken it continuously to a fairly high dose, looked really good markers of inflammation, like almost nondetectable. Uh, my blood lipid profile is probably the best it's ever been since I've been key to genic. Uh, the carbs in there, very minimal. You know, what I look at is the glycemic response to a dose and it's pretty much flat lined in me. So there's no vice simic response and a nice elevation and Beta hydroxybutyrate. Next question. Jimmy Homan key. Genics Quito, s Pruvit Keto cream. Is he affiliated with these, uh, like they claim, if not, does he recommend them? So I've tried all the exogenous ketone products on the market and something I like to do, uh, like to figure out, you know, what formulas are going to be optimal, uh, from the standpoint of using these therapeutically too.

Speaker 4:          01:33:51       So I feel like I'm kind of at the forefront of understanding what blends of Ketone esters of ketone salts, whether it be mineral salts and amino acid salts and other things. The Fun comes in for me is when you start combining these things together and that's what we're doing now and we're doing mostly a lot of pharmacokinetics and toxicology work. They understand like what would be the optimal formula of blend? Like is it, you know, five different types of salts with, you know, to Esther's in a different ratio. Like these are with some, uh, c eight oil to sort of increased and sustained blood ketones over time. Like these are the questions that we're asking and some of the things that we're testing now, I think the Pruvit product tastes really good. It's smooth and creamy and it has a higher concentration of sodium in much higher.

Speaker 4:          01:34:50       And maybe that's why it's because kind of like the salty, creamy taste I love. I kind of ran out of it. I miss it. I using it for a while and they ran out. So, uh, right now I'm using the key genics product, which is really sort of pretty powerful product as far as the uh, effects that I feel from it. So the key genics product instead of kind of a creamy taste, it has more of a Tangy, bitter taste. It's got some green tea extract. So the caffeine, it does give you a little bit of a caffeine boost, maybe about 80 to a hundred milligrams of caffeine. And I think that's from the green tea extract. It might be some bitter orange in there. There's a couple thermogenic ingredients in there that uh, you feel after you take the product cause he feel a little bit warm for evergreen, makes the, uh, key tonics product.

Speaker 4:          01:35:42       It tastes really good. And I think it also gives a, has caffeine in the form of green tea too. It's pretty similar to the key genics product. Uh, just has a different taste to keep in mind that the, the early versions of these products were like horrible. This is going back. Uh, and I used to blend them, actually. I blended, uh, a mixture out and gave it to my friend Peter Attia. And Peter wrote a nice, kind of a great summary of his experience with using jet fuel. Uh, he's tested a lot of these things that ketone esters in the ketone salts and did the study on the bike where he looked at oxygen consumption at a fixed power output, clamped it at 180 watts and then look the oxygen consumption before, uh, exogenous ketones. And after, and at the time Peter was doing a, a sort of a modified ketogenic approach.

Speaker 4:          01:36:42       So he was in a state of mild nutritional Ketosis, like 0.6, 0.7, and he would take, he took the ketone salts and it shot him up about one to two millimolar and, uh, kind of dosed him up with a blend that I knew would be approaching the, his Gi tolerability. And I think he did okay. Didn't have any, they didn't throw up or have diarrhea from my understanding. And uh, they really cranked it out on the bike and showed that he was able to maintain the same power output and consume less oxygen, like a five to 8% less oxygen, which is tremendous. We need to go and reproduce that study. The next question comes from Gavin Williams. What are his goto products, his MCT, powders, oils, ketone salts, anything else? Uh, kind of covered this. So I test whatever the company sent me. I love to test things.

Speaker 4:          01:37:38       I tend, that's why I don't take a whole lot of supplements because I like to keep a unaltered, I guess you could say. So I can confidently test these things and, and, and if I'm measuring various blood, whether it be comprehensive blood work or blood glucose, ketones, I know it's coming from that product. I really enjoy testing to prove that product and uh, told you, you know, I miss it now, that amount of it. So they're listening. They could send me some police. Uh, the key gen x product is great. So I have a, and that they've, I think they're on like version two or three of that now. The one of the first times I tried, the last formula they gave me, I took the product at like 7:00 PM and kind of kept me up a little bit later than I wanted to. Uh, another product that's been, that's really a goto product and I, and I keep it, you know, at my house at work and it's in my suitcase when I travel is to quest MCT oil powder and the quest coconut powder is a big staple of mine.

Speaker 4:          01:38:45       Uh, I've talked about sort of the foods that I've consumed before the wild planet, Sardines, sardines are uh, uh, a much more sustainable then say like tuna or some of the larger fish out there that these predatory fish also, uh, through bioaccumulation can accumulate toxins like mercury and other heavy metals. So I'm so non detectable levels of the things that are of concern like mercury and other, other, uh, PCBs and other things that are out there. So that's important, especially if you're giving your fish to your young kids or the oysters are also one of my goto food through the crown. Prince Oysters are a really good brand that I like. Lately there was a bone broth that I use. It's a little pricey, but the company kindly sent me a sample, the test and it's called fire and kettle bone broth. And uh, I use it maybe like twice a week.

Speaker 4:          01:39:55       I'll make soup out of it and I think it's fantastic. I think it's super high quality. Another goto product would be a citation, makes a product called extend perform, which is branch chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and failing in a two to one to one combination. Lucien being the predominant, uh, uh, branch chain amino acid in the formula that, uh, and we know that loose scenes, a powerful activator of m tour, uh, which is a good thing. Activating and tore and skeletal muscle is really important. So intro workout. So I used the product preworkout and intro workout. I've used the product a little bit during fast and I think, uh, it could be an effective tool for mitigating some of the muscle loss that can accompany a, uh, a longer short term fast, if that makes sense. So like five days or seven days. So the extent performed product also has a mushroom blend in it and I have to go and look to see, uh, I actually researched all the mushrooms, but they're kind of leaving me exactly which, which blend it has in it.

Speaker 4:          01:41:14       But the mushroom blend that's in there has been proven to have a pretty, pretty impressive, uh, data behind it as far as enhancing, uh, performance and for lowering inflammation to, uh, the other supplements I take sort of like staple things would be if, uh, if I'm not getting a lot of sun, a d three, so 5,000, I use sort of, if I'm not getting sun on days and I'm outside all day, I take, uh, 1000, uh, I use, so don't, you don't, you don't want to get too much d three. So there's a bell shaped curve and the too much d three will give you the same symptoms of a too little vitamin D. So Melatonin is something that I take. It's part of, uh, the sleep cocktail I will take, I use it when I cross time zones, uh, and I'll use up to 10 milligrams.

Speaker 4:          01:42:16       But for daily use I will use like anywhere between one to three or five milligrams, typically like three milligrams I think is what I have. Um, so I debit known is a, another product that I take a, I take it when, uh, I fly actually or before hard exercise. It's the, I think of I Devin own is kind of the drug version of coenzyme Q 10. It's more absorbable, it gets to the Mitochondria easier. It's like a mitochondrial antioxidant and it's also the, it's, it's a germ rug. It's almost considered a drug for the management of something called Friedrich's Ataxia. And I think in kids that take I and own it actually helps him out a lot. I'm not sure if you know, Friedrich's Ataxia is really a tough disorder, but I know from what I knew and just talking with, uh, the far foundation, so I know a family and a child with Friedrich's Ataxia and uh, from the research indicates that I Devin, Oh and prevent cardiomyopathy or a hypertrophy.

Speaker 4:          01:43:30       So it just showing it has a real effect. So just enhancing cardiac function, uh, has been, has been shown with I Devin know. And so, um, I think it, it's available. It used to be kind of hard to find because it was reclassified as a drug, but I think it's, I know it's available on smart powders.com you can find it, which a lot of really interesting things there. A magnesium is a supplement I take daily magnesium citrate, magnesium chloride and magnesium glycinate. I tried them all and they all impacted my blood magnesium levels in a good way. So when I started the Ketogenic Diet, I started getting cramps. So one thing that popped out in my blood work is that my magnesium was at the low end of normal. And now that I'm supplementing now I'm like a mid to high normal and I don't get any cramps.

Speaker 4:          01:44:21       If I exercise more, I definitely deplete my magnesium. So, um, you know, if you're exercising, just be sure that you're getting adequate magnesium. Uh, on a QT Jank died. I think you're, you're utilizing more excluding more magnesium and a, if my goat, if I had one go to magnesium, it would be this magnesium citrate powder that I have. So I, I've looked at things like a Gabba a before sleep, sometimes Finny Butte, which is ventilated Gabba Gabba that has a, a fennel ring attached to it and makes it permeable to the blood brain barrier and makes it more lipophyllic. And when you take Finny Butte, you feel it. I feel it. You feel much more calm. You get, I get really deep, the most scary dreams when I take take fenny Butte. Uh, it has a pretty good calming effect. So I will use Finny Butte maybe two or three times a month if that, you tend to use it.

Speaker 4:          01:45:21       When I'm travel across time zones, I'll take a finny Butte melatonin stack before I get to bed. Next question. Leo. Fouls on our exotic us ketones. I kido Kina only useful in a state of ketosis or would they benefit someone who is not keto adapted, put differently? Can ketones enter the TCA cycle? I'll sit in as the Kreb cycle when glucose is still available to the cell or will the body preferentially use glucose nullifying the effect of the ketones. So ketones can be readily transported into tissues as fuel. If glucose is low or high and I think the body will sort of use what's available. So if the glucose is low, it'll use a greater proportion of ketones for energy. And it's also, there's some tissue specificity in regards to the mono carboxylic acid transporter and there's transporters one, two, three and four and these have sort of a different tissue distributions.

Speaker 4:          01:46:33       Breen is pretty high and MCT two and three I believe the liver, you know, doesn't use good liver. The ketone producer but doesn't use ketones for fuel and skeletal muscles kind of like in between. So Sunday at eight indicates that there may be enhance glucose uptake and utilization in the presence of ketones. And I know Dr Veech and, and others believe that ketones influence influence sensitivity. And it does it through a number of mechanisms. And I think through, through altering redox chemistry, it can do two things. It can enhance the sensitivity of the insulin receptor to the likened insulin. And it can also cause a sort of a translocation of the receptor to the membrane. And so there's more sort of receptors that are available. And I think, you know, I was a little has into believe some of that, but our new data we recently published shows that as ketones go up, and this is giving a bolus of exogenous ketones to an animal that to eating a high carbohydrate standard rat Chow, glucose goes down.

Speaker 4:          01:47:55       And you know, we don't know why that's happening, but that could be part of the effect could be enhanced with Pcos disposal through enhancement of insulin sensitivity and um, and other things that we don't fully understand. And I think some of the data that we'll be collecting that may shed light on this is looking at the metabolomic global metabolomic profile of the liver, you know, within without exogenous ketones and how that's influencing liver metabolism. So an alternative explanation could be a decrease in hepatic gluconeogenesis. So I think it's, it may be Bamyan number of things kind of working together. So Adam Rock Horst has a question, can exogenous ketones combined with a low carb diet, uh, in parentheses, but not a ketogenic diet, still give some or all the benefits of a strict ketogenic diet. The experiments that we run with exogenous ketones, most of them excluding the one cancer experiment when we combined the key to genic diet with ketone ester.

Speaker 4:          01:49:06       So our experiments are typically run using exogenous ketones given to animals eating a standard high carb rodent child. So I would say yes to this and I would say yes because our first experiment originally what I wanted to do was give ketone esters for one week and dive rats down to five atmospheres of oxygen, which is 132 feet of seawater. And we know that they have a seizure in about 10 minutes and then look at that latency to seizure. You know, after talking with a number of experts and Dr Veech too thought the ketones work, but a number of the experts are convincing me that you needed to be keto adapted to get the benefits of exhaustion is ketones that the ticket, the optimal benefits, I'll say, you know, and I thought they were right cause we actually try doctor beaches, Esther, uh, or version of the Ester, the Mono Ester of Beta hydroxybutyrate and it didn't prevent oxygen toxicity seizures.

Speaker 4:          01:50:10       So I was more inclined to believe at least an acute post. I was more inclined to believe that you needed continuous kind of longterm dosing to get the brain to switch over. But then we tried the a one three butane dial, a cdot acetate diaster, which rapidly elevated Beta hydroxybutyrate and a COO acid hay. And that a single dose, 30 minutes prior to a five atmosphere dive gave like 600% neuro protection or delay the latency to seizure from 10 minutes to like over an hour, which was pretty much more effective than any anticonvulsant drug like ever tested. So, and that was just simply feeding an animal that's eating a high carb diet, feeding him, titrating in the dosage just enough to elevate blood ketones to a level of ketosis on par with a person fasting for one week. So you had fasting level, prolonged fasting level ketosis in 30 minutes.

Speaker 4:          01:51:19       And unlike drugs where you get like a variety of effects, like it worked in this animal that not the animal, like every single animal we tested when we saw this remarkable neuro protection with the ketone esters. So, so that was, it was not my original hypothesis that it would work this way, but it, but it did. I guess Dr Veech was right. Uh, not right about the Esther. I think we needed, we needed not only Beta hydroxybutyrate, we needed to see to acetate and his particular Esther did not elevate that. I think Beta hydroxybutyrate elevating that would for his, he's looking at um, exercise performance and cognitive benefits too. And I think it would work, you know, Beta hydroxybutyrate alone would probably work remarkably well for that. But when it comes to mitigating oxygen toxicity seizures and also other seizures, the animal models, it's, it's very clear that you need to have an elevation of a COO acetate and that spontaneously decarboxylates to ask the town and we know that can open potassium channels in hyperpolarize the resting membrane potential and mitigate some of the glutamate excited toxicity that's thought to be involved in, in seizure genesis.

Speaker 4:          01:52:36       So, and you don't get that we just Beta hydroxybutyrate ester. So answer your question. Yeah, I think you can get ketones. I went off on a tangent and you, she really talking about combining exogenous ketones to a low carb diet. Can you get the benefits? Uh, absolutely. I think, I think you can do that even on a moderate carb diet. It can probably get the benefits, but there are so many benefits to a low carb diet and of itself that we know about. I think it just makes sense to use it with some kind of carbohydrate restriction. It is really important and if you look at our cancer study, we did the Ketogenic Diet and hyperbaric oxygen and that had a remarkable effect at prolonging survival and a model advanced metastatic cancer. And uh, and when we combine the Ketogenic Diet with hyperbaric oxygen and we combine to ketone supplementation, we had a really significant increase in survival and suppression of tumor growth and also medistatus.

Speaker 2:          01:53:53       Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a few more things before you take off. Number one, this is five bullet Friday. Do you want to get a short email from me? Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday? That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering over the week. That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered. It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've somehow dug up in the uh, the world of the esoteric as I do. It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my close friends for instance, and it's very short. It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

Speaker 2:          01:54:41       So if you want to receive that, check it out. Just go to a four hour work week.com that's four hour workweek.com all spelled out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very next one and if you sign up, I hope you enjoy it. This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic. I reached out to these Finnish entrepreneurs after a very talented acrobat, introduced me to one of their products, which blew my mind and the best way possible it is mushroom coffee. What on earth is this? Well, it includes Chaga mushroom, very powerful antioxidant, considered a super food. I was introduced to Chaga by Laird Hamilton, the King of Big Wave Surfing of all things and it includes another mushroom that is considered a no tropic, a smart drug and this is lion's mane in the entire packet. You just add it to hot water, tastes like coffee.

Speaker 2:          01:55:31       There is only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so less than half what you would find in a cup of coffee. So you, I do not get any jitters. I did not get any acid reflux or any type of stomach burn and it put me on fire for an entire day and I only had half of the packet. So this stuff is really amazing. People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement right now. This is the answer. So it is legal. It will not give you visuals.

Speaker 2:          01:56:33       You may have heard coach summer on the podcast to design the program, former national team coach for men's gymnastics. I'm not easily impressed and I've just been completely blown away by the sophistication of his programming and the elegance of his programming. I've been using gymnastic bodies for just a few months now and I feel more flexible, stronger, and younger than I have in years, and it sounds cheesy to hear myself say that, but it's true.
