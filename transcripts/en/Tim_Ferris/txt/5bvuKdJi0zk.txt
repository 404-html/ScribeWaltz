Speaker 1:          00:11          Tim morgan with the show. So you sent me a photograph on route or I guess just after arriving here and uh, you had a gian open and blood running down your face. Yeah. And where were you and what happened? Oh, I was not but four miles away from here and we just had the IBJ GGF world Jujitsu competition this weekend. And so last week we are doing very sports, Jujitsu training, getting people ready for the tournament. Um, I hate sports, Jujitsu. Um, I, I think Sports Jujitsu is the abomination to what martial arts is where like it takes something that's really cool and then they make it sporty, you know, it's like, oh, let's give some points to do some stupid things. And then people that, you know, the mutation, the evolve, like how evolves it be it like it loses its balls and I don't like things that had balls and then no longer have balls.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Kind of like the emasculated man. And that's what Jujitsu, it's almost become like Jujitsu to me is like, I'm going to get in mount or site control. I'm a pick your face up, I'm a smash it into this cement and then I'm gonna push your eyes out and then my bite your cheek off. That's Jujitsu to me cause they, you know that, that's the origin of it. The gentle art. Yes. The gentle locked. Um, and so today we did combat. You did too. So just to have a total paradigm shift just to make people's heads explode instead of like talking about, you know, getting four points for back controller, getting four points from mount or getting a take down and get to, it's like find a place that you can hold somebody down and then hit them. That's it. I was watching a video in prep for this.

Speaker 1:          01:52          I think it was from sheepdog response. She can, we can talk about in a second. But you, you had control on someone. You're right on top of them. They're all turtled up on the ground and you sort of wiped your fingers on their eyes and you're like, okay. Yeah, I just took your eyes up. So something along the lines of like old man Jiu Jitsu leads to all men time or something like that. But there's just a huge, such a huge Delta between the two. I think you have to look at the origin of what things are and then the abomination of what they become. You know, what you, you, you see as he's really, the genesis of a martial art was they had to learn how to protect themselves or they didn't have weapons, so they had to create something to fight the dictators that we're killing them.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Or there were, um, the Samurai that were really good with swords. So then the ninjas came along to use stealth because if you fight a Ninja head on, you're going to die. So let's create something new. Um, and then over time that loses what it is, you know, like you have to be able to competitively practice something to get good at it. So then you can implement sport and that would, that's what kind of differentiates a lot of these different Jujitsu. You're all, a lot of these different martial arts, uh, are just really tiny little rules. Like, what's the difference between judo and Jujitsu and Jujitsu and Greco Roman wrestling and Greco Roman wrestling, freestyle wrestling and collegiate wrestling. And so they're very small differences. That's to make them a sport. But if you take those rules away, you get back to what the martial art was, which was how to fight for your life and not get murdered, you know?

Speaker 1:          03:25          Yeah. And I think, I think it's also a misleading when people think of the term martial art and they turned it into some type of performance art daily body paint. And I'm like, start putting my chest all over this window. I'm like, I'm doing martial arts. And it's actually when you go back to the translation from say whether it's like Woo Shu in Chinese or any of these like boot Jujitsu in Japanese. I used to live in Japan. It's actually Marshall Technique that then got translated to art. So it's, it's lost. It's uh, some of its impact through a mistranslation in a sense. And when I look at your career, I saw you fight live and uh, some early Strikeforce events when I was living in San Jose. And then became fascinated by your military career, which we'll talk about. It seems like you're very good at game time decisions and acting under pressure.

Speaker 1:          04:22          So I want to talk about training though for a second. Could you talk about what you say to yourself when you train? And at least my understanding is it begins with hurry up. Got Dot. Yeah. Hurry up and fail. Um, funny enough as I send you that picture of me dripping blood out of my face and like I've blood already clotted in my mouth, you know, and like, you know, like he gets like stuck as it starts. Congealing you know, it turns into that gelatin up inside of the kind of weird cavities inside of your nose. Um, so if you like cough, like chunk, start flying. Um, as I was trying to explain what it means to train, so somebody came up to me at the end of practice today and they're like, man, I keep, I'm getting tired or I keep quitting. Or I had a couple of people that just tapped from the position that I was in or that they were in.

Speaker 1:          05:11          And, uh, so hurry up and fail is this mantra of I want to get to the breaking point of where I can't go on any longer and I want to stay there because then the next time I train that that wall has moved. I mean ever so slightly, but it's, it's moved. So then the next time I can go in and I can get to that point as far as hard and as fast I can and I can stay there. So the next time it's gonna move and repeat until finally, if you look back months later, you've progressed so far today as, as that Onnit academy and we did the exact same workout we did two months ago, same weight and what two months ago left us on the ground like almost heaving in, in nauseous, couldn't stand about to throw up today we blew through effortlessly and Juan Shane and I looked at each other like w w, w what are, what are we supposed to do right now because we have an extra 16 minutes.

Speaker 1:          06:07          Cause we went through it so fast. So in two months there was a such a clear change of looking back and seeing like, man, I got bigger, I got faster, I got stronger, and I ultimately got harder to kill. So in Jujitsu it's the exact same. You you rush to that breaking point. And by no means do I want to say someone's going to break me because if somebody can break me, I welcome it. Like bring it. I see I go all over the world to try and find people that can do that. So I can find that point where I'm going to fail and then the next time I do it, it's going to move. You know? So when you then fast forward to an example of an environment which the stakes are a little higher. So I'd love to talk about hydro. Gracie started with an r for the use of non Brazilians out there.

Speaker 1:          06:53          It's chatting with a mutual acquaintance. Actually before we get to mutual acquaintance, I owe credit to the person who made the introduction, who is Donald [inaudible], who I went to college with, who used to be a super lightweight blue belt that I could throw around because of judo. Now I can no longer throw him around because he's a black belt and co owner of a school, which is where you were training today. What's the name of the school and grace? Who am I to, I think it's, um, it's where the Gracie is, is it's in his lineage. Show him coiler Gracie black belt. But Donald Parks and Paula Brendao are the ones that run the school. And you know, it is a shark tank of passionate people that love family and martial arts. And that's, uh, that's what that place is. And for those of you don't want staph infections.
