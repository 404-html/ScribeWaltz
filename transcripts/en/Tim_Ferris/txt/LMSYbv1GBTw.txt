Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. No one else would pose a question. I'm a cybernetic organism living.

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       This episode is brought to you by Peloton, which I've been using probably for about a year now. Peloton is a cutting edge indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into your home. You can also do on demand, which is what I do. We'll come back to that so you don't have to worry about fitting classes into a busy schedule or making it to a studio or gym with a hectic or unpredictable commute. I, for instance, have a Peloton bike right in my master bedroom at home and it's one of the first things I do. Many mornings I wake up and meditate for a bit. Then I knock out a short 20 minute ride in my undies. Hard to do that at the gym, take a shower and I'm in higher gear for the rest of the day. It's really convenient and has become something that I look forward to.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       So you have a lot of options for one if you'd like, you can ride live with thousands of other writers across the country on an interactive leaderboard to keep you motivated. There are also up to 14 new classes added everyday with more than 8,000 classes on demand and you can pick based on length, 45 minutes, 20 minutes, whatever music, hip hop, rock and roll or say low impact versus high intensity or interval. You can pick the class structure and style that works for you and in my case I quite like Matt Wilbur's and I tend to do on demand and listened to a lot of and watch many of the same classes over and over, but I'm kind of promiscuous and also enjoy classes from a lot of the other instructors. They have Peloton and amazing roster of incredible instructors in New York City with a whole range of styles and personalities so you can find what you're in the mood for.

Speaker 2:          00:01:50       You also get real time metrics that you can use to track your performance over time and that will help, I would say catalyze you to beat your personal best. Now that all sounds good, right? Gamification, Yada, Yada, Yada. I didn't think that it would work for me or in any way incentivize me, but they really 100% hit the nail on the head. I was very, very impressed with how motivating it was. I know worked tremendously to keep me pushing a, which quite honestly takes a fair amount. I can get quite lazy, particularly with anything that edges on endurance, which is kind of more than five reps of anything for me. So check it out.

Speaker 2:          00:05:07       Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. This episode is not going to be a long form interview where I distill and deconstruct world class performers. In fact, it is going to be nothing of the sort. It is a Q and a episode. This is tea time with Tim or Timmy or Timbo if your prefer, where I solicited phone numbers from all of you and called a handful of you to field any questions that you might have and I've done these before. They're always a lot of fun for me to do. And among other topics covered in the various phone calls that you will hear in this episode, how to find mentors. How do I think about finding mentors? How have I found mentors in the past? Discussions of meaning Viktor Frankl and so on. How to get rid of anxiety or train into confidence. We talk about that as it relates to a handful of things. Uh, cocktails, relationship advice. If we go all over the place. And I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed recording it. So without further ado, here is tea time with Tim.

Speaker 4:          00:06:26       Hello,

Speaker 2:          00:06:27       is this Edwin?

Speaker 4:          00:06:28       Yes it is.

Speaker 2:          00:06:29       Edwin, this is Tim Ferriss calling. Good afternoon.

Speaker 4:          00:06:33       Hey Tim, how you doing? Oh man, I can't, I can't believe this is real.

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       It's real. I'm afraid I have, I have called up and I made my daycare. Well, me too. Me Too. So let's jump right into it. How can I help any a, and I can't promise I can help, but I'll try to answer whatever questions you might have.

Speaker 4:          00:06:52       I appreciate that. So my question is about mentors. So what guidance do you have for finding a mentor to kind of help, maybe gain a better understanding about an industry? Um, and I think more importantly, how would you or what guidance do you have for asking someone to be a mentor? How do you approach them? How do you kind of break that or make that initial contact?

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       I can, I can actually answer this one. So the, the first rule of thumb is that I would highly advise against ever asking someone directly to be a mentor in using those words because the people you generally will want as a mentor, unless they're retired, are probably quite busy and we'll hear mentor is unpaid part time or full time job before ever and therefore you want to approach it somewhat indirectly. And there are a few different ways to do that. There's also a resource I can recommend, which is a book called the third door, which I think does a very good job of exploring real life case studies of communication that works in communication that doesn't work when you're reaching out to people who are where you'd like to be or who could be possible mentors even remotely by what their rights and so on. So I would suggest checking out that point.

Speaker 4:          00:08:15       I'm actually, I have it in my hand. I heard your interview with Alex Benign on your podcast and men, I have to say, I am understand it's gotten me through some hard times and that's where I initially came across this book and I'm, I'm right around that chapter. I'm a maybe like the 60 70 pages in and I just read the part where it kind of goes into the intro, how we've kind of talked to you. And so I think that's where that question came from.

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       Perfect.

Speaker 4:          00:08:40       Great. Yeah, so I'm just trying to break into this and I'm trying to kind of not repeat those mistakes that he highlights.

Speaker 2:          00:08:48       So let me, let me, let me take a stab at saving you from some pitfalls. The way, way that I first connected with people who later became mentors in a sense when I landed in Silicon Valley in 2000 was through volunteering. So I highly recommend volunteering. And the reason for that is that many organizations including entrepreneurial or entrepreneurship focused organizations, that could be the Eo, the entrepreneurs' organization, it could be young presidents, organization, Ypo, it could be any number of others. There are many of them in Silicon Valley. I've volunteered at PTI, which is the Indus Entrepreneur, even though I'm clearly not Indian, uh, and volunteered at a [inaudible], which at the time was the silicon valley associate, uh, association of startup entrepreneurs. And they given their location and given their focus, were able to get media to attend, to cover speakers, meaning to feature speakers in articles and so on for Forbes or fortune and we'd ever might be.

Speaker 2:          00:10:00       And that meant if I were to volunteer, even if I were simply taking tickets or refilling water glasses, both of which I did, I would have an opportunity if I overperformed, which is easy, in fact in most volunteer capacities because the people who show up very often have the attitude, I'm not getting paid for this. So I will do the bare minimum that they ask of me. So if you are proactive and asking for additional responsibility or is there anything else I can help with, I finished x, can I help with anything else? If you are proactive and really responsible and get things done on time, you'll very often find that they would be more than happy to give you additional responsibility. And that is how I ended up ultimately sitting in on planning meetings and volunteering to uh, act as a speaker liaison for an event, which allowed me to reach out to people I wanted to get to know, like Jack Canfield, who is the cocreator is the cocreator of chicken soup for the soul, which has sold hundreds of millions of copies.

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       The person who commercialized Creatine, first creatine monohydrate that is, uh, the creator of the pet rock. I had ida, very motley crew of folks that wanted to assemble and there had to be something in it for them. And what was in it for them was speaking in front of an audience of entrepreneurs with media in attendance to cover them. So I was not asking them for any favors. In fact, I was asking them, uh, if they'd be willing to sort of receive media coverage in effect and also interact with other people at their level. And it was, it was, uh, during that event I want it to do one thing and it was not asked them if they could be a mentor. It was to demonstrate to them I was very, very good at doing my job. So I wanted it to be the smoothest speaking experience they've ever had.

Speaker 2:          00:12:00       I wanted it to be an event to remember. I wanted to assure that they had the media contacts. They want it to have interactions that is, and following that event, I later, much later, maybe a month or two later, you know, reached out after thanking the speakers, each speaker separately and as a group to uh, Say Ping, I think it was Jack Canfield at the time. And I used an approach that was similar to what I outlined in the four hour work week when reaching out to experts who are above your pay grade. And in effect said, you know, Jack, I really enjoyed our interactions. I hope we get to meet again. And if it's okay with you, I'd, I'd love to, very rarely, but if the occasion calls for it, send you a question that overlaps with your deep experience. Uh, if I'm totally stuck after trying to figure something out and it was along those lines and Jack then, uh, I kept in touch with, now it's important for me to qualify what that means.

Speaker 2:          00:13:08       Keep in touch with does not mean pastor does not say it does not mean send him quarterly updates. It does not mean clog has inbox. It means that maybe once every six to 12 months, I would send him a legitimate question and I would indicate what I'd already tried to do to answer the question. This is really important. So if you reach out to a potential mentor or someone who has more life experience and you say, hi, Tim, I was just wondering, I'm studying this in school, what should I do? That's a terrible question because it doesn't reflect if you've actually tried to figure it out on your own or if you're using me for your personal Google. It also does not lend itself to a specific answer. So you have to ask yourself, is this a question that this person could answer in four lines or less?

Speaker 2:          00:13:59       And if you're, if you look at the question and realize it's gonna take them a half hour to answer it because you're asking them for the meaning of life and to explain their trajectory and how they grew their career, then it's a bad question because you have more time than they do. And you should be aware of that from the outset. So generally the question, I guess the question I'd love to ask you is x, here are the things I've already tried. My tentative plan is this. If you have any other thoughts, I would really appreciate them. And if you're too busy to respond, I totally understand. So give them an out so that they feel comfortable, not responding and completely unpressured. This is very important and perhaps counterintuitively that'll get you more answers because what many younger go getters will do is they'll send an email and they'll finish it with looking forward to your reply.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Or I have Tuesday at 2:00 PM and Thursday at 1:00 PM central open, which one works for you. And it's so presumptive and aggressive that the no matter what the content of that email, the person receiving it will be likely to think to themselves, well shit, if I, if I reward this person with a response to this email, I am encouraging them to send me 20 more of these emails and I don't want to do that, so I'm not going to respond. So that's, that's one, uh, one approach. And I would also encourage you to look for a south by southwest talk that I gave, which funny enough coincides with south by southwest starting right now, today and tomorrow and uh, Austin, Texas in early March. But the talk is titled how to build a world class network in record time or something equally hyperbolic. In any case, it is though an accurate reflection of the talk and you may be able to find it on the podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:16:02       So there's a chance that I took the audio and put it on the, on the podcast. But if you, if you Google how to build a world class network in record time and Tim Ferris, something will pop up, whether it is a video recording of the presentation at south by or it is audio on the podcast itself, which I do think, uh, I had repurposed the audio for. So those are my thoughts. If you're reading the third door, I think that will also compliment a lot of what we're talking about. So I hope that helps. Does that fill in some gaps hopefully or give you some direction?

Speaker 4:          00:16:40       Yes, definitely. And, I mean, I must say it's one thing they're reading in a book or to hear it on your podcasts, but kind of to hear it straight from you, it just adds a little more weight to it and it definitely just makes it sound doable. So I really appreciate it and I, uh, I think you for your time and I just, uh, you know, your, your show's definitely has been a game changer for me, so thank you for that and keep doing what you're doing and I really appreciate it. So thank you so much.

Speaker 2:          00:17:04       Thanks so much. My pleasure. Of course. And I should point out one other thing, which is when I mentioned Jack Canfield for instance, I said it once every six to 12 months. That's a long time. So that as an indicator that I'm playing the long game, right? The question you shouldn't be asking, and I don't think you are, but the question you shouldn't be asking is how can I find a mentor for the next 12 months? If you're looking for something like that, it's going to end up being somewhat transactional and you're going to have to force something within a context of a group like the entrepreneurs organization where people are going there explicitly for that purpose to learn from one another to teach and so on. Otherwise, I would encourage you to reframe the question your head. So the question isn't how do I get a mentor?

Speaker 2:          00:17:52       The question is how can I encourage people I aspire to be like, who are 10, 20, 30 years ahead of me to respect me and want me to succeed? That's a better question. How do I get people say five, 10, 20 years ahead of me whose paths I might want to emulate? How do I get those people to respect me and want me to succeed? And if you do that, that's a precursor to them helping you in ways that resemble those of a mentor. But the word mentor is, uh, probably a word that will never come up, even though in practice that's what they will be doing for you. Does that make sense?

Speaker 4:          00:18:35       Yes it does. It's one of those, the Tim Ferriss hidden gems. And I think that's the exact answer I was hoping for. That's the exact type of answer I was hoping. Yeah, I think you answered it perfectly. Handwritten Followup notes, handwritten thank you notes or even just, you know, asking these questions, you know, a handwritten letter or what have you. Do you have any thoughts on if one is better than the other?

Speaker 2:          00:19:08       I don't think a handwritten letter is necessary. And a lot of people, myself included, do not want to give out their mailing addresses, even if it's a Po box. So I would say it's unnecessary. Giving someone a handwritten note at an event is a different story and I do recommend that, uh, but you can listen to the talk that I gave on that topic at south by southwest and on the podcast, which I mentioned earlier and that we'll get into details on that. All right, my man, uh, I will leave you to it. Good luck and a nice chatting with you.

Speaker 4:          00:19:51       Thank you. You too. Have a great day.

Speaker 2:          00:19:52       All right. Bye. Bye. Steve, this is Tim Ferriss calling. Good afternoon.

Speaker 4:          00:20:00       Oh my gosh,

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       I'm doing great. I am doing fantastic. It's a beautiful day and I am excited to attempt to answer any question you might have. So I am happy to let you take it from here.

Speaker 4:          00:20:18       Well there's two different questions.

Speaker 2:          00:20:30       I would say pick if if you could only get one of them answered, pick that one because that may be the case because I want to make sure that I am able to call more than a few people. So I would say pick, pick the one you would most like to answered if you had to choose one. And then if it goes quickly then we can consider a second one. But we'll, we'll try one.

Speaker 4:          00:20:53       Okay, great. Well I've read that it was just a great book and it really made a big impact on me and it made me think a lot about purpose and finding meaning in life. And I guess my question for you is you've, you've reached such a high level of success being able to affect so many people. And so I guess my question for you is, once you've reached that level, how do you continue to find purpose in your life? Um, has it evolved? You know, what, what would you say purposes right now?

Speaker 2:          00:21:34       This is a good question. Big Question as well. I would say that I'll try to tackle that in a somewhat meandering fashion. Uh, the, the first thing I would say is my approach to book writing, my approach to the podcast, my approach to the television shows had been involved with has had a common thread that is very, very simple. People might even consider it simplistic and that is if I have a pain or a problem or if I have a desire or goal, I assume it is very likely that many other people have the same pains or problems or desires or goals. So most of what I do is scratching my own itch with the expectation that if I can figure out how to, how to navigate any of those things well and take good notes and test a lot so that I can try the hundred things to filter down to the one or two that truly have a disproportionate, disproportionately good outcome, that that is a straight forward way of, of adding value to the world and not just consuming oxygen and eating resources.

Speaker 2:          00:23:00       So that's, that is my general process, which is a way of backing into your question about, you know, what, what is giving me meaning right now? What is giving me meaning right now is looking at some of the traumatic experiences I had as a child. Looking at the repercussions of that and the behaviors or thought patterns that are impossible to explain that I still have in some cases, uh, without looking in the rear view mirror and somehow metabolizing or integrating what happened to me that never had a sense of closure. And that then ties into a lot of the research I'm supporting related to treatment resistant depression, uh, related to longterm demoralization and say, uh, AIDS survivors at UCF. And a lot of what I'm hoping to do with universities and other groups including a Johns Hopkins at the top of the list. Uh, and uh, for me then it's, it's, it's assuming that right now for me that everyone is fighting battles we know nothing about.

Speaker 2:          00:24:18       Like literally everyone, there is some degree of suffering, whether it's minor or major, chronic or acute that everyone walking around Uc, I mean I'm looking out a, a, a high rise right now down at the ground. So I see these hundreds of ants, which will soon be thousands and tens of thousands with south by southwest. And assuming that every one of those people has some type of suffering past or present tense that is affecting how they make decisions, how they interact, how they view themselves. And if I can provide any tools whatsoever to decrease that suffering and to allow them to help other people who are suffering, then I view that as time very, very well spent. So that's how I'm thinking about it right now, but I'm not wedded to that and I think it can fluctuate. Um, I do think the filling the void chapter in the four hour workweek, which is probably the most neglected yet most important chapter in some respects and the entire book towards the tail end, uh, ties into a lot of the observations that you would read in Victor Frankel's book and books for that matter.

Speaker 2:          00:25:38       And so there are certainly complimentary chapters and books that you could digest, but when in doubt, uh, I would say instead of trying to save the world, look at how you can save yourself or help yourself in some fashion. And by doing something that seems very selfish on the surface, you're actually being very practical because you are scratching your own itch in such a fashion that you're not purely speculating, you are dealing with the real world. Even if it is limited to you, which I can pretty much guarantee you if it's any type of suffering, if it's any type of desire, there's a very, very high likelihood, probably 100%, but let's just call it very high likelihood that there are thousands at a minimum and probably millions of people in the world with some close cousin, uh, of that, if not the exact same thing in their deli experience.

Speaker 2:          00:26:39       So that's, that's how I currently am and thinking about it. Um, but I should also say that there's no, there's no one right answer here. And it said that your meaning could be playing music and brightening people's days for 60 minutes or 30 minutes when you get on stage to play your set because you've carefully crafted this art to change the emotional state of people who are sitting within 50 feet of you. That and if that gave you meaning. Uh, and certainly I think that's, uh, I think that is meaningful. I think that's very meaningful. Uh, even though other people who, uh, might sit on the sidelines and judge, which is usually the people who judged by the way, it's not the people in the arena who are actually scraping their knees and getting things done, but the peanut gallery on the Internet and on the side criticizing you saying that you should be spending your time a different way if there is no should.

Speaker 2:          00:27:38       This is that we're not dealing with the natural laws or physical, uh, hard scientific laws that are sort of in, I mean, we can get into a conversation of objectivity, but let's just call them objective truths, uh, for, for the sake of this thought exercise, we're dealing with your perception of what matters and your perception of what matters. I think, uh, though you should listen to other people and I encourage you to, to talk to other people about how they think about it. Your perception of what matters is your perception of what matters. And you can own that and you can consider it a valid. Uh, I would say that it's helpful as your walking around in the world is a proceeding machine to perhaps read or listen to certain books like awareness by Anthony Demello would be, uh, a a one recommendation that I would have.

Speaker 2:          00:28:41       Uh, but I'll stop talking in a second because this is a long answer, but I can't give the meaning of life. But I can tell you where I think my most leveraged point of focus is for creating meaning as I feel it today. And it's not a purely cognitive exercise I should say. It's not that I think about it and sit down with a spreadsheet, although with some of the investments and donations I make in science, I do think about, uh, the downstream effects of certain landmark studies, for instance. So I do use an analytical side to it, but the, the analytical is more, in my case these days for the execution. So I really try to feel with what, what do I get a whole body yes to that makes me and other people feel better or that uh, in some fashion solves a problem or helps me or others to get what they're hoping to have or it gives people hope then enables them in some fashion.

Speaker 2:          00:29:52       You know, what, what is the feeling that I want? Right? So instead of saying how do I find meaning, say like what is the feeling I hope to have when I find meaning when a sort of an antecedent or, uh, if you can kind of diagnose what you need by looking at the, the symptoms, the side effects, which would be how you would feel like if you were doing something really meaningful, what would that give you that you don't currently have? And then try to map that as you're talking about different ideas, different topics, different ways you could spend your time. Like when does that feeling come up? And then if you use that as as one criteria for deciding where you might want to focus to create meaning a, then you can use the analytical to build a plan for executing on everything we just described. But that's long answer to a short question. Hopefully that wasn't completely a word salad. Uh, did any of that make any sense whatsoever?

Speaker 4:          00:30:56       That was incredible. Thank you so much. That's extremely helpful and in my situation, um, I just really appreciate you taking the time to answer my question and it's super helpful and I just feel like I need to say thank you for everything that you, that you do and that you've done. Um, I know you hear this all the time, but you know, I've been following your work for a very, very long time and uh, you know, it's, you've made so many impacts on my own life and I know you've made impacts on so many people. So I just want to say thank you for being you and I really, really appreciate you.

Speaker 2:          00:31:34       Thank you Steve. I appreciate you as well. Honestly, it's like I wouldn't be here able to do this if I didn't have listeners and readers who've been so incredibly supportive of this accidental career I've ended up having. So it's a real blessing to be able to do this in any way and it means a lot that you would even fill out the form to allow me to call. So it's of course my pleasure in it and I should emphasize too, I'm still figuring this out. I'm still making it up as I go along and testing and at the end of the day for me, whether it's looking for meaning or trying to create meaning, which I think are two different approaches that can be very complimentary. Trying to figure out early stage investing or any number of dozens of other things I might get my hands into a rather than trying to debate in your own head or with other people what the best approach might be, what the best next step might be out of say three or four or even more things. I just try to test them. So I look for low cost tests with limited downside that I can throw out into the world to see what happens, to see what sticks and what doesn't. So that's all I'm doing and I'm certainly learning from lots and lots of people around me, including people like yourself. Uh, so I'll let you, I'll let you get back to your day, but thanks very much for taking the time yourself.

Speaker 5:          00:33:16       Thank you so much Jim. I really appreciate it.

Speaker 2:          00:33:18       All right man. Take it easy. Bye.

Speaker 5:          00:33:23       Hello, I speaking.

Speaker 2:          00:33:25       Hello, Heather speaking. This is Tim Ferriss speaking. Good day.

Speaker 5:          00:33:29       No, it's not. It is. I'm afraid so. Well, hello.

Speaker 2:          00:33:34       Why hello, how's, how's, how's the other, the, the weather, I said Heather, how's the Heather I guess was we could speak that way as well. How has the Heather and how is the weather surrounding Heather at the moment?

Speaker 5:          00:33:45       That's how kids get to learn my name and indeed, whether it's very cold.

Speaker 2:          00:33:52       I was going to say, it looked like you were calling or I should say I was calling a Toronto number. Find City. It is some fantastic friends and fantastic startups also. And that lovely city of yours that does get a little chilly. What might I be able to attempt to answer for you, Heather?

Speaker 5:          00:34:11       So I don't have a pillar and I am, I have started taking karate. I've been invited to take my black belt test in the spring.

Speaker 2:          00:34:23       Congratulations.

Speaker 5:          00:34:24       Gotcha. Thank you. But I'm so nervous. Just like I live now and I'm a bit of a choker. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:34:33       there's no rush. I'm not going anywhere. I'm just sitting here with TV and a computer.

Speaker 5:          00:34:38       Thank you. Um, so I'm, I know that you do all kinds of fees and I'm just wondering what your method is for staying focused and calm.

Speaker 2:          00:34:49       So the short answer is that I like to simulate the test environment as much as possible beforehand. Uh, that can include many different factors. So, for instance, if I'm going to be speaking on stage somewhere, uh, whether that's Ted or different venue, I will go, I will always make sure that I have a chance, ideally the day before, maybe the day of to go spend time on the stage and to test all the technical equipment and to know exactly where I'm going to have breakfast the next day. If it's a large conference that I don't have to worry about there being any hiccup in the logistics, right? So I would map out the day that you anticipate or versions of the day that you anticipate on your test day and look at all of the things that can stress you out, potentially look at all the things the night before that could stress you out or cause issues.

Speaker 2:          00:35:53       And then, uh, do two things. Number one is try to set up a system so that you run into the fewest number of those things as possible. And then secondly, practice the screw ups beforehand so that if they do happen, you aren't going to be as reactive and thrown off, if that makes sense. Right. So, so that could include going to end using visualization is fine for a lot of this, but let's just say that there's a possibility I'm making up this example, right? But if there's a possibility that it at a specific speaking location of do a lot of speaking anymore, but let's just say hypothetically, I'm going to go want to get a coffee and I think the coffee, the coffee shop might be completely overrun with people. And I don't like crowds, even though I can speak in front of crowds, I don't actually like being in crowds.

Speaker 2:          00:36:50       Uh, so two things. Number one, I'm going to come up with contingency plans, right? So maybe I buy my own coffee machine and a target that I can replace or returned two days later. Maybe I get some instant coffee from Starbucks. Maybe I decide to use room service, uh, and have backup plants that I don't have to do that. And then I could also go in a number of times when it's really, really busy and, uh, visualize that it is the day of my speaking gig or the black belt test and practice calming yourself down. I think part of, uh, part of the mistakes or one of the mistakes, excuse me, that that folks make is they practice skills like meditation and mindfulness in a vacuum, if that, if that makes sense. So that's exactly right. So they will meditate in the morning when it's completely quiet before anyone's gotten up on their special cushion in their special room.

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       And then they go to the DMV and they completely lose their shit because they haven't practiced the skill in the environment that most demands it or the type of environments. Uh, so for instance, uh, a few years ago I went on my first, uh, well it was not my first Caribou hunt in this case was an el Concen. I don't, I don't hunt very much, consume everything that I hunt, but I do hunt occasionally and I went an El con did not end up harvesting any elk. Uh, but in preparation for that, because it was going to be a bow hunt, I practicing, uh, in upstate New York, uh, with archery and I hired a coach. I was doing all sorts of technical training, which you've done already. If you're a black belt test, right? You've done the technical practice. Yeah, because doing technical practice, uh, but then I realized a few things when I travel.

Speaker 2:          00:38:52       In this case to Colorado, I'm going to be going from sea level to something like s between, uh, between seven and 11,000 feet of elevation. So my heart is automatically going to be beating a lot faster just to make a, to oxygenate my blood properly or oxygenating my tissues, I suppose, uh, more effectively. Second, I am almost certainly going to be extremely nervous at that point. Had never even seen a bull elk and they're gigantic. They're like horse with these enormous antlers and they make these really incredible shrieking sound. Sounds like a woman like being thrown off a cliff or something. They make these incredible sounds. So I assumed if I run into an elk, which is the objective, and I have, uh, uh, a whatever the draw is on the bow pulled back and my muscles are super tense and I've been wondering if I'll screw it up all day long.

Speaker 2:          00:39:53       Uh, I'm probably going to feel like I've had, you know, three double espressos. Okay. If, if that's the case, I should practice, uh, under those physiological conditions. So what I did is I did a number of things. I would do say 20 or 30 burpees or 40 or 50 kettlebell swings. And then I would pick up the bow and take one shot. And I did this when I was practicing in New York, maybe cause I wanted to get my heart rate, uh, wellover say like one 80. So I would do whatever necessary to get very physiologically, uh, what I would consider off baseline and then to attempt the skill, right? And you want, you want to be safe with it, of course. But I would mimic that. And I also did that when I was preparing for my ted talk. I would, uh, I would down a bunch of double espressos and then go in to give the presentation because I'm giving a presentation as a rehearsal in front of a familiar crowd. Ultimately when I'm blinded by the houselights or the stage lights rather and unable to see people in the crowd, my body's going to react very differently. So I want to mimic that. Uh, how far out is your black belt test right now?

Speaker 5:          00:41:07       They haven't set the date, but I believe first evaluations in May.

Speaker 2:          00:41:11       Okay. So you have, you have something like two months. Uh, so, uh, do you do, uh, do you do any type of performance in front of crowds? Do you, have you done any public speaking or sports competitions, things of that nature? In the past,

Speaker 5:          00:41:29       many moons ago I, I perform in front of, um, it's been a few decades. So, uh, they just find that I'm overwhelmed at the idea. Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:41:43       What does, what does, uh, what is the format of the black belt test? Is it going to be the class watching you? Is it going to be in a familiar location, a new location? What does it look like?

Speaker 5:          00:41:57       I, from what I understand, there are two main testing locations and they're sort of more of a formality, uh, gathering, but none of them are in and location that I typically, that I would get to practice that on the norm. Like they're not at the Dojo. Um, and I think they're far out and big. That's fair. Quite a number.

Speaker 2:          00:42:20       What are, what are your concerns? What are you worried could happen?

Speaker 5:          00:42:25       Uh, I'm read that I will blank there. There was a time where I was in a another competition and when it, when it came game day, I just got so nervous I couldn't find my feet with nothing to do with martial arts, but still in, so I have that fear that it's going to happen again and uh, it's ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:42:50       No, it's not ridiculous. I don't think it's ridiculous at all. I really don't think it's your data. This is, it's a response that your body and psyche or having to a past experience to protect you, right? So you're sort of subconsciously, you're trying to protect yourself to prevent what happened from happening again. That makes perfect sense. So the way you overcome that is in my experience, not by expecting that on game day you're going to be able to summon the self talk that is going to be a hundred times more effective than any of your self talk in the past. It's by rehearsing what you fear. So you have two months, which is great news. So I would think about other things that make you nervous, that would make you a specifically nervous about blanking right? Whether that's getting up on stage and talking in front of people.

Speaker 2:          00:43:45       If that's an example, then find a local toastmasters for instance, and get up on stage and start doing that because you will, you will then be begin to develop more confidence in your ability to either not blank or to blank and recover from blanking. Does that make sense? So I would look for other circumstances that would provoke the same fear and practices as much as possible. I would also find out ahead of time what the locations are and I would spend time at those locations because the fewer new variables you can have on the day of testing, the better off you'll be. Uh, I would never, for instance, when I was competing a thousand years ago, I would never ever set foot into a competitive arena or on a mat or anything like that. For the first time when I was about to compete or do some type of testing, I would always do recon ahead of time and I would not, I would know where the bathrooms are.

Speaker 2:          00:44:52       I would know, uh, where the main entrance is. I would know, I would have an idea of what the process is going to be. For instance, when I did my black belt test at the Kodokan in Tokyo, in Japan, when I lived there from 15 to 16, uh, four, it's when I was in Japan, I was part of the judo club, which is the judo team. I mean though, they're really, but yeah, it doesn't translate particularly well in English but judo team and that's where we did our black belt test. So I did reconn even then to know exactly what the process would look like, what the format would look like and uh, to actually attend a few practices in that facility just so that I would have, uh, a familiarity with say, the temperature of the mats, right? Which is, which it can vary tremendously in judo from location to location, I'm sure for other things as well.

Speaker 2:          00:45:48       But the kind of plastic rubbery to Tommy mats that they use in judo could be freezing cold, uh, in one place and really, really warm and another which affects the hardness or the s the relative hardness or softness. Right? So all of these things I would want to be exposed to before it matters, before it counts. Uh, there's also a very good book I can recommend that, uh, has helped me a lot. I've read it over and over again. It has a rather cheesy title, but the content is exceptional and a very, very practical. It's by Dale Carnegie and it's called how to stop worrying and start living. And it may seem like a dramatic recommendation for this particular example that you've brought up, but the fear of blanking, uh, and how that can be self reinforcing, if that makes sense. Right? Like the fear of blanking makes it more likely that you are going to blank.

Speaker 2:          00:46:51       Uh, so that is a psychological, uh, it's, it's a question of psychology and mindset, uh, as well as skill set. And this is, I think the neglected component that I've been alluding to since I started rambling in response to this is that, uh, if someone asks me, and I do get asked this pretty frequently, like how do I build my confidence? Like what should my self talk look like? How can I develop confidence in my answer is you don't develop it in a vacuum. You develop confidence by systematically exposing yourself to discomfort and things that you think are just outside of your capabilities are just outside of your comfort zone. And as you do that, you can, you condition yourself to better tolerate stress and to take what you previously would have considered risks even though now you recognize them as very achievable, trainable objectives and that's how you build confidence.

Speaker 2:          00:47:53       You build confidence by doing these things because at the end of the day, like your inner critic, your inner voice is going to know the truth, right? You can do all, you can listen to all of the motivational audio that you want, but if you've, if you haven't put in the work and you haven't set foot in this arena, if you haven't subjected yourself to a similar situations that would provoke this fear of blanking you are going to know on on a deep level. On the flip side, this is the good news. If you've done those things, you show up and you know you've done everything you could have done. And the self talk is, I've done all of the preparation, like I have prepared more methodically than anyone else who was taking this test. And therefore all I need to do now is simply let come out what I've been technically practicing for x number of months, x number of years.

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       All right. Like I have, I have turned over every stone I could to prepare for this. And that is what makes it far less likely that you're going to blank or I should say end gives you the confidence that if you plank, which has happened to me dozens of times on stage in front of big audiences while I'm speaking, like literally like just poof, gone, do not know what the hell comes next. And once you've learned kind of how to tap dance with that, uh, you, you develop confidence, not just your, in your ability to execute on a plan, but your ability to improvise. And, uh, those would be, those would be some, some of my thoughts. But really it's remove as many unknowns as possible. If you have, what if this, what if that go practice, go practice that. What if in some capacity, and you know, maybe that's asking to go to a different karate school with people you don't know to participate in a class or to do a demo.

Speaker 2:          00:49:58       Like would you mind? And you could explain to the teacher, like, I'm not coming in here with a lot of swagger. I'm trying to prepare for my black belt test. I'm really nervous. I'm going to blank. I'm working with my teacher. But one thing that was recommended to me is getting into unfamiliar environments because that's what the testing environment is going to be to actually perform. So that I have less fear of blanking when it matters. And I'm sure that you could find, you could even ask your instructor if there's another instructor he or she can recommend who would be open to hosting you in a way. Right. So there, there are ways to practice this stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:50:31       That's a great idea.

Speaker 2:          00:50:33       Yeah. So that's uh, which, which was taught to me, right? This is all stuff that I picked up from other people who are really, really seasoned competitors in the, in the, in, in most instances. Uh, yeah. Yeah. So this is this, these are just little bits and pieces that I've picked up over time for, uh, inoculating yourself against sort of a nebulous fear. Uh, and, uh, there's, there's another exercise that I would very, very strongly recommend you go through because you may realize even if I blank and this doesn't work, it doesn't happen. I can retest three months later or six months later, right then. And there is a thought exercise that you can go through which involves some writing. So I guess it's more than just a thought exercise called fear setting, which if, uh, do you have, if you haven't seen it or even if you have, it may be an opportune time to revisit. This is something I do very regularly, probably at least once a quarter, maybe even once a month. Uh, and you can find that at Tim dot. Blog forward slash ted since I also discussed the process in, in my last year past that time

Speaker 5:          00:51:42       and listen to your podcasts.

Speaker 2:          00:51:46       Right.

Speaker 5:          00:51:46       Wait where I think it's comparable to other people.

Speaker 2:          00:51:49       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:51:50       You mentioned it. Why don't we try it?

Speaker 2:          00:51:52       Yeah. So I would, I would go and print out that blog post and just run through the exercise even if it's seems, uh, in some way academic, uh, I think that it will also alleviate a lot of unnecessary pressure or fear that you're probably imposing on yourself, uh, that may not be extremely well defined and to that book, how to stop worrying and start living will also chip away at that with different tools and recommendations. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:52:24       And that was Dale Carnegie?

Speaker 2:          00:52:25       That's right.

Speaker 5:          00:52:27       Okay. Okay. Thank you. Um, when smart question, I hear rigorous more so than our regular training and I don't know if I should leading up with have more rest time or more like go at it. The giver leading up to it too to practice. What do you, what do you recommend that I just am not, athletics is not my, my background. Nobody tell it this early. And, um, I'm looking to get through right and, and try to do so as gracefully as I can, but I hear that it's quite a long day. And by design it's a exciting,

Speaker 2:          00:53:05       yeah, I would, uh, I would rest quite a bit in the week before the actual test, uh, particularly in the few days beforehand. Uh, but since you have two months, I would strive to make your training harder than the test day by design. And if you've gone through things that are harder than the actual fight, so to speak, you will come in with a very, very well earned high level of confidence that you are physically capable because you've already stressed, tested those circumstances. So I would, I would absolutely, you know, within safe boundaries of course, uh, make your training harder than your competition slash certification for sure. 100%. And, uh, I think of this arc, you locus, one of my favorite quotes is we do not rise to the level of our expectations. We fall to the level of our training,

Speaker 6:          00:54:15       right?

Speaker 2:          00:54:16       So hope and, uh, since I'm a high on tea right now and want to use quartz, I'll also say, you know, there's, there's a longer quote by James Cameron, the director, uh, terminate her Avatar, et Cetera. Titanic, which begins with hope is not a strategy. Hope is not a strategy. Hope is not a strategy. So conditioned yourself by making your training at least at a few points beforehand, physically more demanding than the test day and figuring out ways to do that. And it doesn't necessarily have to be karate, but it should be something that is physically more demanding than the test day. I would simulate it as closely as humanly possible.

Speaker 5:          00:55:03       You're welcome.

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       You should. It's the best. Uh, best, best of luck with your, with your black belt test. Very exciting. Yeah. Congratulations. You too. Bye Bye. Justin, how was it in California or at least on a California telephone? This is Tim Ferriss.

Speaker 6:          00:55:28       I was expecting your call.

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       Well, here I am not, not, not to, not to leave you hanging.

Speaker 6:          00:55:35       I appreciate that. Los Angeles. How's Austin tech is presumably,

Speaker 2:          00:55:43       it's fantastic. It decided to brighten up and offer the son just as people are arriving for south by southwest, which it always does to seduce everyone. But the weather is actually generally very nice, but it's, it's been cold for the last week or so. Uh, how can I be of assistance? What to question? Might I be able to answer or attempt to answer?

Speaker 6:          00:56:06       Well, you know, this is more of a personal question and I read the interesting questions and I thought if Kim, Tim, if you had to identify as a type of car, what would that cost Kelby and why would you identify as it?

Speaker 2:          00:56:29       I had to be a cocktail. You know, the first thing that came to mind was an old fashioned, uh, just because I feel like for me there should be certain constants in life. You should have, for instance, consistency with values and how you make decisions with your values as, as an operating system effectively for the go. No go decisions do not do spend time with this person versus avoid this person type of decisions. Uh, on the other hand passed the basic ingredients with say an old fashioned, you then have as a, as a bartender, quite a bit of room to improvise and add your own flair and it can vary tremendously from, from place to place. Uh, so I think that then offers the flexibility to reinvent yourself with respect to projects with respect to career, with respect to how you manifest those values in priorities that guide you a day to day on a more operational, uh, on a more operational level. So that is the first thing that comes to mind when you ask about cocktail. There was like some, some consistency and a, a bedrock foundation that you can rely on and expect. And then you have the room to improvise and be creative and reinvent as needed with all sorts of other types of adornments and highlights subtle or over the top as you see fit.

Speaker 6:          00:58:23       That was a fantastic answer, that

Speaker 2:          00:58:29       glad you liked it. And that was a pretty quick one. Is there as a, do you have any other questions or would you like to leave it at the cocktail?

Speaker 6:          00:58:37       Sure we'll be able to get you on a phone call is I'm 27 years old. I'm a gentleman. I consider myself a, I'm constantly trying to learn and you know, I'm a huge fan of podcasts and I can express my gratitude enough for everything that you do for myself and everybody else. Um, um, somebody who generally struggles with finding my purpose and I don't want to go square peg round hole as far as trying to force myself down a walk of life that, you know, maybe it didn't exactly fit for me. Was there a time that you felt that you were particularly stagnant and maybe you weren't fitting in where you thought you should have and it was just something that maybe helped you get over that?

Speaker 2:          00:59:20       I've had that at many points in my life. So the first thing I would say is that it is a normal experience and in fact at your exact age, I was having that feeling, uh, 27 I would have been in the process of traveling, trying to figure out what I was going to do next. So I would have been bouncing from place to place, uh, living on the cheap, whether it was Ireland or Berlin or any number of other places, wondering what the hell am I going to do with my life? So I was at the exact same point in some respects that you are, it sounds like from what you're describing, it's the first thing I would say is don't panic. Don't, uh, don't view it as a personal flaw, a defect. Uh, don't, don't think that you are somehow uniquely unfocused and that the universe of 27 year olds outside of yourself has this figured out because that's generally not the case.

Speaker 2:          01:00:29       And, uh, I've had that feeling at multiple points and I expect it to come up and I, I don't dread it because I've learned to view it as an indicator that something is not working right. There is something that I need or something that I want or something that I want to give to others and to the world that is not being accomplished right now. So I try to view it as a simple indicator to zoom out to 30,000 feet. And, and try to reassess where things are in terms of what you do after reassessing a, and one way to reassess by the way is to get a book like the 80, 20 principle, uh, and uh, the last name, it's Richard Koch. It may actually be pronounced cock. I have no idea. K O c h a, I never know how to pronounce it. I'm going to go with coke.

Speaker 2:          01:01:28       Uh, the 80, 20 principle, the 80, 20 way, I think living the 80, 20 way, there are a number of books that he has written which focus exclusively in the 80, 20 principle. Uh, which, uh, I view is very helpful from a diagnostic perspective. If you're just looking at first establishing a baseline, right? Where are you expending energy, where are you allocating your time? What are the results that are coming from the various categories of activities and, uh, what type of emotional pay off are you getting or not getting from those things? What are the things you want to get rid of? It's another way to, from a sideways angle, get to what you want is to also identify what you, what you would like to subtract, what are the things you're doing, the people you're spending time with, uh, the things you're committing to, et Cetera, that you would like to remove that are causing negative stress as opposed to positive adaptive stress in your life.

Speaker 2:          01:02:25       So I would suggest those books or one of them for diagnostic purposes. And then after that, the natural question that comes up is, well, what then what, what do you do? Uh, hopefully through that assessment process you'll have some indication of tests that you can run. And I say tests or experiments because it is a very low pressure labeling to use. You're not at 27 making a decision for the rest of your life, right? And it's important to frame it that way because if you view a decision as a five or 10 year commitment and there are paths where that is it that that can be the case, saint medicine, but outside of a handful of areas, uh, you can look at, in even in the case of medicine, there are experiments that you could run. So for instance, would it be possible if you are considering traveling a medical path and thought that might be something you'd want to pursue, that you could sit in at a medical school and audit a class and ask a professor who has a great reputation among students and that's easy to figure out with online course rankings and so on.

Speaker 2:          01:03:46       Uh, who's one specific teaching awards? Could you sit in and audit a class because you are considering pursuing medical school and a career in medicine? Is that something that you could use it as an experiment for two weeks to sit in on these classes to give you more information and to pay attention to how you emotionally and emotionally respond to that to see if it feels like if it could it be a fit or not. Right? What other experiments could you run? Well, uh, what you could do after you've done that or alongside it is try to figure out if there is a way for you to shadow someone, say at an emergency room, right? And this is, this is something I've actually done. Uh, and there's no harm in figuring out how to ask, uh, how you might do something like that even if you are ultimately not granted permission.

Speaker 2:          01:04:40       Right? So even in a case that is particularly seemingly difficult like that there are experiments you can run and uh, the, the upshot of this is that you are going to need to try a bunch of stuff, right? I was not planning on ever writing a book ever that was not planning on writing the four hour workweek. I, uh, had had very difficult experience with writing my senior thesis as an Undergrad and I'd sworn to myself, I would never write anything longer than email ever again. So if you had asked me at age 25 or even 27, probably if I wanted to write a book, if I want it to be an author, the answer would have been absolutely not hell no. But in the, in the process, and I did this accidentally, but you can do it by design. In the process of teaching classes, uh, related to entrepreneurship and getting a very strong response from students who are undergrads and, uh, uh, master's students from certain aspects of my talks, I began to think, uh, it could make sense to, to give a separate guest lecture.

Speaker 2:          01:05:59       This is at Princeton at the time focusing on something that I struggled to label, but nonetheless ended up calling lifestyle design as opposed to, uh, how to build a fast growing a bootstrapped business and how to engineer that to, to function. And it was through that seemingly unrelated practice and, uh, brainstorming that the content for the four hour work week before the title ever existed came about. And then someone else suggested in effect, just like added a snarky comment to a feedback form at Princeton, which is not rare, which was, I don't understand why you're teaching a class of 40 students. Why don't you just write a book and be done with it? Which I don't think it was a serious recommendation. It was just a Dickish, a dickish response from a dickish kid has been trained to think that's awesome at Princeton. But, uh, nonetheless, that stuck in my head and I took notes on possible chapter titles, headlines, content, et Cetera, so that I could get to sleep because it gave it insomnia.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       And then only had conversations with agents and so on after someone made introductions without really asking me if they could make them or not. And then the book was turned down by 27 publishers. Right? So it's almost like that entire path was something that I turned away from multiple times. And nonetheless, it is turned into one of the greatest gifts I've ever received. Certainly that experience paved the way for everything, including the podcast, uh, and failures can also offer you tremendous opportunities. Right after the four hour chef, which really completely burned me out. It's a very difficult book to put together on us, on us, on stay suicide deadline. If I had not been burned out by the four hour chef, if I'd still had a lot of gas in the tank, I would have never tested the podcast format as a sandbox for intellectual exploration and having the types of conversations I now have a weekly basis and share with the world never would have happened if I had not run headfirst into a brick wall with the four hour chef.

Speaker 2:          01:08:23       Uh, so number one, just in, in review because I want to make sure that, um, try to summarize this and then have a chance to call some of the folks. Um, number one, if you're having these feelings of being unfocused or not sure what to do with the rest of your life, that is normal. And in fact, the majority of the world is having that type of feeling at least a few times a year. Uh, so number one, don't freak out because it's normal. Um, and number two is doing assessment. You really need to understand where you are and what your baseline is before you can make any type of plans or draw up possible experiments for finding the things that you feel you lack. That would be the 80, 20 principle at least as one option that I think is particularly effective. And then the second is coming up with experiments and identifying different ways to stick your toe in the water or different waters to gauge how that feels and whether that provides you with some degree of inner peace or excitement.

Speaker 2:          01:09:34       Uh, and I do think that those are two pretty good litmus tests for a lot of the decisions that you make might make in life. You know, does it excite you and are you excited to talk to other people about it and uh, which, which are separate. They don't, you don't have to check both of those boxes. And then, you know, how excited are you or a peaceful argue when you wake up in the morning and how easily do you go to sleep, right? Like anything that can facilitate sort of those four metrics I think, uh, generally falls into the good decision category in my experience. Uh, but a, you don't have to figure it out for the rest of your life and I think it's highly likely that you will at 27 particularly given the rate of technological change and new industries that will be created, um, will in fact have multiple careers throughout your life. And, uh, you don't have to figure out which one to stick with because I think that might in fact be a losing strategy for most people. You want to develop skills and relationships that transcend any one narrow, uh, area of specialty, less your, you know, some type of nanoparticle. A physicist who's, you know, committed to really specializing, that's fine too. But from the, from the sound of, of, of, of where describing, um, I would say experimentation, experiment, experiment, experiment. Does that help at all?

Speaker 6:          01:11:19       Yes. I appreciate your thorough answers. It never does disappoint

Speaker 2:          01:11:28       my pleasure. You know, I'm just trying to make, make something up that sounds believable. So I'm glad it aid you in any way that it is genuinely though how I've, how I've approached things, uh, with very rare deviation for the last say, certainly the last decade and I would say even a little bit longer. So I'm going to let you get back to your day. Uh, but thanks for blending and ear and thanks for filling out the form.

Speaker 6:          01:12:03       I'll ask you again about the cocktails, but until then, thanks for the call and said, I appreciate everything. You have a good day. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:12:08       All right, you too man. Bye Mcneil. I getting that pronunciation right.

Speaker 7:          01:12:19       It is for me.

Speaker 2:          01:12:21       Well, it's not speak to you soon. I might flip the whole thing, but we'll, we'll see how it goes. How are you this afternoon?

Speaker 7:          01:12:34       Grind?

Speaker 2:          01:12:34       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:12:36       First,

Speaker 2:          01:12:38       you know, there's, there can be a time and a place that can be a time and a place for it. So how can I try to be of assistance? I can't promise good answers, but I'll, I'll do my best.

Speaker 7:          01:12:49       Awesome. Well, you know, it's team, they might not be as good,

Speaker 2:          01:12:56       but, uh,

Speaker 7:          01:12:59       today was a regarding relationships and you know, uh, basically you, you're very methodical in everything that you do. Uh, you know, you kind of plan ahead and you always like try and anticipate any downsides and plan for those Yada Yada. Um, so that's kind of my mindset and I've learned a lot of that from you. I was wondering how can I do that in a relationship where my partner and my girlfriend is and isn't really so prone to that or um, kind of bottles up or doesn't want to plan due to the anxiety of it.

Speaker 2:          01:13:41       I think we have some, we have some fertile ground to explore here. So I might rely on followup questions from you to direct this. But, uh, I can tell you how I used to think about it now, how I think about it, which is evolving as we speak. But I realized in the last say five to 10 years that my ultimate nightmare would be dating a long tear version of myself. So they're the sort of assumption number one is that I am looking for a compliment, someone who is a compliment and I have a fantastic girlfriend right now. We've been together for a pretty decent stretch of time and, uh, she, she's proven to be a fantastic compliment. I can explain what that means in a second to me as it stands right now, uh, I am not looking for a duplicate. And at the same time, I'm looking for someone with shared values, right?

Speaker 2:          01:14:53       How do they view truth? How do they define success if they define success at all? Right? So they should be shared value could be, and I think it is on many levels, uh, how you define certain terms that people tend to strive for or strive to avoid and how you answer certain key life questions. Outside of that, there's a lot of room for flexibility. And what I have found is for me at least, uh, what is helpful when you perceive, say, I'm fucking, get myself in trouble here. Let's say we're both, I can't blame it on the booze. Um, so, uh, and, and this applies to the last, uh, probably the last four or five relationships I've had, which have all been with incredible women, uh, and, um, brilliantly strong women in different ways that I separate in my mind what is a emotional fragility or lack of resilience from sensitivity?

Speaker 2:          01:16:21       And I think this is a really important distinction, which I didn't by the way, draw for myself for many decades and I think it did a lot of damage. In other words, sensitivity to me is reflective. Uh, have to use one, a metaphor, a precision instrument, right? So if you have a scale that gives you your weight but it's in 10 pound increments, that is less sensitive than a scale that gives you a pound by pound increments and a very sensitive scale would give you down to the gram. And so on. Uh, the question then is how someone wields that sensitivity and uh, whether it is a help or a liability or when it, or asking the question, when is that sensitivity a help or a liability? So you find, I think that historically for me, I have viewed any type of feeling of feelings to be unhelpful, to be a primitive clouding of logical analysis and uh, uh, for a long time. Therefore, my response to emotional responses in myself was to stuff them down, cut them off, mute them, turn down the volume. And as a result, I made some really bad decisions. Uh, there were times when it was helpful. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:18:04       Yeah. And you use both. Right? So I think that it's, it's a mistake to exclusively rely on either, but the, there is a lot to be said for the hundreds and thousands and millions of years of evolution that have given us rapid processing ability that doesn't have to run through a four quadrant grid in the analytical mind. There's a lot to be said for it, right? If a deal looks great, but you get the Heebie jeebies from person you were doing the deal with, I pay, it's a lot of attention to that. The reason I bring it up is that I think it is equally easy to say date a in this case, you know, we're both dating women date a woman or a partner who is very, very sensitive and to mistake that for weakness, right? So one thing that I try to do is to get a very clear understanding of how sensitive their instrument is.

Speaker 2:          01:19:04       Med, for instance, uh, one of my ex girlfriends, I only realized after we'd been together for several years, that when she walked down the street, she was so empathically receptive that she could basically feel the pain and emotions, almost like a contagion of people as she passed them walking down the sidewalk. Like walking down the sidewalk in New York City was incredibly emotionally depleting for her. And I did not, I didn't realize she was that sensitive. I didn't, and that's not a, uh, it's not a value judgment. It is an assessment of Eicher instrumentation. And that changed how I related to what I'd previously perceived as like very unreasonable and maybe immature responses to things. Does that make sense? So that's, that's kind of 0.1. And, uh, I find it also very, I find it more productive these days and I should say right off the bat, which I didn't, that uh, many people have suggested or asked me, what are you going to write the for our relationship and aside from as a terrible sounding title, the fact of the matter is I don't think I have right now a whole lot to contribute to that conversation.

Speaker 2:          01:20:26       There are 1,000,001 books out there about relationships. Some of them are very good. Uh, I think the five love languages is actually an excellent book and it's been recommended to me by, by some of the most impressive humans on the planet. Uh, off the record.

Speaker 2:          01:20:44       That might be a separate one. The five love languages. No, no, no. I mean maybe somebody should write that one too. Uh, the five love languages I do think for particularly for very Spock admiring left brainers and I know that the left and right brain functions are not as cleanly delineated as this, but just for the sake of simplicity, that book is very helpful. And, uh, where I was going to go next though is that, uh, for, for quite a long time, my response to perceived weakness was frustration. And it still is sometimes, uh, the frustration was based on my perception of whatever their reaction was. And I had no, I had no visibility into their internal process. This goes by the way for employees, it goes for everybody, not just significant others. And what, uh, I've, but I've certainly come to practice a lot more is before getting frustrated, asking what they're experiencing, asking them to describe how they're feeling it, recognizing that their response exists whether you want it to or not.

Speaker 2:          01:22:10       So you might as well have a bit more resolution on what they're actually experiencing. And it can end up being very, very reasonable. And not only that, but even if it is from your perspective, unreasonable, uh, simply recognizing that their experience is valid and even saying, I can see how ABNC it would be very difficult. I totally hear you. I could see that. And can I have friends who have experienced similar things or I've experienced similar things, often diffuses the situation without you having to offer a solution at all or to such a critique the response. Um, so that's another sort of consideration. Um, there is a, this is the type of thing that's probably going to get me in trouble, but here it goes. So that the 20% of you out there who just love to kind of sport outrage on the Internet, you can use this one.

Speaker 2:          01:23:13       Uh, uh, there's a, there, there's a book that I highly, highly recommend for everyone to read and I've recommended it before for many, many different situations, uh, or to as education and a toolkit for many, many types of challenges that can crop up. There's a book called don't shoot the dog, which is written by, I believe it's Karen Pryor and it's at, it's at its most basic a book about a positive reinforcement and it happens to teach a lot of lessons through discussion of, uh, sort of animal conditioning, right? Marine animals, dolphins and so on. Also looking at every possible creature imaginable. And I think the back copy of the back cover of this book says something like whether you want the cat to get off of your kitchen table or like your mother in law to stop nagging you, this book will give you the tools you need, something like that. And uh, the title I think does not do justice to the book. Uh, but it's, it's very useful, particularly when you, how long have you been dating your girlfriend?

Speaker 7:          01:24:31       Yeah, it'll be like two and a half years.

Speaker 2:          01:24:35       Okay. So two and a half, three years in both of you probably have a, I think this is true for most couples by this point. Certain triggers for each other. You have certain ha ensure you have habits that annoy the shit out of her. Maybe she bites her lip, maybe she does it. I'm sure she has a few that drive you nuts and they're probably also exchanges where in you end up in a self perpetuating cycle of some type. Right. And like I'm, I'm not saying this is trivia relationship, but for instance, right, like you perceive her as being clingy or needy in some ways. So you push away or shut down, which makes her even more fearful that you're withdrawing. So she doubles down on the cleanness and the neediness, then you double down on the pushing away and it's just that type of dynamic x, it might exist.

Speaker 2:          01:25:29       So in those types of dynamics, it's very useful to have as a reference point, a book like this that covers principles of positive reinforcement, right? Because the negative reinforcement can work, but there are a lot of side effects. Does that make sense? So sec for instance, and this book is a lot of examples. Uh, negative reinforcement can work. Yeah. It's like if you want to use a shock collar with a dog, uh, and I'm, by the way, just for everybody out who's just like waiting to throw pitchforks at my head, I'm not comparing women to dogs. I'm comparing humans to animals because we are animals. All right? So just chill the fuck out. Right? Uh, and, and I think a lot of our problems day to day quite frankly is thinking that we are uniquely special, uh, like animals when a, for most intents and purposes, that's just not the case at all.

Speaker 2:          01:26:35       Like there's, there's plenty of great literature and science that we can review to get a better understanding of why we do some silly things and, uh, engaged in self defeating behavior and thought patterns, which from an evolutionary standpoint, make a lot of sense. So this is part of that, that education for me at least, and the benefit of it is what are the benefits is that you're not reading about evolutionary biology in a purely theoretical or abstract way. I mean, there's some great books by Dawkins and others that can inform this conversation. What's nice about something like a don't shoot the dog is that it gives you tools you could immediately practice in real life. Uh, so that's, that's one I would suggest that will give you an alternative Palette of options, mixing a lot of metaphors, Palette of colors, I, he, options that you can paint with when you're, you're in these situations. Uh, and, uh, give me another, can you give me a specific example of, of a situation or a response is something that you wish were different, whether it's ongoing, uh, preferably something that repeats, right? Something that you see repeatedly.

Speaker 7:          01:27:54       She's going to kill me.

Speaker 2:          01:28:03       Robert, Robert, Robert, Robert. Don't worry about it. Continue.

Speaker 7:          01:28:10       Oh, yes, yes, yes, exactly. You know, income inequality, right. I do make a little bit more than her, which is, I'm sure there's always income disparity, but, uh, I, I've always been very frugal my whole life, like in terms of, you know, all we save a ton, don't live beyond your means or whatever. Uh, and anytime I tried and talk financials, it just, I get shot down. There's no, uh, there's no discussion to be had. It's just, well, you have yours and I have mine. Let's just figure it out for somebody. I wanna, you know, and the rest of them, rest of my life where it becomes difficult, especially when I've been raised. Um, so financially conscious

Speaker 2:          01:28:56       as I am. Okay. This is a good example. And because it's, it's a, it represents a really common source of friction. Really, really common. I mean, this is, this is, this is not a rare conversation and it's not a rare conversation where one or more parties shut down. So I can only speak to tools that have been helpful to me. I'll, uh, speak to a tool that's been helpful to me and also a buffer. And I'll explain what I mean by that. So the tool which can become a bit rote and repetitive if you overuse it, is a nonviolent communication. And, uh, there are many books on the subject. Uh, there is a particular audio book version that Neil Strauss, eight or nine time New York Times bestselling author recommended it to me. I believe the first name is Marshall, the author. The audio book has, I think a peace sign on the cover and it's several hours long.

Speaker 2:          01:30:02       In any case, nonviolent communication. You can certainly read the Wikipedia entry for the basics, but in effect, it is a, it is an approach to communication that, uh, aims. And I'm probably going to piss off a bunch of, uh, nonviolent communication, black belts out there who are going to say that I got it all wrong. But for the purposes of our conversation right now, to minimize the likelihood of provoking a strong emotional response in the person you're speaking with and in yourself. And the, I'm going to try to, to sort of recall this template right now, there are different ways to approach it, but the way it will generally start is along the lines of, you know, when a B and c happened or when you did A, B and c and the F, this first part is has to be objective. It cannot be debatable, right? So it could be something like when we agreed, uh, you know, when we agreed to meet at three o'clock and you turned up at three 20, it's what, it's, what a video camera would have recorded.

Speaker 2:          01:31:15       Uh, it makes me feel x, uh, because I have a need for why, right? It makes me feel sad because I have a need to feel that we're in this together and that we're, we're going to always strive to keep commitments to each other. Uh, and then there's a specific ask, which is like, would you be willing to, and the the would you be willing to, could be anything. It could be, would you be willing to set aside a time to have a conversation about this anytime that's convenient for you? It's really important to me because for instance, in your case, like I, I literally want to spend the rest of my life with you and I, this is important to me because I was raised a and c like would you be willing for us to set aside some time whenever is convenient for you?

Speaker 2:          01:32:04       Put it in the calendar so we can actually talk about this. Uh, and it's a template. The goal being what I described previously, I would look into nonviolent communication for these types of conversations that have storico. He produced the same response whether in your partner or in yourself. Right. And then the buffer that I was mentioning is in this took me, it's so obvious and yet it took me 41 42 I can't even remember how old I am right now, but whatever my age is right now, I should have figured this out earlier. And that is, it's not just the message, it's the Messenger. And what I mean by that is when, when you get into a pattern, this is in my experience where a partner says a, the other partner shuts down or respond to the B and it's just groundhog day that what's what may be needed and it's not, they're not mutually exclusive.

Speaker 2:          01:33:05       What might be required at both is not the perfect word smithing that is going to be like you're Luke Skywalker in star wars, like shooting through down the line and the death star. Like it's not the perfect prose paragraph that's going to just be stow this miraculous epiphany upon your girlfriend is going to be like, oh my God, now I see it. Right. Rather than hoping to like craft the perfect Gettysburg address that's going to like revolutionize how she thinks about finances. Maybe she just needs to hear exactly what you're saying through someone who is less threatening or with whom she has an established that pattern. Right. And then I'm sure that I, again, I'm not a relationship counselor, but in my experience when I'm like, I can't believe she does x, I usually have a very active role in provoking that somehow. Right. So it's, it's, it's likely that the credit slash blame is shared by both parties. Uh, but in the last, uh, year or so I have been, and I'm like embarrassed to admit this, I don't know what that's about. We can unpack that another time, but, uh, found a relationship coach to meet with or speak with on a regular basis and she will speak to me individually. She'll speak to my girlfriend individually and then we'll have group calls, uh, has enabled my girlfriend to say things or convey things to me through someone else who can also act as a reality check for her.

Speaker 2:          01:34:44       And for me when I have a concern or a criticism, she's more than willing to tell me that she thinks it's unreasonable or that I'm, and as she's put it, she's, she's not for either one of us. She's for the relationship. And how did having someone who is a regular part of your fostering of the relationship as a couple, even when there is not a problem, right? Ku is consistently there to ensure that like the plants are watered before they start dying has been incredibly, incredibly helpful and can diffuse a lot of this stuff through a myriad of, uh, of different factors. Uh, one of which being you can say to this say relationship coach or whoever you might choose to work with therapists that you'd really like to bring this up in a safe space where the three of you can talk about it and where she can voice her concerns to you maybe separately, maybe together.

Speaker 2:          01:35:53       And having someone to facilitate that is, uh, at least in my experience over the last year, extremely, extremely helpful. It is also helpful if you or anyone like me can get a bit overwhelmed or feel overwhelmed when a partner comes to me with emotional challenges. Right. And you, me, at some point you'll have to develop the ability, I'm not saying you don't, I will have to develop the ability and I am to kind of better just sit and witness the experience of an emotional challenge without having to like immediately jump in and offer solutions within 30 seconds and be like, okay, right problem. Got It. Let's be solution focused. Uh, which left brain go. Yeah. Which surprise surprise not always make things better. Uh, I'm, I'm getting better at that. And it's, it's, it, it's a process of practicing and training and so on from it because it doesn't come very naturally, uh, to have someone else that your partner can vent to who is not you is really worth the money and time in and of itself and who you can vent too, by the way, so that you don't blow up over dinner or God knows what at your part and then say to yourself for the next two weeks, for fuck's sake, why did I do that?

Speaker 2:          01:37:20       What a like 12 car pile up of emotional trauma. I have to now try to clean up this. So that's the buffer that, that I might, I might suggest, and it's relatively new to me to have that because I like to think that I don't need things like that and to have realized that that's, uh, it, at least from my experience so far, very penny wise and pound foolish, particularly if it sounds like you're very committed to being with your girlfriend and want to be with her for a very, very, very long time. Uh, so those are, those are a few of my thoughts. Uh, I don't know how helpful those are, but they've been, they've, they've been helpful certainly to me thus far.

Speaker 2:          01:38:17       fired one five love languages. Don't shoot the dog nonviolent communication and don't shoot the dog by Karen Pryor. Right.

This episode is brought to you by Peloton, which I've been using [inaudible] for about a year now. Peloton is a cutting edge indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into your home. You can also do on demand, which is what I do. We'll come back to that so you don't have to worry about fitting classes into a busy schedule or making it to a studio or gym with a hectic or unpredictable commute. I, for instance, have a Peloton bike right in my master bedroom at home and it's one of the first things I do.

Speaker 1:          01:42:43       Many mornings I wake up, I meditate for a bit, then I knock out a short 20 minute ride in my undies. Hard to do that at the gym, take a shower and I'm in higher gear for the rest of the day. It's really convenient and has become something that I look forward to see. You have a lot of options for one if you'd like. You can ride live with thousands of other writers across the country on an interactive leaderboard keeping motivated. There are also up to 14 new classes added everyday with more than 8,000 classes on demand and you can pick based on length, 45 minutes, 20 minutes, whatever music, hip hop, rock and roll or save, low impact versus high intensity or interval. If you could pick the class structure and style that works for you and in my case I quite like Matt will produce and I tend to do on demand and listen to a lot of and watch many of the same classes over and over.

Speaker 1:          01:43:32       But I'm kind of promiscuous and also enjoy classes from a lot of the other instructors. They have Peloton and amazing roster of incredible instructors in New York City with a whole range of styles and personalities so you can find what you're in the mood for it. You also get real time metrics that you can use to track your performance over time. And that will help, I would say catalyze you to beat your personal best. Now that all sounds good, right? Gamification, Yada, Yada, Yada. I didn't think that it would work for me or in any way incentivize me, but they really 100% hit the nail on the head. I was very, very impressed with how motivating it was and it worked tremendously to keep me pushing, which quite honestly takes a fair amount. I can get quite lazy, particularly with anything that edges on endurance, which is kind of more than five reps of anything for me. So check it out.
