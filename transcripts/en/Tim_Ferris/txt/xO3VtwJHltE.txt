Speaker 2:          00:23          so does brought to you by headspace. More than 80% of the people I've interviewed, world class performers across the military, entertainment, sports, and beyond all have some type of meditative practice. I tried for years and years and failed miserably. The key is making it simple and you can dramatically improve your life in just 10 minutes a day and technology can help you. This change comes through guided meditation and headspace is by far the most popular app for this purpose. More than 4 million users. It's meditation made simple, so what I recommend is that you take this practice meditation, which is rooted in thousands of years of tradition, supported by thousands of scientific studies and try it for 10 minutes a day for 10 days. That's all you need to do. You could also check out the founder Andy Puddicombe, a Ted talk, which has more than 5.5 million views.

I have it on my phone and begin their take 10 program for 10 days of guided meditation. Completely free. 10 minutes a day. That's all it takes. You should give it a shot. headspace.com forward slash Tim just go to headspace.com forward slash. Tim this episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive, in a good way, set it and forget it. Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than two and a half billion dollars under management. In fact, some of my very good friends, investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

Speaker 2:          02:07          So the question is, why? Why is it so popular? Why is it unique? Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only pay pennies on the dollar for them. And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations, bloated sales teams, et cetera. And I'll come back to that in a second. I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk assessment quiz, which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in. And if you just want to take their advice, run with it, do it yourself. You can do that or as I would, you can set it and forget it. And here's why. The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't.

Speaker 2:          02:49          Great investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and little things that you may or may not be familiar with. Like automatic tax loss harvesting, rebalancing your portfolio, cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large amounts of money over longer periods of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned, since it's using software instead of retail locations, etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely impossible. Right off the bat, you never pay commissions or account fees for everything. They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for free. If you use my link, wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance. Now normally when I have a sponsor on this show is because I use them and recommend them. In this case it's a little different.

Speaker 2:          03:36          I don't use wealth front yet because I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal. They wanted to sponsor this podcast, but because of sec regulations, companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials. So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast, but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant amount of my own money, at least for me, uh, in the team and the company itself. So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

Speaker 2:          04:53          Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. It is usually my job to deconstruct world class performers of some type, whether they are from sports, military, chess, entertainment, God knows where they come from everywhere and you find a lot of commonalities across them. This episode though is a special episode. I'm going to hand the mic over to Seneca, the younger and what you are going to hear is roughly 2000 years old and it teaches you how to deconstruct or construct a world class life. And suffice to say, Seneca and his letters, I've had an enormous impact on my life. I revisit his writing, uh, many dozens of times per year and this particular letter has affected me in myriad of ways, litter 18 on festivals and fasting. And I want you to pay particular attention to a few passages that began around two minutes and 20 seconds in with the line set aside a certain number of days and what this will teach you and Elucidat is how to practice poverty and reduce fear.

Speaker 2:          05:58          Specifically, you can think of it as inoculating yourself against fear by practicing the worst case scenarios. This is a an incredibly powerful concept that you can rehearse the things that you fear to take the fear away from them and out of yourself. It is extremely practical and I do this with short term fasting, which of course you shouldn't do without medical supervision. I'm going to say that I'm not a doctor, don't play one on the Internet. I do that with wearing the same clothing for instance and like white tee shirt and jeans for a week or so. Or you could do it by eating very cheap food, rice and beans for instance, two to $3 a day in total cost for a week, but I will let Seneca get into it because he will do a much better job than I could ever dare to attempt. I implore you to listen to more of these letters.

Speaker 2:          06:48          The 27 hours or so of audio that I just put out is in the Tao of Seneca. This is not a big money maker for me. It's something I've wanted to do for decades just to make these letters available to you guys in audio format so you can do it. Say on the way to coffee or on the way to work once per day in the morning, you can digest one of these letters and they can set you up for optimal performance in high stress situations so you don't overly react and hurt yourself and others. So you can check out the town of seneca@audible.com forward slash Tim's books. Check it out. You can listen to samples. And for those of you who downloaded it a few days ago, there was an issue with the longer on the shortness of life essay. So you can skip that. We're going to be removing it, but all the other letters should be in fine form. And this is one of my favorites. Like I said, letter 18 on festivals and fasting. Pay Attention. It's changed my life. I think he can do the same for you. And uh, if you want additional resources, I will try to include them in the show notes. So four hour work week.com forward slash podcast and check out the town of seneca@audible.com forward slash Tim's books. Enjoy

Speaker 3:          08:00          letter h on festivals and fasting. It is the month of December and yet the city is at this very moment in a sweat licenses given to the general merrymaking everything resounds with mighty preparations as if the Saturnalia differed at all from the usual business day. So true. It is that the difference is nil that I regard as correct at the remark of the man who said once December, it was a month. Now it is a year. If I had you with me, I should be glad to consult you and find out what you think should be done, whether we ought to make no change in our daily routine or whether in order not to be out of sympathy with the ways of the public, we should dine and gay or fashion and off the Toca as it is now. We Romans have changed our dress for the sake of pleasure and holiday making though in former times that was only customary when the state was disturbed and had fallen on evil days.

Speaker 3:          09:06          I am sure that if I know you are right playing the part of an umpire, you would have wished that we should be neither liked the liberty cap wrong in all ways. Nowhere in all ways unlike them, unless perhaps this is just the season when we ought to lay down the law to the soul and bid it be alone in refraining from pleasures just when the whole mob has led itself go and pleasures for this is the surest proof which a man can get his own constancy if he neither seeks to things which are seductive and a lower him to luxury nor is led into them. It shows much more courage to remain dry and sober when the mob is drunk and vomiting, but it shows greater self control to refuse to withdraw oneself and to do what the crowd does, but in a different way.

Speaker 3:          09:55          Thus, neither making oneself conspicuous nor becoming one of the crowd for one may keep holiday without extravagance. I am so firmly determined. However, to test the constancy of your mind, that drawing from the teachings of great men, I shall give you also a lesson set aside a certain number of days during which you shall be content with a scan, TST and cheapest fare with coarse and rough dress saying to yourself the while is this, the condition that I feared, it is precisely in times of immunity from care that the soul should toughen itself beforehand for occasions of greater stress and it is wild. Fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against her violence. In days of peace, the soldier performs maneuvers, throws up earthworks with no enemy in sight and wearies himself by gratuitous toil in order that he may be equal to unavoidable toil.

Speaker 3:          10:58          If you would not have a man flinched when the crisis comes, train him before it comes, such as the course which those men have followed, who in their imitation of poverty have every month come almost to want that they might never recoil from what they had so often rehearsed. You need not suppose that, I mean meals like to moans or poppers, huts or any other device which luxuries millionaires use to beguile the tedium of their lives. Let the pallet be a real one and the course cloak. Let the bread be hard and grimy. Endure all this for three or four days at a time, sometimes for more that it may be a test of yourself instead of a mere hobby. Then I assure you my dear Luke Ileus, you will leap for joy when filled with a penny worth of food and you will understand that a man's peace of mind does not depend upon fortune for even when angry she grants enough for our needs.

Speaker 3:          12:02          There is no reason, however, why you should think that you were doing anything great for you will merely be doing what many thousands of slaves and many thousands of poor men are doing every day. But you may credit yourself with this item that you will not be doing it under compulsion and that it will be as easy for you to endure it permanently as to make the experiment from time to time. Let us practice our strokes on the dummy. Let us become intimate with poverty so that fortune may not catch us off our guard, which will be rich with all the more comfort if we once learn how far poverty is from being a burden. Even Epicurus the teacher of pleasure used to observe stated intervals during which he satisfied his hunger in niggardly fashion. He wished to see whether he thereby fell short of full and complete happiness, and if so, by what amount he fell short and whether this amount was worth purchasing at the price of great effort.

Speaker 3:          13:05          At any rate, he makes such a statement in the well known letter written to poly noose in the Orrcon ship of Karina Rhinos. Indeed, he boasts that he himself lived on less than a penny, but that Metro Dorros who is progress was not yet so great. Needed a whole penny. Do you think that there can be fullness on such fair? Yes, and there was a pleasure also not that shifty and fleeting pleasure, which needs a Philip now and then, but a pleasure that is steadfast and sure four though, water, barley meal and crusts of barley bread, or not a cheerful diet, yet it is the highest kind of pleasure to be able to derive pleasure from.
