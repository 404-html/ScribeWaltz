Speaker 1:          00:01          All right. What's up guys and Shay? Carl, thanks for the inspiration. A number of you reminded me that I was supposed to do my first vlog no later than today as a start to my 30 days of continuous with logging. I'm on book deadline and it just so happens the next 30 days exactly coincides with when I'm supposed to finish the book. So maybe that'll make it exciting. Uh, and certainly anybody who is not watching this can ask me questions and I will answer for a bit. I'm not going to do it too, too, too long. Um, but today was exciting. Had A, someone land here as a researcher to help me for the next 30 days with putting things together and didn't get very much done today. To be quite frank, got to about 3:00 PM and realized I hadn't done much at all. I was just one of those days and I forget the quote, but I believe that somebody said at some point you could find the quote that courage isn't always some grant thing.

Speaker 1:          01:00          It's just going to bed and saying to yourself, I will try harder tomorrow. Along those lines. So ask me some questions guys, and then I'm going to hop off. I see they removed the timer from Facebook. So I'll just do a couple of minutes and then I'm going to get to bedtime. Jim Jacobs, how do you monetize your podcasts? Well, there's direct and indirect income. Direct income would be sponsorship. Indirect would be all the relationships and so on that I develop in terms of network through the podcast. My Favorite Mall Beck, I like close into the CFA. I like, uh, here's one she goes through. CFA is one of my favorite mall backs. Uh, thoughts on feeding dogs a raw diet. Uh, I think that uh, feeding some raw food is probably a good idea. Uh, I feed my dog some freeze dried and then reconstituted raw rabbit, lamb, things along those lines. But modern dogs are scavengers, so I think that they're pretty well adapted to eat just about everything. Uh, I do think they are omnivores, which means including a carnivorous fair. Uh, let's see. One of my drinking and not drinking any wine right now. Uh, how's my compound bow coming along? It's coming along well. I'll show you what it looks like and actually have some tweaks that I'll be making tomorrow to it.

Speaker 1:          02:38          You can make that out is currently what I'm experimenting with and training with. So I am very much looking forward to a two hour training session tomorrow with a coach. All right, well let's keep scanning. Uh, all right. Why haven't I had Neil Gaiman all the podcast yet? Well, I've tried deal is a good guy, but when he's on deadline, unlike me, perhaps he doesn't get caught up in using social media to push it off. Although I made a commitment to Shay that I would do this and to you guys. So here we are. A best advice for marriage. Uh, listen more than you talk probably. Uh, let's see. Thoughts on going from Quito to slow carb. It's a lot easier than going from slow carb Kido, so it shouldn't be too terribly difficult. Uh, row the hair hat. Nah, I think, uh, I think this is my default these days guys. Uh, Josh says your dog eats better than my wife. Well, you know, I do what I can. From my pooch, uh, thoughts on jumping in the last five pounds. This from Ashley's see the last mile in the four hour body. Uh, let's see.

Speaker 2:          04:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:09          All right. A lot of people are asking about interviews, not doing interviews right now because I'm on book deadline. So that's one of my rules. I'm not doing any media interviews and uh, alas that is non negotiable cause I have a lot to do in the next four weeks.

Speaker 2:          04:25          Uh,

Speaker 1:          04:29          uh, what is the scariest part about stepping into success? Uh, losing privacy I would say in the privacy of your family and people you care about that can be very dangerous. What is most rewarding you have in Archimedes lever for doing a lot of positive good in the world. And uh, and, and I suppose I'm answering this from the perspective of someone who's in the public eye and that's not always the case for everyone who achieved success as they may define it. Of course. Uh, but that is my, my current answer. Best piece of advice to youth. Take risks when you're young and you are the average of, actually we were reverse it. You are the average of the five people you associate with most and in terms of entrepreneurial risks, uh, ideal to take those when you don't have any dependence. No Morgan should, etc.

Speaker 2:          05:21          Uh,

Speaker 1:          05:24          all right. Landon. Yes, please. Please keep doing this. Yeah. If you guys like this, let me know. I will continue to do these. Uh, okay. And this is from Brent, which is related to the earlier answer in my pit bulls on the raw freeze dried and raw freeze dried vegetables. Their health is amazing. Yeah. Molly's health. My dog is just a fantastic, uh, okay.

Speaker 1:          05:51          Why the goatee? Oh yeah. You know, when I shave I usually use clippers and if I'm like running out to dinner and I just don't want to look like a homeless person, I'll take this stuff off. But this is delicate work here. Now you can really like Nicco lip or Nicole, nick a nostril. So this is just laziness. It's not a stylistic thing. I'll take it off eventually. I don't actually like having it. Uh, all right. I look tired. I am tired. I'm on book deadline and I have a month left. So, uh, no huge surprise there. But yeah, I am tired. That's why I liked hired a business coach. Would I hire, I don't know how to hire a business coach. I'm afraid. Uh, would I interview Trent? Reznor absolutely. Uh, big booty, Asian woman. Where are they and how do I find them? Not sure I can help you there. Maybe you go to Brazil and find some mixed blood, I suppose. Uh, let's see.

Speaker 1:          06:56          How do you get rid of bags under your eyes? Sleep less. Coffee and coconut oil topically coffee is usually the culprit for me. That's what gives me bags under my eyes. Uh, alright. Longest time of held my breath is actually over seven minutes with hyperbaric oxygen treatment and Wim Hoff method and a few other things. But under normal circumstances with some breath training, I've done more than four minutes with David Blaine. I did three minutes and I want to say 33 seconds. But in general, my breath hold times are very, very bad. So if I were to hold my breath right now, I'd probably be 45 seconds. Something like that. You can do a lot with training, but you don't want to do any type of, um, very rarely want to do any kind of breath work related to extending breath hold time because you're blowing off CO2, uh, around water. I highly advise against it. Um, I know a number of people who've had horrifyingly dangerous shallow water blackouts from that. Uh, let's see, best sales book out there for beginner. I would get persuasion by cal Deni. Alton Brown, the podcast. Yeah, I'd love to have them on a low volume. Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:14          Why Paris for the trip? Because it's a beautiful city and I never, I'd never spent any real time there. Last time I was in Paris I couldn't afford a real meal, so I was staying in hostels where people were farming and having sex and so on, which is fun I suppose. But I was nice to have a change of pace and do Paris, uh, without any real constraints. Alright. Tried oil pulling and sardine. It's worked for whitening teeth. Congratulations. Rigor. I believe it. Uh, am I still on Kido? Uh, Stephanie? No, I'm not in Quito right now, although I am consuming powdered oil from quest nutrition. Uh, Kido is very boring and um, it was the choir's a level of adherence and I'm not willing to follow right now with, uh, with the book stuff. All right. I'm just going to take a few more guys and then I'm going to bed because I'm tired. Look at me. Uh, all right. A wash wash. She, Robert, you're welcome. Good Day from Melbourne Cup Day. Uh, let's see. What would you, what would you set as an average budget for a year of vagabonding? Well, that varies tremendously and it also, um, I think implies that you need to make all that money in advance, which I'm not sure is the case. I know it's not the case. Um, so I would actually just refer to the book vagabonding pick it up. That'll help you with that question. Uh, right.

Speaker 1:          09:59          I haven't read Ray Pete's work. Uh,

Speaker 1:          10:04          two to three actions. Would I take move to the bay area with the goal of starting a tech business? Mark, I would volunteer at events where you can interact with people above your pay grade. So find organizations handling events, nonprofits and whatnot, and volunteer and do a great job. Even if takes you a while to meet any of the higher ups or people you'd like to meet. Uh, best book to learn about stoicism. There are quite a few. I think that Ryan holiday does good work with the obstacle's the way ego is the enemy. Uh, I, I really think you can dive right into the deep end of the pool and get something like the Tao of Seneca. Um, those, those, that's the audio version of the moral letters to local leaders and you can get a paperback version of that called letters from a Stoic, uh, which is also very, very good. Okay. Can't do too many along ones here. Metallica eighties or after, I would say master of puppets and justice for all. That's it. For me, a handstand work has, has a stalled a bit, a damaged a ligament in my right wrist doing ring work. I thought I actually broke my wrist. So unfortunately my wrist and goes back about that far right now. So I'm not doing any handstand word. All right.

Speaker 1:          11:40          Who are you and why are you in my newsfeed? I Dunno. I know who I am. I don't know why in your newsfeed if you don't have any interest in me, any book on how to not get offended easily. Yes. And this will be where I stopped this particular evening. Um, this blog as it were. Um, the book is radical acceptance by Tara Brock. If you have issues with getting offended easily, if you have issues with anger, a few issues with any, a runaway emotions, reactive emotions. It's a fantastic book. I loved it so much that I had her on the podcast. She's an incredible, incredible woman. So it also encouraged checking out the, uh, checking out the podcast with Tara Brock. Obra c h.
