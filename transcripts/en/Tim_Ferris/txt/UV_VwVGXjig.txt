Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. Now I'm a cybernetic organism.

Speaker 2:          00:00:23       This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way, set it and forget it. Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than two and a half billion dollars under management. In fact, some of my very good friends, investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. So the question is why? Why is it so popular? Why is it unique? Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only pay pennies on the dollar for them, and this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations, bloated sales teams, et cetera. And I'll come back to that in a second. I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their advice, run with it, do it yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       You can do that or as I would, you can set it and forget it and here's why. The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't great investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax loss harvesting, rebalancing your portfolio, cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large amounts of money over longer periods of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned, since it's using software instead of retail locations, etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely impossible right off the bat, you never pay commissions or account fees for everything. They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for free. If you use my link, wealthfront.com forward slash Tim, that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.

Speaker 2:          00:02:11       Now, normally when I have a sponsor on the shows because I use them and recommend them, in this case, it's a little different. I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal. They wanted to sponsor this podcast, but because of sec regulations, companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials. So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast, but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant amount of my own money, at least for me, uh, in the team and the company itself. So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client. Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener, you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account.

Speaker 3:          00:04:29       Amelia Boone has been called the Michael Jordan of obstacle course racing since the sports inception. She's a mask and she's laughing more than 30 victories and 50 podiums. Her major victories include the Spartan race world championship 2003 Spartan race series point champion 2013 and 2015 and she's the only three time winner of the world's toughest mudder, 2012 14 and 15. She's also three times finisher of the death race and dabbles in ultra running in all of her first pair of time, which I'm sure is massive, uh, and has a flourishing and high velocity career to boot. Emilia, welcome to the show. Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate you taking the time. And I thought we could start with a photo. So I was doing research for this and went to your website, which is Amelia Boone racing yes.com. And can you describe the photo that takes up most of the real estate on that page?

Speaker 4:          00:05:26       Well, so the website needs a bit about dating. I'm not, um, a great website person. So if, you know, if anybody wants to volunteer, be my guest, but it's a picture of me. I'm, I'm in the middle of barbed wire and I'm crawling on my hands and knees and I'm just kind of looking around, semi perplexed. Um, and to me that just kind of encapsulates everything that I do. I'm bleeding from, you know, my knees, my elbows, and it's just crawling through the mind, having a good time.

Speaker 3:          00:05:59       Microcosm. Exactly. The face of obstacle course racing. Exactly. It's not pretty. And we met through Scott Keneally who is putting together and may be finished by the time people see this in available rise of the suffer fests. So suffer fest mentioned the blood, you mentioned the dirt, the barbed wire. Uh, maybe we can explain to people who are unfamiliar what obstacle course racing is with the example of the world's toughest mudder. You describe what on earth that is.

Speaker 4:          00:06:31       Well, so that's kind of like the extreme of obstacle course racing, right? But in general, I mean, I think people have been familiar with Spartan races. With tough mudders, you see people jumping over fire and crawling under barbed wire and um, it's just, you know, you're running along and you have a wall to climb and you're jumping through mud and you're using everything that you have, um, like it's just completely physical experience. Um, but, so I got involved back in 2011 when I ran a tough matter with friends and then signed up for, there was this race that was announced called world's toughest mudder, and they're like, you for 24 hours are going to run as many laps of a course, a tough mudder course as you can, and it's going to be in December in New Jersey. Um, and so it like a bombing. I was like, man, I can't think of anywhere.

Speaker 4:          00:07:29       I'd rather go. Then, uh, uh, New Jersey in December. Um, and, uh, so a bunch of us sign, I think a thousand people signed up for this, like, and nobody had any idea what they were getting into. You know, we'd all run like a tough mudder or run a spartan race. Um, but nobody had ever really done it for 24 hours. Um, so we went out that day and people were trying to figure out like, how do you stay warm for 24 hours when you're in and out of water and, um, you know, and it's December and it's New Jersey. Um, so we decided that we would wear wetsuits or that wetsuits would be the way and to stay warm and other people form of triathletes, we're like, oh, there's no way you can run for 24 hours in a wet suit. You'll die. You know, like the how your thermo regulation will be all off or whatever. Um, but we did and, and like halfway through, so we all go out. Um, and it's like 30 degrees outside New Jersey. After the first lap, there are about a thousand people that would start, I'd say maybe 850 people dropped out first lap, like, like done

Speaker 3:          00:08:40       what, like an hour or like a few hours into it?

Speaker 4:          00:08:42       Probably like an hour and a half. And I remember going back in my tent and like just shivering uncontrollably being like, what am I doing? Like what, what is going on here? You know, um, you like walk past like the Med tense and there were just people and they're like lane on cots. They were using like c√©line bags to like warm, say lean to put under people's arms, like a, like armpits to keep them warm. And, um, so a few of us decided to keep that we, you're going to keep going. Um, and I think by, you know, the night descended on us, it was like 2:00 AM we were like walking through the Wa wading through water and like there was ice forming where like, you know, breaking holes in the ice. And I'm sitting here being like, what am I doing? Like what am I doing? But at the same time he's having so much fun, um, and out of a thousand people that started that race, 12th finished and I was one of two women. Um, and uh, so that was, that was the start of it all. And I, uh, for some unknown reason, I remember when I finished that race, 24 hours later, I was like, never again, never again. And then like two weeks later I'm like, sign me up. What's, what's next? Sign me up. So, and the,

Speaker 3:          00:10:04       the drive to do this type of thing. There's so many different approaches I could take to try to dissect this. But are your parents very surprised? Not surprised at all or somewhere in between?

Speaker 4:          00:10:16       Um, I would say somewhere in between because, so I've always been like the high achiever type A, you know, um, you know, I'm, I wouldn't be at the top of my class. I wouldn't be, you know, like graduating summa cum loud and going to law school and everything like that. So I think, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       I read that one of your law school classmates said that you would find a way to be competitive or to win in anything if it were folding laundry or otherwise.

Speaker 4:          00:10:43       Oh yeah. Hey, I like if I was like in law school, these set of like my exercise is like getting on the elliptical, you know, like everybody else and I would like find a way to compete next on the person, like on the elliptical next to me. Um, him, those are the days. Um, but so I think the drive and the determination like that doesn't phase, you know, like my parents like par for the course. Um, but in terms of like how it manifested itself, cause I've always been kind of like a creature of routine and like I don't like surprise. It is and I want to be able to like, like plan everything and know everything. And with obstacle course racing, it's so unknown when you go out there, like for the most part, um, when it first started, like they won't even show, you wouldn't see of course map. So you want to know what was out there. And so I think that part of their kind of like, wow. Or like when I would sign up for the death race and they would be like 72 hours in the wood, it's then you don't know what you're going to be doing but have at it. And so that was very kind of like a typical personality for me. Uh, where did you grow up? I grew up in Portland, Oregon and Portland. And what did your parents do growing up? So my dad was an insurance

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       adjuster and, uh, my mom was, uh, an environmental consultant. Where did the competitive edge come from?

Speaker 4:          00:12:04       I have not said it's funny. He's like, they have no idea. And like I have, I think it's gotta be a Nate to be totally honest because my parents were always like, you can get C's, that's fine or you can, you can play this sport or you don't have to play this sport or as long as you're happy you just do what makes you happy. And so there was more Portland. It's never, it was never like, if you think of like sage parents, I was like the opposite of that. Um, so they were always telling me to like calm down and take a break. But

Speaker 3:          00:12:37       Stat, I just thought it worked well. Yeah. Right. Do you have siblings? I do. I have an older sister. Older sister, yeah. She also competitively driven. I mean we're pretty much like in terms of personalities, like opposites, polar opposites, polar opposites. She's extremely successful. But she came out about it from a very like, you know, way more laid back and you know, like low key approach. What to do you want to be when you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up? I wanted to be a lawyer when I grow up. And you nailed it.

Speaker 4:          00:13:11       I nailed it. I was one of those people that I was like, if I set my mind is something that I'm going to do it. So I would for lunch every day when I was like at home during the summer and my mom and I would always watch Perry Mason and I was like, man, Perry Mason like being an attorney, he gets the bad guy to confess

Speaker 3:          00:13:32       every single episode. That's gotta be cool. Pretty amazing. It's great. I remember Perry Mason,

Speaker 4:          00:13:39       so then I went to law school and then realize that's not actually what happens. And Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:13:45       you were more a Perry Mason than about lock person. Yes, yes I was a Perry Mason person. The, so you decide you want to be a lawyer and did that change that waiver or did that stick with you all the way up until the point that you became a lawyer?

Speaker 4:          00:14:01       I think it it pretty much, you know, I kind of thought of different things in college. I really got, I really fell in love with anthropology and primates and so like, you know, I really love studying. Yeah. Monkeys. And I thought for a pardon me, I'm like, maybe I should go to Madagascar and hang out with the Lemurs, um, or I could go get a lot degree. Um, so I double majored in anthropology and political science and then decided to take the safe route and go with a lot of degree.

Speaker 3:          00:14:35       You Washington, uh, Washington University University, yes. Right. And uh, what did you do athletically in high school or college? So growing up I was kind of like a, I would say like a Jack of all athlete and that

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       I played, I was always on like a club team, like asa softball or club soccer, um, you know, traveling basketball. And so I'd play year round. Um, and I was always good. I was on like the competitive, the highest level teams. I was never like a super standout Allstar in any one single sport. Um, so, you know, I played year round, I know would shuttle back and forth from practice to practice, um, throughout middle school and high school. But I started like paring that down and I actually as high school progressed, I got more and more into musical theater and show choir and singing and I kind of gave up sports and athletics. So in college I actually, I sang in an acapella group, but I know sports,

Speaker 3:          00:15:34       no sports in college, no sports recreationally. Were you a runner? I would go

Speaker 4:          00:15:39       run to like stay in shape, but running in St Louis kind of sucked. So I mean it just like, it was either like hot and muggy or like freezing cold. Um, so yeah, I didn't really, didn't really do anything.

Speaker 3:          00:15:54       Let's say I'm going to jump around a little bit like memento, but, uh, if, if we were to look at say the world's toughest mudder. Yeah. What do your routines look like? You said you're a creature of habit as am I, the hours before the competition, let's just say like the day of. What are your routines?

Speaker 4:          00:16:14       Um, so I always get up like super early before. Well I get up super early in general every morning, super early. So my alarm typically goes off like right around 4:00 AM.

Speaker 3:          00:16:27       Um, that's what you didn't flinch on us. We were talking about Jocko Willink, the seal commander, and he wakes up at four zero response. I'm like, Oh, another one. Here we are

Speaker 4:          00:16:41       4:00 AM. Um, and uh, so actually on race days it's almost like I sleep in a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:16:50       When did the races start? Typically?

Speaker 4:          00:16:52       Um, they generally will start. World's toughest mudder is a little bit different. That one starts at two in the afternoon now. But um, like just a regular obstacle was raised with generally be like seven 30 is the,

Speaker 3:          00:17:03       I got starting at 2:00 PM. So let's use that example. You wake up at four.

Speaker 4:          00:17:08       Oh yeah. Then I drive myself crazy for the next however many hours twiddling my thumbs.

Speaker 3:          00:17:13       What, uh, what other type of body prep, uh, or mental prep do you do? Yeah, we use

Speaker 4:          00:17:21       the distraction technique. So I tried to not think about really, cause I can sit there and make myself miserable over and over, like like picturing the race or whatever. But I find it helpful actually. Um, I actually do a lot of work in the mornings before races. Um, so I'll catch up on emails and I'll do things from like my attorney life. Um, and um, then in terms of like body prep, I, you know, I do a lot of like foam rolling, things like that. Um, the older I get, the more I realized like I can't just like jump out of bed in the morning and like, yeah, be spry as a chicken. So

Speaker 3:          00:18:01       you're 32, is that right? At 32 32 32 I would imagine you still have a couple of good years left in you, but is the whole lot worse cell over time, the mobility work that you do, what, what, what does that, what does that actually look like and in detail?

Speaker 4:          00:18:17       Um, so I generally carry like an arsenal of every single, like from a golf ball, a Lacrosse Ball, a softball, a foam roller. Um, and so I'm really focused on loosening up hips, loosening up hamstrings, um, and every single different little torture device has, you know, it's the golf ball is for the foot, the Lacrosse ball works for awhile on the glutes, you know, the softball is great for the hamstrings. Um, so I'm just, you know, getting the muscles kind of warmed up and loosened and perhaps, um, and um, I do, I actually from a lot of various and nagging injuries that I've always had, I have like little physical therapy routines that I always do too. You know, like to get your glutes activated and Ben thinks that,

Speaker 3:          00:19:05       yeah. What type of movements do you do for glute activation? Others is fantastic exercise called Jane Fonda's that if anybody's ever been at least for Glick, glutamine or

Speaker 4:          00:19:16       where you're sitting there and you're like, man, I should really have leg warmers on. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:19:20       I said the you're talking about, is this like the bent leg sort of, uh, the reverse thighmaster pretty much, yeah. It's the reverse thighmaster [inaudible] on your side.

Speaker 4:          00:19:29       Yeah. Yeah. And like variation, like doing fire hydrants like that too. You know, like a dog lifting his legs. There's all super sexy things that people like. Like if you're, if you do them in a gym, people are like, oh God that was that girl.

Speaker 3:          00:19:43       Well I tell you, I think that you probably get more attention to in fire hydrants than I do, at least unless I'm in a gym in the Castro. It might be a similar experience. Uh, and do you use any other modalities for prep? Do you use any stem, do you use anything like that pre-race or is that set aside for other, other purposes?

Speaker 4:          00:20:05       Pre race, not so much. No, that's more like recovery, like recovery. I'll like compression boots and stem.

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       Now our compression boots, the compression socks are these actual boots,

Speaker 4:          00:20:18       the boots that inflate the air pressure chambers that um, you know, like kind of like flush at supposedly flush out lactic acid. So, um,

Speaker 3:          00:20:31       that's, and that's post race. That would be post race. Yeah. So, well, let's talk about post race then. So in terms of facilitating recovery and so you finish the race. Yeah. And is it true that you have not slept for days on end after races or is that an exaggeration? It is

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       true. So any long race that I've done, like we're always having a matter as a 24 hour race. Um, I've done other races that are longer 48 that are 60 hours. Um, and I feel like it's, I can't sleep afterwards and you feel like you should be able to, you're like, wow, I was just up for three days straight, um, running around in the woods. But my mind, your body is so physically exhausted, but my mind is still on so much like on overdrive that I just, I can't, so I mean, for instance, this year, um, after worlds have a smarter, we all went, there was a group of staying at a house, um, sat around, we're drinking beers, watching football game and I was like, man, I should really be getting drunk right now or something like that because like I'm drinking, I've been running around in a wetsuit all night long. I'm like, I don't feel anything. Like, I don't feel any effects of the booze or anything like that. I was like, it just must be this adrenaline still pumping through me. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:21:44       Um, did other people have the same similar experience for, is that unique to you?

Speaker 4:          00:21:49       I think no, because everyone else just kind of passed out and went to bed. So I was like, hey guys, like say okay, everyone's asleep right now. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:22:00       And would indeed when you cross the finish line, yeah. Uh, as such, you're done. W W what type of recovery starts? What are the, what are the actions that you take in the hours following the race?

Speaker 4:          00:22:12       So I think one of the most important things that people should do, that they don't have to stay moving. People want to finish a race and especially a long one. Um, and just like Lana couch or go to sleep is the worst thing you can do cause you're gonna wake up and like not be able to move anything. So I generally try and stay walking. I try and stay active. Um, you know, I will hop again on like a foam roller or something like that. And try it. You don't want to be too aggressive afterwards. Like you're not going to like hop on a softball and roll out your glutes because that's going to hurt really bad. Um, but then just try, just try and stay active. And that is in like the next day too, you know, like gentle movement and things like that.

Speaker 3:          00:22:58       Um, do you use, do you, are you a proponent of ice, ice baths or anything like that or not?

Speaker 4:          00:23:04       If I can't, so I mean, I'm not a scientist. Whatever. I all I know is what works for me. I know people have different opinions. If I can get into an ice bath, I will, but it needs to be like immediately. So there have been races where there's like a lake right next to me and I'm like, if it's called enough, then I'll just go jump in the lake and kind of use that as an ice bath. But if you're waiting like four or five hours, I don't really think it's going to end up helping you in the end.

Speaker 3:          00:23:32       And, uh, I want you to correct me if I'm wrong, 2012, [inaudible] world's toughest mudder. How did you place,

Speaker 4:          00:23:41       uh, I one for females, but I was second overall in 2002nd place overall. Yeah. How did that feel? So it was a really interesting race. Um, how many competitors? This was again, there were about 1200 people I believe is is generally every year. Um, so there are about 1200 people. Uh, it was once they moved it to November, so it was supposedly a tiny bit warmer, but actually it wasn't, it was actually colder in 2012 and it was in 2011. Um, and uh, I guess I didn't realize, I knew I was winning for women and at this point we were about 24 hours or getting close to the end and I was about 80 some odd miles in and a, as on the last lap, they were like, okay, well you've won for women, but the guy that's winning is like nine minutes ahead of you. So we're on this last lap.

Speaker 4:          00:24:35       Um, you know, going, we'll end up with 90 miles and there are all these people from tough mudder headquarters and like all these matters just like yelling at me, willing me to go on because all they want me to do is to win overall, you know, and you're so tired at that point and like so kind of delirious that I guess it didn't even realize like the import of that situation. Like how massive that would have been. Um, cause I was just like, leave me alone. I hurt, I'm tired. Freezing. Like I'm covered in like 10, like millimeters of neoprene. Like just, you know, and I'm like, I get it. I'm trying to move fast for my body, won't let me. Um, but yeah, so I ended up finishing about nine minutes behind the male overall winner. Um, and uh, yeah, so it was pretty, I, it didn't really hit me until like a day or two later where I was like, oh, I was that close.

Speaker 4:          00:25:31       Ah, okay. So did you not, did you feel pride about finishing second overall or where you just, were you more disappointed that you didn't finish first? Overall, no, no, no. I completely felt pride and it's actually, it's one of these things now that when I race, um, it's almost, I kind of look at the standing is cool to win, you know, as it, as a female, you know, it'd be like, Oh, I'm, I'm the female winner, but I more look of like, I have a con consistent goal of try and place like top 10 overall, you know, I want to be, I don't care, sex, gender, like I just want to be, I want to compete to the best, you know, overall. So the next female finisher, what place was she? She actually in 2012. She was third. Oh, no kidding. Yeah. Yeah. Deanna Blagg. She's amazing. She, uh, she's amazing. She's absolutely amazing. And um, and she's like 46 year old is years old from Australia. Yeah. Just crushes it up there. Yeah. All my excuses. Right. And she's like the nicest woman in the entire world too. So how does her strategy

Speaker 3:          00:26:46       for training or in the race itself differ from younger, a younger competitor?

Speaker 4:          00:26:55       I would say, I think probably anything. As you get older, you realize you, you don't go out as fast, you know, it's kind of like as you age, you're never going to like out sprint, you know, at 20 something year old. Um, but you tend to have more mental strength and more mental grit. The older you get. I'm just, because you're like, whatever, this isn't a big deal, you know, like you're more mature and you can deal with pain and suffering. Um, so I think that it's just kind of more like a slow and steady, you know, and, but just keep going one foot in front of the other. Um, but to that extent, that's kind of how I operate too, is that I'm never, I'm notoriously slow out of the gate. Um, you know, in, in the beginning of races I'm always like struggling to catch up with everyone, which is why I like longer racist. Um, so then, you know, but it's just kind of like, you know, picking them off one by one

Speaker 3:          00:27:50       when, when you are actually before that, so suffering. Let's talk about suffering. Yeah. Uh, I was just reading a letter of Seneca's is that guy that's the bust on the kitchen counter over there. Uh, related to think it's on fasting and celebrations, something related to that, but it talks about exposing yourself to suffering along the lines of the more, the more you sweat during peace, the less you bleed during war. Right. And so I practice fasting among, for, for many reasons among those being practicing hardship, right. So I can endure it in other areas of my life. Do you do that in other places in your life where you deliberately expose yourself to different types of pain or suffering as a practice? Or is it limited to the suffer fest? I mean,

Speaker 4:          00:28:48       with the, with the amount that I race, um, there's plenty of suffering involved in and, uh, in that sufficient, I know, um, I guess, uh, I can't do the fascinating thing I got and I'm not good with that. Um, once you're burning a lot more calories than I am, and like if I don't eat every few hours, like it's, it's trouble for anyone around me. Um, but I, I always try to train in less than ideal conditions if I can. Um, because I think that that, uh, adds a lot to me. It's super easy to go out for a run when it's 70 degrees and sunny. But like when I was living in Chicago, which I did for the past six years, um, if there's like a windstorm or a thunderstorm, I'm like, let me out, you know, like, let me perfect time to go around. There was one time that I, um, they had shut down the lake front path because the were coming over and I was like, fuck it, I'm running anyway. Um, and apparently police don't like that. Um, so as I'm like, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:29:49       Yeah, I'd love to see that. Please tell me the police tried to catch you on foot. Did that?

Speaker 4:          00:29:53       No. Well, there was a, it was a bicycle cop who I was actually surprised that he was like out in the weather as well. Um, but uh, yeah, and he was like, you can't, this is shut down. I'm like, I'm just training. No big deal. No big deal. Yeah. Did that, did that sway his, know his position and no, not at, not at all.

Speaker 5:          00:30:14       Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:30:16       so training in less than ideal conditions,

Speaker 5:          00:30:19       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:30:21       when you look back at

Speaker 5:          00:30:24       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:30:25       the races that you've run, the obstacle,

Speaker 5:          00:30:27       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:30:28       of course races, what has been the most challenging obstacle for you and what has been the most dangerous?

Speaker 5:          00:30:38       MMM,

Speaker 4:          00:30:41       I would say in terms of challenging, I always send you, so there's always, um, I'm notoriously awful at throwing a spear. Um, and uh, it's well known communities that I can throw a spirit saved my life. Um, and so inspiring races, there's always a spear throw and it's actually his costs me like tons of different races. Um, and it's funny because like it's one of those things that if you practice you would probably be pretty good at it. But

Speaker 3:          00:31:11       like the, I like puzzled right now. Okay. How about a throat? His fear? No, like super come loudy like ace lawyer and I thought it was like world champion racer. Okay. So continue not to interrupt and I can throw spirit. No, no, no. But it seems like the other thing you would sit down and study and master,

Speaker 4:          00:31:34       you would think so. I actually think that I'm playing softball my entire life kind of screwed me because I would like try and throw it like you throw a softball, which we do under, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:31:42       the underhand spear Wah Wah Wah. She throws like a girl. No, no, no. But come on, the pitching does is completely different. Right? It's completely you referring to the pitching folks don't get, don't get, don't get all riled up.

Speaker 4:          00:31:59       Um, so that's always been, it's always been a challenge for me and I finally figured it out. But it's one of those things that like, it's a, it's such a silly thing to struggle with, I think. Um, but I guess that also could be the most dangerous because if you miss a spear, throw, throwing somebody around. No, I'm joking. Uh, but there are some, in terms of danger for obstacles, like there are times where I'm sitting there being like, why hasn't somebody died? And these w Oh, I take that back. That's really bad because to me it did die. Um, but, uh, yeah, but dangerous spart yeah. Um, you know, when you're, when you're racing for 24 hours are like really long and you're like climbing super tall things. Like in the middle of the night, I'm always thinking they're being like, man, one misstep and I'm falling backwards and I'm, you know, and I've taken some big diggers off of walls just because you're so tired. You just said diggers meaning falls, awful falls, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:32:54       So how, then these are walls that you're climbing over, similar to a military obstacles,

Speaker 4:          00:33:00       correct? Correct. Yeah. Yeah. How tall are they? Um, they very, um, you know, some are AP, some are 10 feet, some are 12 feet, some have ropes to help you up. Then, you know, others, you know, there's big, like kind of like ladders. I'm, you know, like military tack ladders, you know, that like climbing out, um, climbing out of water. So there was one time, I think it was in 2012, world's toughest mudder as you climbed one of those out of a lake and it was like 20 feet up, but it was in the middle of the night. It was like frozen. Um, and so you're like, it's like iced over and you're like, I'm going to die, I'm gonna die. Um, but yeah, so there's all these little dangerous and people, you know, talk about the electricity involved in tough mudders. Um, which is like a very disconcerting, because I've been hit so hard sometimes that I'd like blacked out from the electricity.

Speaker 4:          00:33:51       Yeah. This, this obstacle to folks. So, well, so there's a couple variations of it, but, um, basically there's these wires hanging. The worst variation was called electric eel. And um, you crawl through water that's about like two, three inches deep and there's wires hanging down over your head. Um, and so you're, you're army crawling through it and your head is hitting these wires and we'll occasionally, we'll like shock you, Vacu, and it's, is it 10,000 bolts? I don't, I don't, or there's the difference between voltage and wattage and I don't really understand what it is, but one will kill you in one won't. Um, so this is supposedly the stuff that won't kill you. Um, but if you get hit and just the right way and you're in water, I'm like, I got hit so hard and like I, my face smacked down through the water and hit my head and then I like blacked out. I started crawling the wrong way. And now it's one of those things that like once you like do like that, like something like that happens to you. You just have like this insane fear of it, you know? And so it's the worst for me now. Like trying to pressure the trepidation beforehand. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:35:08       the people who get injured or even the fatalities. What are, what are the most common causes?

Speaker 4:          00:35:14       Honestly, I think the vast majority of injuries are things like rolled ankles, broken ankles. You saw what you would expect. I mean, I don't think they've never, and the, and the, you know, the one, the one unfortunate death that I think that we know of that have occurred or deaths that have occurred have been like, you know, heat, stroke, dehydration, like the things that you would like ultra marathon. Exactly. Exactly. It's not surprisingly for something that is fraught with electricity and spears and you know, like climbing up super tall things and crawling Barb wire, like nobody's like lost. And I don't think from a Barb wire, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:35:52       so my buddy's got zapped in the eye with one of those electric, uh, when, uh, one of those electric lines, he was not, he was not super happy about it.

Speaker 4:          00:35:59       Well, I mean, the worst of the worst extent of my injuries are really like my body is just covered in barbed wire scars like scratches. You can, I can show you them. But you know, I looked like I was attacked by a tiger that was wondering what kind of cat you had everywhere. Rope Burns, you know, I'm never going to be a leg model. 50 shades of tough mudder. Yeah, I've heard of,

Speaker 5:          00:36:26       uh, the, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:36:28       surgery. I want to talk about your knee surgery. Yeah. Why did you get knee surgery and uh, let's start with that. What was the, what was the reason for the knee surgery? So I, um,

Speaker 4:          00:36:39       last summer heading into like world champion seed Shep season ended up tearing my meniscus and, um, it was in training, it was in training. It was like, I was like running in Chicago and they're like, potholes everywhere. And then the like one of those, like free is one of those freak things where you'd like step in something and you're like, ah, ah, my leg and I'm, then I'm like running it off. I'm like, oh wait, this actually isn't okay. Um, and uh, so, you know, I went and I had an MRI. I thought it was like, okay, but they're like my leg. I kept locking and I had to like physically unlock it. And so I think with certain meniscus tears that happens. And so, um, they just, they had to go in there and, um, you know, shaved down the meniscus and then, um, there were some like tibial plateau fracture and whatever fancy. So I just had to stay off it for a bit. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:37:30       When did, you said that happened? How much long, how much later did you compete?

Speaker 4:          00:37:35       So, so I raced again, eight weeks post surgery. Um, and I remember asking my

Speaker 3:          00:37:44       surgeon, this was the world's toughest mudder, correct? 2014,

Speaker 4:          00:37:48       correct? I did. So I remember asking my surgeon and I was like, so how long until I'm back running? He was like, maybe like four weeks and I go, so could I feasibly run our race like eight weeks later? He's like, yeah. And I was like, how long of a race? And cause he was like thinking like I was going to run a five. Yeah. I was like, why? It's like 24 hours. It was just like, so I never got his blessing for it, but I did anyway. So

Speaker 3:          00:38:21       what did you do,

Speaker 5:          00:38:23       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:38:24       between the, what steps did you take to rehab it? I mean, what were the most important things that you did?

Speaker 4:          00:38:30       I mean, I, I think most importantly for me it was, it was getting into, I got into physical therapy like the next day. Like I had the best physical therapist in Chicago and she was fantastic. She'd worked with me through other injuries and things like that. So we were pretty aggressive and rehabbing it. And then I just did whatever else I could to work around it to stay in shape. You know, I think when people get injured, they forget that there's so much that they still can do. So, um, I had a gym that had a skier, um, which if you've ever seen, it's like a rower turned upside down and you pull it like you're cross country skiing. Um, so you know, for two weeks that was the only like really like thing I could do to like keep my heart rate up. Um, and standby skier, hand bikes gear. Um, I could row with one leg, but then that kind of like throws. Then my other leg was just getting massive. Um, but you know, and I would do, I like wrote a 10 K on earth skier did 10 k, which is the worst kind of torture you can like do to yourself, you know. Um, and just finding another, finding other ways to work around it.

Speaker 3:          00:39:35       What other rehab modalities did you find most helpful personally?

Speaker 4:          00:39:41       Um, did a lot of like stem for to kit cause I think when you go in you do electrical stimulation. Yeah. Um, so when you go in and you like cut open your knee or whatever, it shuts down your quad. And so the main thing is getting your quad to then come back and function again. And so stem is really helpful and um, you know like retraining that um, to get it to fire. Um, so that was, you know, that was helpful. Um, I'm really like I'm a huge fan of like art graston them with those

Speaker 3:          00:40:18       people and not from their air t active release technique type of myofascial release, which is super depending on how you have it done can be super unpleasant if you're having like your, so as worked on, Oh my God, I love that pain though. I think it's like you like having some like, yeah, like therapist and with their like ridge hand knuckle deep into your, so as I had, just as a side note, all right, so I'm going to give a shout out to this Guy Jesse Burdick who was a power lifter who trains with a friend of mine named Mark Bell. I mean they do a lot of training separately, but I think he pulls a, Jesse, I apologize if I get this wrong, but maybe he can dead lift more and more than 700 pounds. He's a big unit. Yeah. And we were getting ready to do, he also does manual therapies.

Speaker 3:          00:40:58       We're getting ready to do an art session and the end. So he puts me on a table and kind of drapes like one leg off and he goes, the safe word is brisket and then just proceeds to annihilate my hips. So the basic idea folks, if for those of you don't know it, they are t and please correct me if, if I get this wrong, but if you have adhesions, let's just say with scar tissue between adjacent tissues you apply pressure, manual pressure, a therapist applies pressure between those tissues. Then has you perform motions like an overhead kind of reaching movement for the lads to break apart those adhesions. Graston which is having really thick butter knives scraped all over you. Right. Uh, I read that you use something and I'm embarrassed. I actually don't know what this is. Dry needling. Oh yeah. What is that? Sounds terrible. Apparently

Speaker 4:          00:41:46       legal in California, which is why you probably don't know. It's like acupuncture on crack. Um, so an acupuncture is actually rightfully, probably hate it cause I think they, they think they think it's kind of like a bastardization of what they do. But so when you go and you get acupuncture and the goal is like to not feel the needle dry needling, you actually are sticking the needle in the muscle valley to try and get it to twitch. And the twitch is like the release. So, um, it's like, and you don't leave the needles in there, so you're basically like poking at a muscle to try. Yeah. And the worst ever don't ever let anybody dry needle your calf, your gas struck. Because like if you get in underneath like right and like the hamstring insertion, like you will feel like you got shot in the back of your legs. And it can also be kind of addictive because like, you have somebody like poking around your group meet and you feel as twitch and it's almost like this like release of the muscle. And what does it do for you? Um, it's supposed to, you know, for super tight muscles. The idea a really. Yeah. Huh. So, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:42:58       I had the, I had this, this nutty experience, uh, and if people want to see photos of me in excruciating pain getting art done by Charles Poliquin, and you can see that in the four hour body, it's kind of hilarious. But the IDA separate experience with something called, uh, let's see. I guess it would be called, uh, I want to say neuro puncture, but I might be getting that wrong. This was done with Dr. Lee Wolfer many years ago with shallow injections of prolo solutions. So, yeah. And what happened though, and we improvised this point is she was working on my infraspinatus. So this is a rotator cuff muscle that at all that always gets sore for me. And I read it. I had reconstructive shoulder surgery and I probably sit like a collage, like chest collapsed, uh, the, you know, Gollum when I'm typing also, which is no good.

Speaker 3:          00:43:51       But, uh, she was working on my infraspinatus and she was doing the, the kind of sewing machine approach with these, these shallow injections. And, and we both here, and it sounded like someone was scraping ice off a windshield. And it turned out that I had these, these just this huge clump of calcium deposits at the back of both shoulders and shit. So we ended up just, well, we, it's the royal we, she ended up, uh, using the needle basically as a scraper to kind of break down these calcium deposits. And what was fascinating is no shoulder pain for months afterward after chiseling these out wasn't the most pleasant thing in the world. Uh, so the dry needling, now that you're here in California, no more sad, sad times. No more gluten meet posts. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:44:40       yeah. I go back to my lack of market dry needling. Yeah. Well sometimes they'll, I'll get acupuncture done and I'm going to be like, can you guys like, and like they'll accidentally, a muscle will trigger and release and I'm like, oh, that's fantastic dude. But I'm honest people, I'm like, I'll try anything once. And in terms of like recovery or like, you know, I'll just throw the, especially because for most professional athletes that they do, you know, they, their job is like to be a professional athlete and then to like Rehab and recover and spend all that time. I'm like training early in the mornings I go and I sit at a desk for 10 hours a day and then I like try and like train and get in the evenings. It's not an ideal, like I'm not doing my body any favors for like with what I'm putting it through. What uh,

Speaker 3:          00:45:29       what, what is your nutritional look like? Uh, and then we were were were you serious earlier when I asked you about breakfast? Hey, we'll, what was your answer? And we were doing a sound check and I asked her what she had for breakfast. What was your hazard?

Speaker 4:          00:45:43       Uh, pop dot pop tarts. Um, no, that's actually the poptarts has become kind of this like running joke in the obstacle racing community with me because when I won the spartan race world championships in 2013 I was so far ahead, I was like 2030 minutes ahead of the next woman and the race director yells at me, he goes, million, what'd you have for breakfast this morning? And I'm like, pop tarts. And I actually did randomly that day cause they're really good source of easy, easy Millie, digestible carbs. Billy. I said, what's that? You said or did you say your full name? Sorry, I heard you say, sorry. You said it Amelia. Oh, okay. Got It. Sometimes I can't say my own name. Um, and uh, so it kind of became this thing that like I would just like pre race ritual, um, that would be like a good luck thing to like a pop tart because I'm a soup, I'm a really big person into superstition and um, it's kind of grown from there. And now I see like I was at, I was at a race the other weekend and like everyone around me was eating pop tarts. What have I started? Like what is it? Everything, like these pictures on Instagram of them eating pop tarts and like they tag me in it. Yeah. And I'm like, Oh my God, I've created a monster.

Speaker 3:          00:47:01       This actually could be an incredible opportunity for you to do whatever you want. Because I remember watching pumping iron and Arnold Schwarzenegger's talking about the guys would come up to him and ask him for advice and he'd give them the wrong advices. And he was like, tell them to go into the shower at the gym and like scream all they're posing. So you could, you could actually, you could pull an incredible April fool's joke, but announced it a year later after everyone has already embraced it. I know.

Speaker 4:          00:47:27       So now I'm like, okay, well what's the thing? Like what's the, you know, what other superstitions do you have? Um, not limited to racing necessarily. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I'm one of those people that, so it's the same, like I will wear the same sports bra, like, so we raised pretty much in like sports bra and like compression shorts because you want as little clothing to like cut down the mud as possible. So I'll wear the same, you know, if I did well in a race, like I'll wear the same outfit for like the next race, um, and especially at the same headband. Um, and then if I don't do well, then that one gets discarded, you know? And so it's, it's that kind of like your typical, um, sports stuff. Um, I actually have, this is kind of embarrassing, but a small little stuffed dog that travels with me to all races and I'm, because I'm typically by myself and really cheap, sketchy hotels because these races are like in the middle of nowhere. Um, so it's like my little guard dog. And how big is the stuffed dog? Oh, it's like fits in the palm.

Speaker 3:          00:48:33       Where did you get that? It was given to me as again as a protection, as a partisan. The Guardian has a garden,

Speaker 4:          00:48:40       Doug. Um, so yeah, I mean it's, it's just, it's, it's silly. It's silly stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          00:48:48       I can be outside of pop tarts. Yeah. What am I actually lead? Yeah. What is, what is your, let's just say your four weeks out from a race. Yeah. What is your, what does a day of food look like for you?

Speaker 4:          00:49:02       That's hard to say. Honestly. Like I, it's one of those things I've struggled with that I've, I've tried every, like I tried to do Paleo, I tried to be like, maybe I can become a fat adapted athletes because for longer races I didn't want to have to like rely on gels, gels and stuff like that because after a while it can, it can be too much in your stomach. But I just never, I'm never going to be the paradigm of good eating of like an and um, I couldn't, couldn't stick with like, you know, um, the whole like, you know, trying to, I couldn't go far enough into like the fat adaptation. Like it was just miserable. Um, I like ice cream way too much. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:49:44       it's somewhat contra indicated for Ketosis and adoption, but much to my chagrin

Speaker 4:          00:49:51       boy, and I think I realize, I'm like, you know, I'm, I'm performing well. Um, I'm winning races. So why change? If it gets to the point where I'm not doing well right then, then I'll take another look at my diet and, and switch it. But at this point, it's like I run so much, I put in so much, you know, time that I'm like, whatever. I enjoy food and Ali, kind of whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:50:16       What do you consume during a 24 hours?

Speaker 4:          00:50:22       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:50:23       What is your, and this is actually a question from a fan. Yeah. Which was how does your gear that you bring with you differ in an obstacle course race versus an ultra marathon?

Speaker 4:          00:50:34       Yeah. Instance. Yeah. Um, aside from the wet suit. So I think it really depends. Um, if you're running, I've, as I've learned from like dabbling in ultra marathons is that my body does it, especially if you're running hard. I'm, my body isn't going to handle solid food as well as like the stomach will like stomach acid and stuff like that. So there's a lot of like liquid, like tailwind is a good, you know, something that a lot of people use to like that it's really easy on your stomach. That's a good name. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and, uh, so, but I also just find, you know, like simple, I actually really love like, um, like I like chewing on things like, like cliff makes these blocks. So, you know, like I do, I take in simple sugars that, that um, like fuel me through that. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:51:24       how often do you eat during a 24 hour race?

Speaker 4:          00:51:27       Um, I try and fuel every, like I try and fuel every 30 minutes to hour, get something in, but little bits. Um, and then I'm telling you sometimes are the best things during like a long race are like, Oh God, I had a Krispy Kreme doughnut during world's toughest mudder this past year and it was like the most phenomenal thing I never had. I'm salty things. Um, you know, like you want to make sure that you, you like, you, um, your electrolytes are give you, especially if you're running in a wetsuit because you're losing, I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:52:01       you're losing summons. It's such an incredible amount of fluids.

Speaker 4:          00:52:04       Yeah, I mean, so, um, pickle juice, mustard, things like that. You carry that with you, their stations regrowth. That there are stations there are imagining like a camel back full of pickle juice. Well I actually do, I carry mustard packets with me. I'm a small package. So because vinegar is it if you ever have issues with cramping, um, you know, they say that like the vinegar, the salt and stuff like that. Can pickle juice as well known to stop cramps in their tracks? Um, his old yes. Yes. Was that makes sense. Yeah, I mean it, that's a pickle juice is harder to carry with you is you have like a little vial or something like that. Um, but yeah, so, um, I think that for the longer the race gets, you obviously need more gear and especially depending on like the cold and the, and the weather and what your conditions are. Um, and so, you know, sometimes it's, it's pretty massive.

Speaker 3:          00:53:02       You mentioning electrolytes. It's, it's fascinating when you look at sort of the record of health issues in endurance races, most people assume that a lot of it would be related to dehydration, but oftentimes it's the complete opposite where a lot of people, the many people consume too much water. And they get, I guess hypernatremia yeah, yeah. Where are you dilute the sodium to the extent that in some cases your heart stops functioning. Okay. And, uh, the, I recall I was doing this Kettlebell certification years ago and it was just like thousands and thousands of swings and whatnot outside, right. In Minnesota. And people were getting horrible cramps and they're like, oh, we're not drinking enough water and heat shrink more. And I'm like, no, that's not the issue. You need some potassium tablets and uh, it's, uh, but God, that could just be the worst if, I mean, do people, I would imagine there must be a fair number of competitors who just have to drop out because they get it. Quatre or hamstring cramps.

Speaker 4:          00:54:01       Zach cramps can be like super debilitating. Um, and I think, and especially like in really hot races and, and also I'm really cold races and stuff like the extremes. Um, so that, you know, it happens. It's the reason why the longer the race is to get, you know, like the more unknown and things like that go into it. And so, um, it can be, it's always kind of a crap shoot, you know, like you're like, come on body, please cooperate with me this one time. But sometimes you can't, you can't predict it. So

Speaker 3:          00:54:32       what, uh, what supplements do you use on a daily basis?

Speaker 4:          00:54:37       Um, caffeine, no, I like coffee. So I am actually really, uh, have really kind of bought the hype and the science behind beets. Beets. Yeah. Um, so I actually, I work with a company called [inaudible], which is it's powdered beat, um, concentrated beet. Um, and so it's really that like if you, I remember the first time I ever had beet juice, which just tastes like death. I'm like, yeah, I mean I, some people like beet juice, but I, I can't handle it. But like you feel this weird like head rush almost. And so I was like, wow, there might be something to this shit. Um, so it's a, so I am really, it's something that I actually like drink ever, like before workouts and stuff like that and you know, delivers the nitric oxide to help the breathing and everything like that. Um, so I think for endurance athletes, you don't need, I don't need the massive dose of caffeine before I go out, you know, and Ron, because he wants to be jittery while like, you know, running for several hours. Um, you need more of like the, the, like the help with the breathing and keeping the heart rate low and stuff like that. Um, and then I also take, um, you know, I try to stay away from like antiinflammatories like Advil and stuff like that, just because I, you know, it's, it's hard on the body, but big believer on like tumeric. Yup. Um, and uh, other things like that. Um, then anything to try and help with like bones and joints and, um,

Speaker 3:          00:56:07       so you've just taken her at like glucosamine or MSM or what type stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:56:10       But I, I try and get a natural, I'm like, uh, like bone broth and gelatin and things like that. Um, you know, but it's bone broth as inexpensive habit until I like bite the bullet and make my own. Then I have to like handle chicken feed and not really into that. So

Speaker 3:          00:56:27       you're in a good place for the, for the, for the bone broth. And I'm in the bay area. I was like, it was the three stone hearth I think in Berkeley. Yeah. Further down the peninsula. You got some really good sources as well, right? Unfortunately, yeah. Hippies love bone broth. Oh God. It's like the, it's the new thing. And for anybody in New York, I'll just give a shout out to a new, I guess it's kind of a side Gig. Started by a chef friend of mine, Marco Canora who was in the four hour chef Brodo they serve hot bone broth in the winters in New York City, Bro. D. Oh, it's amazing. And you can get turmeric and or cumin. You can get different flavored. Yeah. You getting it. You can, you can pay for the ad odds. Uh, what is your prehab routine look like? So the exercises, what exercises do you do to prevent injuries?

Speaker 4:          00:57:17       Yeah, so the main injuries that I've kind of dealt with, I've always been kind of revolving like hips, um, and uh, uh, you know, glutes, leg, most runners, glutes that don't fire. Um, so like the irony. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Uh, so, uh, like Jane Fonda's are the, you know, the, the gold standard. Um, but it is, it's a lot of, um, like kind of like stability work. Um, so I try and do a lot of single leg stuff. Um, what type of single leg stuff? Uh, so single leg squats, you know, you don't, you see like crossfitters, do you like pistols all the way, like asked to grab it. You don't need to do that kind of stuff. You know, he's just like small little like, you know, mini single leg squats. Um, I try into, like, whenever I'm standing around, I'm trying to like, just stand on one leg, like balancing and things like that.

Speaker 4:          00:58:12       Um, I do a lot of like band, you know, like the, the physio band like walks, so like monster walks, right? You're the ex walks. Yeah, the x walks. That's that kind of staff. Um, and then a lot of work, especially if as a trail runner you really want to work. Like you're, I'm going to say what is your transverse abdominis or like the really deep core muscles muscle. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, so a lot of exercises that will like engage that, um, you know, like bird dogs, um, and uh, things like that. Just, I mean, they're there, they're super like not fun and little tiny movements, but I think most people would rather go like, you know, squat 200 pounds and ignore those. And that's not gonna help you.

Speaker 3:          00:58:57       So you're working on glue bead, you're doing sort of ice lateral or single leg movements. Do you do step ups and he'd work on boxes?

Speaker 4:          00:59:07       I do. Um, I do too. I think. I think and like lunges, um, things like that. Uh, anything that's requiring you to, um, that is a required, yeah, that like unilateral movement too. So.

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       And how much time would you say you spend on those types of prehab movements on a weekly basis? It's probably about 15 to 20 minutes a day. 1520 days. Did you do that pre workout? Is it a separate workout

Speaker 4:          00:59:34       or after it's generally like, I'll do a few like activation. Um, one, you know, like fire hydrants before and then after it's generally afterwards at all kind of devote 15, 20 minutes. Um, to kind of that, those like small little strengthening baby exercises.

Speaker 3:          00:59:53       And how many miles on average do you run per week?

Speaker 4:          00:59:57       Yeah, it's changed a lot. Um, I used to, a few years ago I actually didn't really put in that much manager. I was like, uh, you know, running too much is not good for you or whatever. I did, I switched my training from to be more running intensive because I realized that if you're going to run for 24 hours, she probably should run you ever. Right, exactly. Cause I was just joking. I'm like, I'm not a runner. But then I realized that I actually, I love running on trails and I love long, long runs. And so, um, now I'm probably putting in probably about 60, 70 miles a week, which actually is not that much for a lot of UC, a lot of runners who put in like a hundred mile weeks, but

Speaker 3:          01:00:38       60, 70 miles away. Yeah. How much time do you spend doing other types of training, like weight training or otherwise?

Speaker 4:          01:00:47       Yeah. Um, I do. So I used to, I I do. Um, I generally will like crossfit three to four days a week, um, so, you know, or some kind of bastardized version of my own, um, if I'm not actually gonna make it to a crossfit gym. Um, and to also, cause I kind of pick and choose what I like to do from that. Uh, so I mean, I guess it would be probably, I don't know, five to six other hours of other strength training. Um, like interval training, things like that.

Speaker 3:          01:01:24       What does your morning routine or routines look like? First, first 60 minutes of your day you wake up? Yup. Punched the roosters and make them crow for him. Uh, what happens? What is your, what does your day look like between say four and five 30?

Speaker 4:          01:01:45       Yeah. Um, I mean, I wish I could give you an answer that's like, you know, I go out and I do sun salutations. So like breathing exercises or what? Well, the sun's not even out of that hour, but it's nothing really. It's nothing really that interesting. I mean, I wake up, um, you know, I'll generally, at that point, I'll actually typically answer some work emails that since I go to bed pretty early, probably I try and get to bed by nine. So, um, sometimes I'll work emails that'll come in like later than that. So I'll answer those and I'm just, you know, gathering everything up and heading out to if I'm going to the gym that day or from hitting up the trails that day. Um, so because I'll typically, I'll train in the morning and then I'll get ready and go straight into work and you get to work about seven 30 or so.

Speaker 4:          01:02:37       Um, and so if you eaten breakfast at this point, are now, um, I will eat. So Lee, so I'll wake up the boards just race days. Um, and this morning, because this is the only thing that trunk of my car as I was driving up here, um, high temp pop charts in the trunk of my car. Um, but, uh, no. Also I'll generally wake up and, um, I actually typically eat a few spoonfuls of like nut butter to fuel before I go out for like, if I'm going to go run, you know, 10, 15 miles. Um, it's a good source of, you know, fuel to keep me going.

Speaker 3:          01:03:13       She'll just have like a few tablespoons of almond butter or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:03:17       Pretty much. Hmm. And uh, and then, uh, yeah. And I found out that, you know, it sits well and then I'll eat breakfast after I train and then get to the office, things like that. So what does a non pop tart breakfast? Uh, generally, um, I'm a big fan of like omelets and eggs and things like that in the morning. Um, mainly because I really like catch up and I always put ketchup on it. It's just a vehicle for the ketchup pretty much. I see. You sense a sugar theme going on here? Let's see, don't take diet advice from a million. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:03:53       I want to just take a perhaps a few of these fan questions. Yeah. And we've hit on a number of them already, but I didn't know I had fans. But yes you did. Unless they're all coming from Scott. Uh, you have a lot of fans among my fans so that, this is a question that I'd be interested to hear the answer to as well. This is from Cindy, Paul Louis and I'm probably masking that. What is, what is your self talk during training and during the challenges sound like the moment when you want to quit? No, just to head this off at the pass that it, the answer may be that you don't feel like you want to quit but during it extremely hard races or challenging times. What is your self talk? Yeah look like, cause I found like many athletes and maybe not you, but have sort of consistent routines in terms of their self talk.

Speaker 4:          01:04:53       What's interesting, especially with the long races is that you're always going to hit a low part. It's like, and there's always going to be a part where you want to quit, you know, 24 hours at like, and for me it generally comes early. It's like four hours in and I'm like, God, I gotta do this for 20 more. When he, um, you know, the sun setting and it's getting cold, the wind's picking up, there's a massive sandstorm, whatever. Um, uh, for me, I think I generally, it's hard because people talk asked me about self talk. I generally just shut my brain off and I feel like that, that's what keeps, I don't, um, don't really think about anything. Um, but I think when is that always been the case? I think so. I think that you just will that into being. I think I just kind of go, I, I, well I use different coping techniques.

Speaker 4:          01:05:44       I sing to myself a lot when I'm out there. Um, just tell me you sing out loud sometimes. Yes. Yeah. If I have, if I'm not, if I have enough breath, like, you know, um, so yeah, you know, there'll be like, there'll be like a certain song for every race that we'll just kind of like replay it through my head. So, um, 2012 world's toughest mudder was Macklemore's thrift shop. It was like right before it hit big. No, like right before it like busted out, like, and I swear to God, I sing that song over and over again. I can't listen to it the same way.

Speaker 3:          01:06:21       What other songs is, so those like your mantra was Macklemore? Yeah. It was like your meditative mantra. Pretty much 24 hours. 24 hours. That's dedication of what other songs have you used?

Speaker 4:          01:06:33       Oh God, they range like all over the place. Um, sometimes it's, um, sometimes it's just like all kind of like seeing, sometimes it will be like, so my favorite hymn ever is, I was raised Catholic and whatever. And I love, you know, I've always loved church music. Um, so there's a Christmas Kong like low, how arose? Air Blooming. And it's like an old hymn. So not at all what you would think would be like running through my head, like running a race. Sometimes it does, you know? Um, and uh, but then there's other raise, it was Kanye. It was like Kanye is monster was, or like the song was called Monster, you know? So

Speaker 3:          01:07:19       what do you do other racers do that as well that you're aware of or do, do you, do any other top racers have coping, uh, approaches that you think are interesting?

Speaker 4:          01:07:32       Do you know? I think that a lot of people have like that self talk. Like I've always tried to, and I think this is pretty common, is that like a lot of us will try and break up the race into small segments because if you look at the whole picture, it will get overwhelming if you're like, I have a hundred miles to run and you're like crap, you know, but if you're like, no, I only have three miles or I'm just going to focus on getting through these next 10 minutes. And so I've always found that a lot of people who do long endurance events, we'll break it up into small, manageable chunks, you know, and just focus on the next few minutes ahead of them. And I think that works pretty well.

Speaker 3:          01:08:15       Do you, I mean, it sounds like you probably have some form of meditation when you run and I think that in terms of just mindfulness, I'm sure it's a very present state or where to start with, but do you have a separate meditative practice if anytime?

Speaker 4:          01:08:29       I don't, I've tried. I went to this like retreat thing that was fantastic. And I tried to do this meditation session and I just like 20 minutes and I was like, I got it, move and do something and they didn't get out of here. So for me it's almost like the meditation is like, is, is working really hard. Like, you know, like sprinting or running or lifting heavy weights. Like that's like my yoga practice, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:08:58       Uh, no. I don't know what this refers to, but since we'll, Hicks is asking, are you going to do the 24 hour battle Frog in March? Does that mean anything to you?

Speaker 4:          01:09:06       It does, yes. It's a, it's a race. It's another 24 hour a obstacle race. You know, maybe, I don't know. My, my schedule next year is, is kind of up in the air. I really, I really want to kind of like venture and challenged like myself in new ways. And so I think I'm going to be doing a lot more like pure trail races too, which I haven't really had a chance, especially without being out here in California. Um, you know, it's a much better, like I love climbing, running up mountains and stuff like that. So why did you decide to move to California? Um, a variety of reasons. I think the main was I, I'm from the west coast, I want to get back here. Um, and then it was a time for a transition and a career for me. Um, you know, uh, I had been at a law firm for six years and it was great and they were fantastic, but kind of wanted to try a new, like, you know, going in house and working, working for a company there. And, and then I actually, I'll be honest, it totally, the training and having mountains and hills around me, it was really hard. I am the happiest when I am out on a mountain running around somewhere and I couldn't do that in Chicago. So

Speaker 3:          01:10:20       are you able to disclose the company that you're working for?

Speaker 4:          01:10:22       The I uh, yes. Um, so it's this tiny little company you may have heard of it. Um, maybe not, I don't know. I worked for apple. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:10:33       It's a good company. I have, I have a lot of, a lot of friends at the mothership. I just wanted to make sure they would allow you to at least admit that you right there on like my linkedin and Facebook profile. It's public. Yeah. Uh, this is a very racing specific questions. Steven McKee. How do you keep your body limber after ice or water immersion during a race?

Speaker 4:          01:10:55       Keep moving. Just keep moving. I mean, because, yeah, I don't, yeah. Otherwise if you slow down, that's when your body temperature goes down and then you're going to get hypothermic. So,

Speaker 3:          01:11:08       so let's, let's, uh, let's go to the third act. Okay. Which is rapid fire questions. They don't have to be rapid fire answers, but the word successful, and you hear the word successful. Who's the first person who comes to mind

Speaker 4:          01:11:23       and why it's so hard because, and this is going to be your typical lawyer answer where I'm like, well, because successful can have so many different definitions. No, that's fair though. But just, just, yeah, sort of reflexively. So this is going to be kind of strange answer probably, but I always find people who have like transitioned their careers throughout their, who've had like, who've, I guess you have been flexible in their careers and who have transitioned. This answer's not coming out right. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to use an exam, do that all the time. Don't worry. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:12:04       Australian record, like a 22nd intro for this little audio book yesterday and it probably took me 47 ticks.

Speaker 4:          01:12:11       Right. Well, um, so the example, yeah. So I'm going to give you an example of a person who I find successful and then I'll explain why. Perfect. Um, triple h, triple h. So I am a huge wrestling fan, huge professional wrestling fan. Um, and, uh, the reason why I'm in using, I could use, I could use a number of people as this example, but the reason that I'm going to use this is because I find people who have had like one who, so he had a very successful wrestling career but then transitioned into the business aspect of it. You find so many people on it. This is interesting being in, I guess you could technically call me kind of a professional athlete. Um, you see a lot of people who I find are very kind of short sighted in that, in that they're like, well, I, you know, I'm racing now and that, but they don't think about what happens when they can no longer do that. So people who have been able to have very successful athletic career and then transition to the business side of things or to think far ahead, you know? Um, and so those are the people that I look to that I'm like, you know, they have, they have everything, they have the athletic side of it, but then they also have the business acumen and are smart enough to know that their body isn't going to be there for them. You know,

Speaker 3:          01:13:37       Oscar, Delaware, a good example too with golden boy productions,

Speaker 4:          01:13:40       right? Very savvy. I mean, if we want to keep going professional wrestling, you know, it's like the Rock, you know, like things have transitioned to being an actor. It's done. All right, so true.

Speaker 3:          01:13:49       Which is a great example of that. Uh, so Paul avascular, really smart guy. I had him on the podcast a listen to it. It just blew my mind. Really, really, really savvy guy.

Speaker 4:          01:14:00       Right, right. Okay. So triple h I,

Speaker 3:          01:14:04       I agree. I also view him, he works out at I think, midnight every day with Joe to Franco. Like after his entire right. He is very, he, you guys have, right? You have the OPP, you have the opposite schedules,

Speaker 4:          01:14:19       fan of routine and which I know and I've heard him talk about too, and that's how I get by and like, I don't care where I am in life, if I'm traveling, if I'm on the road for work, like I'm going to create a routine there and stick with it, you know? And so

Speaker 3:          01:14:34       what is something that you believe that other people think is insane or any controversial beliefs that you have?

Speaker 5:          01:14:46       Interesting.

Speaker 3:          01:14:49       And if nothing jumps to mind, we can also come back to that,

Speaker 5:          01:14:55       right?

Speaker 4:          01:14:57       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:15:00       Yeah. I may need to come back to that one. Okay. We'll come back to that. What book or books have you gifted most to other people?

Speaker 5:          01:15:09       MMM,

Speaker 4:          01:15:10       I'm going to butcher this author's name because I always do. Um, house of leaves by marks. Um, Mark Daniel, Daniel Lew ski. Um, so, and the reason that I say this and that I, um, and that I would give this is that so, so many people now read on like kindles or technology or things like that. This is a book that you have to hold because there are parts of it where you need to turn it upside down to read it. And I forget the style of what is called the style of writing. Um, there's actual like Shondra for it, but like there are certain pages where you are reading it and it turns in a circle. So it's in like an entire, I think that reading a book and you know, holding the physical book and turning the pages is such a lost art, you know? And so there's something that, this is a book that's like an entire sensory experience. It's a fantastic story. It's brilliant. It's kind of like a story within a story, but then it requires you as a reader to be like active and involved, you know? And I think that's just so cool because you don't see stuff like that anymore. And especially now when people read things on their iPads or their kindles or whatever. Um, and kind of like holding a book is something that we no longer do. So

Speaker 3:          01:16:32       House of leaves. Very cool. Do you have any favorite documentaries or movies? Uh, my all time favorite movies. The Goonies, the Goonies. I mean, it's quality film. It's the quality. It's not, it's not, it's not going to like, it's not life changing, but you know, it's uh, any favorite character from the Goonies? Um, data, data, data is great. And just power. I mean, like,

Speaker 4:          01:16:57       yeah, I've grown up in Oregon and you just had to like, that was, that was my jam.

Speaker 3:          01:17:05       We didn't have much to claim being from Oregon, but we could claim that movie. What is the, uh, purchase that is most, uh, for less than a hundred dollars purchase of less than a hundred dollars. It has most positively impacted your life in recent memory.

Speaker 4:          01:17:26       Um, this is really funny. So menuca honey, bandages and uh, the, so I get banged up a lot. Um, racing I've seen,

Speaker 3:          01:17:39       yeah, there's some of the photos that you sent me. So before we do these interviews, you know, I ask for short Bios, some photos that might be a usable, and I'm looking at one of them. You're climbing up this red and you're just covered in blood. So yes, you get banged up.

Speaker 4:          01:17:58       So, um, this past summer I actually, there's this one obstacle called Shirleen traverse where you basically called tyrolean traverse. Prolean. Yeah. So it's like you've seen like in the military guys, they like it's a rope. Then you either go under it and it's just a rope traverse. Yeah. Um, but you can also go on top of it. It saves your crib. Um, and I decided one day, one race to go on top of it, saving my grip and I was wearing just a sports bra and massive rope burn all down the front of my, and like the worst pain is like a second degree burn. And I discovered that the only thing that would take away the steam where these like honey bandages and there's only cvs was the only place that sold them. CVS has manuka honey bandages and the only visit, or I can find him online too, and a sweater. It was the only thing that got me through like the next few weeks in like no pay. But now I use them all the time for all of like my scrapes and it's, they're great, like antibacterial and blah, blah, blah. I mean with a number that I bought, I'm sure it's over. I've spent way more than a hundred dollars on them, but

Speaker 3:          01:19:02       I knew Connie Benn and just cool. Uh, no, I usually ask about morning routines. We already covered quite a bit of that. What other routines or habits do you find important in your day or week?

Speaker 4:          01:19:20       Um, I, it's very easy for me to, or I think it's very easy for a lot of people to get disconnected from, you know, people around and especially now in our like social media type of world is that like you, you know, like something on Instagram or you know, favorite something on Twitter or whatever, whatever the things are that you do. Um, so it's very important for me to, like, I always set a time every single week and I called my parents like at the same time and I called my sister and, um, to try and make those, those, um, you know, personal connections and stuff like that because it can be so impersonal now with everything that we have, you know, technology that you can be like friends with people that you've never met in real life. So I always try like me that routine like every Sunday at the same time, calling the parents, you know, just kind of like keeping me grounded, things like that.

Speaker 3:          01:20:15       Do you have any wind down routine? What does the hour before bed look like?

Speaker 4:          01:20:22       So I generally, um, okay, can't wait to hear this. No, I was just like, I was just trying to think of like if I actually had, cause generally I'll be, um, you know, watching Monday night raw, um, some other fresh, I don't watch a lot of TV, but it's either sports or professional wrestling. When I do, um, you know, I, I am generally one of those people that's like so tired by the time is I'm going to go to bed. I don't really need a routine. It's just like, it's like, all right, it's time to go to bed. Oh, cool. Yeah. Got It.

Speaker 3:          01:21:03       Uh, if you could have a billboard anywhere, what would it say you put anything on it?

Speaker 1:          01:21:11       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:21:17       I think I would say, um, I think it would be something along the lines of, um, no one owes you anything. And I think that this has been something that lately I feel like there's such a level of entitlement now in people like that, that, oh, I, I deserve this, or I blah, blah, blah, this. Um, and at the end of the day I'm like, it's hard work. You know, the people that I find the most successful people that I think, one thing that I've always prided myself on is that like, I've worked really God damn hard for everything that you know, that I've gotten or that I've done in my life. And you can't expect handouts from people, you know, the, at the end of the day, all that you can, that you can count on really is yourself. And so like, I don't expect people to give me anything. So, and I really wished like, you know, so you see people now, like, I don't know the level of entitlement that people think that they deserve a handout or deserve help sometimes. Sometimes I'm like, no, make it yourself. Make your own opportunities, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:22:27       Yup. That's very pronounced here in Silicon Valley too. It's like, I know you just had a great idea when you went to the bathroom, but it's not worth $50 million yet. I'm sorry. Exactly. Uh, so this, this is, this is not one of my normal rapid fire questions and I'm sure I'm getting a lot of grief for this from my fans, but I have to ask because, uh, I, I know a lot of very successful women CEOs and so on, uh, so 2012 second place overall. Yeah. Uh, I mean you could, you could have potentially, I mean it's, well within the royal possibility you could have won the whole thing. Do find it hard to date. Is it, I mean, is it that I, because I'm imagining if I put myself in your shoes, it must be in, you're in, you're extremely successful in your career. Is it hard for you to find someone you respect enough to date? Because I mean then they're like the mental, physical, emotional toughness. I don't spheres,

Speaker 4:          01:23:26       so I don't think that it's so much me. That's how it always starts. No, I honestly, I, so I tend to be attracted to people that are almost like, I don't want to say the exact opposite then me, because then that sounds like I'm attracted to people who were like aren't successful. But what I found is that I need somebody who's very complimentary to me in terms of like very kind of, I admire people that are super laid back and go with the flow and very adaptable and just, you know, everything that I'm not. And so I think that like for me, it's not so hard to find people like that. I think I though, you know, sometimes you do get, you'll hear, you know, it takes a certain type of guy who can be secure with, with being with, you know, a woman who, you know, beats 99% of the dudes at like a sport or whatever. Um, and, and that feels weird to say because that feels like, I'm like being like, look at me, I'm sending to the facts are the facts. But um, you know, it's, I think that it tastes actually a guy who's very secure in his own right. You know, you can't, I can't like date somebody who's like, who's not, um, you know, secure in who he is because then that would just be disastrous.

Speaker 3:          01:24:51       It sound like it would get very far. And then what, what advice would you give your 25 year old self and place? Place us 20 and 25 I'd be interested to get it for both ages. So wait, where were you? What were you doing at 20 and then 25?

Speaker 4:          01:25:10       So 20, I was finishing up college. Um, probably just getting ready to apply to law school. Super, you know, like hardcore driven, going to be partner in a law firm one day, you know, like all those things. Um, I think at that time I would tell myself to relax. Um, and uh, you know, that you can't predict where life is going to take you. Um, and because now looking at him like would I ever expect that I'd be like the world's top obstacle racer. We didn't even know what the fuck off. So where it wasn't even around at night wasn't, you know, wasn't even a thing. Um, and uh, so and I think at 25 I was finishing up law school and I was starting my career as an attorney. Um, so I would probably be similar, but I think what I would tell, I'm actually going to give you, I would, I would tell my 28 year old self, which is when I started all of this obstacle racing stuff. And

Speaker 1:          01:26:17       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:26:18       I would tell myself it really doesn't matter at the end of the day. Okay, that sounds bad, but like don't take it so seriously. Um, you know, and

Speaker 4:          01:26:32       at the end of the racing itself, the racing itself, because when you reach it started out as totally fun and then you reach a certain level of success and everyone then it becomes this pressure and everything like that. And I think that it's not all of the stress and the pressure and everything that I would put on myself from it. It's, it's not worth it. It doesn't change the outcome. I'm either, you know, ready or I'm not to like, you know, beat somebody. Um, so at the end of the day, kind of keep it all in perspective and I'm like, it's kind of hilarious. I'm running around in the mud, being shocked by electrical things like running around for 24 hours in a wetsuit. Like, just keep that in perspective, you know, like it's kind of ludicrous what I'm doing, you know, so have fun with it. You know, cause there's so much time that I think that it wasted not like putting so much pressure on myself and not having fun. And now I've kind of like come full circle. I'm like, ah, it's just fun. You know?

Speaker 3:          01:27:35       Who would you, who is someone or who are people you would like to meet some day

Speaker 1:          01:27:44       if anywhere?

Speaker 4:          01:27:47       God, I see that light list is like massive. You know,

Speaker 3:          01:27:50       who's, who's, who's up at the top of the list?

Speaker 4:          01:27:54       Ronda Rousey, Ronda Rousey. I like to me strong, I have an entire list like strong females who are at like the top of what they do. Um, she's on my list too. Right. Um, but then I that also extends to, you know, just other things that are like not athletic, really inclined, you know, so you see like Sheryl Sandberg and like that the females that have made names for themselves and you know, as top executives and things like that. Um, so I, I'm not like Rah Rah girl power type of person. But you know, finding other women like that and seeing what makes an tech and seeing how they survive is, is always really interesting for me.

Speaker 3:          01:28:41       What, if any, asks or requests do you have for the audience? And this is the, this is the last question or request. Yeah. Anything you'd like them to do or think about or consider or all the above.

Speaker 4:          01:28:58       Right. You know, I think, um, one of the things that I've learned is like, and what I would tell people is like, be open to experiences, you know, and especially with, they're probably like sitting, oh, people, if they're sitting here listening to this are either already in obstacle course racing and are like, man, this shit's bananas. It's great. You know, so I don't need to convince them of anything. Or if they've happened upon this and they're like, we don't understand what this chick is doing. Actually. Um, like, I don't know. I would say go out there and like, you know, try something new. Um, and you know, so if that's off, if you want to go out and run off score, which of course like great, but I wouldn't be where I am today without, you know, just like saying sure. And trying something and, and seeing where that leaves me. So I think that's always kind of important to keep in mind. So try something new. Yeah, that's good advice. I'm asking them to do something there.

Speaker 3:          01:29:59       I think it's good. Good advice. I mean, do something just for the fuck of it I think is kind of right. Coming back to your, don't take it so seriously. Like not everything has to figure into your five year plan. And I think that's hard

Speaker 4:          01:30:12       because for me it's like I've always been not like super plan or five year person. So it was something that I actually have to remind myself. It's like, try something new, Amelia. Like just do it. Yeah, why not

Speaker 3:          01:30:22       do it. That was, that was one of my, I call it a resolution, so it wasn't a new year's resolution, but when I've done did a lot of unusual experiments last year, uh, we won't get into right now, but one of the, one of the realizations was be playful. Like you don't have to be so God damn serious about things all the time. I mean the psych do something that doesn't have an explicit point or an angle or whatever it might be. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:30:48       Yeah. If somebody told me the other day, um, that the only thing at the end of the day, the only thing we have is time. If you really cut through all the bullshit out there and like this is funny when you asked me about like who do you think is successful? I'm like, seriously, I think the most successful people who are out there are people that are happy that are just like, they may not have it all, they may be dirt poor or they may not be educated, they may, whatever. But if they can art everyday life smiling and just generally happy. Like when, if you break it all down, all we have is time. So why spend it been miserable? So like go do something that makes you happy and like, and have fun with it because you're not taking it with you.

Speaker 3:          01:31:34       That's your, your, your most valuable non renewable resource. Exactly. As far as we know, when the my time finally comes and I realize that there's like a super cool world on the other side, I'm going to be like, God dammit. Well Amelia, thanks so much for taking the time and work working people say hello, find you on the interwebs and so on.

Speaker 4:          01:31:58       Uh, my grossly needs updating website, [inaudible] dot com. Um, but I actually am most active on, um, Twitter. Uh, it's just the handles Amelia Boone. Um hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:32:12       It's funny what Buddhists, any, any at the end? Emilia Boon. B. O. N. E. Correct.

Speaker 4:          01:32:18       Um, but you fair for Warren? I tweet a fair amount about the Seahawks and professional wrestling. So if you're not into that, you probably don't want to follow me. Um, and uh, then I'm on Instagram as well. It's a a our Boone 11, because Emily Boone was already taken by the time I joined that a are been 11. Correct. Um, and I'm on Facebook. Um, I don't have an athlete page because I don't really like that or believe in that, but you can follow me but I don't really become friends with people I haven't met before in life cause that weirds me out. So Twitter, so Twitter and Instagram are your best friend. Instagram. Cool.

Speaker 1:          01:34:52       This episode

Tim this episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.

Speaker 2:          01:35:49       Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way, set it and forget it. Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than two and a half billion dollars under management. In fact, some of my very good friends, investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. So the question is why? Why is it so popular? Why is it unique? Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy, but only pay pennies on the dollar for them. And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations, bloated sales teams, et cetera. And I'll come back to that in a second. I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their advice, run with it, do it yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:36:40       You can do that or as I would, you can set it and forget it. Here's why. The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't. Great investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax loss harvesting, rebalancing your portfolio, cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large amounts of money over longer periods of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned, since it's using software instead of retail locations, etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely impossible right off the bat, you never pay commissions or account fees for everything. They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for free. If you use my link, wealthfront.com forward slash Tim, that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.

Speaker 2:          01:37:33       Now, normally when I have a sponsor on this show, it's because I use them and recommend them. In this case, it's a little different. I don't use wealth front yet because I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal. They wanted to sponsor this podcast, but because of SCC regulations, companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials. So I couldn't be a user and have them on the podcast. But I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant amount of my own money, at least for me, uh, in the team and the company itself. So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client. Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener, you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account. But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.
