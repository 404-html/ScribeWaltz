Speaker 2:          03:41          Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to interview and deconstruct world class performers of all different types from business, sports, military chess, you name it, science. We bounced all over the place and this episode is going to be wide ranging, not only focused on business or investing, although we do have an all star in both of those arenas. The guest is Scott Belsky. He is one of the people I call most for advice on a wide range of topics. Who Scott at Twitter at? Scott Belsky, B L S K Y Scott belsky.com Scott is an entrepreneur, author, investor, and currently chief product officer of Adobe. Big, big company might have heard of it. He's also a venture partner at benchmark, one of the most famous venture capital firms anywhere. But this one based in San Francisco, Scott cofounded by Hanson 2006 and served as CEO until Adobe acquired the hands in 2012 millions of people use the hands to display their portfolios as well as track and find top talent across creative industries.

Speaker 2:          04:45          He is also a incredibly successful early stage investor and advisor who has been involved with companies like Pinterest, Uber, periscope, among many, many other fast growing startups. And his latest project is a compendium of insights and tactics for what Scott calls the messy middle. We all know we have that initial euphoric start to big projects or companies. And then you enter what you might have heard of in uh, perhaps incubator parlance. In this case, y Combinator I believe refers to it as the, the trough of sorrow. So you have this initial burst of adrenaline and then there is a long middle period with any type of creative endeavor. They can get really messy and that is where a lot of people give up or get destroyed in one fashion or another. And then there are people who make it to the last mile and ultimately complete, uh, many of these projects or have type some type of acquisition or exit with startup.

Speaker 2:          05:44          So this episode covers a lot of ground. We talked about a lot of these tactics and uh, if for whatever reason you're thinking, you know what, I want to listen to this, Scott sounds interesting, but I don't want to focus exclusively business stuff or business building. Don't worry. There's a lot in here that transcends that. And specifically we shift locations and number of times in this episode we end up in the sauna at one point. And if you want a real life example of how I ask my friends for help because I was getting all wound up about a very, very top of mind situation when Scott showed up at my house, jump about 55 minutes ahead from where we begin the interview. Uh, so the easiest way to do that if you want to, that's when we are in the sauna and I ask him for help is as soon as we start kind of hop an hour into the audio or so and then jump back like five minutes and it should be around there. But there's a ton of of stuff that you can mine that it's interview Scott is a great guy and I had a blast hanging with him and uh, with that I will let you also through your ears hang with none other than Scott Dusky.

Speaker 3:          07:02          Scott, welcome to the show. Thanks to him. Here we are at the kitchen table. I didn't think we would have a chapter two today. We met earlier for some oysters and beverages and caught up and I was picking your brain on a number of different things and we were trading stories and I realized that you have, and you're gonna know what I'm referring to, how many Evernote notes? Well a lot of Evernote notes, but specific to what we'll be talking about, I think it was a, this, it started at maybe 830 or so a couple of years ago when I started trimming it down. And you've been capturing lessons learned, Maxim's mantras for yourself in the process of developing this career. And I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way, but you've worn so many hats. It isn't a single career. It seems like you've lived many different lives and people have already heard the bio that I read in the intro, but perhaps you could indicate the roles that you've had in the companies, uh, that you've been a part of because they are so varied.

Speaker 3:          08:14          And I just want to underscore how eclectic it is. Yeah. A collectic for better or for worse. Um, but, uh, I was an entrepreneur back in 2005 starting a very small, almost a lifestyle business at that point to help organize the creative world. A company called [inaudible], five years of bootstrapping, um, as a small team valuing resourcefulness over the resources. We didn't have, uh, a few near death experiences in that process. Then became a venture backed company, which is a little bit more of a traditional silicon valley like story. Um, being venture backed for a few years, growing really fast. Um, went through an acquisition, then started, uh, found myself working in a very big company as a vice president given what I came in with as well as a few other projects and a few new muscles. They're navigating a big, a big corporate experience. Then I decided, you know what, I've been a seed investor for a while. I like this. People are telling me I should be. An investor. Jumped in and became a general partner at a venture capital firm. Total context switch, uh, learned a lot of things. I'm the hard way. Um, then realized I miss building, wanting to get back to it. Now, uh, am an executive at a big public company. Um, Adobe, the same company that acquired us, but totally new position. And I would say that, uh, whenever I think about, um, best practices, if there was ever such a.
