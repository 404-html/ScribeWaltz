Speaker 1:          00:07          So I wanted to ask you if all the many, many things of the hundreds and thousands of things that you could do with your time. How did you get exposed to coding and, and walk me through your first experience or experiences with that. Although I love the way that you, you explain it as language and that's really what it is. And I think that like any language, it's a medium that you can express yourself, that you can express creative ideas. And that is what I, why I think it's so powerful. I got exposed to it because I'm just a super curious, like annoying, like her curious person. I ask a lot of questions and I love understanding how things work. I love understanding like how the world around me works and, and how science and math can be ways to explain that. I, but I work in a really creative industry and, and I, I dunno, I guess I at a certain point in a couple of years ago, I wanted to understand what code was.

Speaker 1:          01:12          It was the term they kept hearing. Did it I person a conversation. Yeah. I mean, I was meeting a lot of entrepreneurs, I was watching the entire world, especially fashion and media be transformed by technology. And I was like, what is it that a handful of people who are engineers and building huge enterprise value, what is the sake secret language that they know that the rest of us don't and code. And I was like, what is code and how can I learn it? So I took a boot camp, I took one one week and even in where, where was it in New York at the flat iron school. Who introduced you to that? Um, this guy, Avi fluff bomb and he's a great teacher and he started this school and he taught me ruby similar exactly as yeah. So like it's a very intuitive kind of language.

Speaker 1:          02:01          And, and even in a short time I was able to kind of understand high level big principles and the fact that you can use code to, you know, write a line of code that performs a function and you can build, you can build ideas using this language. And that to me was just so mind blowing to understand like how the tech that we touch every day, how it works and to take it one step further, but to actually be able to, to write it yourself and to express your ideas and to be able to, I mean, you're a man, you're so efficient, Tim. It's really inspiring. You're so organized and so fishing organized for maybe like two hours a day, two hours and you are, it's impressive. And I just think that like even you can build tech to enable that and to scale that.

Speaker 1:          02:54          And that's what's so powerful is the ability to scale ideas or scale problem using code. And, and I think that there's so much opportunity that has yet to really even be built in this kind of intersection of kind of, uh, many intersections of, of kind of creative industries with, from the perspective of someone writing code who has different life experiences or passions may be then, um, then most engineers sitting in Silicon Valley today and you take this class, yeah. You learn the basics of ruby with avi, with Avi. And how does the, what is Kode with Klossy? So Kode with Klossy is my organization where we teach girls to learn how to code and empower the next generation of tech leaders. So we do that by running summer camps across the country. And we teach girls the ABC's. So Ruby html, javascript, CSS, enough to be able to build something.

Speaker 1:          04:06          So our camps are across the country and there are two weeks long and they're totally free. And we have these amazing girls who come into our, our, our camps and learn these skills. And it's amazing what they're able to build. And not only just the way that they're able to build their ideas, but what they're passionate about. So if it's like making social impact, uh, helping their community, um, but they, they're able to build something and recognize the impact that they can have. Um, and that's really empowering and that's that, that for a girl who's kind of, you know, at that point in life where you're like figuring out what you think you can be or what you think you can't, like, that's really empowering.
