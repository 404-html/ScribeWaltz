Speaker 1:          00:08          Hey guys, Tim Ferriss here. I'm going to show you how I went from very grumpy baby to slightly happier baby and for those of you don't know what happy baby is, it looks like this and referred to a lot in yoga. It's something like this and another way to think of it would be like this, this type of position, and I've always had a lot of difficulty with it. It's extremely important for a lot of things, the highly specific acro yoga, things like that, which I'll show in a minute. And then you have just general hip health and there are many ways to improve that position. I stalled for probably a year and a half, two years, huge, huge pain and it turned out a few things were very helpful for me. Waited, stretches, combined with presses and a few other things. So I'm going to show you the sequence that I have found most helpful and it's going to be within the context of Acro Yoga.

Speaker 1:          01:02          So Kipling, this is a my friend Caitlin, Sag Mueller at Kip Lynn, Kip, l. I n. N on all the socials. Let's do some bird presses first. So this is a position of acro yoga called bird. And I'm going to be policing my feet basically on her hipbones right here. So the middle of my feet are gonna be right here and you'll see as I go through this what we're going to do this, the safest way to get into it. So we can do it with no hands if we do it, no hands, it looks like that. Okay. Generally if we come down, we're going to use hands, the Flyer, I'm the base flyer fingers forward as a good way to remember it. And we're just going to come up like that. So very often I would do the presses with the hands so that would look like this.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Okay. But I these days use it with no hands. And when I do this, I'm pointing with the toes slightly. I'm bringing the knees down and I am trying to keep my tailbone on the ground. The temptation will be to roll up and I want to try to keep this seated and then I will pull down with my hands towards the ground. And if your feet starts slipping out, you can just correct with the hands. You can squeeze the hand to indicate where you want to place the weight, readjust the foot where you just the foot. And then we continue. And I'll typically do six repetitions of this. I'm only going to do two right now. So we'd come down and you can kind of play with the balance of feet pointing and so on. And then coming back up to 90 degrees and I'll do one more.

Speaker 1:          02:45          And you can see, you can kind of play with positioning, really trying to pull down into grab your baby slash have UV. So that's part one. All right. Now what I've found is that just putting yourself into this position for extended periods of time, it doesn't work for me. So I will do six repetitions. You noticed five or six repetitions into Max depth just for a second or two and then out. And what I found is that there's a compression on the lag when my legs are straight. And I'll show you another example of that and just a few minutes. Then there's traction. So Kimberly do you want to show just the feet behind the hips? Traction. So you can do this in as partners where you turn the feet in and then she's just leaning back on my feet, which is giving me a nice, I'm going to traction the hips.

Speaker 1:          03:38          So I will do this in between many of these exercises. Thank you Kaitlin. And I'll also do that for my wrists. So this is not limited to the hips. I will get say a towel of some type and I will pull on the fingers if I'm doing a lot of handstand work or something like that. So this is all transferable. Okay, so we have wordpress is number one. Number two, I'm working on internal and external rotation of the leg in both lights independently. So we're going to do a cartwheel into side star and I'll also show you some stuff that is not accurate dependent, but so if we come up and then we'll go onto the opposite side here. All right, so I'm getting this compression on a single leg and you'll notice that Kip Lynn has effectively 90 degree angle between her legs here. This, this foot, the bottom foot is actually very close to the ground.

Speaker 2:          04:35          Okay? And

Speaker 1:          04:38          we'll do generally a five to six reps on either side is what I typically do. This part of the warm up. All right? So then we're going to cartwheel out. Now what we're gonna do is instead of having a good amount of extra rotation and we focused on internal rotation and a, we will do that going from the bird position, which you've already seen, two of these slightly different type of sides to her.

Speaker 2:          05:08          So from here

Speaker 1:          05:10          I'm going to coq one foot out and then Katelyn is going to slide onto that foot and you'll see how she uses her arm support,

Speaker 2:          05:17          no,

Speaker 1:          05:20          this. Then we get this rotation and this internal rotation on this leg. Now when I come back, watch how I bend my legs, I'm going to push with the support leg and catch with the other foot and we come up. Then internal rotation. This one is very tough for a lot of women and a lot of guys in particular guys with stiff hips don't rotate worth a damn. It's a very therapeutic exercise. Also teaches you how to have soft feet if you're doing more accurate yoga or anything that includes some

Speaker 2:          05:59          of hamstring flexibility. Okay, let's dispel it.

Speaker 1:          06:04          So we come down. All right. So I want to show a few things that are not accurate dependent that I sometimes do in between these exercises. So one of them I'll come over.

Speaker 2:          06:18          Okay,

Speaker 1:          06:19          is this, so this is a rad roller and uh, the one of the guests on my podcast, a Amelia Boone, who is the world's most successful female obstacle course racer taught me and as did coach summer. So Chris Sommer, former national team coach for men's gymnastics in the u s that people think of hamstring flexibility. Oftentimes the restrictions that are like, oh, I can't touch my toes are related to the lower legs and the feet. So I will roll out my feet like cell and I'll travel with this rad roller. This is not very exciting to watch, but you'll get the idea. So food is right in the middle here and I'll generally do it very slowly and then I'll caulk it out like so. And then in and uh, you can, you can accelerate a lot of your hamstring flexibility progress. So I will do this on the feet also very good for the forearms and you can roll them on the floor when you're doing a lot of handstand or straight or port.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Okay, a good idea. I don't always do this, but it's tuning gorge to the calves and stretch the Achilles and the calves. Before you do your hamstring work, it was making a lot easier. All right, now I'll show you a few things, uh, because I will often take a break before the next one because I find it have found it historically very difficult. It's getting a lot easier. Uh, other things that I will do is I'll focus on back rotation also to get the mid back and traps and lats engaged. But this is a kind of a modified like mark for Stagen type movement. I think Eric Cressey also uses something very similar. Uh, I will get into this type of lunge position. What's very important is that my hips are square. I'm not doing this, I'm not doing this. It's not a warrior post type of thing. The toes are pointing straight ahead. And then what I'll do is simply drop this elbow flat to the ground and then come up, pinch this leg in and wrote good. And then if that is easy, I'll just inch the foot forward and do it again. And as per usual, I will do probably six of these, right? And that you would just do it on the opposite side

Speaker 1:          08:48          and we're just going to kind of match range for a second and then write out, we're not staying for 30 seconds or on staying for two minutes, uh, that there are options for that, but I don't do them as part of this warmup. Okay. And once we've done all that, there is one last that I would recommend, especially for guys. And this is just a general warmup, uh, recommendation, sort of just stretching this way, stretching this way, focusing on what we just did, just rotation and an easy way to do that. He's like this and this is, I'm going to blank on his last name. I Apologize Steve. I want to say Steve Sydell but I don't think that's right. Steve, who's basically the team doc, also a competitor at parody. So crossfit in Venice should me this tweak, which is not just in free standing or free, uh, squatting rotation, but using a wall to ensure that you don't sheet, that your hips don't translate.

Speaker 1:          09:45          So in this case, I have my hip, my shoulder peg to the wall and I'm just going to be crawling down and then coming straight up. And I asked him, well, if you have pain in your back, had you know if you should do the exercise or not. And his answer was if it feels better as you go after, say five repetitions and your range of motion has increased, that means you do the movement. Uh, so that is that. And then the final move that I'll show you is called a well one is a star press and then you have a walk to star and I'll show you what that is. So I like to start with the negative. What does that mean? Negative, we have concentric and then East centric movement. So the concentric movement you can see the Bicep is contracting, it's getting shorter.

Speaker 1:          10:31          Then as you lower it's getting longer. That's the East centric or negative. So I start with negatives with star and then go to walk ups and, and we'll, we'll, I'll show you exactly what that is. So probably good to face this way to show this. All right, so the hand grip, for those of you who might be wondering is like this, this is the grip that we're using a sort of two fingers on the wrist and then the hands wrapped as so, and we're trying to maintain a comfortable angle. This is flat. This is steep, usually end up somewhere in between and you'd just like dancing with a partner. We've figured out so what grip works for us. Okay. All right, so this is star and very often the hands or the arms of the flyer and this case Kipling are going to be straight. They can be bent. Um, we can do some crazy stuff like Freestar which we don't have to do right now, which is no hands. Uh, but the presses, so the negative I mentioned just going to lower like so and then all right, back up. I'm going to do the same on the opposite side. Just like that. He notices this very grumpy baby and then we come up

Speaker 1:          11:54          and then from here I would do that probably two or three reps and other side. And then we're just going to [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:58          walk down to that. This is bad or straddle that. Then we're going to do a walk up. All right, so this will be pretty self explanatory, just like so. And you just do that on both sides. So I'm just going to pop just for fun

Speaker 1:          12:27          and then I'll show you guys what a pop is just for fun. Don't try this at home. He need professional supervision.

Speaker 2:          12:32          Ready? One, two, and then you can get that pet

Speaker 1:          12:41          and that. Ladies and gents, especially if you're utilizing Acroyoga, which I think is a great way to improve hip health, uh, for El basing when I was doing that is how you can go over time, but pretty quickly in my case, from very grumpy baby, too happy.
