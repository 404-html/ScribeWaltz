Speaker 1:          01:24          This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic. I reached out to these innovative Finnish entrepreneurs of all things because a very skilled acrobat introduced me to one of their products, which is a mushroom coffee made out of Chaga mushroom, powerful antioxidant, considered a super food. I was introduced to Chaga by Laird Hamilton of all people and another mushroom called lion's mane, which is considered a no tropic or a smart drug and I had half a packet and let me put this in perspective. Tasted just like coffee, just add the hot water, only 20 milligrams in half a packet of caffeine. That's it's as little as one 10th what you'd find in a strong cup of coffee and I was on fire for the entire day. I probably got more done in that day. Then I got done in the three or four days prior to that so I would highly recommend checking it out. It is very impressive.

I highly encourage you to try it out.

Speaker 1:          02:42          This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way, set it and forget it. Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they have more than two and a half billion dollars under management. In fact, some of my very good friends, investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. So the question is why? Why is it so popular? Why is it unique? Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only pay pennies on the dollar for them. And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations, bloated sales teams, et cetera. And I'll come back to that in a second. I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk assessment quiz, which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their advice, run with it, do it yourself.

Speaker 1:          03:37          You can do that or as I would, you can set it and forget it and here's why. The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't. Great investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax loss harvesting, rebalancing your portfolio, cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large amounts of money over longer periods of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned, since it's using software instead of retail locations, etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely impossible right off the bat, you never pay commissions or account fees for everything. They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for free. If you use my link, wealthfront.com forward slash Tim, that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.

Speaker 1:          04:30          Now, normally when I have a sponsor on this show, it's because I use them and recommend them. In this case, it's a little different. I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal. They wanted to sponsor this podcast, but because of sec regulations, companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials. So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast, but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant amount of my own money, at least for me, uh, in the team and the company itself. So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client. Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener, you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account. But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you. Take two minutes, fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash. Tim. It's fast. It's free. There's no downside that I can think of.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Little boys and girls, cats and dogs, lemurs and squirrels. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another edition, another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers from all different trades, all different specialties, entertainment, military, sports, you name it. This episode is by request. Thousands of you have been asking for an episode on Dog Training and I would expand that to human training. How do you condition other people or yourself to do what it is you want them or you yourself to do. This episode features Susan Garrett, who is an incredible, not only dog trainer but competitor. She has a bachelor's of science and animal science. She's one of the most consistently successful competitors in the sport of dog agility. For now more than two decades, she's been on the podium of world and national champion. Let me try English again. Championship events more than 50 times winning those events a total of 38 times.

Speaker 1:          06:21          She was of great help to me. When I first adopted Molly, my own pup and her book shaping success was voted, are selected as the 2005 dog training and behavior book of the year. She is a champ both for her competitive track record, but also in her ability to convey concrete tips and recommendations for, for instance, the most critical games and exercises to play with your dog. The three types of reinforcement, how do you as crates properly what you should do in the first 24 hours of say, adopting a puppy. And we talk about just about every facet of dog training and really the way you should think of this as behavioral modification and conditioning. So the supplies to chickens, it applies to maybe irritating inlaws the cat that wants stopped sleeping on your kitchen table. I think I borrowed that from, don't shoot the dog, but it's all the same thing. So there are principles in this that you can take away even if you have no interest in training dog having a dog or dogs in general. So let's me then allow Susan to do the talking. You can find her on the Facebook and she has a very active page, lots of great pics and videos and that is very simply facebook.com forward slash Susan Garret, g a r r e t t, Susan Garrett dog agility. So facebook.com forward slash Susan Garrett dog agility. Say Hi to her and I hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I did.

Speaker 1:          07:56          Susan, welcome to the show. Thanks Sam. Happy to be here.

Speaker 3:          07:59          I have wanted to get you on the show for quite a while now. After our first conversation, I knew that we would eventually meet again with recorded audio because my audience has been asking me for an episode on dog training and so on for ages since I got Molly and you and I spoke very, very early on in that process for me. Uh, the right when I was not, I wouldn't say flatlining, but kind of before I hockey sticked in my training education and uh, so I could think of no better person to have on. And a part of what appealed to me was the fact that you have an objective and verifiable record. And what I mean by that, and for those people who are wondering how I seek out experts, part of it is finding people who can be evaluated objectively. It's not their opinion, not someone else's qualitative opinion.

Speaker 3:          08:58          Uh, you now I'm just going to read a little bit of your bio. I won't go into a ton of it, but you are one of the most consistently successful competitors in the sport of dog agility over the past, uh, I guess at least two decades you've been on the podium of world national championship events more than 50 times winning those events. A total of 38 times. I was, I was hoping perhaps we could start since most folks, well, I shouldn't say most, but many folks are not familiar with dog sports. What is dog agility? What does, what does that support look like?

Speaker 4:          09:30          Most people would have seen it but maybe didn't know what it was. We used to have a event on ESPN a lot every year. So it's the, it's a sport where the dogs go over the Johnson through the tunnels and they wave and out of the poles and it's a really fast, fast sport. It's, it's really gotten to a place where it's, you know, it's tough to keep up unless you're really great shape as a handler that it's a lot of convertibles, dog and handler.

Speaker 3:          09:54          And what are some of the ways in which that is scored? How, how has that scored, and I think we talked at one point, maybe you and I talked about this false starts. Is that a big part of the or is that a piece of the equation?

Speaker 4:          10:07          No, not in, in uh, agility. It definitely isn't pliable, which is another sport. I actually won world championships in as well before I really got heavily involved in and agility. Agility is scored. Think of it like a, if you watch a horse jumping competition, not the Olympics at time is number one. Um, but it has to be time with a clean round. So there isn't style points. It's just, you know, getting around over all the obstacles as fast as you can without having a fault.

Speaker 3:          10:35          Hmm. And, uh, what, what separates a good handler from a great handler in, let's just say for now, talking about the, uh, the sport component?

Speaker 4:          10:50          Well, like any sport, the number one thing that separates us is the mental game. And once you take, put that aside, it would be, um, the, the DA, the handlers ability to train their dog or, and you can put an end or the handlers ability to outrun their dog. And most of my competition are in their mid twenties and at the way the world championship level. So they are able to outrun their dog. In my mid fifties. I am not, uh, able to outrun any dog, so I rely more on the dog training aspect of it to be successful.

Speaker 3:          11:25          And what would you say differentiates your approach to training compared to others? Uh, for those people who have maybe only seen a handful of like network TV shows with celebrity dog trainers and so on.

Speaker 4:          11:41          I train, I train dogs very much the way they did. They trained marine mammals or exotic animals. It's, it's a reinforcement based program. Think of it like a killer rally can't get in the tank and, and correct them and you know, beat the crap out of them when they're wrong. Right. To hit it with a rolled up newspaper. Exactly. So it's choice based dog training in, in with the focus on reinforcement. It's um, it incredibly successful and that's why, you know, when I raise a dog, my focus is to have a phenomenal family pet first and then I know that lays the foundation to be a world champion later and it's all done through, you know, being intentional and purposeful with what I want and, and creating basically the dog of my dreams every time I get a new puppy.

Speaker 4:          12:32          When you say what does that mean? Choice based training? There's basically, you know, if I, if I was going to lump training into three categories, there would be punishment based, which is more traditional because in the military that's the way animals we're often trained with. Um, you know, you're the master and they will do it. They're, they're told and there's really no very little reinforcement. It's the absence of punishment that makes the dog keep working. And it's the brilliance of dogs that allows them to still have this great bond with us in spite of what went on with punishment based training and still goes on because it's, it's certainly not gone. And then there's reinforcement based training where people put a cookie on the dog's nose and lower them to do, to get what they want from them. And uh, and that certainly is a step up from punishment in that you're, you're creating a relationship of fun and trust.

Speaker 4:          13:23          Uh, it has its limitations on its success once that lure is gone. And, and then what we do is, is, uh, different from that because we definitely use food and toys and, and anything the dog loves as a reinforcement. But it's only after the dog has made a choice. So they make a choice and the, you know, it's, it's like consequence basically. You know, I come from a family of nine kids and so, and I never ever heard my parents raised their voice. So how you have success with that? And this was really how I train my first dog as I just modeled my mother. And if we were upstairs watching Disney and it was, you know, five to six and they called us for supper, they didn't yell and stamp their feet and you know, carry on. They would give us a chance to make a choice.

Speaker 4:          14:07          Are you coming for supper? And if you, if you choose not to come down for supper, then she would go into the basement, unscrew the fuse for the TV and there'd be no TV for the rest of the night and for the next 24 hours. So you have the choice to either do as you're asked or not. And you live by the consequences of that choice. And that's pretty much, you know, how we raise the dogs. You create an environment rich and reinforcement so that the correct choice when you want them to make is the one they end up wanting to make. But if they choose something that isn't what you want, the environment controls the consequences so that you don't have to punish them or beat up or the rolled up newspaper would be a good example. Dog Training. I mean, and the

Speaker 3:          14:53          story of the TV brings to mind a video I watched of you actually, uh, believe it was helping to train a woman's dog with leave it and covering the food. I think you were covering the food with your hand. Could you explain if that's a good example? I don't know if it is, but could you explain how that works?

Speaker 4:          15:12          Yeah, that's one of our foundational games. So we have four games. We tell people, you know, you can rock it with your dog if you get these four games in. And the first one is the one you described, it's called, it's your choice. That's why I created my own word. And it's just one word. It's your choice. And we want the dogs to know you're in control of all the good things that happen in your life. And, and it's just a response cost of me closing my hand around the food. So, you know, you get a handful of really attractive traits and depending on the dog's food drive, like if it was, uh, you know, a sight hound dog that doesn't have a ton of food drive, I might get like, you know, the, the top level value food, I could get steak and cheese and put that in my hand.

Speaker 4:          15:52          And if it was a, a Chow Hound, you know, like a Labrador, they just love food or a Sheltie you could put cable in your hand and the dog's gonna like Paul and bite and bark and go crazy. They're going to be on a leash so that they don't have access to just go find something else to do. But as soon as they stop all that, you open your hand. It's your choice. So your choice was to stop unwanted behavior and my choice was to open my hand and then the dog says, Hey, party on, I'm going to dive into the food. Well I didn't like that choice, so I'm going to close my hand. And this goes back and forth like a tennis match until the dogs choice is just to sit back and stare at the hand when it's open. And then I pick up a cookie and I feed them.

Speaker 4:          16:32          And that's the first communication that's clear to that dog. I am in control of the good things in my life because if I do what this person wants, good things happen. And that's the premise for absolutely everything we do. Whether, you know, I have students who train animals at the Toronto Zoo and it's exactly the same premise that you, you control access to the reinforcement and then you reward good choices by giving access to reinforcement. And the thing is with dog owners and they don't realize, you know, when we think about reinforcement, they think, well I've got to go cut up some cheese because I'm training my dog. But there, there's really, you know, there's, there's three really big reinforcements for our dogs. It's the food is obvious. Toys you throw a ball or a Frisbee, that's obvious, but it's the hidden ones, the ones that aren't so obvious.

Speaker 4:          17:21          Those are the ones that get people into trouble. So it's permission to do things. So if you're going to the park and your dogs pulling you on a leash and, and they're chasing a squirrel and you and you like, okay, I got to get rid of this, I'm going to have to take the leash off. So, and the dog gets his massive reward of getting to chase a squirrel. But what you've just done with the permission, you've rewarded what behavior you don't want. Exactly. Pulling on a leash. So that goes all day long. And it's, and it's when you have an awakening too, where's w we told our students where's the value? Where's the value for the dog right now? And if you'd have an unwanted behavior, like pulling on leash, you've got to say, okay, here's what I want. Let's just get clear. This is be real intentional about this is what I want, this is what it's going to look like.

Speaker 4:          18:09          This is what I've got. So what's between there is a gap of what I have to train. And the first thing to identify is where's the value for the dog? Because dogs, they just do what's reinforcing. And you just identify where that reinforcement is and start to control it in a way that you give them permission for what they want. So when we go back to that dog pulling on a leash, you might stand still until the dog came in beside you and then praise them so that they connect, oh, my action gave me the access to be free and chase. So you make that connection that all the value comes through you and you become part of the process instead of the dog. And the squirrel being the only two people in the process for two animals in the process.

Speaker 3:          18:52          And uh, this is, I'm, it's, it's been a little bit since I was digging really deep in a lot of these videos, which were fantastic. But is that a, do you call it, I think in this particular case, the sort of, um, common heel position, like the dog to your left and then the reward zone, is that the right, right,

Speaker 4:          19:13          exactly. Reinforcement zone over reward zone. And if that's what you think of it, that all good things in life happen right there. And again, pulling on leash is such a pain in the butt for so many people, but they don't realize that.
