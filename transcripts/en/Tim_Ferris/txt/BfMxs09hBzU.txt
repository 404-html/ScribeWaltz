Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism living this year.

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       This episode is brought to you by Peloton and I'd heard about Peloton over and over again, but I ended up getting a Peloton bike in the whole system after I saw my buddy Kevin Rose, I've known him forever, some of you know, and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic. I asked him, is it dude? You look great. What the hell have you been up to? Because he's always doing a weird diet or another, but it only lasts like a week or two. So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers and he said, I've been doing Peloton five days a week now. That caught my attention because Kevin does nothing five days a week and you know, I love you Kevin, but it really peaked my curiosity, ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week.

Speaker 2:          00:01:11       I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling really boring usually, but peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into your home. You don't have to worry about fitting classes into your schedule or making it to a studio with some type of commute, etc. New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New York City instructors in your own living room. You can even livestream studio classes taught by the world's best instructors or find your own favorite class on demand and in fact, Kevin and I rarely do live classes and you can compete with your friends, which is also fun. Kevin, I'm coming after you, but we usually just use classes on demand. I really like not Wilbur's and his iron, high intensity training sessions that are shorter, like 20 minutes and I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone seems to have their favorite instructor or you can select by music duration and so on.

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking metrics. I think that that along with the realtime leaderboard are the main reasons that this caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before. It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep your attention. The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you would expect so it can fit in a living room or an office. I actually have it in a large closet, believe it or not and it fits with no problem.

Speaker 2:          00:05:35       Today's guest is [inaudible] Phd. Oh my goodness. Are you in for a treat? You're going to hear about everything from monkeys and birthday cakes to building a personal board of advisors for yourself. I'm not going to give you the buyout right this second because you're going to hear it from a live recording. The live recording was taken at sixth and I very famous historic location in Washington, DC sixth and i.org. You can check them out. We're, I interviewed two different people in separate sessions. Steve case, the Co founder of AOL and known for many other things and then m Sanjin who you are going to hear from next. Enjoy.

Speaker 3:          00:06:15       Everybody loosened up. Limbered all right, let's just jump right into it. So this is going to be fun. I've been looking forward to this, trying to make this happen, hoping to make this happen and here we are. So let me just jump right into it. Our next guest is m Sanjen Phd, a global conservation scientist specializing in how nature preserves and enhances human life. He serves as conservation internationals, chief executive officer. We haven't met before and we'll get into that size and joined ca in 2014 as executive vice president and senior scientist and his let several key divisions divisions. I'm just underscoring that for you guys including oceans, science development, brand and communications and strategic priorities. That sounds like a lot a Sanjay and holds a doctorate from the University of California Santa Cruz and his peer reviewed scientific work has been published in journals including science, nature and conservation biology.

Speaker 3:          00:07:09       He is a visiting researcher at Ucla and they distinguished professor of practice at Arizona State University, raised in Southeast Asia in Africa. Sanjenis background, the expertise provided a unique lens for hosting and cohosting, a range of documentaries for PBS, BBC discovery and showtime. Most recently he owes to the University of California and vox media is climate lab series. Sanjayan is a Disney nature ambassador, a Catto fellow at the Aspen Institute and a member of the National Geographic Society Explorers Council. He puts frequently from his expeditions at m Sanjen, that's s a n j. A Y, a n on Twitter. Please welcome to the stage M. Sanjay,

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       welcome.

Speaker 3:          00:07:57       All right, so I want to start with something we were discussing very briefly before we get up here. And I said, wait, wait, wait. Don't tell me I want to hear the story, but let's save it. What is your full birth name?

Speaker 4:          00:08:10       Oh No, audio, audio, mic, microphone check. Hello. Hello? Hello. There we go. Okay. Can you guys hear me okay? Um, first of all, Tim called me up yesterday

Speaker 4:          00:08:28       when I was in Botswana getting on a flight, 22 hours to get here and said, hey, you in DC because I'm going to be there. And I'm like, yeah, but I'm not just arriving. But that the end effect, well I'm there for 24 hours, but hey, I'd love to see you. Do you want to come to this thing? Oh by the way, you want to be on stage. And I'm not very good at saying no, which we'll get to having listened to this last podcast about saying no to things, but I feel so much better today because I realize it isn't a last minute invitation cause he did the same thing to Steve Case.

Speaker 4:          00:09:05       Really good about it. Okay. So, um, I'm a towel. Uh, I'm from Sri Lanka and some of us are just given one names. So on my birth certificate it just says Sanjay, but my dad's name, which I use as a last name, like from my American passport, um, is Muktar Lincoln. And I don't use it much for two reasons. I've actually never one reason to the obvious one because if someone said Doctor Lincoln, Lincoln would be my dad who would look, not me. So I don't associate it distinctly with myself. That's the reason I've told everyone that reason I don't tend to use it and never, ever told this to anyone, at least not in a public audience, is that when it came to America, people have this obsession about what your name means. They always ask me like, oh wow, cool man. What does that mean mean? Like I don't go around going like Michael, what does your name mean? I'm an angel. I get it. It doesn't come up. But they do tend to ask that are foreigners for some reason. And the problem is this name muck. The lingam quite literally means giant pill. Penis.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:10:26       And until I was like a junior, I was deeply like conscious of that and I would never say it. And then one day in a bar somehow it kind of blurted out and the reaction I got was relief. And so then it became not a problem anymore. So the thing that sounds like a last name meeting, I would shout from the rooftops, you know, you know what Lingam is, right? You could, you guys look it up like Lingam that's like, you know, a phallic representation. So it's like penis. It's the same thing. And with the means Pearl, it's actually mother of Pearl. So yeah, that's exactly, it's like the hope diamond of penises.

Speaker 5:          00:11:07       It can be from testing last name ever or did last name. There we go. So I think the most logical segue here is to ask you about bullying during your childhood. We've suffered many of us through bullying. And I want to talk about a monkey, a monkey who stole your birthday cake. Can you explain what, what the Hell is going on here? How did, yeah, could you please explain monkey birthday cake story. I'll do that very quickly because then it actually comes to one of your questions that you ask me, but we just about a strange habit. So one of my strange habits, unusual habit is that I like to do something new. Something I've never before. I

Speaker 4:          00:11:53       like to try it on my birthday. And that's a tradition. It's been everything from like writing portrait or learning how to snowboard when I was 45 to fly fishing to uh, learning to bake beef, Wellington, right? So it could be anything, but I've never done it before. And I did this eye institute, this is a practice about 15 years ago because I would always get very depressed on my birthday cause what happened on my birthday was that very, there's a long story, I have to do it very short. So very quick version is no, no, no quick version. It doesn't have to be sure. It's all, they're five years old. We just moved from Sri Lanka to Sierra Leone, west Africa and not just in town. We were like in the, in the bush and the country like way out there and my mother, amazingly I get so in Sri Lanka I was like a little prince.

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       I had these amazing cakes like you know, battleship cake, you know, entire zoo cake. I mean it was like that kind of cake. Then we went to Sierra Leone and my mother and we had to the sort of fleas, Sri Lanka in the middle of the night, you know, because of trouble in the country. And my mom actually packed, which is amazing. I think back on it like a pound of flour and like icing sugar because we came to Sierra Leon on December 4th and my birthday was on December 26th and she knew this and so out there in the middle of the jungle, she baked me a cake. It was a simple little round cake with chocolate frosting, which is like the simplest frosting you can. They get right basically. You can make it almost anywhere and I didn't like it, so I was crying as weeping. I was unhappy about it. My mother mentioned got tired.

Speaker 4:          00:13:24       She said, you know, like that's it. I'm, here's the cake, put it on the table. She goes in to take a bath and I kind of stopped crying as you do when you're five and no one's watching. And I walk into the living room and are the corner, my eye catch a glimpse of something. I turn and look and there's a monkey and the monkey is holding my cake as a monkey. Look to me. I look at the monkey, we're both like the monkeys and then it jumps and jumps on the window sill in fleas. It like goes, gone. And I'd go screening and the cake like, hey, this, that kind of thing. My mom comes out, she's like, warrior petrified. She'd only been the country for a few days, that point, like 22 days shaking me. She's like, are you okay? Are you okay? Like the cake, the cake cake, she goes to the window, she goes, no cake that she goes to the window and uh, houses on stilts to avoid flooding in the, in the rain forest. And, and she looks down and the cake is down there and she turns to me and she says, you wicked wicked child.

Speaker 4:          00:14:26       Your birthday is cancelled forever. We will never do birthday again. Just wait til your father comes home. And that was it. And now I'm on the floor. I'm like, because the free child injustice is like the worst thing ever. So since then, like birthdays have been really, really difficult for me. It's awesome. December 26 was not great in our for lots of reasons. And so it creates this gigantic of anxiety. It's never good enough. Carry right into adulthood. It was very, very destructive to everyone around me. And even today, by the way, too, by the way, when we get together with my family, even today, there is discussion about whether I threw the cake out the window and the power of story to end. This is what's happened to my mind. I start thinking, did I really see that monkey or did I ask, I don't even know after a while with this sort of interesting. So anyway, that's a very long story, but that's it. All right, that is a great

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       story.

Speaker 4:          00:15:30       I want to hear the monkeys version of that story at some point. I'll check that monkey down. That'll be really awkward podcast. How did your parents, or how did your family end up going to Sierra Leone of all places? My Dad got a tax in the middle of the night, you know, my parents are, the mildest is amicus banded Asians. You can possibly meet. My Dad's an accountant and you know, he never, like even now when I travel, no Matt in Botswana or Namibia or Indonesia or Colorado, aspen, the same advice. Don't talk to strangers, be careful what you eat, you know, like call. It gets the same kind of like meek capital advice. But they had this one gigantic moment of courage, which I still don't understand because even today it would get massive deal to do, but these, these Asians who never have left the country decided to pick, pick up the five year old and one year old and over weekend decide that the country was getting politically really bad and with two suitcases and only the jewelry my mother had just left.

Speaker 4:          00:16:38       And the only place they, my dad had a job offer was in Sierra Leone as an accountant for a forestry company later on. His career just took off and he did great, but it just was this unbelievable thing. And not just the captain, not free town like this is like where Ebola was like recently, right? I mean this is where there's a 30th of a warranty early on. We didn't just go to the capitol. We went 200 months in the interior and lived in like a tree house with quite literally monkeys obviously around us. And I don't get the, I still ask them then they're like, yeah, you know, we just, this is a typical age. Like we didn't have a choice, you know, we just get just like the two lotteries you, when you know the parents you have, that's one lottery. You don't get picked that I won that one. And the country of your birth is the second lottery. Um, I sort of snuck into that one, but those are the two things. And Steve's completely right. You know, all of the other things in your life. 10 not to matter as much as those two lotteries that you get. So let's talk about the factors or maybe if you could describe for us how you ended up in science and then conservation.

Speaker 4:          00:17:52       Yeah, sure. Um, look, I, you know, I always love nature. I love animals. I think all kids love nature and love things that move. And as you get older it kind of gets beaten out of you. Right? You just get t stop encouraging to do that. But my parents just let me do that because it's the only thing that was sort of around me. And I fooled them for a long time thinking I was pretty mad and kind of went further and further into that sort of realm until eventually very late in my sort of Matt, I had my masters and just getting into my phd, I sort of realized that there's actually a career that was actually open to Asians. Um, in thinking about the environment and thinking about conservation and thinking about actually saving the planet that you could actually do that respectably.

Speaker 4:          00:18:40       So for most of your life and be okay with it. It took a lot of convincing for that bigger family. Just sort of get that, you know, once I got my phd, I tell a story other than my, you went back to Sri Lanka and my grandmother, I overheard her telling her friend who's like across the wall, I kind of leans over and they have this conversation. My grandson is back. He's a doctor now, but not the kind of saves people and by Greg [inaudible] has yet to add that. Right. And I started thinking about it and I'm like, really? Isn't that what we're actually trying to do? Because ultimately it's all connected. The people need nature to thrive and that is one virtuous cycle. But it was a full end game and I bet many, many people who follow their core and passion, you know, sort of fuck, try to find their way to a lot of sort of fooling around and fooling of other people, fooling of social circles. I was just lucky, lucky, lucky enough that, that there was enough there and I finally realized that I could actually do this. What was the triggering event that you were getting at the time? So your masters and phd or in what,

Speaker 4:          00:19:47       sorry? Where were they? Are the fields with, what was the, what was the concentration? I mean it was, you know, it was biology for my master's and then wildlife and genetics for my phd. And was there a conversation or a book or something that proved to you that conservation could be a path you could embrace or was it, you know, honestly I, I wished there was something like more epic on that. I mean I think there were two moments in my life where I made these big leaps. Um, the first was coming to America deciding that I wanted to be here for like graduate school or like if I my high education and that was because of Bruce Springsteen kid. You not that's the kid you not, that's how we picked colleges back then. Right. Because you didn't have like I didn't have like live and have the Internet and I definitely didn't have any way of knowing like why America would make sense for me.

Speaker 4:          00:20:35       I very little concept of America, but someone gave me that Nebraska album and I remember looking at the cover of that album and something about that cover and something about the way that the songs in that and the last song on that album and it just made you want to think of sort of endless possibilities and sort of wide open spaces. And I always felt confined in my life, confined by society or by whatever. I was always a stranger in a strange land. Well no matter where we move because we moved around a lot throughout Africa and sometimes in Asia and I just felt that that was a big leap, like taking this sort of bet to come to America. And then the second one I think had more to do with, I had an amazing advisor, a guy named Michael Sulay who's like the father of conservation biology. Really. He coined that word and he put it on the map. And you know, 20 years ago he was the guy and I was lucky enough to work with him. Um, I just cold called him and sort of pester them until he took me on as a student. And I think that made me realize there was a path there.

Speaker 3:          00:21:39       So you mentioned this professor, could you remind me of his last name? The pronunciation. Sulay so you leave with that now I've read that he told you your job as a graduate student was to train yourself as a critical thinker.

Speaker 4:          00:21:53       I believe. Maybe that's the internet line to me again. But uh, so what was true was like, so I was eager to say things like, you thought that that's what you did in, you know, I wanted to go save wildlife. And he said, no. Right? Right now your job is to just do a really good piece of science. It's actually good advice, like do a really hard piece of work so that you'd own it and you'd know that once in your life you could do that. And there's time enough later to save things. He tells me now that he might not have said that advice today, but at that time it made an impression on me. And that's sort of what I did. Why wouldn't he give that advice today? Did he explain it? I think he, I think he is so distraught about what has happened in the last 20 or 30 years to our planet. And, and so am I. And I think we all are really impatient and I keep waiting for other people to see something that I have seen in very, very few people around me somehow seem to have that gene turned on. And I think that impatient at what, what sort of makes us sometimes be irrational, but other times just feel desperate.

Speaker 3:          00:23:01       So the, the intention, just to take a step back, so you guys have a better context here. What are the no, no, no. What are we doing? That's the question of the evening. So I initially I was like, you know, it'd be really fun is to have Steve Case come up who's in the book and ask him questions that aren't in the book. And then to have someone, you come up and ask the questions that are in the book. But then of course we got the birthday cake in the monkey and we're off on a completely different landscape. So I'm going to bounce around between questions that I'm dying to ask. But then the questions that I feel like it would be fun to sprinkle throughout. So there's going to be very little connective tissue. It's gonna be like the worst edited movie you've ever seen. What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in recent memory?

Speaker 4:          00:23:44       That's really hard question for me because I don't buy a lot of stuff. I'm a total snob when it comes to like the stuff I own. And the reason for that is because I travel incessantly and when I travel I just have one bag and I have to take it to everything I own has to do like double duty. And so I'm very, very, very picky about like I the simplifying or just taking exactly what I like. So can't think of something really easy that comes to mind under 100 bucks. They could just name, um, icebreaker underwear. So icebreaker is a great company. They produce amazing stuff all at the marina wall and a wall. You know that New Zealand based company. I think you and I both know the founder, um, and um, Jeremy Moon and I like his personal ethos and his stuff works. I don't get paid by this company or anything like that, but that's probably the last under a hundred dollars purchase I made that I love.

Speaker 5:          00:24:40       Do you have a Goto bag? You mentioned you have one bag. Have you vetted a lot of bad? Yeah, so I used to love this Victoria Knox bag. They don't make it anymore. So the problem with it's just kills you, right? Really kills you. Like you just figure out that this something that works really well and then they go and change it. Like shoes, like athletic shoes. Oh my God. Did they change it? And there's a whole race to change it fast. So this is really a hard question because um, I now use it to me bag and I like it because I liked the four wheels. I also like the sturdiness of that bag.

Speaker 4:          00:25:20       It's heavy. That's the downside on it. All right.

Speaker 5:          00:25:26       But I'm getting older so I can't really know everything's on my back anymore. I need very specific well wheel to me. Bag. Do you have, do you have a protocol for surviving or maintaining your sanity and health for a really long flights like that flight from Botswana where I ambushed you with this invitation. Uh, is there anything special are you doing? And I know friends who carry céline Mres for their noses or wrap their heads and all sorts of weird contraptions to block out sound and light or do you just go out

Speaker 4:          00:25:55       and you're done? No, you know, I tried to be like as comfortable as I possibly can during the flight. Um, I mean it's just the usual stuff. I tried to get myself on the new time zone fast. I'm very strategic about how when I drink coffee or anything like coffee or tea, very strategic about the timing on that. Um, I tend to fast a little bit on flights. I don't eat a lot just because I can catch up later and it always makes me feel a little better. I guess that's sort of it. Like sometimes you get like, it depends. It really, like I did this flight and I'll be absolutely honest with the, I fly so much that sometimes I'm flying in business class, especially very, very long flight and I have to like gland there and get into meetings. Sometimes I find economy, I did this very long flight from Sydney to Johannesburg and I'm in the back of an old seven, four, seven middle seat with these two.

Speaker 4:          00:26:50       Very nice but large sum on gentleman by the side of the plane hadn't even really taken off. They both fell asleep and their hands kept falling into my lap. I have fifth and I had to like lift and put it in there like two. And you know that kind of flight you just took Kate, you just have to just completely do this mind shift. So what you do. So I stripped all my stuff. I've got really like into like, you know like you know my jeans and a tee shirt, you know, sort of curled up, made my little space and then start playing this game. So all you have to do is think about what worst form of interpretation you could be stuck in that moment. So you just have to think, well this could be, um, you know, Mombasa too, you know, like compiler, you know, truck driver arrived right now in the, in the back of like a local bus, you know, and you'd like, Oh my God, this will be so much better than that.

Speaker 4:          00:27:45       Like I can like order food, they can get drinks and I mean like you've got just infinitely, infinitely better, infinitely better. So that's the trick. Like I once had to spend an entire month in a very small cabin on a book, no windows. It's a research vessel and stuck in there with another roommate, tiny for a month and I, and we had food, literally cans of food under our bed. That's how small the whole, but I kept thinking this is like a sleeper suite on Singapore Airlines, like $20,000 ticket right now because I can sleep, there's a shower. Like I can walk around and it just makes you feel so much better. That's the trick with distance. Anytime the space constraint, just think of what's worse and then just mine shift. It works. No though. Exit. It sounds like a fantastic trick. Uh, I'm still thinking about this, the, the thicks of on hands learning and their loud. If you were to be, we're talking about

Speaker 3:          00:28:39       your mentors and the advice he gave you. If, if you were to have the opportunity to teach, say give you three options, a ninth grade class, college, freshmen class or college senior class, you choose one of those three and to teach a seminar or class of your choosing, what age would you choose and what would you teach? You have a semester. So tell me again how old people are at ninth grade. Cause I didn't go to school. It's grades 1514, 15 I would say a 14 program.

Speaker 4:          00:29:12       I probably teach that freshman seminar class, Freshmen College, freshmen college because I think I have relatable experiences that I can translate to that group. And it's still early enough for that trajectory to make a big difference. So that's probably why I picked that group. Um, and what would I teach? Yeah. What would the class be? And it doesn't have to be, there's no prereq. There's no like be like, how to get shit done or like

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       this is a good, this is a good subject. It's like, it's like so much stuff that we learned in college is wasted.

Speaker 4:          00:29:48       I think he just think about the vast amount of stuff that they taught us that we never ever actually use like that. So I would love to look. I would probably teach a class and like being really honest because I do teach at university. So probably would be something about biology and something about the environment. Right? So chances are it'll be in that thing. It might be, it might be a class in communication. So cause I've done like enough television work and stuff like that to be able to do that legitimately. So, um, but, or storytelling, but I would probably teach a class in biology, but if I really could get away with it, I would do something like, you know, like all of the things you wish you'd known getting into this or how to organize your life to get stuff done. You know, be kind of in that vein. It's just basically take some of your books. Cribbet regurgitate it.

Speaker 3:          00:30:41       So I want to ask both about the getting shit done. Freshman seminar. No, no, no. But let, let's just as a thought exercise, if it were instead, just so you don't have to think about the entire semester. If it were just a three to four hours seminar and what would be some of the key principles or strategies or anything that you would want to hammer home?

Speaker 4:          00:31:07       Um, you, you're getting me out to a really long flight. So it's my brand.

Speaker 3:          00:31:11       Well you can also buy some time by asking you what you would teach in a storytelling class. So none of whites stay with the or? No, I'm kidding. All right, so, so the, what was the question again? The question was if you have a three to four hour seminar on getting shit done. Yeah. What are some of the, any of the key messages or strategies or anything that you would emphasize? So, um, cause you get a lot done. I mean, I've observed how much you do and it boggles my mind. I don't know how you, yes. So, so the, the

Speaker 4:          00:31:54       look, you know, there's some, some of the principles that you'd probably want to try to get into is um, you know, dealing with focus, right? So this is a major challenge, especially for younger, younger people and it's not getting any better. And I have the ability, right? And it's not because I have some magical abilities because he's just practice it of intensely focusing on one thing for a few seconds or for a few minutes. And I think that ability to intensely focus on something and not be distracted from anything else, it's a very useful habit to have. And so I'm very good at one, like when you're one on one, you can be one on one. It can be very focused. And I think that's true for storytelling. And that's true for getting information out of people. And I think helping people focusing on one thing and then switching to another.

Speaker 4:          00:32:46       So it's a series of focus is a very, very useful practice. Um, I think that, you know, we waste enormous amount of time pretending to work and we can just sort of get rid of that whole thing. I think we, um, I think we're not honest with ourselves about what we're really good at and what we're not good at and in the very early success to as being absolutely brutally honest at what you're not good at and you can compensate for it to some ways, but just don't like you ask people, so what do you think you're good at? And they'll sort of tell you their resume or they'll recite you. That sort of, and that's not particularly useful. Um, I'll tell them about the things that I wish I had done. I think every student that going through should, should take a class in ethics.

Speaker 4:          00:33:33       I think every student going through should take a class on communications and storytelling. I think every student who goes through should think about how during their four year or three, whatever their college term is, spending a little time working on a, on something that is completely unrelated to their primary area of interest. That was probably the best thing I ever did when I was going through the American education system is that during the summers I was restricted on what jobs I could do because I was a foreign student. I would go and work at the World Bank and for a biologist to be walking around at the World Bank was a very strange thing at the time and it was unbelievably useful to me. It was like the most useful thing I did. Really. Why was it useful? Because it just put me in touch with a whole bunch of people who were completely unlike me and it was about the world in a completely different terms and go in there and be like, you must be an economist.

Speaker 4:          00:34:28       I'm like, no, I'm a wildlife biologist. And they'd be like, wow, that's crazy. What are you doing here? And, but we, but I just started realizing how they worked and how a whole different set of rules apply and how a whole nother institution was working on problems, you know? And just, it just opened my eyes. It just opened my, these things would have been for me to go work for a nonprofit like the one I work for now, a contribution sash on the age of consent. He didn't do that. I really particularly went and got jobs in areas that had nothing, nothing to do with my primary area of interest. Just to see what it looked like and the best, the funnest things in the world are all on those angles, right? When you can bring two different fields together, this, there's so much gold in those angles. You do that all the time actually, and I've really, you know, learning how to exploit that is often your little trick to getting a headstart and makes me think also of career advice that I've heard from both Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert and also mark Andreessen in different senses, but they've said

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       this is more Scott Adams and his writing that there, there are different ways to quote unquote succeed. One is you can try to be, say top 1% of 1% like a Michael Jordan in one skill. That's really, really, really, really difficult of the other approaches that you could be saying the top 10% in two typically uncombined areas, right? So you have Scott Adams who, who say himself, he's not the best artist, he's not the best comedian, but he's unusually good at combining both of those things. Uh, and in the world of business, it could be say a JD plus computer science or softer skills. And I've heard Warren buffet talk about his best ever investment being, I believe it was toastmasters or some equivalent public speaking course, cause you layer that on top of almost anything and it automatically puts you in a position to have a really unfair advantage.

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       So storytelling, you were kind enough, we were trading some notes before this. Uh, and you mentioned storytelling. So this is one thing I highlighted of notes that you sent to me, which was storytelling is one way to rule the world. Uh, and another friend of mine who's been on the podcast, Chris Saka, who's just an incredible investor, hilarious guy, but the, he originally trained to be lawyer and he was beaten soundly at one point by this guy who got up after Chris had presented all of his spreadsheets and all the data and some guy got up, I think it was in Arkansas or Texas or somewhere, and he was like, well, you know, you can't lead a horse to water. It's something he just started speaking in like five or six different, uh, parables and completely kicked Chris's ass. And so Chris concluded that story's beat spreadsheets. Uh, it's, how have you developed your ability to tell stories or how would you recommend people develop perhaps a books, tools, practices, the ability to tell better stories? Because I think it's as, as you've said, so, so, so powerful.

Speaker 4:          00:37:45       Right? So I, so I really agree with what you just said and I think, um, I think storytelling is one really powerful way to kind of rule the world. And a lot of people that we kind of look up to and think about like, you know, from Einstein to Elon Musk to um, Steve jobs, they were really powerful storytellers in their own way, right? So they had this ability through words or through images to really convince you that you could do something that no one else could, could, could think about. And that just that mind ship that they created propelled you along with their vision and all of a sudden you were doing it. So, and you can, you can absolutely learn those skills. You can actually get better at it. So when I was in high school, I was painfully shy, like painfully shy, were very thick glass, had long hair.

Speaker 4:          00:38:32       I did get the nap all the time. Um, it was, it was, I went to school for my high school. I went to school and it was like Hogwarts without any of the magic and he was really a step. But I had a break and the break was, this is such a funny brick. So I was sent to boarding school in England. This is an England for a year. And the break was that we had a debate team, which is quite good and it would go up against like eaten and all the other schools like that. And the kid who was supposed to be like the OT, the main kid for this debate team, you know, got ill and they suggested that I fill that role. Um, and I did and you know, I really had to the first time where I did this, you know, they make fun of my accent because I had a bit of an accent.

Speaker 4:          00:39:23       I didn't actually have much of an accent, but in their minds I had a very strong Asian accent. And what I did was I started the debate with that very, very strong. I just overemphasized. Everyone laughed at me. I laughed at myself. I got over it and I moved on. That's not a big deal to do today, but when you're 14 or 15, it feels big and scary and really hard to do. And I realized that there was power in that by the way. We went all the way to the finals and this kid. Then got well, and then they kicked me off the team. And then this kid actually lost, not saying anything here, but this is exactly what that literally, I like three debates, three rounds, like we were, we were doing fine. The team was doing great. Okay. Um, he had chicken pox and then he was out of corn time so you could come back on the team and then I was off.

Speaker 4:          00:40:14       Um, okay. So you can't, you can't practice. You can get better. So I practice and I think about it and I think about how people tell stories. I even Tim, like you've looked at Tim's, what you open that first couple of pages, he talks to that little story that he puts in there about, you know, you, you know, what he was grappling with in his college days immediately captivates. You just immediately want to know more and read more, right? So there's real power there. Um, and you can develop and get better at it. So what are some of the ways in which you can do this? So you have to be genuinely interested in the stories you're telling. You can't fake that. Like if you're interviewing someone, you've got to be actually a fan of that person. Even if you're not a fan of that topic or that person, or not genuinely interested, it's just not gonna work, right?

Speaker 4:          00:41:00       You got to own that story. It's gotta be all, you can't bluff the story. It can't kind of lie about it. You can learn a story and repeat someone else's story, but you really have to own it in like a deep, deep sense of it. Um, you have to know when to stop. Uh, you have to know when to, you know, the messengers are so important, right? So there's something I often say it is not just the story, but it's also the kind of stories you tell and they have to be true to who you are as a, as a storyteller. So look this, I'm not a professional like teaching people

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       how to tell stories. I can't do that professionally. I know I do it in my, I practice it, I got it from my parents. I think it's a wonderful craft to think about, read books and read books and figure out what piece of that is really catching your heart. It always starts with the heart. It always come from place of commonality and laughter and love or, or pain or something from the heart before you can engage the mind. And that those sorts of stories always tend to win. So want to underscore something you said then I want to ask about this very, very, uh, clear smirk that came on your face when you just said something a second ago. But, uh, I think the going for the heart or noticing what captures the heart applies to questions too. So, uh, for instance, a cal Fussman who was one of the main writers of the, what I learned column and Esquire for a long, long, long time, I want to say 10 plus years interviewed Gorbachev and all these people routinely would get told right before an interview.

Speaker 5:          00:42:33       Yeah, this hour long interview, you now have five minutes. And so you would have to hook someone like Gorbey into continuing to talk and you'd think about his questions. And then he'd say, you know, tell me about when your father left for war and was there any particular lesson he taught you? And he would go for the emotion first and that would then allow him to get to the headier questions later. So I think that, uh, it applies to not only the telling of stories, but the asking, the eliciting of stories and good storytelling is that right? So in a good story, a really phenomenal story is one way you actually are having this relationship with their audience. And it's a two way story when p and people do that magically, you're at a whole nother kind of level of it. And like when you talk about how you organize your questions, you know, it sounds so simple, like, okay, he's got a bunch of questions that there's so much thought going into it because you're actually engaging a story.

Speaker 5:          00:43:27       You're doing it in that way so that you can get the whole thing kind of coming out. Right? Yeah, absolutely. And, uh, the, the piece that I wanted to ask about it, and maybe it was just because you enjoy smiling and do it so well, but you said you have to know when to stop and then you may thing yet this big grin on your face. Maybe that was just me noticing something that wasn't there, but what's, what's behind knowing when to stop or like what's the opposite? What does that look like? Just telling a long story that goes on too long. The best storytellers leave you wanting to hear more best comedians just absolutely we leave you wanting to hear more. There's a real art to that. You can't give it all away. You have to leave the audience saying, I wanted to hear like tell me more. Like, and that's really important about knowing when to be able to stop and you can always explain things many, many ways. And I'm, I'm really not particularly today by the ways and then in my apologizing a little bit for that. But that's a really important skill to know. Like when does that story end? Don't bury the punchline,

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       you know, like, you know, like so many times it's like there's a whole windup where I'm going to tell you now a story about a monkey that stole Mike. Don't do that. Just go right into it. Like, cause you have them at the first minute and then at every minute after that you're going to start losing audience shares. So you want to get it fast and get right into, into it as fast as you can. So I want to talk about, uh, by the way, can I tell you one thing about that? Because I just think yes, of course. So, you know, when I was talking about the message and the message about owning your story, go, go do this. When you get a chance, when you get home, you know that song respect re res Pct, you know that song, right? Yeah. So who sang that?

Speaker 4:          00:45:14       Right at the Franklin? Everyone knows who read the fine grain or everyone can like Hammad right now if I played it to, you know, in a heartbeat, but she's not the one who's actually first sang it. It's actually done by Otis Redding. Same words, same song, very different. Meaning the song is really like exact opposite of where they are. Either makes that song to be Otis Redding Song. It's like, you know, I'm working all day woman and I'm like putting food on the table for you. And like when I fucking come home, I'm so sorry. I said Duh.

Speaker 4:          00:45:47       When I come home all I want is just like some goddamn respect. Right. That's his song. Never made it big. But all his writing was a big singer by then. A decent song, decent blue songs. She owned it. She complete same words but just the way she put that story together, her complete ownership of it and who will forget her spelling of that just makes her like mix of the one who remembers it and later on in life, Otis actually sort of kind of complaints slightly about about her, like taking the song and making it so huge and no one remembers that. He's the one who recorded it and sang it and performed it for at least two years before she came along. So just you want to hear, seek two stories, same story, told in different ways. Listen to those two songs. That's amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:46:39       I had no idea. I want to talk about some of the stories and the stories may not be the right word, but narratives that have stuck with you. And I'm going to prompt with a question and I can certainly cheat a little bit in prompt, but what is the book or books you've given the most as a gift and why, or books that have influenced you? Yeah, we, Tim and I have talked about this a little bit. So for me, books are like all about the moment in the motion that I'm in and the person I'm giving it to. It is an, and so I can't tell you that there's one book that has predominated how I give, because I love books and I love to give books and I carry books around. And even today I brought two books for you to autograph that I'm giving away.

Speaker 4:          00:47:19       Right? So there's an act of giving and that, and that in a book is a wonderful way to convey something to another person. Um, books that I've loved giving away. Um, Norman Maclean's river runs through it. I read that book in so many different ways and so many pieces. It totally influenced my life in terms of fly fishing and finding sort of magic and words, that quiet space. You also wrote that book when he was 71 years old. Kind of really the only big book he wrote said 71. And you think about all this bullshit about like creative genius being in the young and all of that. As you get older you start appreciating that if Norman could do it at 71, maybe I could do it like, you know, not quite at 71 yet. Um, another book I really liked, um, more recent book is Stanley Mcchrystal's team of teams.

Speaker 4:          00:48:07       Completely different reason. Just a really clever, smart book about how to organize businesses and enterprises for today's world. And he takes us in sort of experience from the army and in, in, in Afghanistan and sort of, you know, and brings it over to sort of to your life or my life and makes it kind of relevant and meaningful. I found it very influential. Um, I, I've given away a quite a few copies of James Nester's book, the deep joy. You might have read, write, read his, haven't read the deer. That book is pretty damn good. It's about, it's about free diving. I knew nothing about and that was, that was one of my birthday things. That was like two years ago. So I thought I'd tried the spray down in him because I read an estrous book and it's amazing the physiology of the human body and what it can do is amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:48:56       So I read this book, it's about free diving and very scary, very sort of can be very dangerous sport, but also an amazing sport because it completely changes the way you think about your body and what you're capable of. And I thought, what, right this is, this book inspired me. I'm going to go try and take a lesson in freedom. So went to Hawaii around my birthday and I took a lesson from a very, very good, you want to do this with someone very, very good. And I did. And this woman's Shelly Eisenberg, who was my teacher for the day, you know, basically, look, this is what she did. Within three hours, I can hold my breath for like maybe 45 seconds, maybe a minute. I tried within three hours, three hours just by doing exercises with me. She had me at two minutes, 10 seconds. That floored me. It'd be like saying how fast can you run it and be like, okay, I can do like a nine minute mile. And you saying, well give me three hours and I get you down to like a six minute. Like he just couldn't do that and that. And she's like, yeah, like let's keep going. And like sure enough, you know, the new, you're doing three minutes, three minutes within 24 hours under yeoman. True story can do it. Everyone in here can do that too. That's why that book was so kind of mentally be

Speaker 3:          00:50:10       transformative. I feel obligated as the person who, certainly not a doctor, and you've heard this before, I don't play one on the Internet, but you have to be very, very careful with this type of training. Uh, so do not do take the DIY approach. Uh, I know people, I know people who have died and I know people who have come very close to dying from shallow water blackouts. And when you, depending on the technique, if you blow off a lot of CO2, you won't sense that you're going to black out before you blackout. You're fine and then you're blacked out. But you don't really want to have happen in any amount of water. Right. You could Jimi Hendrix herself or it could be in a thousand feet of water, same outcome. So be very, very careful only with supervision. But it is fascinating.

Speaker 4:          00:50:54       Yeah. I mean two navy seals drowned in a training exercise in San Diego like two years ago. Yeah. Just the two of them just trying this out and breaking the rules of that. The number one thing with this is just like you're doing it with a buddy who can do this better than you can and, and, and she goes and you definitely want to do this. And that's why I didn't just try this. Yeah. I read his book. Then I went and got like one of the best teachers and I spent time with her. And that's why I think it's

Speaker 3:          00:51:20       thanks billboards. Let's talk about them. If you could have a giant billboard anywhere with anything on it, Bill Billboard with a message you would get out to millions or billions of people, what would it say and why?

Speaker 4:          00:51:36       Um, I'm going to take an easy one out, but yeah, I'm going to use one of the slogans that we at conservation international use in some ways, which I would probably say something like, either people need nature that's not obvious enough. I'd say nature speaking, I might say nature screaming and I'd like to put those outside every place where there's like this quote unquote natural disaster, which is usually a human disaster that was exacerbated by just not listening to nature. Um, that's what I do. And I'd always influenced by like, you drive across this country, you see these signs for like religious purposes, right? Like so, so, and so daddy will do this to you or not do this to you, only you believe. And I was taught, well, why don't we put that same kind of effort into putting billboards up that says nature screaming or nature speaking, when are we going to listen to something like that? So that's probably what I done it.

Speaker 3:          00:52:32       I really want to, and this isn't just a professional courtesy, so we can talk about the work you're doing. Conservation and uh, the, the state of progressive destruction of our natural habitats and surroundings causes me a lot of anxiety. Uh, personally. Uh, in part because I feel like for instance, if a study comes out on metabolism and there are a bunch of conflicting headlines and things are poorly interpreted by certain media, I can parse it. I can go to pub med, I can figure out what's what. But in the world of a conservation are trying to do the right thing, I sometimes feel lost in the sense that I attempt to do the right thing when I perceived to be the right thing. And then I find out, oh shit, that type of wild caught fish or farmed is exactly the opposite of what I should be doing or whatever it might be.

Speaker 4:          00:53:27       B a

Speaker 6:          00:53:29       what are,

Speaker 3:          00:53:32       you're gonna have a lot of people listening to this, people in this room, then people on the podcast. What are some of, if people want to think more precisely about this and feel like they can take proactive steps, what are some of the most common misconceptions about conservation? Or what's a smart way to just approach it? Thinking about it?

Speaker 4:          00:53:56       Right. So the first thing I would say is don't let perfection and trying to find the silver bullet keep you out of the game. So we were both recently, um, at a, at summit in Los Angeles and you know, I heard people talk about philanthropy and giving and wanting to find like the most perfect way to get, and I was sorta struck by how many people were around me all nodding. And I used to think to myself like really like, yeah, okay, I want to make sure my dollar goes the furthest as well. There's so many other things in life, which we waste all the time. And why this one? We want perfection. So you know, when you, when I, when someone says to me like, tell me the one thing I can do to change the planet. Like, guess what, there isn't, there's lots of things and it's messy.

Speaker 4:          00:54:50       You're not always going to get a right. And is it better to drink out of ceramic cup that you have to wash in hot water or uh, you know, a Styrofoam Cup. Those are important questions for you to think about, but ultimately they shouldn't stop you from, from getting engaged. So the truth of the matter is very, very, very few people are actually engaged in like trying to care about the fate of our planet, fate of where we live and our kids lives. Um, and I just want to get more people in it. And I think if more in it, then absolutely we'll come up with more honed solutions. But it shouldn't stop you from getting in it. So that's like my first thing. I would say if you want to make some small changes in your life, like what you eat and how you cook, it makes a huge difference.

Speaker 4:          00:55:38       Like it's probably the one thing that you could do to being thoughtful, like whether it's farm caught or wa that's it. Useful question to think about and try to get least the best pathway there. And I can answer that for you. Like you like seafood watch and the Monterey Bay aquarium puts out, gives you a reasonable pathway, but how you cook and how you waste food, like wasting food is a big, big deal. Like your energy output on those, it's like completely outweighs what car you drive or anything like that. Right? So that's just something simple you can do, you know, get engaged in the political system. I think it really does matter. I, I, you know, I mean it really does matter, right? So there was this kind of crazy decision very recently on, on wanting to at this moment in time, but all of these crises are going on the planet on, on overturning the ban on importing elephant heads from, from trophy hunting from Zimbabwe and Zambia like that actually somehow became a priority for the administration.

Speaker 4:          00:56:44       Like all of a sudden like we're gonna like, oh, turn the bands so that any hunter who goes to Zimbabwe or Zambian shoots an elephant and bring the ivory and they had into the country. Like, why is that all of a sudden the thing to do? And people really got upset about it and believe it or not kind of did change something. At least for now, there's been a reversal of that decision. So the administration has decided to like, wait on that for a while. So make your voices heard. It's important that you make your voices heard and don't sit this out.

Speaker 3:          00:57:16       Are there any other resources that you would suggest people look to? Like Seafood Watch or

Speaker 7:          00:57:22       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:57:23       any other websites where people could find simple things they might not think of like this lower shipping,

Speaker 7:          00:57:30       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:57:32       to make an impact. I mean, if just assuming these people are busy professionals with high demands on their time,

Speaker 4:          00:57:41       would you suggest they look okay? So now and without being totally self serving. So I will say my own organization, conservation.org decent website. You'll find lots of ways in which you can be engaged. The Nature Conservancy, nature.org decent website, lots of ways you can get engaged in environmental defense fund. They do a lot of great work, particularly in the United States around climate. Um, world resource institute gives you the macro picture. They've great graphics, great infographics, gives you sort of the macro picture. Um, I did a series recently on vox vox with the University of California called climate labs, which are just these eight minute very short digestible little videos on something like food waste, slightly irreverent, slightly counter intuitive, simple ways in which you can either get engaged or make the change in your life. You can have an impact. And so we took a bunch of different topics like shipping and, and did the short videos on, it's called climate labs on box.

Speaker 4:          00:58:44       So those are sort of things that come quickly to mind. But here's the most important thing. Seriously, I really mean this. We really are on a race to save the planet. I really, really believe this. W you know, here's the thing, we're the only generation who actually has some foresight. I think that this and the entire history of humanity, we had to like rely on like crystal balls and like, you know, like, I don't know, like a burning Bush, right? Sitting where we are, give us a glimpse to give us a glimpse of where we're heading. And now we actually some big with the first generation in human history to see the INTAPP Emmett John Glenn, before he passed away, amazing guy makes America just American to go round planet. See the whole thing I asked him, he said he had blew me away. I never thought we could see the whole planet all at once.

Speaker 4:          00:59:36       Like if you were standing on a flat earth, if you're standing on, on uh, on the, on the seashore, you see about seven miles after that, the horizon dips away. And as long as humans have been around, we've been climbing taller and taller mountains, towers, trees to be able to see what's over the horizon, what are we looking for? We're thinking about Elian that's over the horizon and my buyers are looking for opportunity now in our generation we can see the whole thing and only that we also mostly all connected. There is no reason for us not to act right now and believe me, that window is small and if we don't do it, I swear future generation will look back and said, what a waste. You had that opportunity when the opportunity costs was actually relatively cheap. The price of conservation will never get cheaper in the future. It's as cheap as it's going to get now, only get more expensive. So not acting now is crazy and that's what people who've done the giving pledge, like Cakes d case and others. I so applaud that because they're not just saying we're going to lead this. We would, you know, leave this for future generations to deal with this and we're going to deal with it now because right now it's probably the cheapest to be able to deal with it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:48       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:00:55       so I'll ask just a few more questions and then we'll do some audience and then we'll head off to Tequila shots or whatever comes next. But I really want to ask you what you found helpful for training humans to think more long term. Because it strikes me that if you look at history and you don't have to go very far back, but you certainly could, that we've a mall, we've evolved for millions of years effectively to survive until puberty have sacks and procreate. Yeah. That's basically, yeah. I mean that's Darwinism at work and people will act in their, in intensely,

Speaker 1:          01:01:41       uh,

Speaker 3:          01:01:45       I mean, worst of interests, long term for short term gain. Yeah. How do you train people to think more, uh, in long, longer term time horizons and in ways that are more communal and not individual? It's, it seems like a very tough task, but a very, very, very important one. What does it, what are some of the,

Speaker 1:          01:02:08       okay,

Speaker 3:          01:02:08       most effective learnings or lessons that you've had with that?

Speaker 4:          01:02:12       I, I'm, I don't know. That's the truth of the answer. I don't know how to fundamentally evolutionary biology. It is so hardwired into us, the people who do and do it rationally. So you'd like look at like, you know what Charlie Munger says, right? It says, look, we basically, our investment technology technique, you know, that he and buffered use is just don't do anything stupid over the long run. Pretty much that that's, he basically says that, right? It's, it's surprisingly simple, but incredibly hard to follow, incredibly hard to follow. And the people who do it tend to be sort of investors and others who, who, who sort of faithfully follow a system. But even they get spooked as we, as we've seen many, many times over. Right? So it's very difficult to beat it. So I'm not trying to do that. I'm just trying to figure out how I can make you changing your life for the betterment of the planet in your own enlightened self interest.

Speaker 4:          01:03:09       And the better I can do that and tell you that it's actually gonna make your life better now. Now, now, now, not even your kids, but your life, the better chance I have of promoting change. The interesting thing is it doesn't have to be rational because we do so many things that are completely irrational and so it doesn't have to be rational. It, it can be very emotional and it has to be about your own enlightened self interest. It can't be about the future. So I think at some point we'll have to do around too. But look, that's just my, like I'm stuck and any help you have and want to throw it my way. Wowway we'll, we'll take it, but I'm actually stuck because I know much better communicator than I am and far smarter people than I am in my field was, we're basically stuck as well.

Speaker 4:          01:04:00       Well too. To that point with them. I know my next question is going to be what ask would you have of people listening, is there anything that you're looking for, any particular type of help or just next steps that people you would like to see people take? Because you have to have a lot of people listening, people in all different walks of life, different sectors, every possible place imaginable. What would you like them to do or consider? So, um, the most important thing you could do for me or for us or for this cause is to be a messenger. It really is quite simply that because the people who are more likely to listen or people like yourself, the more likely it is that message coming from you than if it came from me. And that's really like, so I strongly believe like I strongly believe in that, right? It's the messenger matters as much as the master and you can reach audiences that I could never reach. So being that messenger to carry that message into your community, into your church or synagogue, your place of worship, your school, your community, your family is far, far more useful than me trying to just get my voice to be bigger and bigger and bigger. Thank you. Uh, and where can people say

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       hello to you on social or learn more about what you're up to? Is Twitter the best place? I'm sorry. Is Twitter the best place for him?

Speaker 4:          01:05:27       Twitter is a good place. Um, Facebook is also really good because it allows a longer conversation to just sort of occur. So you know, I'm, I can easily be found as m Sanjayan and some on Facebook and that's a good place to also engage in trade is fine too. Then conservation.org yeah, and conservation.org. So I, you know, I think our website and our social media platform is a great place to engage. Perfect. So we'll take me for a DC audience, but I think also for our global audience.

Speaker 1:          01:05:56       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:05:57       So this is, this is, I think a good place to grab. Just a few questions, then we can, we can close up and have some, have some Tequila. Give George Clooney a few hundred million more dollars. February as a customer. You go story. What us.

Speaker 4:          01:06:10       All right. By the way, while he's thinking about that, I, one of the book I want to mention to you guys, especially for this town, is a book called down destiny of the republic by Candace Maillard. It's a fantastic book. She's a great author and she talks about President Garfield and being shot and how his life could have been saved if they'd only listened to the surgeon who gave them the advice. But he was sort of ignored because it was this black surgeon in the union army. And instead they took another route. And it's just been a fascinating story about race and technology at the cusp of, of a really important moment in our nation. But a president that very few people had heard about, but who, if he had survived with completely changed the course of our country, probably for the better.

Speaker 3:          01:06:54       So this, this is a question from bill long island. Uh, it's addressed to me, but I'm going to ask you, since I've talked at nauseum about my mornings, uh, what does the first 60 to 90 seconds of your day look like? I'm going to modify this, uh, but, but he's asking what, what to do to jump start the first waking moments. Do you have any morning rituals or routines that are consistent for you?

Speaker 1:          01:07:19       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:07:19       Uh, anything that you do in the first coffee? Yeah. Uh, to jumpstart my day? Yeah. Or just anything that you do as part of your routine in the mornings. Yeah. So, you know, I often put like the toughest things I need to deal with and the most creative things early in the morning. It's just as simple as that. Um, I tend not to, um, I tend not to check my email until I'm actually starting work. That's just something I, my, my work email on until I'm actually starting. What is it just really quiet as the mine and what, so what happens with email is, especially for my company because it's a global organization, so I get emails in the middle of the night and so they pile up and see if I find out that if I, if I open my day by checking email, I get diverted into all these other small things that I am very bad at saying no to. So I kind of ruined the rest of that day and raw the, I sort of want to set my agenda then look at it and deal with the ones I can deal with and ignore the others.

Speaker 3:          01:08:22       This is a question from, it's either Eric or Erin, I'm not quite sure. Uh, who's your most recent mentor and what has that person taught you? And I mean we could make that if you have an answer for that. Great. Otherwise we could, we could modify it to just be what is a recent lesson that you've learned or insight.

Speaker 4:          01:08:41       So you know, that's a good one because it kind of Hawk Hawk of the back to you know, tribe, tribal mentor. So one of the things that I did that I found very, very useful in my life and I think for many of you you could apply to is that some years ago I created a personal board, so a group of individuals who would personally spend a little bit of time investing in me and my success, and I didn't do this because it's some grandiose notion of why was it struck me that whenever you wanted like letters of reference, when you go for a job, you're always didn't have to like sort of scramble around and try to catch up to people who you haven't spoken to for a long time and hope they'll give you this letter and they really don't know you by that point in life is sort of gone by and they'll, well, what happens if I had a group of say five individuals that I would pick and I would make a promise that I've never solicited them for money, which I've, I've kept up in, there's some now do give to Cei, but that's not the purpose.

Speaker 4:          01:09:34       They don't belong to my organization. They're not my board for my organization. There my personal board, um, and the great people and I would just say to them, listen, can you do this for me? I'll meet with you two, maybe three times a week. We'll have coffee or lunch two, three times a week, sorry, two or three times a year. Okay, I got it. I was like, man, this is a really generous for us. Sorry. Um, and we'll, you know, we'll just have a little conversation and, and a catch up and I can just occasionally ping you for guidance. That has been incredibly, incredibly useful. I picked some great people. Um, you might know some of them, but it's been very, very helpful.

Speaker 3:          01:10:14       Okay. So I want to, I want to dig into this because this is really interesting. So your personal board, by the way, they all said yes. One person tell me down. Well, yeah, how can we not get into this? Uh, now I want to mention just as a side note, because people might find this helpful. Something that I've found very helpful from Chris Fussell who, uh, coauthored a team of teams with Stan Mcchrystal and he was, uh, stands aide to camp for quite a long time and Jay sock, uh, and advice that he was given was at all times. You want to surround yourself with at least three people, someone who is doing an excellent job of what you hope to be doing, say a few years from now, someone who is doing a better job than you are in some capacity at what you're doing now. And then somebody who is doing something you used to do, but it's doing it much better than you did. And that was how he ended up seeking people to surround himself

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       with. How did you choose since they all said yes, I guess you reached out to five or six people, right? Or how did you choose those people? What were the criteria? You know, I look, I wanted people I, I respected. So that was sort of important to me. They had to be people I really sort of respected. I wanted people who were not in my field because I had plenty of colleagues in my field. Um, I wanted people, so it was, I'll just give you some, I'll give you some names. I don't think it matters that much. So Tom Tierney Bridgespan, he's also the chairman of the Nature Conservancy now. Really Smart Guy. You know, he kind of gets how businesses should organize. He sort of just this, he coached me on how to get the CEO job for conservation international and the tips he gave me what incredibly valuable, like incredible.

Speaker 4:          01:12:05       I'd never realized that you could actually coat your way into a job. And that guy really helped me do that. So that was one. Paula Kerger, she's the see the president of PBS mazing woman. Very unusual. She was a development staff. She asked people for money and then rose up the ranks and ended up running. PBS should also is across the road from my office. So it's kind of easy to sometimes see her really smart, very thoughtful, wonderful kind, generous person gaining set. Neimann crosspoint venture partners. It's one as companies also race car driver, that guy interview CEO's for lending. So his whole job is about interviewing CEO's and deciding which ones he wants to bet on. As a, as a venture capital guy, really useful for me as I'm thinking about what qualities and attributes I want to strengthen, you know, as a CEO. So I sort of looked at it that way as I created this group of folks who could sort of help and guide.

Speaker 4:          01:13:00       Were they people that you'd had contact with before or yeah, no, no. They were all people who had somehow been in my orbit. And then I thought, well let's just try and make this formal in some way and let's just see if they would agree to do this. And they all said, yeah, and one or two of those. But yes, so long as you do that to me in return, which was a very nice flattering thing. I, I'm sure it doesn't work that way, but that's been very useful. And, and believe me, I did end up using that board when I went through my seat, the CEO search. So it was 150 days ago, our founder who had been running contribution to Nashville for 30 years step down and you know, and I became the CEO and last year the board went through a very challenging process of trying to decide who the next CEO and what the next leadership team would look like.

Speaker 4:          01:13:49       And it's a very scary moment for an organization because all the half of the CEOs who come in after found a fail. And actually if you want to get the job, you want to be the one in waiting. Like seriously. Like that's what typically happens. New CEO comes in, they fail and either the old CEO comes back or the person in waiting kind of gets the role and then runs it. So it's fraught with challenges and dangers all over the place. And I really didn't think I would get it. I thought there was a chance I would get it, but I was really worried about it for lots of reasons, including my color to be absolutely honest. Um, and this, these groups of this mentoring group, honest to God, coached me, them. And a couple of other people really helped coach me through this. Can you share any of the advice?

Speaker 4:          01:14:34       Yeah, one of the good simple one. So this is such an amazing thing and I've applied for other jobs before, like kind of like the CEO or top level person job and not got that three times in the past. I've been rejected for that. Get very close. And then somehow either they talked me out of it, I get rejected, here's what I was doing. So they would ask me. So do you like, tell me about the social, why do you want the job? Well look, I've got a good career. I don't really need this. But you know, if it was the right thing, you know, you kind of had this like kind of a long meandering story about saying, you know, I'm not totally vested. Like yeah, I could do this, but I could do a lot of other things. And I actually feel that way in a lot of ways.

Speaker 4:          01:15:13       Right? So in a lot of ways I think I'm definitely, I didn't start my life again. I want to be the CEO of Conservation International. There was never a dream is never a goal, never got the goal was much. It goes to have impact and really care how I had impact, but with these guys said to me was like, one guy actually said this to him. He said, that is not the right answer. I want you to repeat after me. Say I will walk through a wall to get this job. He said, I'll say it like my radio set side. I walked through. It says, now when you go into an interview, they're going to ask you this question and I want you to repeat this. I will walk through. He did. First question, why do you want this job? Tell us what prepared you for this job.

Speaker 4:          01:15:52       I said, let me make one thing clear. I will walk through a wall together and they all went great because guess what? Most times when you're hiring people, and I do this all the time, I hire people all the time and I'm so amazed that I didn't listen to my own rule. You want someone who gives you the confidence that they will solve the problems that you don't want to deal with. You want someone who's coming in and say, you know what? I got this. You don't want someone to come in and say, I don't know if I really wanted to convince me it start negotiating day one. Don't want to do that. It's a very, very simple rule. So whatever job you go for, start by saying, let me be clear. I really want the swack job. I will walk through a wall to get the job. Now let me tell you what makes me so great for this and slay it out. You can negotiate later. Really some point

Speaker 3:          01:16:44       when you sent the emails out to recruit this x men team of mentors to formal structure. Well, a couple of questions and this won't go on and on for hours. Don't worry guys, even though it could and it might later with Tequila. Uh, I don't know why I keep thinking of Tequila. We could psychoanalyze that later. Uh, do you interact with these mentors as a group or is it all

Speaker 4:          01:17:07       one, two, one, one on one? All that they know about on one because getting them together as a group would be too impossible. Yeah. Do you block out say a week? Every quarter just to schedule them in in batches? Yeah, and I did not. I schedule it around travel that I have unnecessary. So I do this as much as I can in person unless I have a crisis or an emergency and just need to get on the phone and then they're always willing. Like I, I literally, today I had a little 90 crazy, I literally had a CEO of a company, I didn't want to name it, but normally nor was enormous company he would turn to my call today is so slow. It's like, I'm so sorry it took me so long to get back to you. And I'm like, are you kidding me?

Speaker 4:          01:17:48       And he's like, they, you know, once you get that relationship with that few individuals, it, it does work. It can really work very well. Did you make, did you say, Hey, let's grab coffee and then make the pitch in person or did you lay it out in email made it either? No, I did. I don't think I did by email. I think I did all by phone or when I met them in person after back the first coffee. So the people I knew, well I did by phone and the Pea by, I'll tell you one thing though, I do take it so seriously. So when I go to see them are two things that I never make informal. Like two things that I never make informal. One is when I talked to my board, my organization board or my group of mentors board, which means I put on a shirt, I kind of, you know, I put on a jacket if it's appropriate, I just, whatever way you want to do it, and it's not about dress code, but whatever you want to do it, you want to make sure they understand that you are using and taking their hour really seriously.

Speaker 4:          01:18:45       So just don't waste time with that. The other thing I do, I always take seriously when I ask people for money, something that I never do kind of on the, I will never ask someone for a donation or to fund conservation and tasks or when I'm having a drink with them or when I'm like fly fishing with them or going on a hike with them because people don't want to be hit up all the time the same and I think you want to go do that and like enjoy it and have fun and then you want to say, can I meet with you at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon or can I meet with you at 8:00 AM 8:00 AM tomorrow today? Whatever it is you want to like just clean up, show up and be straight about it. It's, it lasts like two questions, 20 questions again, but when you're preparing for one of these meetings, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:19:29       What does it look like? I mean you're trying to make you have 60 minutes with such and such super hot shot. What's the format of the hour? It often depends. At this point? It depends on what the major thing that I'm dealing with as it has been and what's been kind of bugging me on my mind that I really, could you give an example or is it too personal? I mean, look good. Look, there's no, it is not a big surprise. Anytime a founder leaves an organization, there are, there's the, Oh, so here's a really legitimate answer. So I was not the only internal candidate going for this job. There were two other very, very good candidates for this job as well, and they both could do this job. It both could be CEOs. And my number one task as soon as I knew I was going to get this job was to figure out a way to keep them.

Speaker 4:          01:20:15       The almost never happens, and I think what you've just done, you've now lost the second best person to run your organization, just walk out your door. It almost never happens. So that was something I prepared for. I thought about how I might try to project. I went to them and I said, this is a problem. It's a big problem. Tell me what I need to do to be able to do this. And they gave me some of, not all of them, I mean different people. And you've got to pick and choose. You know, you've got to filter that advice. But the two individuals, I went to, Amy, incredibly good advice that I followed to a t and it's served me well because I think it's every Malbec get both those individuals are incredibly valuable and, and still part of contribution. Well, all that. Thank

Tim, this episode is brought to you by Peloton and I'd heard about Peloton over and over again, but I ended up getting a Peloton bike in the whole system. After I saw my buddy Kevin Rose and note of forever, some of you know, and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic. I asked him as a dude, you look great. What the hell have you been up to? Because he's always doing a weird diet or another, but it only lasts like a week or two. So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers and he said, I've been doing peloton five days a week. Now that caught my attention because Kevin does nothing five days a week and you know, I love you Kevin, but it really peaked my curiosity. Ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week.

Speaker 8:          01:24:39       I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling really boring usually. But peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into your home. You know if worry about fitting classes into your schedule or making into a studio with some type of commute, etc. New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New York City instructors in your own living room. You can even live streams do you a classes taught by the world's best instructors or find your own favorite class on demand. And in fact, Kevin and I rarely do live classes and you can compete with your friends, which is also fun. Kevin, I'm coming after you but we usually just use classes on demand. I really like Matt Wilbur's and his iron, high intensity training sessions that are shorter, like 20 minutes.

Speaker 8:          01:25:26       And I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone seems to have their favorite instructor or you can select by music duration and so on. Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking metrics. I think that that along with the real time leaderboard, are the main reasons that this caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before. It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep your attention. The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you would expect, so it can fit in the living room or an office. I actually have it in a large closet, believe it or not, and it fits with no problem.
