Speaker 2:          00:04:35       Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. End My brand new podcast tribe of mentors because this guest is suitable for both Mike Maples. He's one of my favorite people, one of my oldest mentors, not in biological age, but he goes back probably 1520 years teaching me and he is the man who effectively taught me how to invest and the audio you're going to hear was recorded in front of a sold out audience at the Castro theatre in San Francisco. It was a blast. Thank you everyone for coming out and it takes us a few minutes to warm up and then we get into not only investing but also his life philosophies, parenting. He is such a splendid human being and has a very, very wide set of skills. So I hope you enjoy this conversation with Mike Maples.

Speaker 1:          00:05:27       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:05:28       thank you so much for coming everybody. This is going to be great and I'll read some suggested introductory remarks. First, thank you all for coming tonight. Welcome to tonight's program with Inforum at the Commonwealth club. And what I'm not going to do is sit here and regurgitate stuff that is already in the book that you just bought cause that's very boring. So what I thought I would do instead is invite one of my friends who is in this book to join me on stage and to dig into some of the old stories, the stuff you guys haven't heard and to really just banter because he is one of my favorite people. So who is this favorite person?

Speaker 3:          00:06:11       Kevin Rose is one of my favorite people but he has a brand new human being to take care of. So he is not here to boost it up with Ferris. I'm very sad to say Mike maples junior can find them on twitter@mtwojrfloodgate.com Mike maples junior is a partner at floodgate of venture capital firm that specializes in microcap investments in startups. He's also the person responsible for introducing me to tech investing in general and we go way, way back. He has been on the Forbes Midas list since 2010 and named one a fortune magazine's eight rising stars before becoming a full time investor. This is very important. Mike was an operator. He was involved as a founder and operating executive at back to back. Startup IPO is including Tivoli systems. It's acquired by IBM motive IPO motive acquired by Alcatel Lucent. Some of Mike's investments include Twitter, twitch dot. TV, Ng, Moco, Weebly, check Bizaarvoice Spiceworks, Okta demand for us and many, many, many others. Please help me welcome to the stage Mike Maples, right?

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:07:21       Thought we were just having a little chat at like a bookstore or something. I guess you tend to draw a crowd. I keep forgetting that still. Yeah, I was trying to

Speaker 3:          00:07:30       put us connecting on a timeline and I think we've had a number of, of interactions beginning it had to be back pre 2000.

Speaker 4:          00:07:43       I think it, and I think when we first started catching up, it was um, the right before you had done the four hour workweek and you were so, um, Tim, Tim wasn't sure what to call this, but am I just anything goes, anything goes, I may regret. But yeah, so, so Tim and you know, I'm a little bit less over my skis sometimes and Tim is, uh, well it depends on the area but w whatever. So, um, but so Tim was deciding whether to call the book, uh, the four hour workweek or drug dealing for fun and profit. And, um, and I was like, Tim, why do you want to write a book about being a Druggie? You know, this is just terrible idea. You know, you'd be, it's just a terrible influence, just, just a bad idea. And Tim was like, well, you know, you really want to get people, you know, sort of provoked the point of departure, right to, to get access to the ideas. And so we did this thing, I think we called it ghetto testing where we said, hey look, let's not argue, let's not in your opinion versus mine. Let's just test the two titles and just say, Hey, by the four hour workweek, hey, by drug dealing for fun and profit. And you know, neither book exists yet. So people would click on it and they get

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       a four o four error. But we could, we could understand like what got the better response. And so now it was no longer your opinion versus mine. It was just like, what do people respond to? So we did this. That's my recollection. No, we had this testing, but it goes even further back. So you had appeared, I was more of a spectator in a class that I took in college, like undergraduate back when I had more hair on my head. And Mike came to talk about thunder lizards. Yes. Which we'll talk about in a moment. And that was part of what piqued my interest in silicon valley, the bay area, the excitement, certainly at the time 99 who granted I was an exciting time to be running towards the precipice also. Uh, but got me out here. And then our conversations around the time that the four hour work week came out, uh, involved to my recollection, many things.

Speaker 3:          00:09:53       But we would sit at, and I might be getting this wrong, but hobbies, hobbies, yeah. In town and country town, which unfortunately no longer with us. Have it on at Raster Darrow. And we used to just eat omelets and uh, and talk about marketing and PR, but also about the deals that you were becoming involved with. Yeah. And the, the testing for people who don't know, it was very simple. I mean we had a number of different titles and a used Google ad words, which was, I mean it was the golden age of Google ad words. You could just shoot fish in a barrel. It was so inexpensive. And so he took the, the headlines prospective headlines as the, as the actual ad headlines and then the perspective subtitles as the ad text and then had all these unique URLs that, like you said, and went nowhere because all we really cared about was the click through rate.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       What I also did, if we want to talk about businesses going out of business, there are a lot of them to point to is I went to Palo Alto University AV to the borders that existed at the time and to test covers. I had mock ups that I printed out and I would wrap a book that was roughly the same size. I thought mine would be put it up during what I perceived to be rush hour at borders. Not sure how I figured that out. And I would say stand there like a bouncer, keeping track of fire code, like click, click watching the number of people who picked it up like every 15 minutes. So I get, try to look at the visual appeal of different covers. Now it's a lot easier. You don't have to quite do that. It's still this wine. Oh yeah, I should, maybe I need some booze up here and we'll get to that.

Speaker 3:          00:11:21       Uh, but what I wanted to do, so can I just interject one other thing about these books should interject with any other things. So I went to Kepler's bookstore and printers ink, I guess, right, because they're, they're like well known as bellwether bookstores and, uh, and I was like, I'm going to, I went and bought $1,000 worth of his book, four hour work week at both bookstores. And we didn't really know at the time, but bellwether bookstores kind of trigger supply chains. And so it's a little bit like before the APP store happened, right. Cause the iPhone out yet.

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       And so, so like I'd go into these bookstores and I'd be like, how many copies do you have in the bookstore? I want to buy him all because this book's going to be hot and I'm doing this offsite and I need every copy you've got. Cause I doubt you have enough copies for all people in this organization. I've run. And so it was just me at the time. But, uh, but like what it turned out it was true, right? It like, it becomes, oh wow. Kepler's bookstore in printer's ink. They're selling out like crazy as four hour work week and that is the hot heat seeker on the New York Times. And then more people read it too because up in the, and obviously it was a good book that helped, but uh, but it was like, just looking back on it, how, how crazy that was.

Speaker 4:          00:12:35       Cause I that like maybe you thought it was gonna be this huge, uh, breakout bestseller, but I remember I was just like, Hey, I'll read these drafts blank however I can. And like, I hope it works out. But yeah, whatever it was. I think you offered one of the very first blurbs in the first edition of four hour workweek. Halftone read additional copies. I go, okay, yeah. You're like, I ended up doing a quote too. She was like, okay, I'll do one. But when we're talking about this alchemy for instance, Kepler's let's just say, unbeknownst to me, there's certain stores that trigger certain other things and there's this Mexican black magic, but there's this, uh, these tipping points. So now people look at what you've accomplished and the investments you've made and the minus list and everything. And it's, Oh my God, Mike maples sort of in, in quotation marks.

Speaker 4:          00:13:25       But my understanding is that, uh, you had a tough time getting hired as a venture capitalist when you first got here. Talk a little bit about that. You know, it's like in a coach bill camp. How many people have heard of Coachville Campbell before a fair number? Uh, and for those of you haven't, I'll just give the quick version. Bill was an early executive at apple and then he ran a company called Claris and then go, which flamed out. And then he was CEO of intuit, but probably more significantly became kind of the most famous coach in Silicon Valley. He had been a football coach before. He's a business guy. And so he was on the board of Google and apple and a actually I got a chance to work with him and Twitter and in a demand force, which for two companies he got involved with that we invested in.

Speaker 4:          00:14:11       And um, uh, Bill's favorite song was you can't always get what you want by the rolling stones. And, uh, it always struck me that, and I, we won't do too much of the book, but um, that, that sometimes you use the stuff you're not getting right now that you think you want wasn't the thing you really wanted. And so I couldn't get any venture firms to hire me coming to silicon valley. I was just this random guy who'd moved to Silicon Valley from Austin, Texas. Never done an angel investment in my life. And uh, you know, Kevin Rose, one of your favorite guys. One of my favorites too. I'm the first to bat entrepreneurs I ever backed were Evan Williams, uh, who ended up doing Twitter and then Kevin Rose. And uh, by the time I met Kevin, no venture firm would hire me. Nobody thought I knew consumer Internet cause I was an enterprise software guy.

Speaker 4:          00:15:02       Nobody thought I knew how to invest. And I was like, Kevin, look, I just, um, I really need you to take my money on this thing. And I, you know, that's what we call a leverage open trade. I'm afraid that I'm, I'm going to have to go on hunger strike in your apartment if you don't take my money in this dig deal. And, um, you know, he, he ended up letting, letting me, you know, uh, Kevin and then Jay Adelson let me invest and dig and uh, you know, dig had a kind of a circuitous path, but, um, you know, I look back on it. Um, that was the sort of the booster rocket. Yeah. And uh, you know, it's funny. People talk about who back to them or whatever. Um, you know, I think that it, it was, uh, Kevin's generosity that, uh, sorta sorta got people I'd, sorry, get, no, I get caught up with this stuff. Sorry about that. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:15:59       So, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:16:02       so you and I share a similar affection for the same guy. Yeah. Kevin's a sweetheart of a guy. Yeah. Also, one goofy motherfucker is you guys know I, well, you know more about this stuff. I know more about, well, we won't get into that, but how do you connect with Kevin? I mean, how did that meeting end up happening? Well, it was a, Ron Conway was really generous. So, um, I heard about this guy named Ron Conway. I reached out to him who, I mean probably still, but it was thought of as the godfather of fame, the most famous angel investor of the world. Right. And so, so we go to the oasis and, and uh, was it the oasis? I care maybe the goose and uh, I say, well, you're wrong. No, no. A restaurant in Palo Alto and Menlo Park knows, I think it was the goose.

Speaker 4:          00:16:50       And, um, and, and so, so, uh, so w Ron's like, hey, great to meet you. And I said, Ron, I just want one chance, just one chance to work with you on one thing. Just give me one chance. It's all I need. And he's like, okay, whatever. You get your chance. What does that mean? And I said, well, there's this company that I'm interested in called dig. Then I had to come up with my own independent conviction about, but there's no way, like, how am I gonna ever get in touch with Kevin Rose? Right? I'm just some random dude. It's so, uh, so Ron's like, he looks at his spreadsheet and he's like, Oh yeah, I'm meeting with him next week. You want to come with me to see dig? And I'm like, sure, let's do it. And I just knew there be, you know, I knew what they were trying to do. You know, I cared a lot about their mission and you know, I wasn't talking about things like cohort analysis or you know, well like what was the retention and the decay factor of the users. It was more like, you guys are transforming journalism and this is like super important. And it's like the wisdom of the crowds to stories.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       And it's so like it was just, I think that part of why Kevin gave me a shot and Jay was that they just knew I just cared a lot about what they're doing for my own reasons. Well, I think that from, from the opposite side of the hubbies brunch table, when I heard you talking about startups, you are always genuinely personally vested and excited about the products and you spent a lot of time not just looking at the deal structure and the this and the that and the particulars of whatever the projections might be. But the product itself and knowing Kevin as well as I do now, like I would see that as a key factor. I mean also many other things to him then gravitating to you in that way. And I, when I think back to our, our lunches, we've talked about all these various things and I would pepper Mike with all these questions like, wait, what's, what's a claw back?

Speaker 3:          00:18:48       What's a Pro Rad? I don't know what that is. What's this, what's that? And eventually like any of it matters. It's, it's all blindfolded monkeys throwing darts. But I really wanted to know how the best blindfolded monkeys through the darts. So we're digging into it. And I remember at the time I was, I was pretty brief. This was before the four hour work week popped because keep in mind that that book had initial initial print run in between 10 and 12,000 copies, right? I mean not even national distribution, no one expected it to do really much of anything. And I was eager to take a little vacation and I thought this two year vacation called an Mba might be interesting. So I was looking at Stanford business school and I made all these visits and there was some great classes. One was taught by Pete Wendell, a venture capital inside the trenches, really great class by an operator.

Speaker 3:          00:19:42       But then there's all this theoretical stuff that I just couldn't quite stomach. And after, I don't know, four or five of these lunches, I said, wait a second, maybe I could put together a real world MBA and make this, you know, Tim Ferriss Fund in principle and spent 120 grand over two years and learn all these things. And develop all these relationships and view the 120 k's sunk costs, like that's gone. It's tuition, but I don't know if you recall, but right off the bat, what do I do? So I asked Mike if he'd be willing to let me piggyback on, on a couple of deals to co-invest and be really a sort of cheap labor to try to over deliver to these companies. And uh, if you want to mention it, you can, but I'm not going to bring up the name of the company, but they're, this company, uh, that, uh, you, you, you were very measured in, in assessing.

Speaker 3:          00:20:31       And he told me about it and it was super popular I think in Taiwan or somewhere and I got so over enthused. I was like, I want to put in 50 k now keep in mind that's like 50 k of 60 for my first year. And in the first deal I want to do 59. I remember you said to me at the time, and you're very Mike way, you said, well, well Tim, uh, don't you think that might be a little aggressive? And I was like, no man, this is going to be the next Google. And then I just saw your like, okay. And then, uh, yeah, that didn't, that didn't, uh, that, that forced me though. If you want to talk about like life saving you from what you want losing, I mean it wasn't immediately lost. That's part of the tricky one tricky aspect of the startup stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:21:13       It's like you might not have a clean loss for many, many, many years. I just might have like you solve that quickly. Yeah. So you might have a walking dead scenario where it's just like, I am legend and you're like, oh, now what do I do? Kind of like certain areas in SF past six o'clock anyway, so I need more alcohol so I can excuse all the things that I'm going to say. Uh, where was I? Oh yes. So the, the point was I had to then figure out something called advising because I was already out of money in year one. And that led to in that period of time, a lot of the absolute best connections that I made, including just to, just to highlight something that comes up over and over again in tribe of mentors. It comes up over and over again in conversations with you.

Speaker 3:          00:22:02       There are these catastrophes or business failures that really end up in no uncertain terms, sowing the seeds of really huge leader success. Right? Like you mentioned the Securitas path of dig, but who cares because you befriended and became an ally of Kevin Rose who knows everyone just about in tech and is very generous with making introductions and if he cares about you and believes in you, he'll make those introductions. Similarly, I ended up at one point introduced to Garrett Camp and I advise, Stumble upon, stumble upon, didn't work out, uh, but we had a chance to work together extensively. And then what a Garrett camp go on to do. He started this thing that people laughed at called Uber Cab Llc, which then got renamed. It became Uber. Right? So that at least on paper has worked out very well. That's more important than clawbacks. Yeah. More important than club.

Speaker 3:          00:22:56       Uh, so first and foremost, thank you for, uh, shepherding me even as a viewer are a quick study, as much of a blunt instrument as I was into all of that. But can you tell us about some of the responses from the venture capitalists, these rejections? Like what happened? Can you tell us about a meat? You don't have to name names, but like, you know, meetings go, I don't blame him. I mean, uh, I had never made an angel investment before I was from Austin, Texas. I had no network here. I just show up saying, hey, I think I want to be a VC and, um, you know, let's not a, not a very straight forward path. Um, and so, you know, I would call up sequoia capital and say, Hey, I'd like to interview for a job. It's sequoia capital. And that's just not how it really works.

Speaker 3:          00:23:42       And so, um, you know, I have no animus towards anybody. Like they probably, um, you know, they probably made the right decision at the time for what their parameters were. See you have a characteristic, it seems, at least in the way you express yourself, that I don't see in a lot of people. And that is, you seem to hold very, very few grudges. I don't think I've ever heard you express ill will towards anyone. Uh, especially in this day and age. But that's a rarity. Is that something that you've always had by, by birth or is that something you developed? Why is that? It's a waste of time. But how did you learn that? How did you embody this? Because if you, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:24:31       I, I dunno, I Kinda, I kinda look at it like life is short. You don't have much time. Every day is a gift. And the, the part of the secret of happiness is to figure out what your gift is and to offer it to the world and to like not worry about all the noise and the hype around you that says what you should do. You know, think for yourself and don't waste any energy on this stuff. It doesn't matter to you. And holding a grudge is a symptom of not knowing how you want to spend the gift of today. And so, uh, you know, it's hard to, it's hard to hold a grudge if you're, if you're so focused on, I'm excited about these things, I can do a good job at this. I can't wait to do this stuff. How do you have time for grudges? It's just, it just doesn't make sense. Right. It doesn't make sense.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:25:21       I mean, I, there was a few people, you know, you know, just be honest, but you know, when she, you land in Silicon Valley Sequoia, like, and it wasn't just a quiet, no, no. I don't know. I probably shaped there and that's the reason I'm just saying I'm singling them out because I was taking a fling at an impossible dream. And Sequoia was like, Hey, Harvard, I want early acceptance to start and I want to start in the middle of the year, even though I don't have the prereqs. I mean, in a sense. Right. And I had no resume, no grades. That's a hard pitch. Yeah. Uh, and they're really good at what they do. It turns out it was, yeah. Yeah. But you land here, you don't get the jobs. You are given this, this gift of an introduction through Ron with really smart wordsmithing. Hope you guys were listening. Like the pitch is really, really important and nuanced. You ended up meeting Kevin Rose. So you, you invest in Evan now at the time, was it Twitter or was it, was Odo is podio? So walk us through how that unfolded.

Speaker 4:          00:26:24       Well, um, I thought, you know, I was in Austin and what I would do is, you know, my kids were in grade school and so we weren't sure whether to move yet. So I would come out every Sunday night and stay over Thursday. And it's funny cause when you're on that pattern on the plane, some of the same people are on the plane, like system integrator, consultants, people from Deloitte and stuff. And I'd be like, oh, it's the brother that's, hey bud, what's up? What's going on? But, uh, so I'd be on these plane flights and all these people and we would, um, we would, uh, I did go from Monday to Thursday and this is always dangerous when I got the bottle. Liquid courage. Yeah. But, but, um, uh, and so I thought, okay, I'm gonna, I'm going to take nine months and figure out if I can find something exciting and Silicon Valley.

Speaker 4:          00:27:08       So I just basically immigrated here. And the reason that I did that was that I thought the web was shifting from a, an internet of connected pages to a platform that would connect people. And it just felt like it was kind of time to get the party started again on the Internet. You know, the bubble had burst, the meltdown had happened and I saw things happen. I saw Tim O'reilly talk about web two auto, I saw stuff about podcasting and broad catching and stuff like that. And I was like, it's just clear to me, this is just obvious that something major news happening and I just have to go to California. I have to go right now, not wait another day. And so, so I do that and as I've had the best podcasting company and so I, you know, Jeff Huber it, Google introduced me to him.

Speaker 4:          00:27:54       He said we just ran him off because he doesn't want to work at a big company, but he's going to do something interesting podcasting. And Somehow Evan took my money his first time ever since he took your money. But walk us step by the way, that's a pretty good start. And investing, that's a fantastic Williams did Kevin Rose, it's not bad. You know, you could argue that the secret to ventures to get lucky and your first five years, which I think is a pretty strong argument, I think it's a huge argument, but you, you've, you've since then been like consistent, I should correct me if I'm wrong, but with Odeo there was a, was there a point when as it was a very good guy decided to offer investors the ability to, to get their money back? Yeah, so what happened was I'm so invested in Odeo and Mike, okay, great best podcasting company, first Angel Investment I've ever made.

Speaker 4:          00:28:45       Just wire the money in a week later, apple decides they're going to give away podcasting on iTunes. And at the time, it's hard to remember now, but 85% of all playback devices where iPods. So like, what are we going to be the the, the one you pay for on the Zune, right? Like, it's like, what business? Like you don't have a business. There's still people trying. It's so, so, so a f to his credit tried for about a year to figure out another business. And um, we couldn't, and we'd go brainstorm and we'd look at each other and we're like, yeah, it's pretty tough. And, and, uh, and um, and so one day is some of the investors were getting pretty disenchanted because they're like, you're just wasting our money. You know, there's no business here. And so f decides to give it back to everybody. And so, uh, so I'm like, look, have you know, you don't owe me anything.

Speaker 4:          00:29:38       Venture capital is in the word has venture in it and you win some, you lose some. Right? He goes, well this is the kind of the deal I've struck with some of the bigger investors and B, it would help me a lot if you just went along with it. And so I said, well as long as you let me invest in your next thing. And he goes, well part of this deal is I get to keep this Ip that I've been working on on the side and we're trying to decide whether to call it voicemail 2.0 or tw TTR and it's one of Jack is working on it long with Noah and we're figuring this out. And I'm like, what is, I'm like come on voicemail 2.0 in like why don't you put the vowels back in? Cause like Twitter without the vowel sounds like flicker and that's derivative and whatever.

Speaker 4:          00:30:20       So I don't think I had anything to do with that by the way, but like I was just my gut reaction. So he goes, ah, you say what you're doing. And I'm like, well then what? Ha. Okay. Yeah. Then what happens? He goes at 140 characters or less cause we want it to do cell phones and stuff. And I'm like, this is before the iPhone, right? So, so I'm like, okay. And then what happens? He's like, he's like, that's it. That's all it does. And I say, uh, uh, what's the roadmap? There is no roadmap and a, what's the revenue model? There is no revenue model. And so I say a math, uh, like, why do you even think this is a product? Much less a business, a company. And he goes, oh, I have no idea if it is. But he goes, here's the way I'm thinking about it.

Speaker 4:          00:31:10       Like blogger, a million people use blogger software and this is EBS. First company was blogger, he was one of the pioneers of blogging. He goes, podcasting's kind of hard. You had to use audio studio, you had to record stuff, you had to put it on an RSS feed. He's like, it just took more effort. He's like, what happens if you had micro blogs and rather than a million people did microblogs 10 million people did. Microblogs he's like, I think if 10 million people did microblogs the burden of proof will be on the people who are negative. And so I was like, sounds good to me. Uh, I'd like to invest in Twitter or voicemail 2.0, whatever you call this thing. And, uh, and he says, well, it's, you know, it's not a company. There is no investment. But, uh, and then, and then a few months later, uh, maybe six months later, Twitter blows up at south by, which is such a delicious irony, right?

Speaker 4:          00:32:04       Cause it's from Austin, right? The town I just come from. And a couple of weeks later, [inaudible] says, hey. And I thought by then, it's like a hot air balloon drifting away. There's no way I'm going to get to invest, you know, abs going to forgotten and everybody's gonna be chasing him. And he calls me up one day and says, hey, did you mean it when you said you wanted to invest in a Twitter? And I said, yeah. And he goes, well, um, we're about to take our first money and if you want to do that, now's the time. Wow. Yeah, that was a good guy. He is. So like I, I remember that because both of those guys were good to me. You know, like

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       I just some random Joe Schmo guy and both of them, uh, you know, gave me a chance to be involved in their companies and uh, yeah, that good guys and the RC, I try to remember that every time an entrepreneur pitches us. I, you know, I try to remember the grace those guys showed me and our stories intertwined in so many ways because that I met him right around the time we were hanging out on this book and 2007 South by southwest, I begged and pleaded with Hugh Forrest who was running south by interactive, or at least the programming side still is, it still is. And, and now a neighbor of mine effectively. And I begged and plead, I said, if you have any last minute, can't, I know you don't have any spots because I've already been rejected multiple times. But if you have a cancellation, if there's anything that moves and there's a spot, please let me know.

Speaker 3:          00:33:34       I'd love the opportunity. And Lo and behold, there was this chance 2007 which at the time to put it in perspective, Twitter, all of the tweets in the world were being displayed on these big screen TVs. They were positioned around the conference hall, just one feed moving kind of slowly. Every Twitter user, I was briefly in the top 100 I was very proud of that until Ashton Kutcher came along, just like kicked my head around and I do, I never cracked the top 100 donated, only needed like 500 at one point. And then it was gone. But it should have been Mike at Twitter. But I was like, oh come on. Like how there are so many people who have that story. They're like, oh I just chose like Hawaii steak 5.0 is my username cause who it's not going to become anything. And then again, I'm stuck with that for the rest of my life.

Speaker 3:          00:34:19       But I ended up getting an email from you and he's like, Hey, if you meant it, like we have an overflow room that had a cancellation, a sponsor isn't going to do, they're stuck. So if you want it 45 minutes, you blew up at south by two. I did. And uh, it was, what was really funny about it is I was so nervous of sooner versus my first presentation really about the book. And it was before the book came out. The book came out in April, 2007. This was in March, and I was staying at a friend's place because I couldn't, I wasn't gonna pay for the hotels. They're all sold out. Also, if you get a room, and it's like $1,000 a night during south by, so I stayed in my friend's house and I would go into his garage and I rehearsed my talk in front of his three Chihuahuas and I'll explain, I'll explain why a, my friend had other things to do and he had real jobs so he wasn't going to be there. But the Chihuahua's you had to be at least like 10% Tony Robbins to keep them engaged. And, and these dogs at your secret, is that your seat? I can be 10% Tony Robbins. I'm doing pretty fewer in tribe of mentors. Would you, that would be your like talk like it's saying, here's my district. My secret trick for networking is first practice with dogs because they don't care about the content so much, but if you're monotone they just kind of go, ah, and then turn around

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       and walk away. So I was in the garage and I'm like kind of doing this hand wavy stuff to keep them engaged. This, I totally believe this. Oh No. I remember the garage and then I go to the event and I had all these fancy slides and everything prepared and what happens? Blue screen of death, my computer died and sell my, okay, well I guess I'm just going to have to do this without any of my prompts. And I did it, but I'd rehearsed so much that I had it in my head. And uh, yeah. So Hugh also one of those people, it's like, to this day, if you ever asks me like, Hey, could you help us with x, Y, Z, go south pine? It's like, of course, of course I will because it's just like that one opportunity. And I also want to emphasize one thing.

Speaker 4:          00:36:17       He'll look and say, well, you know, the luck was there with Twitter at the same time and it was absolutely lucky. But it's like every year there is something to draft on. Like every month there's something like that that you can draft and you just have to look for it, but you're going to the other. Well the other thing is, it's kind of, I guess we talked about grudges earlier. To me, like the opposite of having a grudge is like to enjoy seeing somebody do well. Right? And like, um, when when I was a founder or you're just trying to do real company stuff and make the company happen and you're like, okay, we're going to go on this ride and hopefully it works out. But one of the fun things about being an investor is you get to see people do well. You know, you get to see, you know, like Logan and John, uh, from Lyft ate beans until they raised their seed round.

Speaker 4:          00:37:04       And when we had our first board meeting and looks at the financials and says, you guys aren't paying yourselves and minimum wage and that's illegal in California. It was like, we have to fix that. And so, so like, and now, now people talk about how much money Lyft has and Al Carl Icahn's invested in Google capital, but like, like I remember him when they were eating beans. Right. And, and, um, and it's just fun to see them do that. Well, it's fun to see you do this well, right? I mean it's like, um, we had no reason to think the four hour work week was going to be that big a deal. I mean, you hope it will. We a lot of reasons to believe it wouldn't be a big deal. But I mean, it was like seven or just like every time I see, you know, I'll get a call from somebody like a reporter that says, Hey, would you do a quote for this article about Tim and some major publication.

Speaker 4:          00:37:51       I'm like, wow, he's just killing it. That's awesome. Right? And it's just fun to see. It's a lot more fun to spend your energy on deriving joy from that and seeing your friends do well, especially friends who were like worthy of doing well and won't be changed by it. Like that's a lot more fun than remembering who wasn't nice along the way, you know? Yeah. It's a drag. I've, I've been working on the grudge piece. I don't have many, but it's good to see you. Yeah, I mean like the Arab spring or like when I would, I'd pick up Sloan on a play date, you know, my daughter Sloan and, and the parents or the play date would say, is it true you invested in Twitter? I saw them on Oprah and then the Arab spring happened and I was like, wow, this company is kind of working like we got a chance to do well on this one.

Speaker 3:          00:38:37       You see, you mentioned your daughter. I want to bring up something that I've thought a lot about since you mentioned it to me and as context for folks. What I've really tried to do in the last at least five years is to look at the lives of people I look up to in a holistic way before modeling them. All right? So what I mean by that is it's tempting to look at say the business success of person x and then replicate everything they do. But all you may see is one tiny piece of the puzzle. And then in actuality they walk around in shambles and every other capacities. So I've, I've tried with the interviews and the books and tribe of mentors to really look at things holistically. And I remember asking and I asked, even though I don't have kids, I ask parenting advice of friends a lot because I'm curious to see how they look at it.

Speaker 3:          00:39:33       And at one point I asked you when we were on a hike and I asked you what advice you would give to a new parent or someone thinking about becoming a parent. And please correct me if I'm getting this wrong, but I might write your version is going to be better. But to my recollection, there were two main points that you made and there there could be more be you said, number one, really teach your kids and train them to be optimists because without that you're lost. And with that you can at least look for a CE solutions and silver lining and so forth. And then the second part was remember that your kids owe you nothing. Like they didn't ask to be born. You chose, remember, wow, I do remember it was meaningful to me. I really made an imprint. And your job is to give them love.

Speaker 3:          00:40:19       It is not their job to give you love. That's right. The, I chose to have them, they didn't choose to have me. They owe me nothing. Yeah. And, uh, like I find it helpful to think about that. But, but like the, the, the, the hope part I think is, is important for them. Like the, the, the way I look at it is, unfortunately, unless we solve some breakthrough problem, we're all going to die. So you could choose to be to fetus about that. Or you can choose to say, the fact that we get to live at all is just this huge gift. And so like, I think that one of the things that you can do for your kids as you can help them feel optimistic and happy about the fact that they have the gift to be alive and that, um, don't be defeatist about this world. You had the gift of today and as long as you have the gifted today, like you should be like, you're, you're on the path to the light. Right. And, um, uh, and if you can, if you can give your kids the gift of being optimistic and hopeful about the future and grateful that they have the time they're going to have, like, I think that that's helpful for them because kids get, they get judged and you know, all of us

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       are unkind to ourselves in our own mind. And we're judged by people all the time. And it's easy to just forget that just today's a gift. Be grateful for that gift to be optimistic that tomorrow's gonna be another day where you have another gift. So when your kids or say one of your entrepreneurs, I mean, yeah, startups are full contact sport, right? I mean, yeah, people take their lumps and in major ways and bad things happen all the time. Uh, whether it's with your kids or some of the founders you've worked with when they're going through really rough time, what do you, what do you say to them? Uh, and it, you could give a specific example or just a general principle. Then I'd be curious to hear how you'd think about that. Um, well, so, so like these founders that we've worked, some of them are just extraordinary, right?

Speaker 4:          00:42:24       And so I, uh, I'm reluctant to say we had much of an impact. Um, I think the thing that sometimes I've done, uh, that I've been proud of is like when they're in the depths of despair, you know, entrepreneurship is like this where there's no, there's no even path. And, uh, there are times where you just like, everything is against you and you're just like, how did I get myself into this? And this is so terrible. Uh, and, um, I think I've been better than most at those times. It kind of saying, you've got this, how do you, how, and sometimes, and sometimes they need to hear that. Is it just the words or how do you deliver it? Like what makes no, I tell, I tell them, look, you know, Twitter, we couldn't keep the servers running. We couldn't decide who the CEO was.

Speaker 4:          00:43:18       A twitch, it was Justin TV. We didn't even know what twitch was. That's during the Chegg was craigslist for colleges. And then Facebook decided to compete with us. So we pivoted textbook rentals and we only had 30 days left of cash. And like Ng Moco, we had 45 days of cash when we pivoted from APP downloads, the free to play and Lyft started out as Zimride and when we launched Lyft, we weren't even sure it was legal. So I'm like, guys like guys I've seen way crazier than this. You got this. And sometimes a founder needs to know, look, entrepreneurship on. So I like, I like to say I like to invest in people I would enjoy getting in trouble with because it happens every time. And um, and like when you're in trouble with these people, what's it going to feel like? Is it going to feel like, okay, it's us against the world, or is it going to feel like, oh, how did I get myself involved with these people?

Speaker 4:          00:44:15       And so like, I like people where I'm like, we're in the foxhole together, screw the rest of the world and what they think we're right. They're wrong, let's rock and roll. Right. And so, um, so that's kind of, uh, I think that we've been like, I like to say when I was an entrepreneur, one of the things I learned is in my early customers, they didn't just buy what I was selling, they bought because they believed what I believed we were in on a secret together. And like when I work with founders, I like to say I'm in on a secret with the, I believe they're secret. And like we think the rest of the world is just wrong. We think we're right and we're going to prove it. And so when stuff goes wrong, we're like, Eh, it's just a setback, speed, bump, whatever. But, but like in the end it's like we still believe in our insight. We're right. Let's, let's prove it. Let's prove it.

Speaker 4:          00:45:09       What about for yourself, if you can think of in the last decades could be anything, but when, when you, could you give us an example of maybe a tough time that you went through and how you found your way out of it? Or what helped you find way out of it could be any, any set of life? Gosh, a fair number. Um, you know, Liz, Liz and I broke up, uh, you know, we'd been married for 17 years and things didn't work out. And that just felt like, um, like, like I had really failed as a person and I was about to fail as a dad and, you know, like, uh, what else? Uh, what else was there if I failed at those things and then what can I even think I was successful at? That was a, that was a tough time. Um, but, but, um, you know, fortunately, uh, kiddos turned out okay.

Speaker 4:          00:46:06       And, um, you know, I tried the hardest. I could navigate that time the best I could. And, you know, kids turned out great and Liz and I get along just fine and, you know, you win some, you lose some. But, but at that point in time, it just felt like everything I had done in his life was screwed up and I just totally blown it. How did you not just succumb to the depths of despair and stay there? Yeah. And some day, you know, we, we need to have some more wine and talk about this, cause I know you've said that you've, you've struggled right. At times with feeling depressed and um, I'm like the worst person to talk to depress people because I just don't understand the concept like, like a, and it's like I'm not judging right. But like I'm, I'm just like, um, uh, today's a gift and like I have to like make the most I can out of it and if it doesn't work out, make the most out of [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          00:47:06       And by the way, like I don't look at that like, I don't think that my way of thinking is better than your way of thinking. Like it's sort of like you're leaner than I am. You could probably run faster, jump higher. I don't sit there and say, give me your legs. Right. I, I just realized that we're all different and I realized that, that like I've had a few blessings in life and one of them is to be grateful for every day. And, and like for that to be the high order bit, no matter what's happening, I'm like, you got to have today. So did that, was that just a life raft that you had throughout that entire period that each morning you'd remind yourself over? How did it manifest on it's daily. It just, it's just ever presence. Just ever Pr. It's just obvious to me.

Speaker 4:          00:47:44       It's like breathing oxygen and I need to borrow your code. All right. Yeah. But, but I don't say that it's like, listen to me and my advice, I'm so smart. It's just I was lucky enough to be configured in wired that way. So I want to make a suggestion to everyone in the audience, and this is based on observing Mike over and over again. When someone says to you, well, you can explain it to me. I'm just, I'm a not a fast thinker. I'm from Texas. When someone pulls that, you should really be careful. And, uh, I actually borrowed that from you and I was like, I think I can use this. Cause most people think people from Long Island are idiots. Great. So I'll be like, you know, explain it to me again because I'm not clear. My brain doesn't move that fast and from Long Island. And everyone's like, what? And then so thank you for allowing me to, that I could help you act simple.

Speaker 4:          00:48:35       So I wanted to bring up, and this is actually something we have not spoken about publicly or privately before, but commander John Boyd. Yeah. Can you explain who commander John Boyd is and why you're a fan? Yeah. So, um, uh, commander John Boyd was, I'm a flight instructor for the Air Force and he, there was this expression that in a simulated dog fight, he could, he could beat any pilot in like 30 seconds or some outrageously quick amount of time. And people were like, well, how does he do that? And he taught, he taught this form of combat, which was about moving very quickly. And, um, uh, so it's if you place yourself in the time I was reading about John Boyd, it was also when I was working with Eric Reese and Steve Blank. And so Eric Reese was a consultant at floodgate before he wrote the lean startup. He's famous just like I have this magnetism for famous future to be authors I guess.

Speaker 4:          00:49:36       But, but, uh, so we, we were talking to and we're like something really important happening here. Offshore Labor or search engine marketing, opensource software, broadband penetration, global markets. And it seems like you can get a product to market for less money. You can do it faster. And uh, Steve Blank started talking about this guy named John Boyd. And so John Boy does this flight instructor in the Air Force and he could beat anybody in a dog fight super fast. And Boyd's fundamental insight was that sometimes you can win a battle purely by being faster. So like, let's say you're in a Russian Mig and I'm in an f 16 and I make the wrong move, but you haven't moved yet. And then I make the right moves before you've moved yet. Just the mere fact that I was able to make a move and course correct before made your countermove means two things.

Speaker 4:          00:50:30       I can get in the right position relative to you. But more importantly, it's very disorienting to you cause you don't know where I am. I was here, now I'm there. And so the, the philosophy of John boy that was inspiring to me back in 2005 and one of the reasons I started floodgate was I was like, you can do this as an entrepreneur and an investor. And so the f 16 fighter jet was designed to John Boyd Spec and f 16 doesn't fly faster than Russian Mig, but it changes directions faster. It's, so the [inaudible] fighter was a system. It wasn't just the plain, which could change direction faster. It was the mind of the pilot and the mind of an agile pilot with an agile plane will be to mush, beat a Russian Mig all day long. And so, um, so I was like, that's what's going to happen with startups.

Speaker 4:          00:51:22       And that's why 500,000 is the new 5 million. And that's why we need to go fun, these agile entrepreneurs, because they're going to be able to force multiply and the big competitors who've raised a bunch of money or going slower doing waterfall development, they're going to be disoriented by how fast these companies move. And so, like what, what, what I really learned from Boyd was the kind of this idea that if you, if you are a speed based competitor, uh, you can be wrong but still be right quicker, which makes you, right, right? Which, which translates very directly to blank and Eric Reese and that's right. Minimum buyable product and iterating. You could, you could be totally off base in the beginning, which a lot of your biggest hits have been in the 93% of our exit profits have come from pivots. And so, you know, you look at that and you say, Gosh, when we invest, should we even care what the business is?

Speaker 4:          00:52:19       I mean, it's a legitimate question. So like cruise automation, right? That's one of our recent wins. Uh, you know, Kyle had started twitch, we made a bunch of money on twitch and uh, he starts this company called cruise. It's like a roof rack that does autopilot self driving. I'm like, Kyle, that's a bad idea because you're going to live 20 customers in the world. There's only 20 car companies that matter and they have concentrated buying power and they can design you out unless you're like 10 times better and there's gonna be competition, blah, blah, blah. So six months later he's like, okay, you're right. The roof rack idea was dumb. I've got this new idea. I'm like, what's your new idea? Is like, I'm going to make Nissan leafs self driving. And I'm like, then why are you gonna do? He's like, well, you know, there's a lot of ways you can monetize that.

Speaker 4:          00:53:04       You can do a fleet of cars, you can sell the cars people you do. So I'm like, okay, let me get this straight column. Now you're just going to compete against everybody there. You compete against Uber and Lyft and Tesla and GM and everybody, Bosh. He's like, yeah, but you know, I'm passionate about this. I've been doing this since MIT is my research project. And I've just, I just think this the way to go. And I sat there and I thought about it and I was like, you know, this guy made me 84 times on my money last time I wrote him a check, I think I'm just going to run them in check. So, uh, so I, so I go to the partner meeting at floodgate and thank God you don't have, we don't have a voting system. And I say, I say, you know, I think I've decided I'm going to do this cruise deal.

Speaker 4:          00:53:48       And everybody reads me the riot act and they're like, Mike, come on. Like I understand that a business model can be vague, but like you cannot even articulate a path where this is a business and neither can Kyle. And I was like, no, but you don't understand. And he's an awesome founder. He's got incredible insights, he's very passionate, blah, blah blah. So like everybody just is like, talk to the hand, this is stupid, whatever. So we had two new, uh, venture partners who became partners, Ryan and Arjun. And six months later they get bought by GM for more than a billion dollars. And, um, Ryan and Arjun go, boy, it's really a shame. We talked you out of this cruise deal. And I said, oh, we funded crews. And so, uh, like of course we funded it. I secretly have super voting rights on every deal. No, we, it at floodgate, there's no voting system.

Speaker 4:          00:54:40       It's just somebody has to pound the table. And so if somebody pounds the table and says, I will take ownership of this and I am responsible for the outcome of our returns to deal happens. But if everybody around the tables and a minus and says, I think this is a good deal for you to do, Tim or you to do an or you to do, Ryan are you to do origin. But nobody says I will pound the table. I'm irrationally love with this doesn't happen. So like we, you know, we kind of think that in the super early stage, kind of love conquers all. And it's like, you know, when you're going through all these times are good, getting all his trouble. It's your love for the idea and the founder that will cause you to like overcome whatever you face. And you have to have enough authentic love and passion for the idea and the founders that you're willing to pound the table and say, I will defend this.

Speaker 4:          00:55:27       I will defend 140 characters or less, even though people say it's stupid in 2007 right. So just need, you just need one person who is, who in some cases irrationally exuberant and willing to defend the idea for a go signal for sure. And then, uh, so this is, this is really fascinating to me. Yeah. We're not exactly a private equity shop. No, but it strikes me that some of the best investors I know have a, a similar or close cousin approach to that. Like if they have somebody who's willing to just put it all on the line, who's already been vetted because they were hired as a partner, it's like, okay, kid, like it's on you then. No. But if they're really willing to go, go to go to fight for it. And, and by the way, like if you're a partner, floodgate, yeah, you pound the table.

Speaker 4:          00:56:18       But guess what? We keep track of the deals you did. And if you like lose tens of millions of dollars of no returns. It's nothing personal, but like you just don't seem to be cut out for this. You're not like pound our table anymore. So like when I pound the table for a deal, I know just as much as any other partner that I am taking ownership of pounding the table and we're going to all help each other and we're not going to say, yeah, I told you so. But it's like if I pound the table, I'm saying I care enough about this idea that I'm willing to have some of my track record and credibility be tied to this. How do you differentiate? If you look at, for instance, 93% of the returns coming from companies that pivoted. Yeah. When you are observing a founder or trying to help and just by way of giving the most convoluted question possible.

Speaker 4:          00:57:09       Okay. Question I get a lot is how do I know when to persist with my idea? How do I know when to quit or how do I know when to pivot? That's a hard question to answer. But when I spoke with Marc Andreessen awhile while back for the podcast, he said, you know, sometimes people pivot so often. It's like every time I see them, I'm paraphrasing here, it's like watching a rabbit good down in a maze. It's like every two days it's a different company. It's like they think it's a Mulligan, not a pivot. Right? So how do you, how do you help guide or even assess a, a good pivot versus someone who's merely unfocused? Yeah. So, um, uh, and, and you know, it could be that I've just been had a string of crazy beginner's luck. And so that is a very real potential factor.

Speaker 4:          00:57:55       Yeah. But, but, um, uh, the way I see it is that, uh, you are right when, when not because people agree with you, you are right or wrong based on whether you're first principles thinking is right or wrong. And so if I see a company where it's not working, but I still believe in the first principles of the idea, I say, this is great. We still believe in the first principles and we know more than we knew a year ago. That's a fundamental advantage. Like why would we want not want to double down on that? And so, uh, whereas what, what happens too often as you say, this doesn't work, it doesn't have traction and we're not gonna be able to raise money, you know, forget about it. And the problem with that is that if you live with the results of other people's thinking, it's, it's like if somebody really smart like fight, you know, I guess if Reid Hoffman says to me, this is a bad network effects idea, because if it doesn't conform to network theory in these ways, unlike, okay, that's data.

Speaker 4:          00:59:02       He's the smartest network effects guy. No, the best PR first principles thinker about network effects. I know. And I offered a first principle to him that he said, you're wrong on first principles. I'm like, hm, I pry all listen to that. Uh, but like if somebody like with Chegg, right when we did textbook rouse people said, oh, people try that before with varsity books. And like, who gives a shit? That was five years ago, like five years ago, isn't it today? And so like, um, like to me it's about like what are, what are just your first principles, reasoning behind why you're excited about something and are your first principles, reasons being refuted or double down on. Because to me the valid definition of a pivot is the first principles are still true, but you learned something from the data on the ground that caused you to double down on a new aspect of that that nobody else knows God and see have in Split.

Speaker 4:          01:00:00       But like that may just me be giving a good explanation for why I got lucky. That is perfectly reasonable point of view for you to take. Yeah, I mean it's certainly possible. Uh, I would tend to assess it as certainly a component of skill. But if you're looking at then let's just take you of the first principles. Maybe then you have strategy, then you have tactics and you have tools you could look at a stack. Are the first principles in your investing experience? Mostly spotting, say converging trends that people haven't spotted before. What, what would be an example of first principles as it applies to one of these? Will you surf? Do you surf poorly? Orally I surf even more poorly but, but like I like the Metaphor of surfing because you could be a skilled surfer but you don't really control surfing, right? You can sort of control the board ish.

Speaker 4:          01:00:54       Even if you're good, you can only barely control it, but you can't control the wave. And like I look at the w to me the magic that animates the tech industry is a combination of Moore's law, Metcalf's law. And so I think we all benefit from the magic of Moore's law Metcalf's law and it's like literally as powerful as the ocean waves and below you when you surf. And so like I look at it like the job of a startup founder is to surf a valid wave and the wave is usually bigger than the company, right? Like when we invest in Lyft and crews, we had this belief that network capitalism is supplanting vertically integrated corporations and that there would be network transportation and just like I believe there's going to be networked real estate network manufacturing, all this stuff. And so we believe that those gathering waves are more powerful than any one company.

Speaker 4:          01:01:44       And that the, the, the job of the tech entrepreneur is to leverage the awesome massive power of all of the, you know, all of the fury of the ocean beneath them of Moore's law and Metcalf's law just surf into the beach and you know, like give Moore's law enough time, it will breach the advantage of any incumbent and give Metcalf's law enough time and it will create an insurmountable mote. Google tried to take out Twitter with Jaiku didn't work. It didn't matter because Twitter, I had a network effect and so like to me like the tech industry's magical, like there's been tulips in the past. There's been a crash of 29 there's been the real estate bubble, there's bubbles all the time. There's mania is all the time, but tech is animated by two valid exponential forces that are super powerful and they are the asymmetric attack vector of the entrepreneur.

Speaker 4:          01:02:36       They are the, they're the Rock in David's slingshot. And so, uh, I look for founders who have some type of fundamental contrarian insight about where a wave's about to gather and then hopefully they have the stuff to surf it. And if they do, I'm like, hey, let's raw unconditional love. Let's go. Will you, you gave me some related advice really early on. I remember meeting more by the way. Any more wine? Yeah. Think I think I have a wine deficiency. Yes. We'd love to see out wine. Gotcha. Thank you. You gave me some advice. I remember it was at a restaurant in Palo Alto. There was, uh, an event gathering. Reid Hoffman was speaking, I was attending and we were having wine much like we're having right now. And we, you're talking about some deal I was flummoxed by, because I had certain primitive parameters for investing and I was getting somewhat ridiculed for my simplistic parameters.

Speaker 4:          01:03:34       Like, I need to be a power user of the product. I need to, it needs to match with the demographic, that sort of core audience than I have. And I got a lot of flack for it. And I remember he said to me, well if those are, say you didn't use these words then, but like your first principles as are your sort of criteria. If you fall, you're going to make, in some cases really good investments when people are poopooing the idea, but it perfectly matches. So your criteria when it's, when their sprints, right, based on first principles. Conversely, if it doesn't match your first principles and you're getting into a deal because it's closing tomorrow, but we can feel it, you feel or whatever, if you're just following some consensus, however small, but it doesn't conform to your first principles, that's where you gonna lose your money.

Speaker 4:          01:04:19       Yeah. This is where like people talk about social proof. I think social proof is bullshit. I think that it's, um, so my favorite example is actually an Elon Musk example. So, I don't know if some of you may have heard this, but I thought you can say, I think some of you may have heard of him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, so, so, um, he talks about space x and most people think space x is like a better NASA, but that's not true. So you think about a rocket, um, what 0.3% of the cost of the rocket is the fuel and the rest of it is what gets burned up in space when it doesn't come back. So Ilan says, okay, if you could have a reusable rocket you could have, you could maintain 99.7% of the value of the rocket by bringing it back to Earth.

Speaker 4:          01:05:07       And if you could do that, you could have a two orders of magnitude improvement. The economics of space travel, that's first principles thinking. Or when f says if 10 million people, right? Microblogs that's 10 times more. The burden of proof is on the people that are negative. And so like, I don't have to see the business plan to say, that's an insight I can get behind. Right. Uh, conversely all see plenty of business plans that look incredibly straightforward and I eliminate them immediately because they're just not an exponential enough and they're not first principles enough in my whole business isn't about how, how often I lose. It's the magnitude of the rightness when I win. And so like I, when I, when I have to win super freaking big, this is a such an important point. And because it applies to life and not just, well it depends.

Speaker 4:          01:06:00       Like if you're a PE guy, you don't want to have anybody, you don't want more than private equity. You don't want to have more than like a 15% loss ratio. Sure. So you're, you're, you want to take out risk and you want, but I'm not a risk taker outer, I'm a luck multiplier, right? Like I'm not asking what can go wrong because I'm investing when it's worth zero, I'm asking what could go spectacularly, right. Is a rare event and I only have to be right a fair number of times. As long as the idea has the exponential awesome power to just take us to the promised land. Well, this is part of what appealed to me about the startup game as you explained it to me, because it's a hits driven business. You can be wrong a lot, but if you have decent rules that have some basis in reality, maybe you, maybe, maybe then you, as long as you're, this is, we don't have to get into like portfolio theory and stuff, but yeah, as long as you're investing enough in these bets that they can say return the fund or whatever the parameters might be, it's a, it's a fun game.

Speaker 4:          01:07:10       Uh, and uh, it's certainly dangerous one. But let me ask you this because I remember how impactful and then we're going to go to audience Q and a. My, in my, my, my pink basket that I brought, uh, if you are teaching, you can pick the age. It could be college, freshmen, college, senior of high school, senior, doesn't really matter. Graduate School, if you were teaching a class on entrepreneurship. So you're not teaching people how to be investors. So we do now we teach wants Stanford. Oh, you do? Okay, well that makes this easy. So what do you teach? What are, what are the sort of differentiators in the class? Um, what we, what we try to do is help people understand that there are things that we can learn from these prime mover entrepreneurs who create massive abundance. And it's about more than just having a good product, product market fit clearly important, but designing the company, what's your culture?

Speaker 4:          01:08:11       How are you going to define it up front or just kind of let it happen? What's your category? Or are you going to design your category? Just let it happen. Are you going to chase revenue or are you going to accumulate attractive customers? And so like what we try to, what we try to emphasize, we try to emphasize a couple of things. One is great businesses truly are valuable and so we should try to think about building a scale of the business with the truth value in mind rather than what's the latest fad and how do we raise money or what's the paper Unicorn or any of that stuff. But then the other thing that we, we worry about some is that you look at some of these companies and the problems they've had with their culture and a lot of these people come from Stanford or the top schools and it's like it how do we have some impact where if, if, if only one person who might have gone off the rails as a founder in that dimension doesn't.

Speaker 4:          01:09:12       Because we're like, you know, culture matters. A building company foundation matters how people treat each other matters and some of this stuff is like a blockchain transaction. You'd get it wrong. You can't go backwards or like the metaphor I like to use like the Hertz rental car parking lot, if you back up the tires explode and so you can't, some of this stuff you can't really back up. And so getting it right the first time, there's a lot of counterintuitive lessons and it's more about just having a good product. It's about designing a company in a category in addition to the product. And you know, having a point of view about how you're going to bring abundance to the world and not just get rich. And so the class is sort of about that and about just like, oh, the other ideas that like you don't, if you're a prime mover, you don't just have to be a tech entrepreneur.

Speaker 4:          01:10:03       Like you could be, uh, uh, the French laundry guy who Keller Thomas Selling. You can be, uh, Elvis Presley and you invent rock and roll. Or you can be Albert Einstein. You can have a theory or um, you know, MLK out a dream. But it's sort of the idea that we try to express to people is find your gift and express it your way. And um, entrepreneurship is only one way to express that gift. But if they learn anything from the class, it's not be an entrepreneur like these people. If entrepreneurship happens to be your calling, great, here's what great people do, but figure out your calling, figure out your gift. You don't have much time. Don't live someone else's life. Don't live by somebody else's thinking, live your gift and actualize it to the fullest.

Speaker 4:          01:11:00       How do people who say hear that? And I'm sure you go into a much more detailed in the class, there's 13, 13 lectures. But for those people listening, if they wanted a place to start, just to get a toe hold and they say, God, I want to do that. I just don't know what my gift is. What would you say to them? Like what are the sort of whispers through the ether? They should pay attention to her. Any indication. I'd say spend time with awesome people and, uh, work on things with them and, uh, you'll find it. But most people, most people fail to find their gift, not because they can't find it, it's because they're too busy worrying about what other people think. And like one of the things that I find, uh, so like one of the things I find inspiring is that, um, I, I wrote this post one time and I was surprised that, so a, I call it finding billion dollar secrets.

Speaker 4:          01:11:55       And the point that I was trying to make was that billion dollar secrets are everywhere. It's just that people aren't looking to pick them up off the ground. They're looking at each other, they're looking at status, they're looking at, hey, when I was in high school, I got rewarded for giving the teacher the answer to the questions the way they wanted it, and then I went to the right college and got the right to graduate degree and got the right job at the right company and live in the right neighborhood and had the right designer kids and send them to the right designer schools and was in the right country. Clubs drive my right designer car and they get, they get focused on, you know Peter Teal would probably call this magnetic behavior, right? This, this idea of people's desires being defined by the people around them and what's going to make a good impression on the people around them.

Speaker 4:          01:12:43       The best entrepreneurs I know, they're just like, screw all that. I know why I'm here in this world, that secret on the ground. That's my gift on picking it up. I'm doing this and, and like that to me, that's the thing I tell my 20 year old self, my 15 year old self, my kids is like, figure out your gift, your gift. It's not, it's not the world's opinion of your gift. It is yours. It belongs to you and figure out the gift that belongs to you and express your gratitude for the time you have by offering that gift. I love it.

Speaker 1:          01:13:23       [inaudible] you

Speaker 4:          01:13:29       guys can see why I've bugged Mike so much over the years. The questions, speaking of questions. Sure. Boy. Wow. This must be, this is like the Willy Wonka golden ticket of questions. Thanks. Oh Wow. Look at this. Oh, look at that road question givers. All right. I hope a lot of these, I had no idea it was a lot more from your answers. I think. I know this is like the Improv jazz of question receiving. All right, so I'll, I'll start with the, uh, start with the first one and then we'll just kind of bounced between these. So the Oh God, a two part always, which by the

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       way means two questions. Where would you have moved besides Austin? Uh, there are a few places I looked, I looked at, I love Austin. I've wanted to move there since I graduated from school and she didn't get the job at trilogy software. Funny Story, founder of trilogy. It was my roommate in college, so I could have helped you looked, you know, I didn't know what to do. I was, I was, I was, I was lost a babe in the woods. So Boulder, Colorado. I'm a huge fan of boulder. I also looked at BC. I really like British Columbia and areas up in Canada. Uh, sorry, Americans. Thank you. Uh, and uh, there were many different places that I considered, but Austin has this gravitational pull for me, so I ended up there. What changed my mind or on the significance of fiction versus nonfiction? Really it was because I had onset insomnia and I did not want to turn on my problem solving apparatus by reading business books and so on before bed. And I found that fantasy dune Ender's game stranger in a strange land, uh, the name of the wind. Read that, but be prepared to wait like 17 years for the last and the trilogy. You ever read that Crowd Count of Monte Cristo? You don't haven't, oh my gosh. Speaking of a book about grudges, what, since we're on books, what, what books do you most recommend or gifted the other

Speaker 4:          01:15:33       people? Hmm. Gosh, uh, lately I've liked, um, there's a, there's a woman named Bronnie ware called, she wrote a book called the top five regrets of the dying and she was a hospice nurse who would spend time with people in the last 90 days of their life. And um, she would, she would learn like what their regrets were or sometimes she'd learned what their happiness was. So, um, there was an example of this woman who was from super rich family and uh, she decided to marry an artist in the family. Ex communicated her and she's like 32 years old, she gets cancer and she dies and she hasn't heard from her family and years. And, uh, her mom comes to her at the end and says, uh, you know, to be honest, I was just jealous. You were living life on your own terms and I've got all these obligations, I don't even like my life that much.

Speaker 4:          01:16:30       And I was just kind of pissed off that you could go marry some artists and be this happy. And I realize like how wrong I was. But this woman who's Diane says, I have no regrets. I got to be with the person that I wanted to be with. And like I would've loved to have lived longer, but nobody knows how much time they're going to have. At least I got to have the time that I got the way I wanted to have it the best I knew how. And, and then they would have another person who the opposite was true. They would be dying and they'd say, promise me brawny that you will not live life according to other people's thinking. Cause I live my whole life trying to please other people and if I could have it over again, I wouldn't do that. And so she, she does a great job of like having the example of the person who did it well with no regrets and the person who's like, fuck right, I'm dead now. And like I could do it over again, I'd do it different. And so, so, um, and, and it's, it's motivating to say, gosh, you know, how am I measuring up against those five things? And so, so I like that book because it kind of takes people out of the here and now and kind of forces you to confront a broader set of issues.

Speaker 3:          01:17:39       Yeah, I think that for me in the last few years, I had a lot of death, uh, friends pass away in the last two years or so, and including Terry Laughlin, rest in peace who is in this book and just a few weeks ago. And I found it really in an odd way, reaffirming to familiarize myself with death and grief and grieving, uh, and in, in almost a preemptive way. I mean, one of my favorite people, I'm sure you've spent time with Matt Mullenweg, incredible entrepreneur, but first and foremost, just a beautiful human being. And he lost his father in a very unexpected way. And he recommended on grief and grieving to me. And I think it's, I think it's a very useful exercise to familiarize yourself with the details of death and people passing.

Speaker 4:          01:18:30       And I learned a lot of this from Julie who is my love of my life and puts up with me and uh, you know, she's helped all these people who have had cancer. And so as a result, she ends up seeing a lot of people pass. And you know, I think more than anybody, she taught me that in the last, um, the last bit of time you have all the shit falls away, right? All the expectations, all the external stuff. And so you just hope that when that, when that time comes, you're like, I did the best I could, you know, do it the way I could. And so, um, that's, uh, that's why I find that that book helpful. It's not cause I'm preoccupied with dying. I hope I live a long time, but it's like when the time comes, I want to say I did it my way. I did the best I could. I honored the gift.

Speaker 1:          01:19:30       That's a good book.

Speaker 4:          01:19:33       And there's business books too, but oh, we'll do that. So I think that's a good place to, to move. Ours is everybody. Cool life. You have to leave. You have to leave at people call with going a little longer

Speaker 3:          01:19:46       fun. I hope you guys all right. So here we go. Uh, this is the left turn from when we were talking about, but I'm curious to hear your answer. What emerging technologies or theoretical technology that can really go wide, uh, do you believe are most promising for anti authoritarian disruption?

Speaker 4:          01:20:07       How that's a leading question is similar to how bitcoin disrupts government control of money. Maybe. Uh, I'm very interested in crypto and blockchain. You mentioned blockchain earlier, so I'm going to too bad we don't have an involved here. Yeah, that'd be awesome. But I would be curious to, to hear first your thoughts, general thoughts on crypto and blockchain and then any other emerging technologies that you think are promising for anti-authority disruption. Okay. So, um, uh, I hope this isn't a shaggy dog answer. Uh, but, uh, I don't even know what that is, but the stories a really long story, your friends. But um, so, so for better or worse, I'm a little bit of a history buff when it comes to business. And so I took this class when I was in business school and only Harvard business school would have a class called the coming of managerial capitalism.

Speaker 4:          01:20:58       And uh, but it was a fascinating class because he named roles like for example, like in the year 1820, there weren't any companies in America with more than a hundred employees, you know, cause you had people trading, selling muskets or for, or like if you are a really big monster company, you were like a spinning loom and Waltham, Massachusetts, uh, and, and spinning yarn and fabric. Well then the railroad and the steam engine come out and that changes everything. So like what people don't realize about people like John Rockefeller and JP Morgan and Andrew Carnegie, like, imagine you're doing standard oil and you want to compete with a guy in Pennsylvania on oil prices. You don't just whip out your cell phone and call the branch manager and say, Hey, lower the prices. Run this guy out of business. I mean, there's no accounting, there's no org charts, there's no salary managers.

Speaker 4:          01:21:53       We don't even have the telegraph yet. We don't have shit. Right? And like Rockefeller is building the company against that backdrop. And then you know, JP Morgan's like, well, there's nobody who has enough money to own a transcontinental railroad, so maybe I should do this thing where you create these fractional units of ownership of a company. We'll call it stock. You're, you're some guy who sells your blacksmith and 1820 and somebody says, do you want buy stock in a railroad? You're like, what good does that do me stock in some random company. It doesn't exist. Why would I want that? And so like, but what happened was the modern corporation emerged and it drove the standard of living of humanity 13 fold from the year 1820 to 2000 the richest man in American 1870 was Cornelius Vanderbilt. He didn't have flushing toilets. He didn't have running water.

Speaker 4:          01:22:52       He didn't have electricity. You can have all those three things now and be defined as poor. And so I look at it and I'm like, people say capitalism is screwed up. I'm like, what are you talking about? Like I'm like, it's a freaking miracle. It's like it in 1800 you had to work one hour to get six minutes of reading light. Today you work one hour, you get 300 days of reading light. It's a miracle. And, and you know, there's a lot of stuff that is wrong with how people are practicing capitalism, but free trade and voluntary, you know, I have this to offer, you have that to offer. We get to trade without somebody interference. That's not the problem. That's not the problem we have. Well, what I think is happening today, and this is where blockchain gets in. I'm hearing a little Texas, sorry for this share.

Speaker 4:          01:23:42       No, no. Uh, I believe that that blockchain and things like it and, and, uh, Moore's law Metcalf's law or the fundamental animating forces of what I like to call network capitalism. And I believe that someday value is going to be created, not by creating a large company. We have a lot of employees that work for you, uh, and produce a lot of stuff, but it's dead. It's going to be the people who create and curate software to find networks. And, um, I think that Tesla is a software network defined car company. And I think that apple was a software network defined phone company. Nokia thought they sell widgets. Apple thought, no, we sell sell software to find phone. The bet between Tesla and GM has nothing to do with WHO's selling more cars. It said we'll Tesla figure out manufacturing faster than GM figures out how to be a software to find network capitalist company.

Speaker 4:          01:24:37       Right? So, so like, okay, now back to blockchain. Uh, there's a, there's a book called like a lot called the wealth of networks by Yo. Hi Bankler. I read it about 10 years ago and it influenced my investing a lot. And one of the things that that Bankler talked about was we're going to move from the tragedy of the Commons to the wealth of the Commons. And the examples he used back then, he had dig in the book actually. And he had examples of user generated content, open source software. Well what if just like the stock market was a new way to practice capitalism for the modern corporation animated by the railroad, the steam engine, that is a new way to create abundance because you couldn't have had a national railroad unless you had a stock market. You couldn't have said, hey, who has enough money to build a railroad?

Speaker 4:          01:25:26       There was no one person who did. And so now I believe that crypto has the opportunity create the wealth of the Commons. And um, rather than a centrally organized equity capital structure, you have a set of people who contribute to a project on their own volition. And if the other people, their peers in the community judge their value as compelling, they get rewarded. So it's, it's kind of like the wealth of the Commons, but like, I find it easier to think about Crypto, not through the lens of, Oh, sorry, you're gonna Invest in Crypto company. How many shares are you going to own? That's wrong. That's like asking how many dollars or am I going to own in the transcontinental railroad? No stock units or a new thing. Yeah, it's a different unit. Crypto tokens are a new thing. They are a new way to create wealth.

Speaker 4:          01:26:19       They are a new way to leverage the wealth of networks rather than vertically integrated top down owned companies. And so like I just believe that a hundred years from now, uh, tokens or something like them will be one of many ways that a enterprise and capitalists can create abundance in the world and the more ways we can create abundance of better, does that obliterate ventral cap venture capital as we know it or does it just reconfigure it so that you guys are investing in the pickaxes? Yeah, so like I don't really, it's funny, so like I'm friends with Vinny Lingham who did civic and the first time we met he's like, Hey, I see owners make you irrelevant, but I'm happy to give you courtesy of my time. And I'm like, Vinny, like, look, I'm just not afraid of what's going to be done to me.

Speaker 4:          01:27:06       The question I asked today is, what would JP Morgan do if he's alive? JP Morgan wouldn't be like, oh, how am I going to get disrupted? Oji He'd be like, how can I play off fence with crypto and how can I create new businesses rather than, you know, like Elvis didn't say I'm going to disrupt jazz, right? He wanted to create rock and roll. And like when I look about Crypto, I'm like, what would Elvis think? What would JP Morgan think? I think disruption in tech startups kind of bullshit. None of the, none of the tech startups I've invested in had people who said, you know, Logan and John didn't say death to taxis, right? They were like, ride sharing is going to be awesome. It's going to bring people together and make things better. And um, disruption happens after you win almost by accident. And it doesn't happen because you try to defeat taxis. It happens because you transcend taxis and, and like, so like whenever people say, I'm going to disrupt something, I'm like, well, you're not a real entrepreneur because entrepreneurship comes from love and creation, not from anger and disruption. And what am I going to attack? And so like I don't like, I'm not going to get

Speaker 3:          01:28:15       disrupted by crypto any more than the next guy will. So just Jamie diamond might,

Speaker 4:          01:28:23       by the way, I'd be happy to debate him anytime and anywhere. Ooh, like

Speaker 3:          01:28:27       this. This is the rumble in the jungle. Jamie diamond. I can't wait for this to happen. So just so nobody gets fired. I did get the wrap up. Smiley face sign, but I'm going to temporarily ignore that. I apologize. Just so that everybody knows someone who's done their duty and I'm going to continue for a few more questions and then we'll wrap up. I appreciate everyone okay with that. Cool. Because I'm having fun with my Bud Mike. Uh Oh my God. All these questions. I wonder if this is the same person, what nascent tech could most disempowered the state where you see tech potential

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       for removing government control over the individual? Holy Shit. We got a bunch of, so the way, this is one of the reasons I liked the wealth of networks is that the wealth and networks potentially creates the opening to reestablish the idea of trade is a voluntary activity between people. And the government's role is not to own everything or legislate everything or give her buddy handouts or free Scooby snacks. It's too, it is to protect the rights of people. That's why I believe valid role of governments protect the rights of people. And what we've allowed our government to do is to have unsound practices with how they create, how they treat money, right? So the Fed is, and with the money supply and it's hurting honest people, but if we want to explore that we can, but like the Fed jacking with the money supply is picking the pockets of the middle class and it is a right. And um, and, and like the crypto has the opportunity to say money should have a price just like everything else. And just like we need to separate politics and religion. We need to separate politics and economics.

Speaker 1:          01:30:10       Whoa.

Speaker 4:          01:30:15       Oh my God. We'd get on so many Rad. No, no, no. It's great.

Speaker 1:          01:30:21       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:30:21       man. I can't wait for this rumble in the jungle. Jimmy diamond. It's going to be great. I don't want front row tickets. All right. Uh, what were the traits that you had early on that made you successful?

Speaker 1:          01:30:33       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:30:33       I'll just leave it at that. That's from Jignesh and I'll leave the last name out just so I don't have to get permission for keeping you on the podcast. Um, I just think that, uh, I was lucky that, um, uh, I was born with parents who were just really good to me and inspired me in ways that were surprising that I didn't understand at the time. Like when I was, uh, we're not, when I was in third grade, my dad bought me this book called how it works, illustrated for my birthday. It was all these diagrams and how product, you know, how it is dishwasher work, how does it get this book? It's a great, it's a great book. And he writes in the front, it's like, um, I know is a little bit advanced for third grader, but uh, you know, it'll make you think differently about life and uh, you know, someday you're going to invent things are going to be in a book like this.

Speaker 1:          01:31:23       Yup.

Speaker 4:          01:31:23       What is it like, who has parrots like that? Like I didn't decide that. Yeah. Just like, just like, uh, you're, you know, when you're a parent, your kids are you nothing. It doesn't mean you can't be grateful when you get lucky and have good ones.

Speaker 1:          01:31:39       Yeah. Here, here.

Speaker 4:          01:31:43       Yeah. I'm curious about that too. Ah, you know, I, I also, I think in a lot of ways won the parent lottery. I wish I could give a better answer, but it, well, the one thing that my parents did, they were there a few things my parents did that I think were very helpful in retrospect. Now it's all

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       kind of post hoc analysis, right? So who knows? But I would say number one, I, you know, I wasn't, it's not like we, we didn't have a flushing toilet and electricity's, it's not like my parents would go your board, but we didn't have her neos Vanderbilt. Yeah. But we didn't have, we didn't have a lot of extra cash floating around, uh, parents that are made more than 50 grand or so a year combined. And, um, anyway, the point was two things. Number one is they said, no, you can't have the new bike, can't do it, can't do this. But they said this is, I mean, maybe it was by necessity, not by engineering, but they said the one thing, we have budget for his books. So if you really want a book, like we'll figure it out. And so we used to go to the remainder table in this bookstore or our local hometown and pick books.

Speaker 3:          01:32:50       And I remember to this day, some of those books, just like you do, fishes of the world was when I wanted to be, become a marine biologist for 10 plus years because of this book and bought it for whatever, 70% off. And I carried it with me to school every day because that's the playground for me. I was a runner. I was a really small kid, born premature. He got the shit kicked out of me like weekly until sixth grade. So I would stay close to the teacher with this book. And I remember, I don't, I've never talked about this. Remember this one teacher substitute teacher, not my real teachers cause they knew me, but the substitute teacher said to my mom, you know, you shouldn't have, you shouldn't let him bring that book to school. He's going to destroy it. And my mom was like, what are you talking about?

Speaker 3:          01:33:30       Like it's like destroy that book. Like it's those important book he has. And uh, they were very good at training us to want books. So that was a key. And then second was, uh, my parents and my mom particularly, we're really good at just exposing me to a lot of stuff. Yup. And it was free stuff. It's like, all right, we're going to take a trip to the aquarium when it's free. We're going to go to the beach and we're going to collect black sand with a magnet. And I'll try to explain it back to Tim is, and my mom through so much against the wall and every once in a while something would stick and then she would just put everything behind it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:34:09       Yeah. Me Too. Like I read some book and I said, well, the best example of this dinosaur bones is in the museum of natural history in Washington DC. And my mom would say, well, we live in Princeton, New Jersey at the time. And, uh, there's a museum of natural history in New York. And I'm like, but that's not where the biggest one is. And that's where like, sure enough, we'd be going to Washington DC to see the biggest and like Carolyn Maples, like had like, if I was interested in dinosaurs and that's where I wanted to see the biggest dinosaur. Like by Golly, we were going to museum of natural history in Washington DC. And maybe while we're at it, we'll go to Gettysburg and learn something about the civil war. But it was uh, uh, one other thing that I think is good and then onto the next thing.

Speaker 4:          01:34:51       But, um, my dad also told me don't have heroes. And I think what he meant by that was that hero worship is a form of not thinking for yourself because heroes first of all, a lot of times they're kind of a story and you don't really know what they're really like and what really happened and why they decided what they did. But the other thing is defining yourself relative to somebody else's accomplishment or how somebody else acts causes you to not spend the time to discover how you can be your best self. And so like, it's okay to respect the way somebody thinks or it's okay to respect a talent that somebody has it you could learn from. But that's different from saying, oh my gosh, Bill Gates is awesome. I want to be like Bill Gates because Bill Gates is awesome, right? He's awesome at being bill gates.

Speaker 4:          01:35:47       But you need to be awesome at being you. And like having a hero can cause you to drift away from that. So my dad was always very, whenever somebody famous on TV, you know, wrong, Reagan was president when I was young, he'd be like, be very careful not to have heroes. You don't know their whole story. He's like, he may be great person, but don't have it. Don't have that person as a hero. Figure out what you admire that they do and try to understand that. But don't, don't say, I want to be like that person ever. It's a good guideline. Yeah. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. I don't know how I figured that out.

Speaker 4:          01:36:24       This is a question from anonymous. Very nice handwriting. Um, what would you put on a billboard? Could be, I don't know if you answered it in the books. I did. He did. So let's, let's hear. It could be that or it could be something else, but how would you answer that? What would you put on the billboard that got out to millions or billions of people? Uh, like, um, there's two things. One would be integrity is the only path where you'll never get lost. And that's the one that, that I put your book. And then the other one would be think for yourself always. And I'm thinking for yourself doesn't mean don't listen, but it means be willing to have first principles and you are right or wrong, not because of how powerful the person is who challenges you. You are right or wrong based on whether the content of your ideas and first principles as right or wrong.

Speaker 4:          01:37:19       And you should, you should seek out people who challenge your first principles like goal because they'll make you better, but you shouldn't, you know, and that's like ego is about who's right and truth is about what's right. And if you become an authentic truth seeker in life, uh, to me that's kind of what it means. Did like think for yourself? Yeah, it's for you. I'm not nurse. I'm not going to follow that up. Y'all come on guys. No, everybody wants to know. You're signing one record player that says the same thing over and over again. All right, so I would say I'm going to give a new answer, actually have two. So the first would be,

Speaker 3:          01:37:57       and this is advice I got really early on that has stuck with me for decades now, you're the average of the five people you associate with most and drew of Dropbox. Many of the people would give similar advice and I think it's just so important emotionally, financially, psychologically it's very important that you choose the people you spend time with. It doesn't have to be in person, it can be via podcast, it can be via books, they don't have to be alive. It could be Ben Franklin and I've learned so much from Richard Fiman and Ben Franklin for instances. Just two examples.

Speaker 4:          01:38:32       And, and can I just double down on that because like it doesn't even have to be five people that will help you succeed in your career. So like, like Julie, right. I was talking about earlier, uh, one of, one of the companies that we invested in, the founder's son was 10 years old, got a brain tumor and so he has to be operated on in San Francisco. And uh, Julie calls me and says, when are you going to get here? It was like a few days later and I'm like, uh, sorry. Am I supposed to, I'm in this meeting. I'm like, where are you? She's like, I'm here at the hospital. Who goes about to be operated on? Where are you? And I realize like she never said, hey, let's meet at the hospital. But like what I realized from her was that she's like, what else are you doing that's more important than being here right now? Like, why did I have to tell you that? And she wasn't being judgmental about it was just to her, it was just obvious. And so like, part of it is not just five awesome business people or five fortune 500 whatever. It's, to me, it's more like five people who in their own way make you appreciate the gift of life in a more deep way so that you practice it better. And like where you say, wow, that person changed my point of view about how to use my time. How do you use your life? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:40:02       Yeah. We're going to wrap up in a minute folks. Uh,

Speaker 3:          01:40:09       I said I would give something new. I've given you're the average of the five people you associate with most a lot. So I'll give you another one to keep interrupting you, which is relatively recent discovery for me, which is if you want to succeed in any holistic capacity, if you want to love the people you care for fully and have them feel that you cannot do it. If you merely tolerate yourself, you cannot do it. If on some level you lose yourself or aspects of yourself, and I spent, I mean, I've spent decades of my life like barely at best tolerating myself. I had some bad things happen to me. I as a consequence, decided to just hone myself into an instrument of competition. That was it, and I found validation and a purpose in that and being number one and the any joy I felt, it was really from observing other people experiencing joy.

Speaker 3:          01:41:13       It wasn't intrinsic to me and I'm forgiving yourself. We're loving yourself as not a nice to have. It is a must have. Even if you're doing it just for other people and the people you want to express your love to most fully you. You need to solve that and there are ways to do it. There are ways to do it. That's the good news. So I would just say whether it's a book like Tara Brocks, radical acceptance, terrible title, a great book or Paul's Book, love yourself like your life depends on it. Yeah. Call Robert [inaudible] book. Also exceptional of that is I think the root cause of so many things that we can perceive is 30 or 40 or 50 different problems to solve. And in fact they're just one or two things that happened to you that you need to unpack. Yep. 10 with, can you double click on that for a second?

Speaker 3:          01:42:07       Cause I don't like, I think it's like people will sometimes say, Hey, you should love yourself and they'll will dumb down that they won't understand the subtlety like of what you just said. And I think that's important. Yeah. So the, the, the subtlety, if we were to drill down, I would say that, uh, and this is borrowing from someone, actually it's in the conclusion of Trevor mentors it because it's that important to me. Um, Jim Loehr or lair who's a performance coach has worked with a lot of incredible athletes and he, l, O, e, h, r, fascinating guy and his book, a mental toughness training for sports. Here you go. Uh, Mari more really changed my life. Sure. You're good in high school. Don't worry. I know I'm getting them. I'm getting the stink eye. I'll make it up to everybody. Uh, tell the whole story, Tim.

Speaker 3:          01:43:04       So, uh, the gym expressed to me when I met with him to learn how to play tennis for the first time, just in the last year, which had always wanted to do my whole life. He said a in effect, you know, the most important voice we ever hear in our lives is the voice that no one else hears. It's the voice in our own heads. And for my entire life, I would really, my entire life, it's been the most merciless, brutal coach or wish on your worst day. Like, raise your hand if you said something to yourself negative in your own mind today. Yeah. Right. And you can create, even if externally you have all of the material trappings or rewards of a financially successful career. If you have the nuclear family that everyone has dreamed of and painted a Norman Rockwell paintings, if that inner voice is just a demon on your back, you will not find the piece that you want and nothing you buy, nothing you achieve will provide that.

Speaker 3:          01:44:13       There are just things you need to unpack so that that voice becomes a different voice. It is it fair to him to say that part of love is a, like you can love your country without thinking. It's perfect and you can love your kids without thinking they're perfect and part of like loving yourself is like saying, that doesn't mean I'm perfect. I'm not going to be jingoistic about myself. It's more about I'm going to hold myself and hire enough regard that I'm going to do the best I can with the day that I have and I'm going to forgive myself when I screw up, honestly. Yeah, that's a big part of it. And also for people who were looking for maybe a tactical recommendation. One thing I found very helpful, and I do want to take too much time to go into it, but something called Metta Emmy TTA meditation or loving kindness meditation.

Speaker 3:          01:45:01       I went through meditation retreat recently, which was very difficult for me and I was practicing this. Just Google it. You'll find plenty, uh, to convey in my meditation love and wishes for happiness to many different people who had helped me throughout my life. And I remember one of the teachers at the retreat said the very end, I was about to walk out the door and she said, wait a second, have you done any loving kindness to earlier versions of yourself who experienced a lot of pain, who maybe felt unsafe? And I was like, didn't even occur to me to do that. I would encourage everybody here to accept Laura that, and I know we're running out of time. So Mike, I have one more question and then I'll have some closing thoughts. This is the tradition at the forum to ask, what is your 62nd idea to change the world? Uh, pressure. Okay. Think for yourself and be kind to yourself in your own mind because 90% of the unkindness that happens in the world is actually people being unkind to themselves. And if you're going to be, if you set out to make the world better, being kind to yourself in your own mind is probably the most straight forward, high return UC or time possible. Cheers to that.

Speaker 5:          01:46:23       [inaudible] Mike, I just want to say I that

Speaker 3:          01:46:31       it's been such a joy and a privilege to know you for as long as I have and uh, I really hope to spend more time with you. I mean, we've spent a lot of time together, but I'd like to spend more time and I really truly believe in part of the reason I wanted to bring you out on stage tonight. You're one of the most genuine unentitled positive people who want to also impart the gift of positivity to the world I've ever met. So I just want to thank you for that. Alright, well it's been fun to see you do so well. Well, you too man.
