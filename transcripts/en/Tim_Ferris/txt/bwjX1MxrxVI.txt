Speaker 1:          00:00          Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism.

Speaker 2:          00:23          This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way, set it and forget it. Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than two and a half billion dollars under management. In fact, some of my very good friends, investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. So the question is why? Why is it so popular? Why is it unique? Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only pay pennies on the dollar for them. And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations, bloated sales teams, et cetera. And I'll come back to that in a second. I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their advice, run with it, do it yourself, you can do that or as I would, you can set it and forget it and here's why.

Speaker 2:          01:22          The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't great investing is a marathon, not a sprint and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax loss harvesting, rebalancing your portfolio, cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large amounts of money over longer periods of time. Wealth Front, as I mentioned, since it's using software instead of retail locations, etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely impossible right off the bat. You never pay commissions or account fees for everything. They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for free. If you use my link, wealthfront.com forward slash Tim, that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.

Speaker 2:          02:11          Now, normally when I have a sponsor on this show, it's because I use them and recommend them. In this case, it's a little different. I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal. They wanted to sponsor this podcast, but because of sec regulations, companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials. So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast, but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant amount of my own money, at least for me, uh, in the team and the company itself. So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client. Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener, you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account. But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you. Take two minutes, fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash. Tim It's fast. It's there's no downside that I can think of. Just take a look, see what portfolio they would create for you and you can use that information however you want. wealthfront.com forward slash. Tim

Speaker 2:          04:06          Hello Ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. This is a special edition where I'm going to share an excerpt from my favorite book of all time and in fact it is a collection of letters, roughly 2000 years old that I reread at least once a quarter from Seneca, the younger, these are the moral letters to Achilleas that I've compiled into the town of Seneca and this particular example is a letter 17 on philosophy and riches and Seneca takes a little while with his preamble to get warmed up, but my favorite portion begins with, I might close my letter at this point. Say you can use that as a bookmark. I might close my letter at this point and I was talking to a friend of mine, uh, about Seneca. He's a huge fan also and he said what I agree with and that is I went back through my notes and start to compile a list of the ideas I had the biggest impact on me letter by letter, but going through I realized that what makes Seneca so unique is the common threads that flow through different letters.

Speaker 2:          05:10          So it's very hard to just take one letter although they are valuable. So I encourage you to check out all of these letters and you can find them@ataudible.com forward slash Tim's books. It's a three volume set of all of these letters because I wanted to listen to them in audio and could not find it and that's how it got created. So please enjoy on philosophy and riches by Seneca and I hope you find it as valuable as I have.

Speaker 3:          05:38          Let her 17 on philosophy and riches castaway, everything of that sort if you are wise, nay rather that you may be wise strive toward a sound mind at top speed. And with your whole strengths. If any holds you back tired or severance, but you say, my estate delays me, I wished to make such disposition of it that it may suffice for me when I have nothing to do last, either poverty be a burden to me or I myself, a burden to others. You do not see him when you say this, to know the strength and power of that good which you are considering. You do indeed grasp the all important thing, the great benefit which philosophy confers, but you do not yet mr an accurately its various functions, nor do you yet know how great is the help we receive from philosophy in everything, everywhere, how to use CICERO's language.

Speaker 3:          06:41          It not only suckers us in the greatest matters, but also descends to the smallest. Take my advice, call wisdom into consultation. She will advise you not to sit forever at your ledger. Doubtless your object, what you wish to attain by such postponement of your studies is that poverty may not have to be feared by you, but what if it is something to be desired which is of shut off many a man from the attainment of wisdom. Poverty is unburdened and free from care. When the trumpet sounds, the poor man knows that he is not being attacked. When there was a cry of fire, he only seeks a way of escape and does not ask what he can save. If the poor man must go to see the Harvard is not rezoned nor to the wharves bustle with the retinue of one individual. No throng of slaves surrounds the poor man slaves for whose mouths the master must covered the fertile crops of regions beyond the sea.

Speaker 3:          07:43          It is easy to fill a few stomachs when they are well trained and crave nothing else but to be filled. Hunger costs, but little squeamishness costs much poverty is contented with fulfilling, pressing needs. Why then should you reject philosophy as a comrade? Even the rich man copies her ways when he is in his senses. If you wish to have leisure for your mind, either be a poor man or resemble a poor man. Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live simply and living simply is voluntary poverty oh way. Then with all excuses like I have not yet enough when I have gained the desired amount. Then I showed the vote myself wholly to philosophy and yet this ideal which you are putting off and placing second to other interests should be secured. First of all, you should begin with it. You retort. I wish to acquire something to live on.

Speaker 3:          08:47          Yes, but learn while you are acquiring it for if anything forbids you to live. No. Nobody. Nothing for bids you to die. No Glee. There is no reason why poverty, you should call us away from philosophy. No, nor even actual wand for when hastening after wisdom. We must endure even hunger. Men have endured hunger when there are towns were besieged and what other reward for their endurance did they obtain then that that they did not fall under the conquerors power. How much greater is the promise of the prize of everlasting liberty and the assurance that we need fear. Neither God nor man. Even though we starve, we must reach that goal. Armies have endured all manner of want, have lived on roots, and have resisted hunger by means of food to revolting. To mention all this, they have suffered to gain a kingdom. And what is more marvelous to gain a kingdom that will be you and others will any man hesitate to endure poverty in order that he may free his mind from madness.

Speaker 3:          09:54          Therefore, one should not seek to lay up. Rich's first one may attain to philosophy. However, even without money for the journey it is indeed. So after you have come to possess all other things, should you then wish to possess wisdom? Also his philosophy to be the last requisite in life, a sort of supplement, nay. Your plan should be this. Be a philosopher. Now, whether you have anything or not for if you have anything, how do you know that you have not too much already, but if you have nothing, seek understanding first before anything else, but you say, I shall lack the necessities of life in the first place. You cannot lock them because nature demands but little and the wise man suits his needs to nature. But if the utmost pinch of need arrives, he will quickly take leave of life and cease being a trouble to himself.

Speaker 3:          10:53          If however his means of existence are meager and scanty, he will make the best of them without being anxious or worried about anything more than the bare necessities. He will do justice to his belly and his shoulders with free and happy spirit. He will laugh at the bustling of Richmond and the flurried ways of those who are hastening after wealth and say why of your own accord postpone your real life to the distant future. Shall you wait for some interest to fall, do or for some income on your merchandise or for a place in the, we'll have some wealthy old man when you can be rich here in now. Wisdom offers wealth in ready money and pays it over to those in whose eyes she has made wealth superfluous. These remarks refer to other men. You are nearer the rich class. Change the age in which you live and you have too much, but in every age, what is enough remains the same.

Speaker 3:          11:55          I might close my letter at this point if I had not got you into bad habits. One cannot greet Parthian royalty without bringing a gift. And in your case, I cannot say farewell without paying a price, but what of it I showed borrow from Epicurus? The acquisition of Rich's has been for many men, not an end, but a change of troubles. I do not wonder for the fault is not in the wealth, but in the mind itself that would should made poverty a burden to us has made riches also a burden just as it matters little, whether you lay a sick man on a wooden or on a golden bed for whither soever he be move. He will carry his malady with him. So one need not care whether the diseased mind is bestowed upon riches or upon poverty. His malady goes with the man
