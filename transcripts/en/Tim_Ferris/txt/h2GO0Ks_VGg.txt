Speaker 3:          00:03:59       Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. He saw, she booted on there every episode. It is my job to deconstruct world class performers of different types and that term world class is going to come up again in this episode so you can pay attention to the context. And this particular conversation I have with me and Mira Co who has been called quote the most powerful woman in startups and quote by Forbes and is a lecturer in entrepreneurship at Stanford, the child of a rocket scientist at NASA that's a literal rocket scientists and is a Palo Alto native and has been steeped in technology startups since she was a teenager. Prior to cofounding floodgate, she worked at Charles River ventures and Mckinsey and company. Some of her investments include Lyft. I Yazdi, I'm gonna screw this up. I know it.

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       Xamarin refinery 29 joy run taskrabbit and mod cloth given the success of her many investments, she was on the 2017 midas list of top 100 venture capitalists and I just found out today back on 2018 elbowing her way to the top to steal the crown from her partner, Mike Maples, Jr. It's all good spirited Mike and is known for so many other things. I'm going to skip some of them because we're going to touch on the seeds of her. Many, many accomplishments in perhaps some of the first few minutes of the conversation. Uh, she has a Yeahi hope I'm getting that right from Yale and a phd from Stanford and math modeling of computer security. She lives with her husband, three kids age 10, eight and six very well spaced and one spoiled the hog. And welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. So there's so many places we could start. And I was, I was hoping to humanize the ever intimidating and Miraco, which I, I may only partially succeed at doing. But could we start with explaining

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       why your brother used to introduce you or how he used to introduce you on stage? Yeah, so I, I had this brother, an older brother by exactly two years, were born on the same day, and he was one of these guys was so confident. He knew that he wanted to stay cars and airplanes from the time that I could, I could remember him existing. Um, and, and he was always confident with friends and he was also confident on stage. And so as any good Asian child would do, we played musical instruments. I played the piano, he played the violin, and we would always have to perform. And I was painfully, painfully shy. And so I would get up on stage and I would refuse to speak. And My mother and knowing this wouldn't let this get in the way of our performing, she would send my brother up on stage to help announce whatever I was playing.

Speaker 4:          00:07:02       And I have this real clear memory of being in junior high and having this happen. Uh, my brother got up on stage and said, you know, this is an Mira. She's going to be playing a Chopin Nocturne, um, and go and, and I looked over and I remember thinking to myself, you know, like they think the mental dialogue that's happening in a teenagers mind, this is totally ridiculous. And because I'm sitting there in front of a room full of people and I felt fine playing the piano, but I felt petrified speaking. And that's one of like the clearest memories that I have of my brother and me and the difference that we had between the two of us. Why are you so shy or nervous about speaking?

Speaker 4:          00:07:55       You know, I, I've always been an introvert, so I think it comes probably directly from that. Um, but I was also sort of, I was a strange child. I have to admit, I, I had a lot of different interests, but I love to do things by myself. Um, and, and so I just didn't, I wasn't really that interested in talking to other people. Um, like one of the first thing my mom actually discovered about me when I was a little kid when I was two, I only spoke Japanese. Um, and we were living in Michigan and I used to be this very hostile little child. And I would walk by anyone speaking in English. And in Japanese I would say, I wish you would leave. So, you know, like, I can't even for mom, my poor mom. And so she was like, oh, we really should socialize. And, um, with people who speak English and were living in Michigan. So there's no shortage of these people. Do you, do you still speak Japanese? I do. So I speak Japanese to my parents.

Speaker 3:          00:09:11       How do you say, I wish you, I wish you would leave just for people who want to monitor that to people in the park or wherever they might be as do you recall or how, how might you have said that as a kid? Do you have any idea?

Speaker 4:          00:09:24       I think I might've said, let me think about it. At [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:09:34       that is aggressive. That's really aggressive. You're not welcome in this house. Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          00:09:43       Gory. It was like, it was, I think probably more likely it was Ooda cy. Nah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       Right, right. Oh Wow. That's even worse. Right. And so I know, I was like something that like a drunk dad says, yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like shut up. Yeah, you're really loud. You're really irritating.

Speaker 4:          00:10:03       But like, like a little intransigent, two year old saying that to a grown up speaking English in her home.

Speaker 3:          00:10:11       Okay. I don't want to take us too far off the rails, but we, we may come back to that. Okay. So we were talking about you being introverted and shy and weird. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:19       And it was, um, one of these things that I think it really held me back and I knew, I knew actually it was holding me back. Um, the strange part though was my mom was recently talking to me about this in a few years prior to that experience where I'm in junior high, my, I'm on stage. I had actually done this other thing, which was, um, we had this summer school program where I, uh, I would go to local community college. It was foothill college and all these schools around the area. And when they let out for summer, uh, the students would go to this community college to take math classes and writing classes and whatnot. So a lot of elementary school students to high school students would be at Foothill College. And, um, and so my mom said, you have to pick two classes. And one class was a math class obviously.

Speaker 4:          00:11:16       Um, and she said you could pick your second class. And, uh, my brother picked a normal junior high school writing class and I was in fifth grade at the time, so 10 years old. And I picked a negotiations class and it was not in the summer school program. It was an adult class. Why did you pick that? And um, I picked it because I remember the book was getting to yes. And my mom looked at me and she said, why did you pick this class? And I said, it's because they're teaching you how to get to. Yeah. And I want to know how to get to yes. And I have this incredible experience, this Co, this community college of having, um, a class with, I imagine they were probably 30 to 50 year old adults taking this class and they were probably the most patient, wonderful people.

Speaker 4:          00:12:18       And you know, we had this, uh, this experience where you had certain supplies that you were given on pieces of paper and then you had to negotiate, you're on Mars and you had to negotiate supply lines and whatnot and create a real society. Um, in the simulation they're taking seriously a 10 year old kid who's negotiating for supplies. And I, I remember taking that experience and feeling like, you know, I was taken seriously in that environment, but it was a great experience because it was a small class, it was like 20 people. And in that setting I felt okay speaking up, but then on stage I didn't still and, and so it was sort of these small steps that felt like I was getting closer and closer to realizing, oh, I need to actually be able to speak up. I need to be able to say things in front of a large audience. And so there was this desire to face my fears.

Speaker 2:          00:13:21       What was the next step after that? How did you go about facing the fear of speaking on stage?

Speaker 4:          00:13:27       So in, in high school I get to high school and as every high school freshmen is doing, they're looking for different activities to, to participate in. And I decided to dive into a speech and debate and speech and debate. At this time at Palo Alto high school was not a very big activity. There were probably about 20 students on the team. And uh, I, I found that I, I really enjoyed it and it was a really great group of students, um, and then not only from Palo Alto high school, but from the local community. And I just fell in love with the idea that you could really seriously get up in front of an audience and, and talk about really important issues even as a high school student. And so, uh, I dove into that activity and it was frankly terrible at it. I think freshman, sophomore year, I didn't win any tournaments, didn't even come close. Uh, and that was, that was sort of the way though I decided I could face that fear.

Speaker 2:          00:14:40       What did you, what kept you going? I mean, there's the, the answer that, or perhaps potential answer you gave just a moment ago, which is you really enjoyed it and you loved it, but what did you love about it? What, what did you enjoy so much? They were able to persist through failures over those first two years.

Speaker 4:          00:15:00       The first thing is just the people. Yeah. I reflect actually on the people that I met in speech and debate and they're doing incredible things. We have just in my, my year or low, not in my team, but in my local community, uh, professors, you know, one's at Harvard and government ones and Philosophy University of Colorado, a one woman is now, um, on, on the the morning show on NPR. Um, we have several venture capitalists. It was just a really interesting group of people, um, all in, all in the same age group, uh, who wanted to talk about really interesting things. Um, I also found that the actual activity itself was something, it challenged me in a way that I hadn't been challenged before. So I was really good at math and science and those things really came naturally to me. But getting up on stage and speaking was not something that was natural to me. But the piece that I did love that came very naturally was competition. And I'm, I've always been this way.

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       No, I'm just checking. Yeah, I can agree with that.

Speaker 4:          00:16:21       Right. I love, I love competition. You, you put in points on anything and I want more. I want to, I want more than the next person. And, and I remember the coaches that we had, we, we didn't have, um, teachers at our school who were able to coach. And so we had to go across the street to Stanford and find students who are willing to coach. And these, these kids were, you know, 18 to 21 years old. So they would pump us up by saying, Hey, if phew can get someone to cry in cross examination, I'll buy you a slice of pizza. And so, you know, things like that were extraordinarily motivating you, like logic and arguments could get you a step further. It was just something that even though I wasn't good at it at the time, I just loved it. And I felt like if I could just do one more tournament, I become even better at it. And you would see that. Right. And so that's, that's the thing that I love.

Speaker 2:          00:17:30       So do you have any memory of, this seems like a very, very specific example that you gave the crying in the pizza. Did that actually happen? Did you succeed at making someone crying cross examination for a slice of pizza or is it, was that just something that can, can you

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       please describe that? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:17:51       I feel like I'm not succeeding and my desire to humanize me and make myself seem like a less of a dragon lady but

Speaker 3:          00:17:59       there, but this, I want to hit here, I want to hear this story.

Speaker 4:          00:18:05       Several stories. So there were points in time or I remember people would cry in the, they would crumble in the middle of cross examination and run out of the room crying. And my coach would see that and proudly bring me a slice of pizza after this happened multiple times. This wasn't a single tournament. It was an, and there were moments where I got, they had courtesy points too. So it wasn't just about winning. It was also whether you were courteous during that. And there were, there were rounds where I got zero courtesy points and, and my coaches, you know, they would say they would ask why we got zero courtesy points just to really understand if we were just being mean. But a lot of times it was just because we were, you know, and I was particularly tenacious in cross examination and, and even at the point where I had the person stumped, I would just keep going. I would keep going, keep going at it. Um, and so it was, I remember at least, you know, four or five occasions where where someone cried and, and left the room before the round

Speaker 3:          00:19:17       it was over. So this, this was like the Cobra Kai of debating the bad team.

Speaker 4:          00:19:26       My, uh, my, my six year old at one point right before kindergarten said, hey mama, I can make people cry just with my words. Say it was like a really proud moment for me. And then I had to, I had to course correct and, and, and talk

Speaker 3:          00:19:42       to him about that. But no, for someone knew who it was, is wondering what I omitted from the bio that I had in front of me. You had two years of not doing well. And then in the bio we have, she placed first in the National Tournament of champions and second in the state of California in high school. And it goes on and I'll, I'll mention one more thing. And it was part of a five person team at Yale that competed in the Robo Cup competition in Paris, France. All right, but let's focus on the debating. So how did you go from sort of miss flub with not succeeding and debating to getting good at debating?

Speaker 4:          00:20:25       Yeah, this is where I think it's the love of the game. Has To,

Speaker 3:          00:20:32       were your parents supportive through all of these, the, these early trials and tribulations?

Speaker 4:          00:20:37       No. So you have to, you have to remember, you know, I come from very traditional Japanese parents who really want me to get into a great university. And my mom at one right after sophomore year looks at my record and my parents were incredibly supportive. They would go and judge these tournaments every single weekend, spent so much time doing it, driving us all over the state. And, and my, my parents pulled me aside and said, you know, this isn't working. You have a losing record in this activity that you're doing and you appear to be doubling down on your time with respect to this. And if you want to get into a good college, you have to, you have to perform well in whatever you're doing. You know, just, it's not just about effort, you have to have results. And I remember my mom said to me, I've heard fencing is a great way to get into an ivy league college.

Speaker 4:          00:21:39       And I remember looking at her and I was like, how, how is it possible that she's my mother? She clearly does not know anything about my athletic abilities if she's suggesting that I move into fencing at this moment. Um, and so I said to them, point taken, give me the summer and I'm going to, to just work on it. I'm going to, and this was back before the Internet, so I working on it men, I was at Stanford Green Library reading philosophy books and reading articles about the, I think they have 12 topics, 12 possible topics that they're going to pull from for the next year. And I just studied those topics. I lived in the library and then I, um, emerged that year to start competing. And when they announced that first topic, I knew that topic cold and then I could write my cases really quickly. I had already done all this research and I remember going into my very, very first round, uh, and, and had this deal with my parents.

Speaker 4:          00:22:59       If I didn't win one of my first two tournaments or at least place, then I would quit. And I have this distinct impression walking into my very first round of debate that fall and feeling as I looked across at my opponent that there was no way that they could have out prepared me. And so I knew that whatever they said I would have five arguments against. And it was this incredible knowledge that that it's not that you can be lucky and turn your luck around, you actually make your own luck. And for me that was a profound lesson because I placed in that tournament and I placed in the next tournament and it was like that. It just never stopped after that. And I had a losing record all through my freshmen sophomore year. And it's like I turned it around junior year very suddenly. And the main difference was that I was willing to outwork and outdo every competitor who walked in through that door.

Speaker 3:          00:24:12       For people who don't know the format. And I'll be honest, I've been surrounded by it and not surrounded by but certainly in the same universities and so on where debate teams existed. But I've never seen a debate competition what, what is, what is the format?

Speaker 4:          00:24:33       So it's, it's a bunch of nerdy kids dressed in suits, holding briefcases and then maybe that's changed, but that's what it was back then. And then you have a resolution that's been announced nationwide. And that resolution is generally has some philosophical elements to, this is also Lincoln Douglas style of debate. And you have, um, so, so it's one person against one person. So it's individual and it's value based and so you're really debating philosophy. So, um, an example of one debate that we did, the principle of majority rule ought to be valued above the principle of minority rights or resolved that education is a privilege and not a right. So, so all of these debates are really surrounding, not a specific policy, but it has some application in the real world and what you're trying to debate is a philosophical underpinning behind that statement. And what I loved about debate was you are actually forced to debate both sides.

Speaker 4:          00:25:52       So you had to have cases ready for both the affirmative and the negative. So pro the resolution and against the resolution and the format is the affirmative goes up and talks about this resolution and says all the reasons that that they support it. And then there's a short cross examination where the negative then cross examines the affirmative, asks questions of the affirmative. Then the negative gets up and talks about all the reasons that they're against the resolution and then goes point by point against all of the arguments that the affirmative made and talks about why they're wrong. And then there's another cross examination of the affirmative against the negative and then the affirmative gets up for rebuttal. Negative gets up for a rebuttal. And then the affirmative Dez closing arguments sort of shorter and shorter speeches towards the end.

Speaker 3:          00:26:51       How is the outcome determined? What are the, the parameters?

Speaker 4:          00:26:57       Yeah. So, so it really depends on the, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:27:01       aside from courtesy,

Speaker 4:          00:27:02       courtesy points, it's all about courtesy. Um, there's two different types of tournaments actually when, when I was debating, one was where you had parent judges and that I would say really the, the style of speaking, um, your flare really would come into play. Your sense of humor. It was, it really just a line by line arguments. There was also a places where you would go where college students were the judges or experienced coaches where the judges, and that's where really the line by line logic becomes much more important than just the style of your debate. Um, so it really depends on your audience and you had to read the audience correctly.

Speaker 3:          00:27:48       And did they just then say, I I choose a or B or do they have to rank like the sort of Olympic style one to 10 in some fashion?

Speaker 4:          00:28:00       So you only have two debaters that you're, you're judging and you vote for one of them. And, and in some of the rounds you have just a single judge. And then in another, Anne, in the, the breakout rounds and semifinals you, you might have a panel of judges and they can't confer. They're just sort of voting individually on who wins.

Speaker 3:          00:28:25       So you, you may be at a point now with debate and argument that you've reached the, the, uh, it's an unconscious competency phase in the sense that in skill acquisition, one framework that one could use to think about skill acquisition as you go from unconscious incompetence to conscious incompetence, to conscious competence, then unconscious competence. So I don't know if this question is going to be a good one, but I'll, I'll try it anyway. For people who want to get better at debating and structuring arguments and so on, are there any books or approaches or resources, anything, exercises that you would suggest?

Speaker 4:          00:29:07       Well, getting to yes, I thought was always really good. Uh, I actually found the philosophical, uh, texts to be extraordinarily informative. So anything where you have that Socratic method in a book, I found really, uh, a great way of learning how people debate the greatest philosophers, Aristotle and Socrates. Even, you know, when you get into more modern, um, literature around justice, you have people like John Rawls writing, uh, that is actually a dialogue and a real logical debate. And I always found those examples to be really great to read how people argue philosophical constructs. Um, you know, presidential debates, to be honest in politics aren't real debates because it's two ships passing in the night and you don't have real conflict between people. Um, I've also found like the British parliamentary system, if you've ever had the chance to see that on, I think sometimes it's on c span at, that's actually an interesting observation of a real world debate as well because they will actually engage in dialogue around policy and it's not just ad hominem attacks.

Speaker 4:          00:30:34       Um, though I find those sort of real world examples much more powerful than someone going sort of point by point in teaching you how to debate. Because I think the how is much more around how do you engage in the idea? How do you read and research both sides of an argument and what do you believe on both sides. Um, and so, you know, one way to do that would actually do take a fairly controversial topic and then actually read, read a lot of literature on both sides of the argument and then understand where actually the conflict happens. You know, are there definitions that people don't agree on? Are there, uh, are there nuances that, that people haven't thought about? Uh, are they, are they real? Is there a real conflict or are they two ships passing in the night? Um, I think you could do that with even the gun control debate, or you could do that with immigration or you could do that with abortion and really understand, uh, both sides of an argument and that that's, that's the way to engage in the process of debate, I believe.

Speaker 2:          00:31:47       And if we're, if we're reflecting back on your Cobra Kai training for slices of Pizza, uh, I'd be really curious to know if there are any particular approaches or questions or playbooks that you find very useful in a heated argument. And I'll give you some hypotheticals, right? Look, let's, let's say that you are on stage at an event and you are doing a Q and a with the audience and you have someone who ends up being really hostile attacks you or it could be on someone on stage. You're just having a contentious debate of some time. I find it fascinating to see how people, even with no real logical advantage shutdown opponents, and I'm not saying that's you in this case, but for instance, whatever people may of our, of our

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       dear current president of the United States, I do find it fascinating how effective he has been at saying, check your facts right? And, and, and it just throws enough imbalance into the dynamic where someone's like, wait a second, maybe I did miss one piece of due diligence that they're on their heels and it opens up a window and creates sort of a, uh, an illusion of them being stymied that is really advantageous. And I'm like, wow. I mean it's, it's kind of gross on one level, but it's also kind of brilliant. Uh, and I also have a lot of lawyers in my family. And so one thing that they'll do, uh, not to say they all love arguing, but a lot of them do. And you'll, you'll say something and they will go, so let me just get this straight. You're so I understand you're, you're saying that acts and they'll kind of take your argument and like inch inch it a little closer to absurdity, but just subtly enough that you'll say, yeah, that's about right. And they'll say, okay, so really what you mean is x. Right? And they start to edge you over before they even counter with an argument to make you contradict yourself or kind of seem ridiculous. And then it's, they just have to kind of finish you off. Uh, but I've never taken, I've never taken debate. Uh, and, but I do find this really practical and really interesting. So it's a long winded way of enjoying. But yeah, like, so what are your, what are your thoughts on any of that?

Speaker 4:          00:34:09       It's funny, my, my husband has said to me in the past, and this is a lesson that I continue to try to learn and relearn, is that life is not a debate.

Speaker 3:          00:34:20       Right?

Speaker 4:          00:34:22       And, and you know what he's saying? And it's funny, he was a debater as well, um, in college and in high school. And we joke that I would still have beaten him in high school if we had actually gone head to head. But, but I think it's a really important point that life isn't about winning the argument. And, um, and he's also said to me in the past, you know, it's not, it's not about being right. And I think that's so true. And it's something that I'm always trying to really practice in life. And I think it's the debate or in me, um, makes it really hard. The, the things that you're pointing out are, what's important about it is that people have a tendency to have an inner dialogue where they're there, right? And instead of really listening to the other person, they're coming up with the next argument that proves that person wrong.

Speaker 4:          00:35:31       And so, so if you go back to what I really loved about debate and what I felt like I got out of it, it was actually this ability to see both sides of an argument, to really delve into a topic and understand why the, the side that I actually naturally believed could actually be flipped on its head. And, and that was a really important skill to develop. And I think that was so much more important to develop then the skill to argue for my side. Because I think in the world today, what we don't see enough of his empathy for people you might even disagree with and we get stock in our version of truth and what is right. And we aren't truth seekers anymore. As a result, we're truth of winners. And true. Yeah, very true. And that, that's the piece that really makes me sad is that, you know, when people are like, oh, this debate skill is so great to have because now you can like Ram people with your ideas and, and I've never seen a situation where you shouted people down and convince them you are right. And I, I've seen situations where by developing true empathy for the other side, you actually create bridges and you create commonality and you create situations where you can actually work together. And, um, and I think that's the piece I would take away from my debate experience. I would say actually making the person crying cross examination probably is not the skill that I should be using in real life. Although maybe sometimes I do. I do.

Speaker 3:          00:37:20       Just when you're teaching your years, your son the black magic, I, I should point out just so people don't think I'm completely, uh, uh, sort of drinking the Koolaid of the blood lust of this, of this potential sport. Although I do find it very, very fascinating, uh, as an insight into some parts of human nature. But the book you mentioned getting to yes, just part a or a B byproduct of the Harvard negotiation project as I recall. Yeah. Is Not a book about proving you're right, it's a book about getting outcomes. Yes. And there is another book which I believe was coauthored by one of the coauthors of getting to yes. Called getting past no. Which I also really, really like and it is about a, well both of these books, any book really under negotiation is about achieving a very particular outcome or arriving at a a desired result as opposed to proving that you're right.

Speaker 3:          00:38:25       So I just want to underscore that, uh, B because there is a very real world differences you already noted between say debate and negotiation. I mean the tool kits are very similar perhaps in some respects, but in, in debate you're not going to have to think about, I wouldn't imagine something like the Batna that they talk about in getting to, yes, you're your best alternative to negotiated agreement, right? Like do you like walk away power or what your options are? You don't necessarily have to go through that thought process, but when you step into the real world and you're not just trying to prove that you're right, you're trying to get someone to concede something and agree to a certain set of terms or price or whatever it might be a or amicably trying to break up with someone or get together with someone or have a divorce or whatever it might be.

Speaker 3:          00:39:17       Uh, you're really trying to manifest some type of outcome, uh, or damage control. It's really, really different from being a truth winter. Uh, and, um, the, the worldclass term that I mentioned in the intro and use used a little bit of foreshadowing saying that I suspected it might come up a little bit later. So in doing, in doing homework for this conversation, uh, I read, and I don't think this is a misquote, but that your dad, even when I think you were going to be photocopying and the Dean's office would remind you to be world class and you would ask you if you turn it into calculus assignment. Is that a worldclass effort? Yeah. Uh, could you talk a little bit more about this? And, uh, uh, that's not that, that wasn't my experience growing up. My parents certainly encouraged me to do a good job, but, uh, tell us a little bit more about your dad in this particular case and how that was used.

Speaker 4:          00:40:33       Yeah, so my, my dad grew up in Tokyo, um, right at the tail end of World War II. And so one of his earliest memories actually is just a plane's coming across Tokyo and the fire bombs and he escaped to the countryside. Um, and, and then came back to Tokyo for high school. Um, his father passed away when he was in college and he, um, literally tutored kids. Uh, one, one guy was like the prime minister's son until he, so that he could make enough cash to support his family. Uh, he had three other siblings, um, and he was one of these incredible academics. And so he was at the top of his class in one of the famous high schools in Tokyo. Went to Tokyo University. Um, was also then went to Toshiba, which at the time was one of these great companies to work for. And then he ran into a friend who, um, who told him he was, he was also a friend who was one of the top at his high school who said, hey, there's great opportunities in America.

Speaker 4:          00:41:46       And this, this person had, uh, gone off to Princeton and gotten his phd and was at that time working in, uh, one of the great labs and Ibm and was also becoming a professor. And, and my dad decided that he also wanted to go to the u s and he was the eldest son. And so having a mother who's a widow and three siblings, uh, he had to take care of them until he had saved up enough. All of his siblings were married and his mom had the courage to say, you know what, you can go, you can go to the u s so this is sort of the backdrop for who my dad is. He, he comes to the United States without speaking very much English, gets a phd in mechanical engineering, Aerospace Engineering, um, and then is in a la ultimately as a postdoc and an associate professor.

Speaker 4:          00:42:44       Um, my mom comes to marry him and they are the only family members living in the United States. So really no support. Um, so my dad eventually makes his way out to NASA at Moffett field. And, and I, my memories of him, he was very engaged on the academics, but he would wake up at five in the morning and go to work and he'd bring back reams of paper and would continue working late into the night. Uh, he loved what he did. And so when he turned to me on anything I ever did from the time I was a small, small child, um, I would be writing something. And if the handwriting wasn't neat enough, he would say, hey, is this world class? And I remember thinking to myself, you know, four or five year old, yeah this is world class. But he would always push. He would always say is this really, you know, the best that a five year old could ever do.

Speaker 4:          00:43:52       Um, and it was a constant message and the, the story you're pointing to is one, when I was in, in college, um, after living through a lifetime of this is this world class question, I had a um, a moment where I was starting my, my financial aid package included, you know, 10 hours of work study and I the opportunity to, to work in the office of the dean of Engineering. And what was really funny to me at the time it since I'm leaving to go to my first day of work, I called my parents and my dad gets on the phone. He said, make sure you do a world costs job. And I thought, my dad thought I was like really doing something important in the office. And in fact I was just photocopying. And I said to my dad, I'm photocopying and, and filing, there's no such thing as world class there.

Speaker 4:          00:44:46       And he said, well, I'd still think about it. And so I get to the office and I am actually just photocopying and filing. And I remember standing in front of this photocopy machine with a stack of papers thinking to myself, what is world class in this situation? And I decided it was really crisp copies where you couldn't tell that it was a photocopy. And so I remember really trying to make, you know, the, the color match and everything was straight. Um, and I spent a lot of time on the details and when I was filing things, I didn't just handwrite it. I got a label writer and I'm, I made sure it was printed out on labels. Um, and I really tried to do everything as, as well as I possibly could. And I remember I was getting donuts and I would like make sure I got the, the fresh doughnuts instead of the ones that had been standing out.

Speaker 4:          00:45:47       I'm in the basket for awhile. So every step of the way, it was what can I do to make this experience for the dean or for his executive assistant? A delight moment. And it was a real lesson for me because it was a case of real ownership. I felt so much ownership of the job I was doing, even though from the outside, I think most people would have thought it was just sort of a grunt job. Um, and I think that's sort of, again, when I come back to you, don't just get luck. You, you make, can you, you create these opportunities for yourself. Um, to me was, was a real well real learning experience,

Speaker 2:          00:46:36       right? I mean, you're, you're, you're looking at the potential precursors of luck and trying to set the conditions, even though they might not always produce luck. The you can increase the likelihood of it happening, which I think is a perfect segue to a discussion about spring breaks. Don't worry, this isn't going anywhere tricky. This isn't going anywhere tricky. Uh, this relates to shadowing. I'll just, that'll be my cue, which might bring you back. So, all right, we're, we're to lead into this. Uh, you were giving a man a tour around Yale. Yeah. Who is this man? Why were you giving them a tour? What happened? And I actually don't know all the detail. I just, I found two lines in

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       a past interview and I was like, you know what? I don't want to dig into this because I don't, there's more to this story. I know it. Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:47:35       yeah. So I'm like, I'm a junior at the time at Yale and doing this office work. And the dean of engineering was this, this, this older gentleman, um, Alan Brom blame. And he had no idea who I was. And I'd been working in this office for I think two years, but he barely knew my name, but he was, he was just like this great. He'd worked under George Bush, Sr. He was, he was a legendary physicist. Um, and I really look up to this man. And so one day he, he pokes his head out of the office and the executive assistant was out and he said, who are you?

Speaker 4:          00:48:21       And I said, I'm an Mira. I'm your, I'm your student assistant in this office. And he said, Oh, I've heard of you. I need you to go and give this, this friend of mine a tour of the engineering facilities. And he's like, I know you'll do a good job. Sarah has told me, you're great. And so I take this gentlemen and I take him on a fairly thorough tour of the engineering facilities and we just had a great conversation and he, it started off with, you know, where, where are you from? And I said, I was from Palo Alto and it turns out, this is also from Palo Alto and we're just sort of talking about Palo Alto and in the buildings that are around us. And my growing up back in Palo Alto and in the middle of it he said, hey, you know, what are you doing for spring break? And it just so happened I was going to go back home and visit my family. And he said, well, that's great because, uh, I'm wondering if you want to come and shadow me and see what I do for a living. And in my complete self centered, uh, moment of being a, you know, Jr, uh, I hadn't asked this guy what he did for a living. And so I said, well, what do you do for a living? And he said, I'm the CEO of Hewlett Packard.

Speaker 4:          00:49:51       And I remember thinking to myself, I'm such a moron. And, and I said, I think that would be amazing to be able to shadow you for a couple of weeks during spring break. And so this man, Lou plot, um, invites me to just shadow him in 1997 and I am going around, literally, he, you know, he, he didn't have a driver. He was, is, this was really just the, the Hewlett and Packard error of CEOs. He drove himself around in a Ford Focus. I remember this. We'd go, go to different meetings and he took me around and one of the days actually, uh, Bill Gates came to make an announcement about.net, um, with Hewlett Packard. And so it was an incredible event that happened. I got to sit back stage and see everything that was happening. And Lou Platt that invited the photographer to come in and actually take a picture of me talking to Lou and I didn't really think about it.

Speaker 4:          00:51:01       But after the fact, I get back to my dorm and Lou Platt has sent me a thank you letter. Thank thanks for coming to visit. I thought you would enjoy these photographs and there's two photographs in there. I framed them in my office. Now one is a picture of me sitting on a, on a seat talking to Lou. And then the second picture is bill gates sitting exactly in that spot that I was sitting in talking to Lou Platt. And you know, to me like mentorship means so many different things. I've had so many different examples of mentors, but to a junior in college who, who literally is a no body, um, he was such an incredible example of mentorship. He never asked for my resume. He never asked for my GPA. He just sort of took this girl and said, you know what, you have, you have something and I, I see it and I'm going to show you something even greater.

Speaker 4:          00:52:12       And, um, to me that is such, it was such a gift. It was so incredible because I hadn't even thought about my own personal potential ever. No one had ever described anything to me. And I came back from that with my mind completely blown. I met Anne Livermore who was an executive and I never seen a female executive in my entire life. And here's someone who I could look at and, and see and I can see that people around her respect her. Um, it was just a, it's a, it's a life changing moment and it comes from that first. Okay. You know, comment from, um, Dean Bromley who says, I've heard of you, I heard you do a great job. Um, and that's where the opportunities opened up.

Speaker 2:          00:53:04       You're the, you're the woman responsible for my fresh doughnuts and crisp photocopies. I've heard good things. Exactly. It's a little things,

Speaker 4:          00:53:13       steps, filing labels. No,

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       I should note where you don't have to go too deep into this, but in a way you were perfectly primed for doing a good job with your photocopying and labeling

Speaker 3:          00:53:27       after spending. Was it summers in Kanazawa in the stationary store? Am I making that up?

Speaker 4:          00:53:34       Yeah, no, my first job was literally helping my, my uncle and grandmother sell office supplies in Kanisawa Japan at our store. Taichii doll

Speaker 3:          00:53:46       pikey though. Oh Man. [inaudible] is just such, I'd never been to Kanazawa for those people who don't know. I used to live in Japan long time. My first time out of the U S was a year in Japan as an exchange student, which is a whole separate story, but never made it to Kennesaw until a few years ago. It's gorgeous. And it's not that far away from Tokyo at all, but such a, it's such a cute spot with, uh, so much to offer. Uh, what did you, I'm sorry, go ahead.

Speaker 4:          00:54:14       Yeah, it's, it's actually incredible because it's one of the few cities in Japan that was protected by historians. The US, it did not get bombed in World War II because of some of the historic elements of the city. So it's almost like a smaller version of Kyoto and it has a historic, a Japanese garden called Kevin Oakwyn.

Speaker 3:          00:54:36       Yeah, it was unbelievable. Unbelievable.

Speaker 4:          00:54:40       Believable. So it's, it's like an eye summers. I would spend maybe like two blocks away from Kevyn Aucoin. Wow. So it was an incredible set of summers. But yes, I, I used to man the cashier register at the, the office supply store. So I know my pens and notebooks and in stamps like nobody's business.

Speaker 3:          00:54:59       Do you have any favorite Goto? Don't worry, I'm not going to spend too much time on this, but do you have any favorite notebooks or pens or items of those types that you use today?

Speaker 4:          00:55:10       Yeah, yeah, totally. So I'm on pens. I love the juice up. Oh four how do you spell giussep juice up. Oh, juice up. Okay. Yeah. Juice up oh four. You can get them on Amazon. They're super thin pens. Oh four that's at the 0.4 millimeter or something? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And then, um, for notebooks it's the Nuna, it's n u u n a, some European brand, but, but I like any notebook that has the dot matrix on it. Um, and those, the, the paper quality is really great.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       I see. Dot Matrix. Just not, it's not, it's not like graph paper, but there is, there are perpendicular lines that are dotted. Yes, yes. I'm very particular. They could go on and on. Oh, it appeals to the dungeons and dragons nerd in me. Anything that resembles craft papers to the juice, apoe four and the Nuna. Yeah, definitely. Anything European sounding with the repeating val, I'll pay 40% more for, um, maybe, maybe, maybe 100%. Okay. Maybe a hundred percent. You mentioned that you have these photographs in your office. I'm curious, you're sitting in your right now. Yeah. All right. So what else, I'm sure you have photographs, you were family, but outside of kind of the usual suspects, is there, what are other items that you have in your office that are important to you?

Speaker 4:          00:56:35       Uh, let's see. I have the original lift pink mustache that used to go in the front of the cars, um, which I love. I have, I'm also a picture and a set of laser etched metal plates that, uh, students gave to me, um, that have sort of a word graph of all of the words that they thought, uh, they could, they, they ascribed to me

Speaker 3:          00:57:11       students. Of what, what, what was the context for these students interacting with you and what are some of the words?

Speaker 4:          00:57:17       Yeah, so I had, um, I teach at Stanford. So after my phd, what I realized was I loved teaching more than anything else. And so I stayed in contact with, uh, Tina Seelig and Tom Byers over at Stanford who run the Stanford Technology ventures program. And they've given me the opportunity to teach a few different classes. But the one that I got these metal plates and the photograph from was, uh, the class of 2013 may field fellows group and they have words like a thunder lizard, bad ass inspiring, um, mother. So, um, you know, it's just really fun to see sort of what words they thought.

Speaker 3:          00:58:13       What were you, what were you teaching these Mayfield fellows?

Speaker 4:          00:58:16       Uh, so we were teaching them basic concepts behind leadership and entrepreneurship and it's sort of the first exposure that they get as juniors and seniors into really, you know, startup ecosystem. What does venture capital do within that ecosystem? What are the tough choices that you have to make as a leader within these types of organizations? What does growth look like in these types of organizations? So it's just sort of a startup one oh one but what I love about it is it's only 12 students and it goes for nine months. Wow. So if you get to be involved in it, you get to really know some of the students. And I've been mentoring students and sometimes teaching some of these classes since 2008 and you get this whole arc of the career path of young people and, and I really love it. I think it's just sort of you get, see, you know, students who start off as seniors and then they start their career, they might go to Grad School, um, then they go back and get a job. Then they have, uh, they get married. And then I think one is now about to have a kid. Uh, so you just sort of see this whole arc. Um, and it's just about 10 years, 20 years behind where I was. And so I get, I get to see this incredible progress that the students make over time. So it's, it's something that I love

Speaker 2:          00:59:55       and Miraco Mother of Thunder Lizards, Aka mother of dragons. We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna come back to thunder lizard because there's a whole lot wrapped around that. But, uh, I'm going to try to keep, my brain's somewhat focused here. Is there a reading list for that class or, uh, do you recall anything that was on a recommended or required reading list for that class?

Speaker 4:          01:00:22       Yeah, so we actually teach a, I'm starting a class today at Stanford, um, for the new spring quarter. And in this class, what we're teaching is what I would call intelligent growth. It's a little bit different than may field fellows. Um, but my hypothesis, my belief is that just like fake news in politics, there's actually something that we would call fake growth. And we've, we've, we've worshiped at the alter of growth for about five to 10 years now. And what I've seen is that specifically specifically within startups, there's so much that we see that it's fake and, and no one has ascribed actual adjectives to growth until now. And so the class that I'm teaching to engineering students at Stanford is around what is actually intelligent growth. And so you asked about the reading for it. It's all around some of these case studies that we've seen. Um, a great example of that to me is Qualtrics.

Speaker 4:          01:01:38       We're going to have Ryan Smith who is the sea of Qualtrics come in and speak. And I think he's a great example because I think he was at $50 million in revenues before he raised a dime of venture capital money. And so as a result, he's going to own an incredible piece of this company when it exits and it will. Uh, and so I love the capital efficiency with which he built his business. I also think, you know, one of my companies, Lyft is a great example of having that kind of discipline early on. And not just not just wasting venture capital dollars in the early days, they didn't have product market fit. So they spent two and a half years working on this platform called Zimride, knowing that they had to get to density and writers. Um, and Zimride was just a, it was a platform where you could find carpooling arrangements and it was being sold to universities and companies, but we couldn't get enough density to get transactions really moving fast.

Speaker 4:          01:02:46       And it was two and a half years before they launched Lyft. And in the first six weeks you could start to see that there was a real traction there. And it was only after they, they knew what they were doing with Lyft that they went and raised large round with founders fund and then an even larger round with, um, Andreessen Horowitz and, and that, that story of really, really hacking value before you go out. And Hack growth is something that I don't see often enough in, in silicon valley. So it's something that I'm, I'm continuing to seek and I love to see companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, that, that do that. And that's when we come back to hunting for thunder lizards.

Speaker 2:          01:03:32       That's what I'm looking for. When you mentioned the case studies, do you have written case studies that you using it much like a, I don't know if Stanford uses these, but much like the Harvard Business School case studies, which are these kind of three ring binder? Yeah. A five to 10 page cases that are published. You use those?

Speaker 4:          01:03:52       Yeah, we use, uh, so the, the ones that we focused on, there's a Harvard business case on flood gate, uh, that you can purchase off of the Harvard Business Review website. All right. So just

Speaker 2:          01:04:05       so anyone can purchase these, you don't have to be a student. And I, and I just, yeah, I don't want to interrupt but keep going because the format of these case studies is really interesting to me. In as an undergrad senior when I took ed showers class in high tech entrepreneurship, which is how I met Mike Maples Junior, who's going to be a recurring character shortly. Uh, I remember how useful they were. So that's, uh, that's the only interjection. Sorry to interrupt.

Speaker 4:          01:04:30       No, exactly. So we, we use that case study for Qualtrics. There is one on flood gate, so if you go to the Harvard Business Review Site, you can actually just search for flood gate or Qualtrics and it'll come up in there somewhere between, you know, five and $15. They're pretty easy to buy and download. Um, but I think those two in particular are quite valuable. We have then also, uh, just people coming in and speaking about some of the things that they've learned in how to grow that business from zero to one and then one to ax and, uh, people like, uh, Michael Siebel who is now a partner at y Combinator but also was part of, uh, Justin TV. Um, and social cam. We have a Stephanie Schatz who, who was the fearless leader on the sales side for Xamarin. She had 18 straight quarters of beating the stretch target. Uh, so you can only imagine how incredible she is as a sales leader, taking a company from zero to $50 million in revenues. Um, so we have a lot of different types of people, whether they're CEOs or c Aros or venture investors coming in to talk about the, the kinds of trade offs they had to make and, and how they decipher growth, uh, to make sure that they're, they have the real kind and not just kind that they're buying.

Speaker 2:          01:06:02       Right. It, just to elaborate on that, for people who may not be in the startup world, if, if for instance, you're sitting in on an incubator, a investor day, and you see 12, 12 companies in a row that have 20% month on month growth with very similar looking charts, there is some possibility that they have been inflating or manufacturing the numbers with paid acquisition to raise funding or do any number of things. And it's really easy to, uh, it's, it's relatively easy to spot once you know the symptoms, but there are an end, then there are, I suppose, you know, Richard Fiman would say the physicist, you must be sure not to trick yourself or fool yourself and you're the easiest person to fool. You can also get very caught up with what you might consider vanity metrics. But let me take a step back and just ask.

Speaker 2:          01:06:51       Well, before I ask people, definitely take a look at the case studies for both Harvard and if you search Stanford GSB, which is the business school case studies, you'll also find a website with these uh, profiles of companies and not just companies, but decisions they had to face generally where you can determine for yourself what you would do in a given situation. Then read about what they did, whether it's Mongo DB, I'm looking at this Stanford GSB site in the case studies right now, so nose and so on. Uh, how did you go to investing? How did you first be he become exposed to save venture capital and what did you think you were going to do in college when you were in college junior year? What do you think? What did you expect you're going to do when you grew up?

Speaker 4:          01:07:38       Yeah, I actually had multiple different paths. I started off when we were talking about my brother describing this kid who knew he wanted to work with cars or airplanes, uh, from the get go. And guess what he's doing right now, he's in Germany working with race cars. So, you know, and I was the complete opposite. I think when I was four I wanted to be a farmer and then somewhere along the lines I really wanted to be a doctor and I, I want it to be a doctor for a fairly long period of time. Where in you freshman year? Summer I took organic chemistry. It was in this premed track. Um, I think sophomore year, summer you take the m cats if you're pretty sure you want to go to medical school. And that summer I was with my best friend who also really wanted to go to medical school and she is right now, uh, studying leukemia.

Speaker 4:          01:08:38       She's a doctor, uh, at UCF. So she's, she's clearly gone down that path and double down on it. Uh, but I remember going to study for the mcats with her and I, I turned to the side and I looked at her and I had the sudden realization, which was that then, this is two days before we're taking the amp cats. I said, hey, Kathy, I hate hospitals. Um, I don't like actually being around sick people. I also don't love it when people are always complaining to me. And, and I think that might get in the way of me being a doctor. And she looked at me like I was an alien. And she said, why are you saying this right now? We're about to take me. I'm cats and we need to go study for it at Kaplan. And, but, you know, I was just constantly observing her and she's just this incredible human being.

Speaker 4:          01:09:38       And she continues to be. Um, but this realization of wow, like the actual job of being a Dr. May not be something that I actually enjoy, was really a hard realization when you've been all in for this long. And so, but it was, it was a realization that I really had to face. And I knew, I knew my gut that I was doing it because it was a really great path. It was a path where I knew what the next step was. I knew what next class I had to take, I knew the next exam I had to take. Then there was applications, then there was school, and then there was residency and fellowship and it just felt like a really predictable thing to do. But the actual work at the end of the day was not something that was going to love or enjoy. And that was really disturbing to me. And so I really screeched off of that path and I had, and it was hard because I had actually taken all of the requirements except for biology and the premed requirements did not actually overlap very much with electrical engineering. So I've taken a lot of extra classes to make it a possibility, but realize also it wasn't for me and that's where I was sort of in this state of not knowing what I wanted to be. And that's okay

Speaker 2:          01:10:57       for one second. Yeah. What you just described illustrates a, a degree of self awareness, but also decision making that I think is, is rather uncommon in the sense that I know a lot of people who have gone on to become doctors or lawyers or fill in the blank that has a lot of prerequisite training and schooling because of say succumbing to this sunk cost fallacy. Like, Ugh, God, I've put in so much time, even though I have this intuitive feeling, I'm not going to like it. I really should do it. And what was the conversation or the background that allowed you to step off of that path? And not to beat the like Asian kid drum too hard, but, but let's be real. Right? I mean you're also, I mean that's, that would be a very, uh, admirable, well-respected, happy to share at a dinner party with friends type of path for your parents, I would assume. So all the more uncommon that you would step off of that track. So how has that, how has that the case, why, why or why were you different?

Speaker 4:          01:12:13       So I think it goes back to actually the moment in debate where I, I, my mom is telling me, um, you should, you should do fencing instead of debate. There was this realization of my parents really love me, but they don't know me and they, they don't actually, no one really knows me in terms of my capabilities and what I feel like I can get done. No one knows that better than I do. And, um, and it was a, it was an important lesson for me because one other fact that I didn't mention is that in as a kid, there was no sign that I was special except for, you know, these weird characteristics where I would go learn negotiations. Um, but I failed the Iq test multiple times and the school district insisted I was not gifted or talented. My mom had to fight for me to be part of this gifted and talented program.

Speaker 4:          01:13:21       Um, as a two year old after I, I was a really hostile to people who spoke English. My Mom's stuck me in, tried to put me into preschool to socialize me, but I, um, ended up biting the person who was interviewing me for, for a preschool slot and they put me in special education. And, um, and I was, I was one of those kids who got picked up in a short yellow bus from our house and take into a state run program for, for, for special children. And, and I think for a long time, my mom wasn't really sure what I was, but she just decided to be all in on the fact that I was gifted and talented, even if I wasn't. And she really worried that I was, I was one of these special children. And, and, and so I had sort of an environment around me way before Yale where I knew what I was capable of, even if the test scores showed that I wasn't.

Speaker 4:          01:14:31       Hmm. And I knew that I knew what I was capable of, even if my parents didn't see it in me. And I think there's sort of this, this moment in time that people need to have where, where you realize that there's no test for human potential, there's no recognition for that. It's something that you have to find inside of yourself. And I think for me, you know, that, that one of those tests was actually going back to, am I, am I going to be a great doctor? And if I revisit this question that my dad had always asked me, can you be world class? I knew I couldn't cause I looked at Kathy and she was going to be world class cause she loved, she loved helping people and she loved helping people from that kind of caretaking perspective, which is not where I was going to be world class. But I felt like there was something in me where I could be great at something that just wasn't it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:41       And how did you have the, you've all this technical training by this point? Many have the chemistry, but you certainly also have the, uh, let's see here. At that point, the electrical engineering probably. Yeah. Uh, how does finance and investing or startups, I don't know which came first enter the picture?

Speaker 4:          01:16:00       Yes. So having grown up in Palo Alto, I was actually exposed to a lot of startups as a, even as a kid. My, I used to Babysit for a serial entrepreneur, um, and he was always tinkering around in his garage. And I remember thinking to myself, oh, he, he works for himself, which is very, very cool. I also, I'm on my debate team. Um, was Lisa Brennan jobs who I didn't really realize she was the daughter of Steve Jobs until I was in her house. Um, and we were, we were talking about debate. I was, I was a senior at the time and I was helping her through learning the ropes of speech and debate. And Steve jobs sort of appeared out of nowhere. And I remember thinking to myself, what a Steve Jobs doing in this house? Um, and so, you know, it was just sort of, it was all around and, and so venture capital was something that actually a friend of mine had brought up when I was still struggling with this notion of what should I be.

Speaker 4:          01:17:01       And he was a real finance guy and he said, you know, you are, you're really good at technology and you're now in business because of this exposure to loop plot. You know, have you ever thought of venture capital? And I remember kind of reading about it and having heard a little bit about it growing up, um, looking into it and realizing, oh, you have like all, all this work experience you need to have. I talked to a couple of former Yalies who were venture capitalist and, and sort of had that in my, in the back of my head. Um, and so, you know, I went off to work at Mckinsey as a consultant for three years and then in the process of trying to figure out what to do next, I met a venture capitalist by the name of Ted Denture Smith. And in that interview with him, we spoke about not about technology, not about the research I'd done or my work experience, but he wanted to know what books I was reading.

Speaker 4:          01:18:03       He wanted to know, uh, about the music that I loved. And in that period I was really into modern American literature. So I was really into El Doctorow. And uh, there, there are a few books that I just absolutely loved and we talked about that for a little while. And then when we turned to music, I've played piano, classical piano since I was four and he, he and I talked about the, the classical musicians that I really loved and he happened to be an English lit major along with being a physics major. So he, he loved books as much as I did, maybe even more. And then he was an opera nut. And so we had all these things that we could talk about and two hours into that conversation, never having touched upon technology. He then basically said, how would you like to come work with me? And, um, I was living out in Palo Alto at the time. This is an opportunity in Boston. And I remember not, not even hesitating knowing that I wanted to work with this, this person, this human beings sitting across the table from me, uh, jumped at that opportunity. And it wasn't, it wasn't the fact that was in venture capital, but rather I really wanted the chance to be working around someone like Ted Dinner Smith at that time.

Speaker 2:          01:19:30       Let's talk about that interview for a second. So that I think would strike some people as a very unusual interviewing style. Do you think in retrospect, and maybe you know, that he had already decided you were fully capable of doing the job, therefore didn't have to check that box and just wanted to make sure that he could work with you and spend time with you. Was it that he was using the interview to sell you so that when he made the offer you would say yes. What do you think was going through his mind before, during, or after our, I suppose before and during that conversation?

Speaker 4:          01:20:03       You know, I think Ted is a very unique human being in that when I, I used to have this perception that networking was work in a room and like you shake a lot of hands and hold a lot of babies and you learn a few names and you move on. I learned from Ted that networking is actually a deep curiosity about the human being who's sitting across the table from you. So I don't think he necessarily had that kind of purpose in mind, but that he was just really interested in what I was interested in. And we happened to find commonality and he was trying to understand how my mind worked in what I was interested in. And I, I've taken that as a real lesson because I love the way he would network. He, he learned so much about people in that process and um, and, and that's how he ministered to his entrepreneurs.

Speaker 4:          01:21:13       He also, um, was capable of providing advice at the right time because he really knew those people. Uh, and so, so for me, I felt like it was a really unique interview. It's stood out from all the interviews I've ever had, but I think he was learning more about me than most other technical interviews could have gotten to. And then you know, his other partners I think ease our mini gave me sort of more of a case study and could dive into that. But Ted always had a deep curiosity about the human being and not necessarily just the skills. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:21:55       What else did you learn from him or in that position in that, in that job?

Speaker 4:          01:22:04       I thought that Ted was also an incredible first principles thinker. So this, my second day of work at CRV was nine 11 and so, so it was, you went from kind of a bad economy to a horrible, um, black whole economy and, and so it was a really terrible time for venture and they had just raised this one point $4 billion fund. And so that's, I mean for venture, that's a huge amount of money and it's a huge accomplishment to convince so many investors to invest in your venture capital firm at that amount. But then Ted took the time to actually start to do analysis with me on how much capital had gone into venture capital at that moment. And then the exits had stopped. There are no more IPOs, no one was acquiring companies at the economy just came to a screeching halt and he decided along with the other partners in this firm to give back most of the money. So they reduced their fund from one point $2 billion to $450 million. And the reason why that's so interesting and impressive is that the way a venture capital firm makes money, the way you have any salary or on the operating money that you have for the firm is a direct percentage of the fund that you raise. And so by shrinking the size of the fund, you're shrinking the size of the management fees that you get pretty dramatically.

Speaker 3:          01:23:46       Oh, for sure. Very dramatically. I mean for people who don't know, I mean you hear very often, it's not always the case, but in venture capital two and 22 and 20 and that means 2% management fee based on the sort of assets under management, meaning that particular fund and then 20% of the upside for people who don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:24:05       And so, so they, they decided to give back those management fees. And, and to me that was really, really impressive cause you're, you're facing now in a really terrible economy and not only are you shrinking the size of your fund to reflect that you're also shrinking the size of your management fees and you're, you're taking that blow. Um, and so, so things like that I learned, I learned also, you know, how to, how to shepherd companies through that kind of difficult time and how to be a true partner to an entrepreneur. Um, and so, you know, I think it was a really important lesson to learn because I would argue most people haven't seen real cycles. People seem to think 2008 was a real significant dip in the economy. But anyone who lived through 2001 knows that 2008 was a blip compared to a real downturn. And because we've had a, you know, raging bull market for such a long time that that memory and that knowledge of, of having survived, you know, 2001 as a crisis period is something that I hold with me really my war chest. I know how to get through that kind of time period. And I don't think a lot of people do.

Speaker 3:          01:25:27       Yeah. It makes me think of a lot of what I heard in Silicon Valley still here. I know before moving to Austin, uh, which, which makes me think of, I'm going to paraphrase this, but it's a quote from Sir John Templeton I think it is, which is the most expensive words in investing are this time it's different. And uh, it has been quite the bull run. You mentioned first principles thinking, uh, what, what are I want, I want to tie that into something you mentioned related to your class. Tough choices for leaders. What are some of the toughest choices for leaders? I suppose in this context, CEO is or high level exacts cofounders of companies, what does, what are some of the, the toughest decisions that nonetheless seem to come up fairly commonly?

Speaker 4:          01:26:19       The most difficult thing for a startup founders, CEO leader is that especially when you're, you, you witnessed multiple phase changes in a business. And so if you imagine you're going from absolutely nothing to something, that's what I call the zero to one phase. You're searching for product market fit, you're trying to find the best customers, you're trying to find where your tenex advantage is truly valued. That's a very different business process and truth seeking. Then when you're going from one to acs, which is now that I know what my value proposition is, I'm going to add to that, but I'm also going to pull on some of these growth levers. The, the fundamental job of a VP of marketing who is in that zero to one phase changes dramatically one to x. It changes dramatically for the salesperson in zero to one to one to x.

Speaker 4:          01:27:25       Um, and you go through this incredible Bermuda Triangle where you have to navigate that change. And so, so what, what I see challenging for, for startup founders is actually being comfortable with your fundamental job shifting from every three months. You would have a massive shift in what you need to focus on and how you need to develop. And I think, you know, a, an accompany is a multidimensional thing in, in, in Silicon Valley we spent so much time thinking about product and product market fit that we forget that there's this huge emphasis you might want to place on the fact that a company is also an organization. A company is also a category that you're building. A company is also a business model, you know, companies also a team. And so it's, it's, it's the skill set actually to balance all of those things and knowing when you've, you, you fundamentally need to change out the talent in your team, uh, the knowing when you actually need to let go of a product. Um, and knowing, actually to me this is probably the hardest piece. Knowing the difference between a winning strategy versus a strategy not to lose.

Speaker 3:          01:28:58       Could you elaborate on that please? Yeah. So

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       to me a strategy not to lose this is a lot of different things. It's to not to lose to a competitor, not to lose talent. Uh, a strategy not to lose out on revenue. So it's all these fears that you have of captured ground or uh, the fact that you might have someone take over something that you're, you want to do a competitor who's breathing down your neck versus a strategy for winning is about where do you double down on, what do you do to capture ground, to be aggressive, uh, to play off offense and not defense. To me, that as a huge difference between that strategy of I'm going to win in this market versus I'm not going to lose and not losing often invest in involves a lot of hedging. And when you feel that urge to hedge, you need to focus. We, you need to be offensive.

Speaker 3:          01:30:04       What, what, in what ways might that hedging manifest? What would be examples you've seen or hypothetical's of the symptoms of a defensive strategy in the form of hedging?

Speaker 4:          01:30:18       Great question. It might manifest itself in, I am going to go after two very different customer segments. One is large enterprises. There is small medium businesses and the reason why that's really hedging is you have two completely different ways of selling to those organizations and you're afraid to pick one because maybe you have some revenue in both. Right? But in that situation, by not choosing to focus on one group or the other, you're probably a short changing your team because you don't have a specialized team to go after that opportunity. You're short changing your business model because you aren't pricing your product correctly and you're shortchanging the opportunity because probably your product isn't optimized for that customer. Set your, your customer services and optimize for that product set and your team is ultimately confused because you're heading in two completely different conditions and directions. And so I believe that, you know, that's one of the most common ways that I see people involved in a strategy of not losing instead of we're here to win it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:31:38       Yeah. All of those things you mentioned also contribute to lighting money on fire. Right? I mean that's tests, that's split focus. Just the bottom

Speaker 4:          01:31:47       fire, the bonfire

Speaker 3:          01:31:49       of funding, uh, or cashflow depending on where it comes from. Uh, the, this is really important and you know this, but I want to underscore it. People listening

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       and give a few other examples that might be worth people might enjoy exploring. So this winning versus not losing distinction seems really subtle up, but you can get an in to, to feel for it in a few different ways. Uh, one is, there's actually a, I think it's a three part mini series podcast called the making of Oprah and it talks about the rise of Oprah. I know this seems like an odd segue. Oprah impresses the hell out of me on a million different ways. And after you listen to this, you'll understand exactly why that's the case. But she would constantly tell her team, many of whom wanted to respond to say Donahue, who is the 800 pound gorilla at the time. Like we need to raise our own race in the sense that if you're on a thoroughbred horse and you're in a race, you need to focus on your race.

Speaker 2:          01:32:53       You can't be looking side to side at the, the, the, the competitors, the razors next year you get yourself into a lot of trouble or you get really injured. And the second is if people want to Google, uh, Dan Gable on aggression, uh, there's a short video I put on my blog that hits this point exactly. And I'm giving examples from different disciplines because it is crossdisciplinary. It's not just investing in startups. Dan Gable is the, the most legendary wrestling coach, certainly of the last, I would say a hundred years in the United States. Uh, also, uh, won a gold medal in the 1,972 Munich Olympics without having a single point scored on him. That just does not happen. And uh, this video, we'll show you a lecture that he's giving one of his athletes after his athlete tied and he said, you lost to him twice before you just didn't want to lose. He said, you never win that way. You got to tie. And that's, that's exactly why you got to tie and uh, the differences is just so powerful and it's, it's worth, I just thought taking a second to, to underscore it because I think that uh, it's, it's, it's really a critical distinction that you brought up.

Speaker 4:          01:34:08       Like I think about it, I love to ski and I had this instructor once I was complaining about going through powder and I was, I was saying how it really hurt my, my thighs. He was like, my thighs are burning and he looks at me and he said, it's because you're not leaning forward and, and like the minute you lean forward, suddenly you're just gliding. And it's scary in that moment when you lean forward because you feel like you're gonna fall and yet it gives you so much more control and it gives you so much. It's so much less effort counter intuitively. And that to me is like the perfect example of, oh like you have to actually have a little bit of aggressiveness in order to have the win.

Speaker 3:          01:35:02       I think you are, are well suited in that respect. Uh, how did, how did you meet the, uh, how did you meet the man who so famously tries to trick, not trick that sounds too strong. Who so commonly will say something like, well, I'm just a southern boy. Maybe you could slow down and explain that one more time. Which by the way, if you ever hear anything like that, like really stop and pay attention because you're, you are about to be tricked or directed. I've actually borrowed that and I use that for long, Long Island. A lot of them like, you know, I'm just a slow long island boy. Take a second. Maybe you can explain that to me again. How did you meet Mike Maples Jr?

Speaker 4:          01:35:44       Yeah, so this actually happened in one of the classes that I was teaching at Stanford. He was, uh, he was one of the mentors for a bunch of teams. So we had all these teams who are creating business plans for, for their own version of a startup company. And we had incredible mentors to each of these teams. We had, I think someone who was the former CEO of verisign, we had, I think Diane Greene might've been a mentor to one of the teams

Speaker 3:          01:36:13       can we had Mike Maples and green is for those who don't know,

Speaker 4:          01:36:16       Diane Greene is now the head of Google cloud. She was also the CEO of Vm ware. Big Deal, a big, big deal, big deal, big deal. Um, and what we, what we did was we would team up some of these entrepreneurs or people in Silicon Valley with a student team and Mike was one of them. And for people who know Mike, he's just this charming guy, boy from Oklahoma. He calls himself sometimes a washed up enterprise, uh, VC and are washed up enterprise entrepreneur, but he's not. And uh, so he came to our class and he was mentoring this team, but he was actually being too nice. And so this team was having like all sorts of weird issues. They were fighting and they came to my office hours and one of them started to cry and

Speaker 3:          01:37:13       spotting a theme here within proximity of

Speaker 4:          01:37:16       right. I did not make this teeth number cry. It was, they were making each other cry. And so I was just kind of, I was really, I was kind of mad at Mike because part of the, the, the role of the mentor is to help shepherd them through this tough points. And he was just kind of checked out on that front. And, and I emailed him, he said, Oh yeah, my team's doing great. And I said, well, I kind of beg to differ. Uh, they were just in my office and one of them started crying and they're fighting and right now if they don't pull it together, they're really gonna fail the class. And he wrote me this message that said, well, I think they're going to get an a plus. And so I said, well, so far, not tracking. And, and so we just sort of have this friendly banter and actually the team does turn it around and they ended up getting an a plus in the class. And, um,

Speaker 3:          01:38:15       or did he just throw some turtle shells on a desk and like divine his way to that outcome?

Speaker 4:          01:38:20       I, I'm not really sure, but I actually take full credit for the turnaround because had I not pointed it out to Mike, then the team would have just imploded and, and so, um, so based on that interaction, you know, a few years later I was starting to get to a point in my phd where I was thinking of starting my own company and I had started my phd in computer security exactly because I knew that it didn't matter when I graduated there would be a computer security problem out there and I would be, I wouldn't be at risk of market timing. And it was sort of a perfect opportunity because just as I was going through my research, it was from 2003 to 2007 at this point, we had transformed from this world of where security used to be a bunch of vandalism problems to now there are companies involved in like real money was being involved.

Speaker 4:          01:39:23       And so real crime was being created here. And then towards the end there was really like nation state warfare starting to happen. And so my, my research was really in risk management of computer security and I knew that this was becoming a huge issue. And so I started to think I'm going to make a company. And so at that moment I turned to some of my advisors and my advisors were nice enough to say, hey, um, if you're thinking about starting company, you've been in the ivory towers for literally four years, so you should get out of the classroom and go check out some angel investors. And then Mike was one of the first people I turn to and I asked him if I could see his deal flow and he was nice enough to say, sure, why don't you just come in and take a look at my deal flow on Wednesdays? And so we would sit next to each other and look at companies and

Speaker 3:          01:40:26       I mean, you get the, the, the sort of top of the funnel companies that he's considering potentially investing in,

Speaker 4:          01:40:32       right? They would come in and pitch for between 30 minutes and an hour. And then at the end of that, I, um, I think it was, you know, March of 2008 he calls me is I'm actually going up to Tahoe to ski. He calls me to say, Hey, and um, I have this great idea. I just raised my first fund. It's $35 million and I think that you should drop out of your phd program and join me. And it's not the venture back startup that you've been thinking about, but it's now a backed venture startup.

Speaker 3:          01:41:15       Let's go. I like that. That's really good. Now was that an immediate yes. Or is it a let me sleep on it.

Speaker 4:          01:41:24       I actually thought he was crazy because first of all, you know, I was literally, again, I was a nobody. I, I'm, I'm a phd candidate. I didn't even have my degree at Stanford. So there's like all these business school students, there's great, you know, Angel investors milling around the, the major question was like, why does this guy think that I would actually be a good investor? And then the second piece was there weren't a ton of venture capital firms that were being started up. So even when I went back to people who were my mentors, some of them said, why would you go to a no name VC? Why won't chew go and be an associate at Kleiner Perkins or excel or you know, sequoia. Yeah. And I didn't really have a good answer.

Speaker 3:          01:42:16       Um, just to set the stage for folks who don't know, maybe the recent history in Silicon Valley at the time that Mike had proposed this to you, sort of microcap venture capital was barely a thing, right? I mean it's, it's there, there are a lot of funds of all sorts of different sizes now, but at the time this was very unusual.

Speaker 4:          01:42:39       Yeah. And so it was, you know, this point and when you get to 2018 there's probably, you know, 30 funds being pitched a week to a limited partner who invest into these venture capital firms. But back then there was very, very few. And so it was really a question of is this the smart thing to do? And I think this is sort of where, you know, when you turned to an entrepreneur, this is the feeling that they get. Um, what I, what I sensed was there was actually a major change of foot. I'll, all of the students around me at Stanford didn't need $5 million to start a company. And that's what venture capital was offering to startups. At that point they would say, I will buy 50% of your company for $5 million.

Speaker 3:          01:43:28       Right? Is predicated on the entry costs being very high. And some are very, very high.

Speaker 4:          01:43:34       And like at that point, you know, we suddenly have open source software. We really have what starting to look like cloud computing, we have all the shared resources. So even though I was helping to run servers and the closet at my Grad in our lab, that was starting to become something that we didn't need. There was actually, you know, services that you can use where you could rent services. And so to me, uh, there was a dramatic change that was happening. And so you had to change the financing environment. And so I felt like I could see something that everyone else didn't see, that Mike was also seeing. And he used to save 100,000 is the new 5 million. And, and, and then the second piece for me was this guy, Mike maples had a skillset I had never seen before. I made maybe in like one or two other people in my entire lifetime, but he was this incredible marketer and I used to believe you either build things or you sold things.

Speaker 4:          01:44:43       Everything else just seemed like an extraneous skillset to have. Mike was incredible at storytelling and positioning and, and, and strategy, like real strategy for how do you create a new category and how do you build that category and how do you create the king of that category. And as an engineer, I had a thought about what you do after you build the product. And so this magic of category creation to me was something that almost felt like magic. And so I looked at Mike and I thought, I really need to learn from this person. And, and not only is it a great skill set that I'm learning from, he is also genuinely one of the best human beings that, that I've ever encountered. And so it was just sort of this magical combination of someone whose values really aligned with me and how I wanted to build a firm and the things that I wanted to do with that and how I wanted to treat entrepreneurs and in a person who was a mad genius. And so that combination to me was irresistible. And so a couple of months into it, I said, sign me up

Speaker 3:          01:46:04       a couple of months. All right. So question number one, just for, for people who are wondering, and I know a lot of people, you seem very good at avoiding the sunk cost fallacy and this is so, so, so key, this cognitive bias. Uh, when you were looking at the quitting of the PHD program, did you, I don't know how it works at Stanford, but did, did you realize you could kind of, you didn't have to quit?

Speaker 4:          01:46:30       I did not quit. So, so that first year and a half of my life within at floodgate was crazy because at that point I joined floodgate and I have an 18 month old child, my daughter Abby. And then I, you know, I think it four or five months into it, I am pregnant with my second child. I've promised my mother as any good Asian daughter would that I will finish this phd if it's the last thing I do. So I'm waking up at like four o'clock in the morning doing research until, you know, seven when she went, my daughter wakes up and then taking her to daycare and then working from like eight 30 to six 30 at floodgate and then coming back doing dinner and then working on my phd again, Rinse and repeat. And then I got pregnant with my second child a few months into that and then, um, decided I was going to defend my phd.

Speaker 4:          01:47:31       They set the date for six weeks after I gave birth to my son. And so, you know, I, I not only did my first set of investments, but also had gave birth to a child, cared for another one and managed to stay married and finish this phd all between 2008 and 2009. And so, you know, to me like that's like the most creative and probably productive period of my life ever and probably will be, but, but also showed me that I can actually do a lot of things that everyone around me was like, why would you do all of those things at the same time?

Speaker 3:          01:48:18       How does, how does this seem like a non sequitur? Kind of is, but uh, how does, how does your mom say your name? Because Anne is sort of an unusual first name.

Speaker 4:          01:48:29       Oh, no, but that's what my first name, my first name is Nicole

Speaker 3:          01:48:33       nickel.

Speaker 4:          01:48:34       Yeah. So how does my mom say she was like, no

Speaker 3:          01:48:38       Vaco Dayco chances going there. I can barely, that's another word. Everybody should look up and learn. Shug I sequoia and uh, that just means sort of awesome, impressive, whole all sort of things because I can barely manage to brush my teeth and shower on a daily basis. And yet you're doing all these things simultaneously. I have to pause at this point just to try to fill out the, the, some of the, the colors of who [inaudible] is. What have you struggled with? Like have you had any dark, really, d doesn't have to be dark, but difficult times, dark times that you could tell us about and where you, where you really struggled or is that not part of your sort of lexicon?

Speaker 4:          01:49:34       No, I think we, we all have struggles, right? So I think even in this moment of like the Phd and caring for my kids and caring for myself and my, and my family and all, and trying to do a good job at work, like things slip, right? And, and I, I, I struggle with this still today and this is where the darkness comes in is like, am I doing anything? Well, like, am I a good mother? Am I, you know, I, I didn't, I wasn't today, my, my six year old is on a field trip and he asked me, why is it that you never get to come on a field trip? Like those are all these moments where you wonder like, am I failing at being a parent or you know, Aye I, Aye not able to get to the dishes. And My, I had a moment where my, my front door neighbor is actually a Japanese woman, a nosy Japanese woman.

Speaker 4:          01:50:32       She went up, she went up to my mother and she said, you know, your family is so strange. I always see the husband doing the dishes but never the wife, never the wife that is the most nosy Japanese neighbor thing to say ever. Like I spent two days like in, in that, in that front window doing dishes. And at some point I was like, oh, screw this. Um, but, but it's like all it is this constant battle of how do I figure out what my priority is so that I have like minimum viable, you know, progress on some fronts. And then the thing that really matters, I'm going to make massive progress on. And so, so that, that's where the darkness creeps in. I think, you know, for me, my, my really loser moments have been things like, you know, early on I just described to you early how there were tests that always said like, I wasn't that smart.

Speaker 4:          01:51:38       There were, you know, lots of examples where I wasn't good at a lot of different things that other people found very normal. Like I was horrible at standardized tests only until I got to like senior year or junior year in high school. Did I finally figure it out? Like there's so many places where so many people said distinctly average, maybe not even that smart. And, and I think for me it's been learning to tune out the naysayers and knowing that there are certainly a lot of things I'm not going to be good at, but there are things that I can actually be great at. Um, a really good example of that actually is my phd. I remember when I got to my phd at Stanford and I'm starting, first of all, like I took a math class and there were high school or college freshmen in this class and it felt like the math teacher was speaking Greek and the freshmen are flying through this material because they're like little kid geniuses.

Speaker 4:          01:52:48       And I remember thinking to myself, well, clearly I should not be getting a phd in math. And thank goodness this is an operations research. Then I had this second experience where the professor, a new professor came in across the hall from me. His name is Ramesh Johari. And uh, he was my age because I had taken five years off to start my phd. He was literally my age and he was incredible. He could remember things about different papers and theorems and how they were proved from like years past, compare and contrast them. He just knew things that I struggled to remember. And I remember looking at him and being in one of his seminars and thinking to myself, that is world class as an academic. And I'm, I'm okay at it. But I would have moments where I was like, I'm, I'm actually not even good at it.

Speaker 4:          01:53:48       And then I would go to a conference and like when you, when you compare yourself against the world of Phd students and obvious, then you start to develop a little bit more confidence. Then you go back to Sanford and you see what world classes and, and I was thinking to myself, this isn't the path and there's a, there's a place where I actually can use the skill sets that I do have, where I can be really good at the things that I'm doing. And so if, if I, if I, I'm sitting here saying, you know, oh, I was always good at everything that I did. It's just not true. There are so many moments where I realized it's like being a doctor. I said I would not be good at being a doctor. I would not be great at being an academic. I would not be great at a lot of different things. Just knowing and having the self awareness of where I would double down is I think what, what I was good at. And so, so it makes the, this emergent life where I was going from one track to another, I was going to be a doctor and then I went to Mckinsey and then I went to VC and then I went to get a phd and then it went back to VC. This is all self discovery rather than a stated path that I had career plan for a long time.

Speaker 3:          01:55:09       Well it strikes me also that, and maybe I'm trying to create narrative where there isn't one or connection, but it seems reasonable that Mike's superpower or one of his abilities to help create categories and then sort of mint kings within a given category is actually a different species of something that you're also good at, which is kind of a Jack Welch, Ian in a sense. And that is you're looking at the different paths you could take.

Speaker 2:          01:55:45       And if you can't be saying number one or number two in that thing, it just gets rolled out and you're asking this world class question over and over again. And one way is to find something where you can dominate and really be world class. And the other is to create an entirely new category in a sense. So it seems like you and Mike are very complimentary in that way and have that shared programming. Uh, I've, I've heard people describe you as an investor when your strengths is being technical, which I suppose seems self evident given your background, but how would your colleagues, how would, how would Mike, let's say describe your, if I asked him what her aunt superpowers is an investor, there are a lot of investors out there. What is, what is ends superpower set of super powers? What would he say?

Speaker 4:          01:56:40       I think for me, the super powers I have or a few folds. So one is because of the, the technical capabilities that I have when someone is describing particularly anything that has to do with math. And Luckily for me right now, math is having this incredible resurgence in artificial intelligence and in cryptocurrency, I, I can get that piece. I can get that piece better than I would say probably 99% of the investors out there. And so if I get a math paper, that's something that I love to dig into. And that technical insight is something that I think I'm better at than most other investors out there. And then from there I can also start to piece together what that company will look like around that technology. And so it's not just I'm looking for great r and d projects, but ones that are ripe to be big D and little r and, and I think that's a super power, especially at the very early stage.

Speaker 4:          01:57:53       So one of the companies that I invested in back in 2010, uh, Yosty, they've gone over a hundred million dollars in financing at this point. And I found them when they were, they didn't even have a business plan. They had four math papers that they sent to me. And, and so to me that, that's something that I, I doubled down on and it's a, it's a part of the types of investments that I like to do. Um, that's very different from, you know, the task grab. It's refinery 29 and lift that I've done in the past as well. I think the other superpower that is a little bit less, seven is more of an, as I'm working with people is I feel like I have a pretty good sixth sense about the dynamics within an organization. So I can tell when there's actually in fighting happening. I can sense when a executive is starting to disengage. Um, and those are things that, that I work on with a lot of the CEOs that I work with. Um, and then the, the last piece that I think I really love to engage in is the fundamental data behind the business. And so, um, I love looking at the cohort analysis and really engaging on data, uh, because that's, that's a piece of the puzzle that I feel like I'm also good at encoding uninviting.

Speaker 3:          01:59:23       What are you looking for now? And water thunder lizards. We mentioned hunting thunder lizards earlier and I promised I would come back to it. So maybe we define that first and perhaps you could tell us what you're looking for at the moment.

Speaker 4:          01:59:40       Yeah, so, so a thunder lizard is inspired, um, by Godzilla. It's a term that Mike, my partner used to always tell this story, which is that we are inspired by entrepreneurs who are like Godzilla. And so what is Godzilla like? He's born from radioactive atomic eggs. So the DNA of that entrepreneurs already fundamentally different. And then he swims across the Pacific Ocean and depending on if you're Mike or me, he lands in either the bay area or Tokyo and starts to wreak havoc and eats trains and automobiles and buildings and then proceeds to crush that, that industry and creates disruption and then build something out of that. And, and so you know that that idea of disruption is something that, that I always liked that imagery of like the journey across the Pacific Ocean, born from something fundamentally different and then really starting to turn things over. Um, and so, so when we say, okay, what are we looking for right now in terms of where do we think the new thunder lizards will exist?

Speaker 4:          02:01:02       There's sort of two different areas that comes back to the math that I, that I'm really interested in. One is I do think that artificial intelligence is about to disrupt a lot of different types of enterprise software. Um, I think that enterprise software is still socks. And if we're going to be able to really transform the way, um, uh, an, uh, business has actually operated. We have to take these, the software that just basically records data and spits it back out to you into something that's actually more intelligent, that tells you something that you didn't know, that gives you superpowers. And, and I think that we're going to see more and more of that in the industry. And so as an example, like baseline examples, why do we spend millions of dollars on oracle or net suite when the CFO is still has to make a budget for next year?

Speaker 4:          02:02:04       Why does it that financial planning just automatically automagically generate itself based on all the history that it knows, plus all the data from the external world. So I think things like that we're going to start to see happen more and more. I also think, you know, fundamentally the scientific method may also be dead. Like we list used to have the scientific method is developed in a time where we didn't have enough data and data was actually the fundamental bottleneck in scientific research. Well that's just not the case anymore. And so why is it that we form a hypothesis then look at the data and then come to a conclusion. We should have all of the data then have, uh, an analysis of that that leads us to a hypothesis or a belief system that we fundamentally test further. Um, so I think these massive changes are coming and, and you see it even in, in cryptocurrency. Um, there's also really philosophical, interesting debates happening around, well, you have this massive pull towards centralization, whether it's an AI and ml. We have to have all of that data in one place in order to really train

Speaker 3:          02:03:20       MLP machine learning,

Speaker 4:          02:03:21       machine learning, um, or in cloud computing. You're also putting it up into the data and to more in data centers. Um, in crypto currency, uh, we believe that there's going to be more decentralized software. And so how do you reconcile those two types of systems? I think there's lots of really interesting themes that are just at the start of being discovered. Um, I'm really excited about what, what's going to happen with autonomous vehicles and the technology that it's going to be required to make that a reality. Uh, and so all of those areas I think are just fascinating. And so it feels like, uh, the period of real intellectual abundance and that we're headed into a period of real great creative energy

Speaker 3:          02:04:17       end up at a time where a lot of your philosophical training and reading will be put into practice in the real world, right? Where we have, yeah, if you look at the, uh, people can look up the trolley scenario or that is typically thought of as a thought exercise, but if you're programming, not take too

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       off on a tangent, but if you're programming for autonomous vehicles and there's some type of act of God off hailstorm, a huge boulder falls in the middle of the street and the car has to swerve left and hit to school kids or swerve right and hit five geriatrics. And how does it make the decision? What is the logic embedded into that machine? It's, it's uh, really bring, it takes a lot of these philosophy, one o one thought exercises and translates them very directly into the real world with real consequences and is, it is a fascinating time

Speaker 4:          02:05:17       and how much, it's also like how much do you want to know? Right? So deep learning, it's actually very difficult to know what's happened inside of this black box. And, and so there's more of a demand for, let's know what is actually happening. This inside of this black box, especially if lives that are risk or have billions of dollars are at risk and we need to be able to audit these, these algorithms. I think there's real, real interest in new technologies now that we can actually audit and know what's going on inside the box so that, you know, if the, the trolley example happens, we actually know how the machines will make their decisions. And so I think there's a lot of work to be done, a lot of opportunity, but also a lot of thought that needs to go into how we want to regulate all of this.

Speaker 2:          02:06:06       Tricky. Tricky, tricky. Yeah. Well it's going to be going to be exciting. Very, very interested to see how all these things coalesce. Right? Also you're looking at these gigantic companies, the Facebooks googles, the fangs, right? That are more and more so converging onto the same territory. To see how that resolves if it does in some fashion is also really, really exciting to me. Or how something like y Combinator just to do a little bit of inside baseball can say we are interested in this type of company or this particular aspect of engineering or fill in the blank and it's kind of steer the attention of thousands or tens of thousands of would be entrepreneurs into a particular sector or type of project is also just really interesting to think about from the the ramifications five years down the line. Right. But anyway, maybe

Speaker 4:          02:07:07       we have, I mean like I think we have so many incredible societal problems that need to be solved and I believe that the private sector is most capable of solving these problems, right? Whether it's energy or health or you know, the fact that we have so much trash. How do we solve that? How do we get clean water to people? Um, it's not just about the next social network and how do we deliver a better advertising to people. But you know, the, the beauty of, of this type of entrepreneurship is that there are huge societal problems that still need to be solved. That I think, you know, is, is a really exciting opportunity also to build great businesses around. Uh, and so I think that's, that's also what gets me up in the morning and makes me believe that that what we're doing is important work.

Speaker 3:          02:08:09       Yeah, it is important work. I don't think that sort of collective interest in self interest have to be misaligned, right? They're not mutually exclusive. You can, you can solve and there's a long history of solving public problems with private sector technologies and companies. Uh, and let me just ask a new, we, uh, we've gone a little bit longer than expected, uh, which I should have expected. Let me ask you just a few more questions and then we'll wrap up with where people can find you and learn more about what you're up to. Besides getting to, yes. Are there any books that you've given a lot as gifts or re-read a lot yourself?

Speaker 4:          02:08:56       Oh Gosh. For me, you know, right now there is, there's a couple books that I think are, are super interesting. So, um, my, the, my mentor Ted Denture Smith just wrote a book called what school could be, and this goes back to sort of education as a critical societal question. Um, how do we fix education? And what he did was he went on a 50 state tour, um, to look at schools and discover that the answers are actually already there and are incredible school teachers throughout our country are already finding solutions to teaching our kids the most important skills they need to have. And I think reading that book has not only given me hope, but also a desire to see real change in the public school education system. Um, but I think that's a really important problem for all of us to actually engage in. And so that's one book that I would really push on to other people.

Speaker 4:          02:10:04       Um, the other one that has completely on the opposite end of the spectrum, but it is a fiction book. It is, uh, by Khaled Hosseini, um, who also wrote kite runner. He wrote this book called a thousand Splendid Suns and, uh, probably one of the most beautiful books that I've read in a long time in terms of fiction writing. And I would encourage people to read it because it gives you sense of, uh, Afghanistan's incredible history, um, and the role women have played within that history. And I, I just loved that book because it just was eyeopening to me in a very different way. Um, so two very different types of books. None of them like straight forward business books, but ones that I think are meaningful for our society to read today.

Speaker 3:          02:10:55       What school could be in 1000 splendid suns. Yeah. Is there any purchase of $100 or less? It's kind of arbitrary, right? But just not a Bugatti or something that has most positively impacted your life or positively impacted your life in recent memory.

Speaker 1:          02:11:15       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:11:16       $100 or laugh.

Speaker 3:          02:11:18       Yeah, it could be. I mean, look, if it's, if it's like a foldable Kayak that you've got for 400 that's fine too. But it could be, could be anything, could be $2, could be free. It could be any recent addition to your life

Speaker 4:          02:11:30       that it's actually a foldable chair. So I go to my daughter's soccer tournaments a lot and there's this incredible foldable chair. I don't know what it's called. You can get it on Amazon, but it has this flip over sunshade that goes over your head. And for any parent who has been at a swim tournament or anything, this is life changing because oftentimes I'm just baking in the hot sun and you can be anywhere and you have your own personal tent that like folds over your head. It's been, it's like saved me on multiple weekends. My husband bought two of them. I love it.

Speaker 3:          02:12:12       Can you send me a link to that and I'll put it in the show notes if, uh, if you can track it down. So for people wondering, I'll, I'll put that in the show notes at Tim Dot. Blog slash podcast and you can, you can find this miraculous foldable chair, uh, if you could have a giant billboard anywhere with anything on it. So metaphorically speaking, getting up a word, a quote, a message, a question, anything out to millions or billions of people can't be an advertisement. What might you put on that billboard?

Speaker 4:          02:12:45       Wow. Hmm. I wonder if it's like not losing does not equal winning. So one of my, one of my themes these days, I like that. Yeah. And I think actually finding your world class life, it's probably the other one that I would think about. We'll give you find your work worldclass life. And I think the reason for that is to me, everyone is capable of that. And I think oftentimes we forget it. And uh, and it, for every person it's different. That's the beauty of humanity. So

Speaker 3:          02:13:26       what do the characters for vehicle mean?

Speaker 4:          02:13:31       Oh my gosh. So it means it's a small round bell. And the reason for my parents named me that was they were originally going to name me something more like, you know, really beautiful child or you know, genius child. And my mom, my mom took one look at me when I was born and she's like, no, none of those. She said, your face was so perfectly round when you were born. It reminded me of this bike perfectly round bell.

Speaker 3:          02:14:09       And I'm like,

Speaker 4:          02:14:10       mom, like all these other friends that I have, especially Chinese friends are like super intelligent, like world class dominating dictator for life. CEO, child, you know, and I'm like small bell.

Speaker 3:          02:15:45       good enough reason. A audacious, audacious, yes. Uh, audacious, aggressive but still the mother of dragons, there is a nurturing mother. Like there is den mother quality to him,

Speaker 4:          02:16:03       the Mama Bear, you know, I'll, I'm very protective, but also I'm going to push my kids and the people around me to be the best they can be.

Speaker 3:          02:16:13       Just don't get in. Don't get in between the mother and the cub. Good guideline. And I will say for anybody who's wondering, what would it be like to just go sort of motto Amano with an I would say, you know, you're one of the few people I would put Sam Harris in this category where if you, if you are willing to engage in at like eight, eight public debate with either of you, you just have to make sure that you have practice defending it against having your face ripped off and like the most logical complimentary way possible.
