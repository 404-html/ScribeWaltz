Speaker 1:          00:00          Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism living.

Speaker 2:          00:23          This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for tuning in. This episode is a followup and an experimental episode. Each of these interviews they're typically interviews, consists of me trying to deconstruct a world class performer, whether they be an investor, a chess prodigy and athlete or otherwise. To pull out the tips and tricks that you can use. A recent episode that with Pavel Tsatsouline who is an elite physical training instructor. He's been involved with training the spit nos, the elite Soviet special forces units, also the Marine Corps Secret Service Navy seals. Uh, he did an episode that ended up being a masterclass in strength training and it was so popular that we decided to do a round two on this. Round two in both of these can be listened to independently, consists of the most popular 15 questions as voted up by hundreds of you.

Speaker 2:          01:24          So hundreds of you submitted questions voted on them. The top 15 which covered just about everything you can imagine are those that Pavel we'll be answering in this episode. One piece of housekeeping, if you are looking for business mentorship in 2015 and you would like an all expense paid trip to Necker island, that's Sir Richard Branson's private island on a private jet to be mentored by yours. Truly Sir Richard Branson and a handful of other folks. You can get all of the details and they are very cool details@shopify.com forward slash Tim, that's shopify.com forward slash Tim and if you miss the first interview with Pavle, you can search his name, p a v e l and my name and it will be one of the first few results on Google or go to four hour workweek.com forward slash Pavle Pav, l all spelled out and you can find everything including all the links and resources mentioned in that episode. Without further ado, here is round to the Q and a by popular demand with Pavel Tsatsouline.

Speaker 3:          02:29          Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my pleasure to be speaking to Tim Ferriss audience again. You have asked me a number of questions, excellent questions. And uh, I will answer us on them today. Many of the questions had to do with nutrition. It is not my specialty, so I will not be answering them with one exception. The question by Carl from Indiana on the podcast, you asked Pavle if he had tricks regarding the challenges of eating for hypertrophy and he said he would mention them, but you guys never had time to circle back. Well, Carl, to put on muscle, it's a very costly proposition for your body to put it on in, to keep it, it takes a lot of energy. It takes a lot of plastic resources and the buddies very reluctant to add muscle, especially past a certain point. So you must convince it that food is not only available, the food is abundant, the food is overly abundant. So the tactic used by number of lifters, top lifters like Kirk Kolasky to get themselves past a sticking point and keep putting muscle on was to add a feeding in the middle of the night. That's right. You just get some food, a solid food or liquid food, high protein food on your nightstand, something that you wouldn't mind, uh, gagging down and in the middle of the night you just throw it down the hatch. Nobody's said it would be easy and uh, nobody said it would be health.

Speaker 3:          04:07          Mikey from Dublin is wondering what is the optimal way to combine strength training and high it for training. Obviously there are many ways of doing that, but if we were to look for the minimalist approach, simply focusing most of your energy on doing sets of five, when you do a set of five as confirmed, both by research and experience in the trenches gives you the best of both worlds, delivers muscle and delivers strength bar to you, Mikey and muscle too. The next question is from, and pardon me if I'm not pronouncing the name correctly, Josue led desmo from New York City. What would be the 80 20 training method to build strength and overall fitness? The answer is without any doubt correct kettlebell training.

Speaker 3:          05:01          When one tries to develop all fitness components, strength, endurance, flexibility, power, using the same modality, usually he ends up with a whole lot of compromises by the kettle bell when used correctly for some reason allows you to avoid this problem and develop all these components to a high level. We even have an expression in the Kettlebell world that what the hell effect. Let's say that you're doing kettlebell exercises and suddenly you'd go out and test yourself at something, have not been practicing and it turns out you can do more pull ups. You can walk with, they have your weight much faster. You can lift heavier weight off the ground. That's the what the hell effect. And uh, there are a number of Soviet studies in the eighties confirming that and in the last several years there've been a number of studies done in the West as well and you can find them on pub med. Now speaking of specific training program, I recommend three highest yield exercises that also have the steepest learning curve. They are the one arm swing, the getup and the goblet squat. Just do this reaction sizes that were referred to as a program minimum every day. And uh, I guarantee that you're going to get a great return on your investment.

Speaker 4:          06:30          Okay.

Speaker 3:          06:31          The next question is from Jdk from San Francisco. You mentioned the podcast that prior to strength training you need proper alignment. I struggled with this one side is shorter than the other and a weaker than the other. What can I doctor, should I see and what steps should I take? First of all, find a sports sports doctor or chiropractor who is an athlete and the lifter and works with athletes and lifters. It's a very important step. My personal rule is I would never go to a chiropractor who dead lifts less than I do. And after that, I suggest that you find yourself an fms certified specialist, fms or functional movement screen. You can read about it in the four hour body. Greg Cook is the Osr and uh, it's a terrific system for assessing your symmetry and helping you improve your performance.

Speaker 4:          07:28          Okay.

Speaker 3:          07:29          Jeffrey. John from Edmonton, Alberta is writing any tips for developing conditioning are appreciate it.

Speaker 3:          07:38          Let's start with the efficiency. That means posture and relaxation. If your head is sticking forward, your running speed and endurance is going to be compromised. The same thing can be said about your gas in the ring. So work on your posture. Relaxation in the Soviet Union, it was a standard practice for all kids in grade school to practice relaxation exercises. And it's the same practice that stayed with all the athletes all the way to the Olympics. So these exercises are very simple. They pretty much mean shaking your muscles out. So start shaking you arms, shaking your legs, vibrate him, and imagine that you're trying to shake water off your limbs and practicing these exercises regularly between sets of your, uh, strength exercises during your athletic practice is going to go a very long way towards making you more enduring and making it faster as well.

Speaker 4:          08:42          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          08:42          Uh, Arctic, you're a type of running is going to help you with being more relaxed and more enduring. Just go out on a run without looking the clock and focus and being as relaxed as possible and go as far as possible while being as relaxed as possible. And uh, as you keep doing that, eventually all you'll have to do is just add some gas and you're going to run faster. Next item would be strengthening your respiratory muscles or breathing muscles. Research tells us that the metabolites from your respiratory muscles, which means all the waste products from this muscles, makes the blood vessels in your limbs get constricted. So think about it this way. You start sucking wind and then as if it wasn't bad enough already, you get this extra punishment of the plumbing in your legs start shutting down. So the same research tells us that strengthening your respiratory muscles is going to increase your endurance by preventing this reflexive Vasa constriction.

Speaker 3:          10:02          How do we do that? In Our kettlebell practice, we do something called the biomechanical breathing match. So let's say we were performing as set of swings on the way down. We sharply inhale into the abdomen through the nose. So you're inhaling against the resistance of your muscles and against the resistance of the weight and on the way up you're forcefully exhaling as if you're striking. That's called the biomechanical breathing match. So that's how we strengthen our breathing muscles. Then there is such a thing as the breathing discipline. Uh, breathing ladder is a very effective technique developed bottom of my colleagues rob Lawrence. Let's say this, you're doing a set of swings, kettlebell swings, or a sprint. Any type of an exercise that makes you gassed, decide that you're going to rest from this set to the next according to a certain number of breaths. So let's say you get to do five breaths until the next set, and this is going to discipline you to slow your breathing down, slow your physiology down, stop panicking.

Speaker 3:          11:17          That's also going to help with your endurance. One more thing to say is, uh, you can develop mitochondria and your fast twitch fibers, which is going to enable them to be much more enduring, to be able to use oxygen in the podcast. I already mentioned building up slow fibers that already come equipped with Mitochondria, but you can also build these mitochondria oxygen using mitochondria into the existing fast fibers. So how do we do that? We do that by exerting the muscle's very powerfully for a very short period of time, typically 10, 15 seconds, and after that resting actively for a fairly long time. So a rest work to rest ratio may be as uh, as high as one to five or even one to six. That might mean that you would do a ten second effort followed by 50 seconds of rest. It seems quite easy, but, uh, until you realize that you have to maintain that power output every time, very high maximum power output. And you have to do this up to eventually up to 40 sets. That's another, the protocols by professor silly Yana so arrest actively between this sets, which means kind of move around, jog lightly, uh, shake your muscles out the way. I told you to do this earlier, and you can do this couple of times a week or eventually you can even do this possibly every day.

Speaker 3:          13:01          Tyler EHC from New Jersey is asking you, talk a bit in the interview with Tim about how important it is in exercise sports in life to be able to switch yourself on and off. What are your favorite techniques for making this rapid, efficient and achievable by anyone? It's true that most people exist between the on and the off switch and they're unable to really turn on to put out high power. They are unknown enabled to really switch off and enjoy some rest or just have some endurance. So there's several things that you can do. One hour to mentioned is those uh, relaxation exercises, fast and loose exercises, just shake your limbs. And other technique that you could use is a, it's an old technique called Jacobson's per progressive relaxation training. It pretty much means lying down and then progressively tensing all your muscles and then relaxing them in a, in a particular order that makes you aware of the tension and then makes you release the tension through all the day.

Speaker 3:          14:11          And during your training, you should be particularly aware of your facial tension because that takes a lot of effort and it does drain you. So be impassive meditation, breathing exercises from Yoga, from Cathay and so on. Definitely very helpful. One of the comes to turning yourself on. The first thing you can do is do a proper set of morning exercises. So I've had to research decades ago established that if you do at pleasant, not exhausting a series of exercises in the morning, just some sort calisthenics, joint rotations, arm swings, whatever you will accelerate, you will accelerate your ability to perform at a high level by a couple hours. So you will reach that peak of performance early in the morning as opposed to waiting for it later and later throughout the day. Your ability to, uh, access that performance is going to be greater as well. Back to breathing practices. There are some special exercises in, uh, some oriental practices like Cathay.

Speaker 3:          15:22          There's the bookie breathing that helps you to turn yourself on, get some more power, get some more aggression. I strongly recommend one book to the book is called Psych by Dr Bai's Soto. Doctor Dad buys Soto by his own admission, looked like a 11 year old stamp collector, and yet he proceeded to began one of the most successful power lifters in history at the age of 44 after back surgery, he's squatted over 600 pounds at body weight of one 32 which is absolutely amazing and he achieved that ability largely through his mental training, jogged reached the point where he would wait for his attempt as other lifters are waiting for their attempts. Judd would be just sleeping and then just a couple of minutes before the attempt, his coach would wake him up, he would get up, he would work himself into a frenzy. He would go out, lift a record, and then just go back to sleep.

Speaker 3:          16:29          Now that's an amazing control of your on switch and you're off switch. The title of the book again is psych by Dr Judd Baez. Soto, spelled B. I A. S. O. T. T. O. Josh Elbaz from Montreal is asking, what's the quickest way to improve a strict barbell military press from three quarters of your body weight to body weight? Given that my grip and abs are already strong, Russian weightlifters have a saying to press a lot. You must press a lot. The press responds exception, the wealth through a high volume of training. What does it mean typically 20 to 50 reps per session three times a week. That's a lot of presses. All these presses are done in low repetitions, one to five more typical to three and four, but one to five. That's the range. And you never go to a failure. So typically you stay with one third to two thirds of your Max Reps. So what does it mean? It means that if you're able to do 10 reps with that weight, you should really only be doing three to six repetitions. So one more time to press a lot. You must press a lot.

Speaker 3:          18:01          Could you elaborate a neurological strengths? Please? Asks. Reimagined. Yes. From Miami, Florida. Think of your muscles as a six cylinder engine. And right now you are firing only on three cylinders. You could get stronger by adding several more cylinders and that'll be hypertrophy or you could fix that engine and learn how to take advantage of the cylinders you already do have. That's the essence of neurological strength training. Pretty much what you do is you learn how to activate your muscles more intensely. It's done by training with low repetitions is done by training with heavier weights. It's done by a perfect practice. Approaching your training, not as a workout, but as a practice.

Speaker 3:          18:56          Nick m from Erie, Pennsylvania is asking in the podcast, it's mentioned that to build strengths you shouldn't go to failure. How do you know when to add more weight if you're not going to failure? And Kaelin from Denver as a similar question, you need to use your perceived rate of exertion. So on the scale of one to 10 let's say that your typical sets takes you eight units of effort and you were staying with this weight and couple of weeks from now lifting the same weight takes six or seven units of effort. You know that you've gotten stronger. Kid from San Francisco is asking what is the best way to gain strength as you get older, his book power to the people espoused heavy lifts but going on 39 years old, I'm finding that this routine is way all cabs way too hard on my joints. Step one, go get your joints checked by a doctor. Step two, get your head in the right place. My father is 77 years old and he's done lifting or for a hundred pounds without a belt and he does not think himself as old.

Speaker 4:          20:15          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          20:16          Dylan from Los Angeles is wondering when does the five minute rest between sets apply, when does it not? There are three types of rest intervals. There is ordinary stress and stimulating an ordinary interval allows you to pretty much recover your performance level by the time the next set rolls around and that's roughly three to five minutes as stress interval I accumulated fatigue. So the more sense you, the more tired you get and finalists stimulating interval allows you to perform better in the next set and then may take 12 minutes or so. So unless your training program says otherwise, just go with the ordinary interval at about three to five minutes.

Speaker 3:          21:09          Trey from Denver, Colorado is asking, the army still has sit ups in the physical fitness test, any advice and training in maximizing the repetitions. First, get your abs strong, really strong. That means three to five sets of three to five reps with three to five minutes in between of an exercise that puts a lot of tension on your abdominal muscles. That could be strict hanging leg raises. That can be, uh, the abdominal wheel, that can be strict weighted sit ups. So once you've gotten that strength, then just do a very minimal practice of your repetitions set up test and you'll have no problem.

Speaker 4:          21:56          Okay.

Speaker 3:          21:58          Swash from Columbus, Ohio is asking, I know the deadlift is one of the best exercises, but I've gotten terrible back spasms from doing it. Is it my form? Can I have proximity? They deadlifts effects with something else that doesn't possibly injure me. Step one, see a duck and lifting doc. Find out what your restrictions and limitations are. Either you will learn that you can deadlift with proper form, possibly with some corrective exercises or you have to look for an alternative. If the answer to the deadlift is yes, then find a coach, a good power lifting coach and learn how to do trite. If the answer is no as good doctor for some other suggestions, ask your doc above the Kettlebell swing. Very often people who are not able to lift heavy barbells are able to safely do the Kettlebell swing. H F VK from Norway who appears to be a personal trainer is asking how would you go about building the discipline required to be great in a client? Stop treating people you're training as clients, hair salons of clients. A client is somebody who's passively receiving a service. You want them to think of themselves as students and you want to treat them as students.
