Speaker 2:          00:37          I think this attitude I can flat out before my hands start to shake. I'm a cybernetic organism living does show what metal endoskeleton. Does religion play

Speaker 1:          00:59          a large part in your life right now

Speaker 3:          01:02          in a certain sense? Not in a kind of a ritual success. I just wrote a book called what technology wants

Speaker 1:          01:07          excellent book. I highly recommend it.

Speaker 3:          01:11          Theory of, of technology. And I was trying to put technology in the context of the cosmos. So I think what religion gives me his permission to think about cosmic questions. I'm right in the middle of finishing a Kickstarter funded graphic novel that's about angels and robots. And the intention there was to fictionalize the idea that robots would some days have souls, but these souls would be coming from angels. And so that there was this intersection of these two and if possible worlds of conscious robots who were in, sold by angels and, and the, and the reason why this was sort of interesting was that the idea was that, um, the angels that insole us have been trained, they had been given moral guidance, but if you don't give the spirits and kind of moral guidance than they can wreck havoc. And so it was this idea that when we make robots, we're actually going to have to train them to be ethical.

Speaker 3:          02:10          We can't make a free being and not train it. So it was a way to rehearse and think about some of the consequences of technology today. So I think my religion gives me permission to ask those questions without embarrassment to say, well, um, what is the general direction of the arc of evolution? What is it pointed somewhere? How does technology fit into the greater cosmos? What does it mean? What drives it? Why is there more of it? Is this a good thing? And so I think having a kind of, I consider this kind of an other view. So I have, uh, other view, the, I'm sympathetic to other world views. I don't necessarily have to believe all the other world's you'd, but I get the idea that if you have an another world view that can be very helpful in seeing other worldviews. So people have a worldview, even though they don't know it. But I have a review and I know that I ever, I mean, really everybody has a religious or a spiritual orientation. Even if they're atheists, they still have one. And so there are some assumptions that are at the basis of it. And I like to question assumptions, including my own assumption.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Two things I can't resist asking and we can spend as much or as little time on this as you'd like. But recently grappling with a lot of these issues of that I've been grappling with, some of which are existential, some which are related to death, limited time on the planet. I've become deeply fascinated by indigenous use of plant medicine. And I've had some very transformative experiences that are difficult to put into words because they make you sound like a complete crazy person. But yeah, there's a somethingness that is a very difficult to communicate without sounding like you should be institutionalized. What do you think the role for people who aspire to do the greatest good in the world, what is the role of that type of direct experience and is it possible to benefit from that type of, for lack of a better descriptor, spiritual experience without a religious framework around it?

Speaker 3:          04:33          Yeah, no, it's, it's a really good question. So my little personal story there, of course the, I was basically, that was basically hippie or worked for the hippie catalog and [inaudible] catalog, which was about hippies living in San Francisco. And, um, all my friends were drug taking hippies, but I for some reason never did. I just had no appetite or inclination at all for ever taking any drugs or smoking pot or anything. And when I was 50 years old, I decided that I would like to, to take Lsd sacramentally on my 50th birthday. And I did and I arranged with, uh, had a guide and I had appropriate setting and I had some acid that I came from a source that was extremely reliable and it was a sacrament and it was a very profound sacrament. And I think, yeah, you can use drugs and recreationally and for entertainment and I think that can go somewhere.

Speaker 3:          05:30          But I think there was another powerful use of it, which is kind of what you're talking about it, which is to elevate one outside of yourself, to lose yourself, to be in contact with other things beyond your ego. And I think it can be done. And I think unfortunately because of the illegal status that we've had for a long time, the rituals and the practice around that have not had chance to be developed or communicated. Actually trying to find this information. It was extremely hard. It was one book that I did find eventually from a guy who was doing LSD experiments while they were still legal and was able to accumulate enough wisdom about it that that would be the one place I would point people to. But I think it is important that the context and expectations and the, the setting they call it, that that revolves around it is very important.

Speaker 3:          06:24          And I do believe that these can be extremely profound and powerful experiences for good. They can remain long after. And you know, most people who understand this and don't abuse it, understand that in fact the experience was not in the pill, was not in the chemical. It was a real experience. And so unfortunately there's so much other stuff circulating around the use of these drugs and the misuse of them that, that it kind of information is often very, very difficult to find. But I do think maybe we're seeing a moment now in the u s where the second prohibition is being undone and at least pot will become legal and maybe we can return to revitalizing the traditions and the necessary, uh, settings are around that and expectation that I'm not just potter LC, but even other synthetic drugs can be extremely powerful in removing the, um, ordinary guards that we have.

Speaker 3:          07:31          And when we have an ego for on purpose, we have all these things to keep us sane in a day to day. Um, functional exactly. Standpoint. Yeah. Right. And so if you remove a completely, you can become dysfunctional, but if you remove it deliberately and with great care, you can be opened up. And I think it's that, you know, I think there's an expertise there. I think there's a lot of other things that, that, that, um, if we have the freedom and the wisdom to not abuse it, I think it can be extremely powerful. Do you recall the title of the book? Okay. So this is, or how people might search for him? Yes. So this is, uh, one of the many resources that I recommend in my book. Cool tools and cool tools is a big catalog of possibilities. It has about 1500 different items. A lot of them are kind of like handles, you know, pliers and the grape cordless drill.

Speaker 3:          08:23          But it's much farther than that. And I include things like, what if you wanted to have a psychedelic experience that was transformative. What do you do? And I would recommend this book or, or I mean there's lots of other things in it, but the, I don't actually have the book in front of me. I should, I think it's called. Um, I don't remember. It's okay. I will, uh, I show notes. We will list it as the right one. And there's also a little tiny book that came from England. There was a cartoon guide that gave of a street, an unjudgemental view of all the different drugs that were, and what each one kind of did in Denton. What the plus and minuses are without, you know, recommending or forbidding them. It was just saying this, this is what it is. That information also, believe it or not is really in short supply. It's like, you know, what do you do with this and how's it work and tell me the facts. I don't need to hear a lecture either way, like whether this is great or this is terrible, but just tell me what what's going on. As, as you know, I mean that kind of information sometimes is extremely in short supply,

Speaker 1:          09:26          it's very difficult to find information that isn't politicized. Yeah, inaccurate or like you said, so shrouded in either fear or irrational optimism that it's almost intelligible and certainly generally useless. We'll put those books in the show notes for people. I want to come back to one thing you said far, far earlier and that was related to the pieces that you tried to give away that eventually wouldn't die and came back. Were there any common threads, any patterns in those pieces that that you can pick out as being sort of a uniquely Kevin Kelly theme if for lack of a better term?

Speaker 3:          10:08          One of the things that I discovered in my six months of trying to live as if I was going to die in six months. Because as I was coming closer to that date, which happened to be Halloween, October 31st it was I kept cutting off my future. I mean maybe like you, I kind of tend to live in the future of much more than path. I'm always imagining I'm saving this for something, that I'm going to do this and I'm kind of looking forward, I'm going to do this here. And so I was very much in the future and then something that future was being cut down day by day. I was like, and I was thinking like, why am I taking pictures, taking the photographs because I'm not going to be here in another two months or something. So, so there was all these things that I'm kind of cutting out and as I was cutting them out, I had this realization, which was the thing I took away from this thing, which was that I was becoming less human.

Speaker 3:          10:59          That to be fully human, we have to have a future. We have to look forward to the future. That is part of us is looking into the future. And so after I came out of the, and I kind of embrace that and saying, well you know that future forward facing, that's what I do. That's what, that's what I want to do. And that's what I write about. And in thinking about the future, one of the things that is very hard, because the paradox about the future is that there are lots of impossible things that happen all the time. And if someone from the a hundred years from now would come back and tell us things, there's a lot of stuff we've just not going to believe this. It's like that's just, that's crazy. It's just like if we went back a hundred years and told them what was going on now they would say, you know, that's just not going to happen.

Speaker 3:          11:44          I mean we could even go back 20 years. I can go back 20 years and say we're going to have like Google street views of all the cities of the world and we're going to have, you know, and it's like a PD this for free, this edited by anybody. You know, I was like, they would say, you know, there's no way I would tell them, you know, most of it's for free. They were saying there is no economic model in the world that allow for that and there isn't. But here it is. So the dilemma is, is there any true forecast about the future is going to be dismissed any future that is believable. Now it's going to be wrong. And still you're stuck in this. Like if people believe it is wrong, if they don't believe it, you know, where does it get you? You're just missing.

Speaker 3:          12:28          So there was this very fine line between saying something that is right on the edge of plausibility at the same time, right on the edge of having a chance of being true. And what I discovered that was helpful and trying to get away from the kind of assumptions that binus had, just kind of extrapolate was to think laterally, was to go sideways. One thing, just take whatever was everybody knew and say, well, what if that wasn't true? A good example of that or an example like everyone says, okay, Moore's law will continue Moore's law. It didn't continue. What would that mean? What would happen,

Speaker 1:          13:09          and you can maybe I could say for the audience, but I'll just say even to remind me, Moore's law is what does it every 18 months, the the size and cost of technology will decrease by 50% something along those lines. Let's say even worse, there's speed involved as well,

Speaker 3:          13:25          right? More than it does say that, but, but let's say subbing. Right now we live in a world where every year the technology is better and cheaper. What if that wasn't true? What if every year starting like, you know, couple years from now stuff was better but more expensive. That's, that's a completely different world, right? Everyone assumes that things are going to get better and cheaper. Well, what if that wasn't true? So you can take kind of an assumption that, again, that's something that no one's really examining like, uh, well, one of the things I write about is the fact that we're going to have a population implosion globally, that the global population will drastically reduce in a hundred years from now. We'll have less population far, far, far less than we have right now. And so,

Speaker 1:          14:10          all right, I have to bite it. That what, because I've thought a lot about this and the a, what would they call it? The Mel Malthusian dilemmas. Is that going to be, do you think pandemic related, nuclear weapon related, all of the above? None of those. None of those, no. Ai Coming into the, the rise of the machines? No.

Speaker 3:          14:28          Okay. It's just pure demographics. So if you look at the current trends in fertility rates in all the developed countries everywhere, except for the u s they're already either below replacement level. So replacement level of means that you just sustaining the population just replaces itself. If it's below, it means that there's, it was getting less and less. So Japan, all of these, you know, Europe, they're all below replacement. The U S is an exception because of only because of immigration.

Speaker 1:          15:02          Got It.

Speaker 3:          15:03          Where people coming in, otherwise we would be there and it just would not be any news to anybody. But the real news of people would point a developing world. But you know, Mexico is now aging faster than the u s China is aging faster because of their one child policy. Of course, Japan is this completely is there a way underwater? Completely. So even the one exception is Subsahara Africa. And there's really a kind of debate right now about how fast or whether they're slowing down, but generally around the world, South America, the rest of Asia, the rate and fertility continues to drop. And here's the thing is that the demographic transition that is happening everywhere where people become urban. And so every forecast shows the urbanity the certification of the population continuing. And I can't think of any counter force to stop these huge migration at the scale that we're seeing into the city.

Speaker 3:          16:00          And as that happens, the birth rates dropped down. And even in places like Singapore or other places where they have taken very, very active countermeasures of cash for having kids and daycare forever bonuses, none of these work in terms of actually trying to raise fertility levels. So you have to understand that to go above replacement level, the average woman has to have 2.1 kids. Well that means it has to be tons and tons of women who have three or four kids make up for those. How many people do you know with that many kids, you know, living in cities and there's just not, there's not enough of them. So, and this is a projection. Some of these are you in productions, they have three, three, they have a low high and a medium and the low one is not good news because there's not a large cultural counter force for women to have three a lot, you know, a very high percentage of the publishing to have three or four kids in a modern world. And that's why the the published and continues to decrease every year.

Speaker 1:          17:10          What type of, this is perhaps a tangent, but one of the big debates in my head right now is to marry or not to marry, to have kids or not to have kids. I never thought those would even be questions in my mind and yet here I am in and now they are. What are your thoughts on having children? What type of people? This is very broad but should have children or shouldn't have children. Whichever way of answering is easier or how to even think about that question.

Speaker 3:          17:38          I think people who are privileged of which you are should have children because you can bestow so many privileges and opportunities to your children and if the world has to be populated, why not populate it with children who have as many opportunities as possible. I also say from my own experience of growing up one of many kids and having, well I have three kids. Uh, one of my other regrets in life is not having a fourth, but we were just, we started a little bit too late and we were unable to have a fourth but all my kids with that we had a fourth to, and I would say that as a gift to your kids to have more than one. And I know that from hanging out in shiner where so many kids grew up only children and this really, really miss that there is a total gift of the siblings and brothers to each other.

Speaker 3:          18:29          That is really very profound. And there is also, I know from my friends who have had lots of kids that there is a tremendous amount of teaching from the, the older to the younger and that's a lot of what they've learned. And that the uh, curve of the amount of energy that you have to expand actually after three, it doesn't really matter in terms of the parents. Got It. I have one friend who has nine kids and I have another friend who has seven. Wow. And basically how do they do that? Well, the older kids, we're helping to parent the younger kids. That's the only way that it really works. But there's actually basically they have, you know, they have five parents instead of having two parents.

Speaker 1:          19:10          Right. It's very traditional in a way. I mean traditional meaning reaching back thousands or tens of thousands of years.

Speaker 3:          19:15          It is of course in the old days, maybe a 12 born, but they rarely had 12 kids survive. Right. So that actually is a very recent or I mean as far as like, it's like the 18 hundreds kind of onward. I hang out with the Amish a lot and they still have these very large families and they all survived. So they have kind of, in some sense it's sort of an unnatural expansion. And one of my predictions, again going back to kind of like the assumptions, one of my predictions is that, you know, in America in a hundred years from now or whatever it is, there'll be, um, the complete countryside is run by the Amish. The Amish take over the entire countryside because they never sell and they have like eight kids. And then there are always people living in the cities and it's like everybody's happy. You know, you were all living in the drive out to the Amish lands. It's just fantastic. And uh, they're very happy, you know, doing their thing and running the farms. And so I had been predicting for years that dom, which would come in and start buying upstate New York. And that's exactly what they're doing right now.

Speaker 1:          20:11          Why do you spend so much time with the Amish? This is news to me, but very, very interesting. And how long has that been going on

Speaker 3:          20:17          for awhile.

Speaker 1:          20:19          And does your beard have anything? Is there any relation to the Amish?

Speaker 3:          20:23          I had the beard before my interest in the armory show. I'll show you some pictures when I was 19 years old. I do have those that don't know I have an Amish beard, which means that I have a beard without a mustache. The reason why the Amish don't have mustaches that was at the time that they were kind of adopting or dress code, the mustache was all military men and mustaches. And so they were very anti military. They refuse to serve in the, they don't even vote, but so it was there kind of rejection of the military by shaving off their mustache. I hang out with the Amish because their adoption of technologies is like seems to us totally crazy because first of all they're not Luddites complete hackers. They love hacking technology. They have something called how much electricity, which is basically pneumatics. The lot of these farms have a big diesel, they don't have electricity, but they have a big diesel generator in the barn that pumps up this compressor, that sense high pressure air tubes and tubing into their barn, into the homes and so they have converted like their sewing machine washing machine and stuff to nomadic.

Speaker 3:          21:30          Okay. Seems like a bit of a sidestep of the word of God. Exactly. So we'll have the, we'll have horse drawn buggies and horse drawn farm implements and the horses will be pulling this diesel generated combine and you're thinking, what are they doing? Okay. Right. But in fact, if you look at our own lives, and I've done this many times, I can ask you Tim, or you can ask me. There'll be some weird thing like we don't have TV in our house, but I've got internet. It's like, well, what is that about? Right? So we all have these things, but here's the difference is the Amish do it collectively. They're very selective. They're selecting their technology collectively as a group. And secondly, they have to articulate because they're doing collectively, you have to articulate what their criteria is. A lot of us are adopting you try this.

Speaker 3:          22:20          We tried that. We don't have any kind of like logic or reason or theory or framework for why we're doing stuff. It's just, it's just one a parade of stuff. But the Amish have a very particular criteria and their criteria is there are two things that they're looking for, the main thing they want to do, and the main reason why they have all these restrictions like horse and buggy and all this stuff, is that they want to have these communities, very strong communities. And so they noticed that if you have a car, that you'll drive out and shop somewhere out of the community or you go to church somewhere out in the community or whatever it is. But if you have a horse and Buggy, you can go and he 15 miles. And so everything has to happen your entire life. You have to support the community.

Speaker 3:          23:02          You have a community within 15 miles, you have to visit the sick and you have to shop locally. So you're shopping with your neighbors. So when a new technology comes along and they say, will this strength in our local community or send us out? And then the second thing that they're looking at is with families. So the goal of the typical Amish man or women is to have every single meal with their children for every meal or lives until they leave home. They have breakfast, they have lunch, and they have dinner. So breakfast and lunch is that they go to one room schoolhouse and they peddle back for lunch that their parents had with them. And that means that the businesses are ideally in their backyard. So they have, they have a lot of like shops and stuff. If they're not a farmer and they have a backyard shop, which is actually has to be kind of clean ish because it is in their backyard, right?

Speaker 3:          23:52          It's like not my, well it is in their backyard. So they really are, you know, they really want, I'm sure that there of metal working shops and stuff would say really try to keep nontoxic and work because it's in their backyard. And so that means that they can come home for lunch. They have breakfast and lunch, so they're there on the premises and they have every single meal with their children until they leave. And so they say, well, what does technology allow us to do that will help us do that? Or will it work against that? And then like right now they're, they've been deciding whether to accept cell phones are not, even though they don't have landline phones. So they're basically, they're going to, well, some of them are going to accept cell phones and they do that by, there's always some Amish early adopter who's trying things and they say, okay, Ivan Bishop says you can. He had to get permissions is you can try this, but we're watching you. We're going to see what effect this has on your family, on your community. You have to be ready to give it up anytime we say that it's not working and they do this on a kind of, Paris by Paris is very decentralized and so they try out always trying out new technologies and they're always looking to see does this strengthening the families is a strengthening the communities? If not, we don't want it.

Speaker 1:          25:03          What have you. I have two questions. I guess the first is since you're normally, as I understand it, based on the west coast and northern California, how do you get out to the Amish or is there a separate community closer by and then secondly, what have you incorporated into your own life or your, you're on family that originated from the Amish.

Speaker 3:          25:22          Yeah. So I don't get to see them as often as it went. But actually it was when I go east, I have some contacts that I will exercise and um, I would try to get, like to stay overnight and go to church and a buggy or something. And this is Pennsylvania, but, well actually Pennsylvania is the heart of it. But actually there are more communities in Ohio where my brother lives in Iowa. There's a lot more happening in New York, so, so the, the Pennsylvania or the kind of ground zero, but in fact they're bigger, more extensive communities outside of Pennsylvania.

Speaker 1:          25:58          I didn't realize that. Yeah, the Amish Diaspora,

Speaker 3:          26:01          it is what I'm saying. They literally are just buying up farmland there. They're expanding, they're constantly expanding. They have a very small attrition rate. Very large families. They all are buying a, basically they're buying farms and stuff for their, for their children and they never sell. And so they also don't, he move into areas as a, they have a minimum number of families that we need to move in at once. But what did I learn from the, well, one of the things that we had, particularly when we had younger kids was kind of technological sabbaticals or satisfy, I should say. And I've now seen other families who aren't even, um, you know, aren't even religious. Adopt that same thing, which is once a week you take a break from either, you could define it however you want it to screen or the keyboard or, or, or connectivity or something and you step back and you do that.

Speaker 3:          26:57          Not because it's like terrible or poisoned, but because it's so good. You know, there's lots of people were kind of like, they're going to drop out from Twitter or they're kind of like, oh, this is like a toxin I got to get detoxed or something. I think that's entirely wrong way to think about it is you want to take brace and it's not because they're toxic, but because they're are so good. It's like you want to step back so that you can reenter it and with a renewed perspective with a renewed appreciation, with having spent time looking at it a different way. And I think that kind of rhythm of having sabbaths and then yearly Sabbat, uh, vacations, wherever, retreats and then every seven years or whatever it is, you take a, um, a true sabbatical. I think that kind of rhythmic disconnection or Sabbath I think is very powerful. It's something that, that works very well and it was something that we had in our family.

Speaker 1:          27:49          I take Saturdays off as it turns out, as my screenless day, I really, I really try to make that a weekly occurrence and it's incredible the, yeah, the, the effect that, that it has this sort of galvanizing effect of just a mere 24 hours. Not even that, if you just consider the waking hours every seven years, a vacation or sabbatical of how long in your case or your family's guys?

Speaker 3:          28:10          Yeah. Partly because my wife actually is granted a sabbatical from the company she works for, which is Genetec. It was one of the few companies that actually have a official sabbatical for all other researchers at least. And it's very meager. It's six weeks. Of course, you know, a six week sabbatical is basically a European and

Speaker 1:          28:31          well, the vacation, right? You know, blackboard, American, right. It's three years,

Speaker 3:          28:39          big thing. So yeah. So we're, we're do something, do something different. So this year we're taking one and we're going to camp in national parks for one month of it. And then the other two weeks we'll go to Asia. But we haven't been to allow the national parks, I'm going to do a different kind of project and I haven't done before and we'll do some kind of car camping. We haven't really done a big road trip like that. So it's all new for us.

Speaker 1:          29:03          What is the longest in the last few years that you've gone without checking email?

Speaker 3:          29:07          Oh, probably two weeks. And in China.

Speaker 1:          29:13          How do you manage that? Well, but it was like, I just, I was unable

Speaker 3:          29:19          bigger that because China was blocking Google

Speaker 1:          29:23          makes, makes it, makes it more challenging.

Speaker 3:          29:26          And I was in, um, I was in some remote places and so even the connection was hard, but it was like they weren't, uh, they weren't letting me get it. I'm not a mobile person. My first smart phone was an iPhone five and um, I still not using it properly. I use it for phone call.

Speaker 1:          29:45          Yeah. I don't, I don't use my iPhone as an input device either. I just, yeah, it just drives me nuts.

Speaker 3:          29:51          Can't type. When I travel, I liked it to leave everything. I spent a lot of my time sitting in front of a computer. I'm kind of like the Zen, you know, walk walks. It's it, the wobble. So like I'm here, I'm like really online. And then when I leave this studio, I don't want to be connected at all and I won't be, and I'm not checking email, I'm not checking this other stuff. And I can go days. Typically I'll go days without choking, even in the u s if I'm traveling. And then if I'm overseas I will go probably a three or four days before I get the email. That's pretty typical.

Speaker 1:          30:26          Do you, um, let me shift gears just a little bit. I'm looking at looking at long now. Dot Org. Eric Command, everybody take a look at it. The long now foundation and humans are generally, I would say pretty bad at thinking longterm. Uh, certainly when it comes to habit change, very, very high failure rate with longterm incentives. You're going to get diabetes in 20 years for instance as opposed to you'll have more sex if you have a six pack when it comes to diet. But the long now foundation, I just want to read a few things on this website for people. So the long now foundation was established in 1996 written as zero one nine nine six two creatively foster, long longterm thinking and responsibility in the framework of the next 10,000 years. Then you have the 10,000 year clock, which is a monument scale, multimillion. Yael, all mechanical clock is an icon to longterm thinking.

Speaker 1:          31:13          The Rosetta Project building an archive of all documented human languages, long bets. Featured bed is here, Warren Buffet, protege partners and LLC see a public arena for enjoyable competitive predictions of interest to society with philanthropic money at stake and then revive and restore, which is bringing extinct species back to life. So there is a lot here. Can you explain to people, cause I've, I've greatly enjoyed many of the seminars and speeches of the long now foundation. I'm a supporter. I suppose I've even spoken there on stage and love the email Synopsys uh, that Stewart sends out. What is the function of the long now foundation when, what is the value?

Speaker 3:          31:53          The Lone Alpha addition is kind of reactive is it's reacting to the very inherent short term bias that our society, particularly this technological society particularly say that Silicon Valley exhibits, which is often a focus on the next quarter or the next two quarters, the next year results needing to be immediate, you know, instant satisfaction. If something's not on Netflix streaming, we don't even wait for the DVD. It's this really kind of very fast paced short term thinking and also somewhat blinded by the fact that we don't have a lot of sense of history either. That um, we're kind of ignorant about what's happened in the past. And so the term, the long now came from Brian Eno who noticed that we have a very short now, which is like the next five minutes in the last five minutes. And so the long hours a week is an attempt to kind of expand that so that we as a society and as individuals would try to think about things at a generational or civilizational scale.

Speaker 3:          32:56          So like how about like working on something that might take longer than your own lifetime to accomplish? So you start something now, there may be make it so that it might take like the cathedrals of all it would if we were trying to make something that, you know, might need 25 years to accomplish, how can we do that? So we're trying to encourage people to think in that perspective, to take that perspective and then to maybe move in that direction. We're not necessarily saying we have to have like the a mohs foundation where we have to have like a master plan for the next hundred years and we're going to plan out the future. No, we're agnostic about what it is that people make or do. We're just saying that it would benefit having, um, thinking about the long term. And I've often heard, uh, some people, uh, who advised to counseling to individuals about kind of thinking about the longterm in your own life, even though you might want to act kind of locally and be spontaneous, but you do want you to do one to kind of keep in mind the fact that you know, you'll be around for a while, whether it's putting some savings away or working on a skill that may take some time, more than the six months or a year to acquire or you know, whatever it is that you can have both perspectives.

Speaker 3:          34:20          And so we're not attempting to get rid of the need for people to survive the need for companies to have a profit this year. We're saying there can be additional perspectives. In addition to that where we say we commit to like a sigh, a program of science research where it's a pure science and the results of the same mathematics is one of the most profound things that we can invest in. Even though most of the things in the beginning seemed to be non utilitarian. They don't have any purpose, but we know from our own history that you know, in 20 years they'll pay off in some way or other. And so being able to kind of construct a society so that we can allow the rewards of longterm investment, longterm thinking, long term perspective that would make us better civilization.
