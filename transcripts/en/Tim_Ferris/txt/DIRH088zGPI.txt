Speaker 1:          00:00          The common characteristic of the people who had the most time and the highest income is the ability to single task. So single tasking being the opposite of multitasking. So to identify the critical few objectives, separate them from the trivial many and focus exclusively on one of them to completion without interruption. Because the default mode in especially a web 2.0 user generated universe and I would include email and user generated is it's very easy to simulate forward motion without accomplishing anything. And you cannot possibly as much as we'd like to think so, uh, organize and consume the information that is presented to you. So the only option left is to cultivate this selective ignorance where you act on the most important things. So I'll, I'll, I want to hit a few concepts, a few findings that you can apply immediately and then we'll jump into Q. And.

Speaker 1:          00:58          A. So the first is a concept you may be familiar with called the 80 20 principle. Hence, you could look at a company like Ryan Air, which has some ridiculous number, like one point $4 million of profit per employee. Okay. There's a related principle called Parkinson's law, uh, which I'd like to explain briefly and then people can, can play with it. Parkinson's law indicates that a task will swell and perceived importance and complexity in direct correlation to the time that you allotted. Okay. So we generally think that if I have more time I'll do a better job. Uh, this is very, very seldom the case. So there are actually two ways that you can identify the critical few and separate them from the trivial many. Number one is to do an 80, 20 analysis with the metrics that you've chosen. And the number two is to limit the time, so to use very short deadlines.

Speaker 1:          01:52          So in essence, you're limiting the tasks to very few to limit the time invested or you're limiting the time invested to force you to focus on the critical few decreasing inputs. And increasing output I think is the easiest way to frame how we want to look at time. And, uh, there are a few ways to do that, but one of the, one of the key variables as information intake. So you can either consume information or you can focus on production and you could really can't do both at the same time. It's a one way street before you look at delegating, you can automate, but related to both of those is taking the most time consuming tasks. So there will be some that remain and really defining the process. Okay. Now this sounds like Gobbledygook tech business talk and I'll put it into concrete terms. Most people check email in very, very specific ways and email being one of the most time consuming activities.

Speaker 1:          02:48          They're afraid of outsourcing that or delegating it to someone else because I'm the only one who can check my email. Well, the fact of the matter is I get somewhere between four and 5,000 email a week. Okay. So it's, I'm pretty sure I'm at the top of the room here or at least towards the top and I have multiple email accounts and multiple people helping me. But one of my key assistants has a document called Tim Ferriss processing rules and this is a working document of explicitly how I check email. So I had to take my internal process and define it and put it on paper. What am I looking for? How do I decide which I reply to which I delete, which I postpone. How do I archive? And she has essentially a step by step guide to my cognitive process for processing email. She receives 90% of my email goes through it.

Speaker 1:          03:39          And then each day we have a call at 4:00 PM where it, she'll have the name of the person, company affiliation, what they want me to do. All the rest are details. So those are the three top disqualifiers I've taken a task that would take me well over a hundred hours a week and it drops it down to less than five minutes a day. I listened to her voicemail. As I'm typing out the email, she numbers each of the to do items. So I just do one, do this, two do this, three do this. Okay. And that's not limited to CEOs.
