Speaker 2:          00:05:54       Whitney, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. A local,

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       a local

Speaker 2:          00:05:59       Austin, Texas. Yeah, so I wanted to start at the beginning and for those people who are familiar with the, a bit of the genesis story and also the name itself. So how did bumble come to be? Why did it come to me?

Speaker 3:          00:06:15       So bumble is somewhat of a unique story in the sense that it wasn't just a singular Aha moment somewhere. It was really a response to a couple of different things in life. And then there was a little bit of serendipity involved. I had just started becoming the kind of the center of this attacking, you know, violent internet abuse and all sorts of strangers and random people online were just ripping me apart all day long in the media and in the comments sections and on Twitter. And it sounds silly to think that that could affect you. Um, but it devastated me and it made me just, it just made me so depressed and I started to realize that there was something wrong with the Internet. I started to realize that the lack of accountability on these social networks, that was a real thing and there was a real risk to that.

Speaker 3:          00:07:16       And I was, I was on, you know, I was a perfect example of how dangerous it could be. And if I at 24 who had already had somewhat, you know, successful career and had great friends and family around me and I still could barely get out of bed and I could barely see straight, I mean, it, it just, it depleted every, every ounce of confidence that I've ever, ever had. It scared me for what it would mean for a 13 year old or 14 year old or 15 year old who was in junior high going through this. Right. And so I started to really understand the danger of the internet and it was around that time that I started thinking, what am I going to do next? Because obviously I'm not going to, you know, just do nothing at 25 after being part of this really high growth startup and having this, you know, awesome exposure to so many different areas of the tech industry.

Speaker 3:          00:08:09       Um, and so I was going to start a female only social network where you could only be kind to one another, so you could only share complimentary behavior. And the thought process behind it was compliments are contagious, just like hatred is contagious. Is it going to be called mercy? Yeah. Thank you. Right. So it was, it was supposed to be a kind of social network, which had never been done. And um, it was around that time that things kind of parlayed into where we are now. Um, my now business partner on bumble, who's been a huge force and you know, bumble coming to life and, and the, the course of bumble, he, uh, tried to hire me as his CMO at his dating company. He has this huge dating company that's the match of Europe and South America. His name is Andre have and ever, right.

Speaker 3:          00:08:58       So James Bond, um, yeah, he's, he's pretty awesome. But he, he wanted me to go run marketing and is dating company and I thought he had lost his mind. Um, and so I told him what I was going to do. I'm going to start this new way, this new age of social media. And he was like, no, you're not. You're going to do that in dating with me. And I was like, you've lost your mind. Um, but we actually ended up talking through it and the more thought I gave to this new concept of a dating app that could be engineered for women by women, um, the, the need became more apparent. And so that's how I shifted from this concept of mercy into what is now bumble, which was, you know, very much similar concept if you think about it, you know, creating a brand rooted in kindness or product rooted in good behavior and really putting women in charge of that, creating the female internet.

Speaker 3:          00:09:55       And uh, that was really the beginning of bumble. It was the first name of a bumbler word, Moxie. Moxie. Yes, it was, I really wanted it to be moxie. Um, so you know, for anyone that's familiar with that word, it insinuates that someone has gall or guts and is brave. And because bumble was going to be this platform turning society on its head where women were going to make the first move, which according to society, that's not something women should do. Definitely not in dating, right? I mean, it's a tale as old as time men do that men need to go first. Um, or so society said and says, um, and so mocks who's going to be the name, but I couldn't trademark it. Why couldn't you trademark it? There's somebody else had totally trademark every corner of it. It's actually a soda somewhere. And then there's some big PR firm or some consulting agency that's trademarked the heck out of it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:50       And I couldn't do it. So how did you land on bumble than, I actually hated the name bumble at first I thought bumble. How did it occur to you? And I did not think of the name bumble. Actually. Someone on our team or early team did. And she had actually called her husband a bumbling idiot and she's got this British accent. She was like, you know what about bumble? Because we'd all been searching the internet. We literally putting random letters together to come up with words and mean anything. What were the other top contenders? Um, oh goodness. Yeah, because women were going to take the leap and make the first move. And actually leap year is a very interesting story. So in leap year, folklore says that women would propose to men during leap year. And so we thought leap and then we, you know, we played with Sadie for like Sadie Hawkins dance.

Speaker 3:          00:11:37       We played with several names. Hawkins, you don't know what the city Hawkins dances or surprise. Okay. This is awesome. So the Sadie Hawkins Dance started in the 1930s and it was based off of a cartoon by al Cap where these women during leap year would make the first move. Essentially they, they'd ask them men to marry them and this got consolidated into a dance that US school system started putting into place and it became so popular, you know, the Sadie Hawkins dance, they'd wear the poodle skirts and the black and white shoes. Okay. You're going to have to look into this, but

Speaker 2:          00:12:12       no. Is it a dance? It's not an actual dance style. Like a mating ritual dance.

Speaker 3:          00:12:18       No, it's, it's like a school dance. So you have the prom, right? Right. And then you had the Sadie Hawkins dance and the Sadie Hawkins dance was different from the prom because boys ask girls to the prom girls asked boys to the Sadie Hawkins dance. They asked the boy to the dance and something really interesting took place when the Sadie Hawkins dance went into effect. It became so popular, they made it a national holiday and it became so popular because parents felt that it was a safer option because the way the boys behaved when the girls asked to the dance was much less aggressive. Girls were not crying, feeling left out. So it recalibrated these gender norms around flirting and dating and courting. And so that was a big inspiration behind bumble. You know, when we were thinking about women making the first move, it was almost the digital rendition of that.

Speaker 3:          00:13:10       Did you, you did or did not like bumble them when it came up? I did not like it at first. And I'll tell you why bumble sounded like fumble. You know, you were, you're fumbling through a dating experience and we wanted this to be an app that was empowering for women where they felt confident and in control. And it was not until all of these really cute catchphrases start started being, you know, coming, coming up, people on our team and friends when, you know, we're asking, what do you think about this name or this name or this name? And all of a sudden, um, these catchphrases were coming up like, you know, be the Queen Bee of bumble, find your honey on bumble. And it was in that moment that we said, okay, this is it. This is brand ability. This is how you brand something. And that was that. Was it off to the races? We went,

Speaker 2:          00:14:00       yeah. If it sticks, it sticks. One of the first things I ask proofreaders who are typically friends of mine who are writers or lawyers because they're really good at spotting sloppy language or words that don't need to be. There are things that are confusing. In any case, one of the first questions I ask after they've read a chapter is I will give it some time. So like a half hour have a cup of coffee. I'll say, okay, what do you remember? And I'll see what, I'll see what the first few things are that come to mind. It's really interesting. A lot about top of mind like yeah, I don't think about it too hard. Like top top line. If it takes too long, it's like, all right, I need to rework the entire chapter. Now, how many people roughly at this point use use bumble? And I know there are many different, many, many different metrics and was he give about it? But we,

Speaker 3:          00:14:49       we look at kind of overall user base in terms of registrations. How many times has somebody download our platform? How many people have registered for our APP? We've had over 29 million registrations now in just over three years. It's a lot of people. That's good. It's a few people. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:15:05       I saw the part of the beauty of the, of the approach, and I know that there's a lot of complexity hidden behind a very simple interface. Believe me, with the amount of time that I've spent with startups, I started using bumble very early on. I mean sort of, I'm not going to call it Alpha or Beta, but very early on, and what I realized very quickly is that by having the woman make the first move, you also remove one of the biggest pain points. And you know this for men, which is women receiving 500,000 unwanted messages. And even if prince charming is hiding in there, even if you are the ones she would pick, it's too much noise. This, the signal to noise ratio is so unfavorable that as a guy you could put out a hundred messages and get zero responses and it, it just cuts out that first leg of wasted work completely. So thank you for that.

Speaker 3:          00:16:02       Well that's awesome feedback. It's interesting that you highlight that. That just plays into these gender dynamics. You know, women from the time they start thinking about who they like or having crushes, it's that it's going to be inbound, right? They were trained to think that's going to come to us, that, that the boys were supposed to chase the girls and, and then that turns into the men chasing the women and, and that we're supposed to essentially play hard to get and not give in. Right. And so when the good guy does show up, you oftentimes miss that given those, you know, those broken dynamics. And so yeah, when you do flip the switch it, it does allow, it does allow for better and more genuine connections.

Speaker 2:          00:16:48       So people might be listening or watching and they've read a bit about your story and you're on top of the world. Right in so many ways. Stepping up to the plate, hitting home runs every time out that but you mentioned when we got started this, this depressive period, this dark period. So I wanted to read something that I found in the course of doing some research and it may be a paraphrase but I think it's, it's somewhat accurate based on checking with you beforehand but I don't know the elaboration. So the quote here, it's from refinery 29 and it talks about how you wanted to build a company that encourages empowerment, confidence and respect because when you have self respect it's really hard to get you down. This is the part I wanted to dig into for a second. I've been in a place in my life where I've had no confidence, no self respect, zero self worth and it was really easy to hurt my feelings. Anything would trigger me to be sad. Then when you rebuild some of that you become stronger. So I was hoping you could describe us, whether it's that episode, that period that you talked about or another and I just one of the darker harder times. Sure. And like what a day looked like during that time and then the things you did or the things that helped you get out of that depressive state. And it doesn't have to be depressive, could be anxiety, could be anything else.

Speaker 3:          00:18:09       Um, well, you know, and I still have days like that and I think that's healthy for listeners or watchers to understand that just because something's going well or what pro, you know, what people perceive to be going well, it doesn't mean every day is perfect and I think the hard times in my life have really shaped the good times in my life. And I think many people can agree with that. So, you know, the inspiration behind bumble was really driven from self, you know, self experience and what I've gone through in my life. Basically. There's been a common theme with every tough time I've ever gone through. And that always comes down to mental abuse. And that has been not just in romantic endeavors, that could be friendships, toxic friendships. And so there's this been this recurring theme. And you know, when I was under so much scrutiny from the Internet from strangers and I was allowing these random strangers to define me and to dictate my day.

Speaker 2:          00:19:07       Can you think of any particular example? I've personally, I can certainly think of certain examples. I'm like, oh my God, that one year when that thing came out on my birthday and it was a hatchet job piece is, can you think of one where you're like, Oh God, that day. So

Speaker 3:          00:19:21       it was, it was actually right after my birthday. Funny you say that. It was, um, the summer of 2014 and all of these articles were running and I hadn't, I wasn't speaking to anyone, I wasn't commenting on any articles. I knew nothing about the media at that time. Nothing. And I could not have been more naive when it came to PR and press at that, at that time. And yeah, there'd be dragons. Got To be careful. Yeah. And uh, you know, this story came out one morning, one afternoon, my dad sent it to me and it was disgusting. It was talking about, you know, the, basically the, the piece painted me as this, um, you know, like at the gone girl of Tech, you know, she was a seductress and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, and all of these awful, you know, insinuations and it was talking about ridiculous things like really personal details that were completely inaccurate and it was really gross and ugly.

Speaker 3:          00:20:26       And it just made me feel undressed. I felt naked. Your Dad's commentary like, well, and that was what was so devastating. My Dad was just like, you know, having your father send you an article and be like, is this true? Like, of course, no, but what, you know, how do you have to justify that at 24, just turning 25 years old to your father? What, how, how can journalism be that? No one asked me for comment on that. You know, no one asked if those allegations were true and to be this young woman feeling like I was part of this like mean girl club. And you know that the girl that was, you know, being pointed at and laughed at by a group of people. I mean, it was awful with the rest of your day look like I was devastated. I, I actually became physically ill.

Speaker 3:          00:21:14       He's now my husband and thank God for him. He, I was having such a mental breakdown. I was actually having a, what they call it, clinical panic attack. I was hyperventilating, I was distraught. I couldn't breathe at my site was not right and he had to take me to his primary doctor, like his family doctor and the doctor literally had to prescribe me one to two days worth of some. Well, I don't know, I don't take any medicine. I'm scared of even Advil, but I think it was like volume or something to Jay to physically call me down. I was having a mental breakdown because I had no way to defend myself and I just felt helpless and I felt literally undressed on a huge stage and it was, it was awful.

Speaker 2:          00:22:00       Yes. Not a great feeling at all. And it's even worse. I mean, it's even worse for women. It's bad for men, but it gets even worse. I think for women, it can be terrible for men, don't get me wrong, but it was talking about that

Speaker 3:          00:22:10       very misogynistic things that really only apply to women and that's what made it worse. You know, making insinuations about who I was as a woman and my intentions as a woman, not, it wasn't even about business, if that makes sense. You know? It was, it was very,

Speaker 2:          00:22:25       it was a very salacious and exciting compared to the business stuff. So apparently so paint the picture, they want to pick out some clicks. No. One thing I'd love to chat about because it came up in a number of places when I was doing homework for this, and this is certainly not uncommon among founders. I know people think, Oh, when the times are going well, you're doing well. When the times are going poorly, you're doing poorly. But a lot of founders, even when they're starting up to doing really well, have a certain baseline of low grade or high grade anxiety. So plus, so I've heard Peter that points tell me this. It's the Internet, so who knows if it's true or not, but at some point you were waking up every two hours to check your email or you'd wake up at four 30 check your email, then go back to sleep and wake up again at six 30 I did that for years. You did that for years

Speaker 3:          00:23:20       actually, that has just now started to slow down

Speaker 2:          00:23:23       and I have you at one time been anxious. Is that been a sort of an emotional home of sorts?

Speaker 3:          00:23:28       Anxiety paired with drive and ambition and passion. I'm so dedicated to what I'm doing. I can't explain it to you. I mean it's just part of my blood at this point and it's almost like a, it's built into my system. Yeah, the anxiety has been really scary over the years. And there's days where, you know, I couldn't feel my fingers for hours or I didn't think I could breathe. I mean this started manifesting into physical ailments and God bless my doctor, he's really going to have to block my cell phone number at some point. But you know, it's scary. If you don't deal with anxiety will take advantage. It will take control over your life. How have you dealt with it? What are the habits or routines or self talk? Anything has helped you to keep it from going from a fuel to a handicap? Takes control.

Speaker 3:          00:24:23       It definitely has become a handicap at points, but I would say 85% of the time it's a fuel. And actually back to the doctor talk, um, my doctor said something really interesting to me and it's something that stuck with me. I said to him one day, I was like, I don't know if I can deal with this anymore. My anxiety is just so extreme. It's paralyzing me at certain points. Do I need to get on a medicine? Do I need to be medicated for this? And he responded, just keep doing good work. It will, it will recalibrate the way you feel. And when I thought through that and it was like, you know what, when I can just, if I can channel this energy and this, this anxiety and channel it into doing good work, meaning work that affects others in a positive way, it genuinely works.

Speaker 3:          00:25:07       It actually, if you shift your focus to shift it and you have to, you've got to harness it and control it. And my husband's great about this too, you know, he's just like, what are your thoughts? Let's get your thoughts under control, you know, and how do we harness this and just, you know, focus on what's causing this and then how do we shift it into something that's positive versus you, you know, doing the, the self doubt thing on repeat with any type of help like journaling or is it just a conversation with your husband and are there any, when you feel it starting to spiral, I mean, do you have pattern interrupts that you can use? You know, I tried to get outside and take a walk and then my phone and I've found that that's really helpful. And also sleep. Nothing is more nourishing to your mind, body and soul and a good night's sleep.

Speaker 3:          00:25:57       And I think if you can have uninterrupted sleep for, even if you're, if you're a person that's like, oh, I only need five or six hours of sleep. If you can try to have a good seven, eight, nine hours sleep, it really changes the game. I've also observed, and I think these are actually very closely related in some people, but that at least in the for people with depressive symptoms going to bed before or by say 11 o'clock mix it very big difference. Absolutely sure. The words, you know, sleeping from 2:00 AM if you're, let's say self employed and have this ability or unemployed from to sleep from say two to 10 is not the same caliber of sleep that you're going to get from 11 to eight or 11. So I'm going to flash

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       back to books specifically. And so I had read at one point a, I don't think we're going to spend a ton, ton, ton of time on this right now, but you ask about your team's mood every day, which I thought was very interesting and having have them rank it. Uh, but what I caught at the end of this I was curious about, so it says a box in the corner contains copies of originals, subtitle, how nonconformist moved the world by Adam Grant and wolf tells everyone to take one home so they can have a group discussion. Why did you choose to do that with this book? And do you do it with other books? Are there other books that you've also used, uh, for employees in the company or two years whenever it might be? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:27:28       So Mike, we were saying earlier, Internet time is like different time zone from every other, you know, measure of time. When we were doing that we were a team of something like six or seven. I got you. Great. We were really a tiny team. We were still in our apartment, in our conference room, was in a bathtub and you know, we were really just trying to keep the wheels turning and I felt that a good mechanism of kind of keeping everyone as fast and as crazy as it was all going can keep keeping everyone on some form of a thread of commonality. You know, where there'd be something everyone could talk about together that wasn't bumble, right? So how could we, how could we have interesting conversation together as a small team that wasn't just like, okay, what are we going to do with our downloads are about new product?

Speaker 3:          00:28:16       Are we going to do, did it, how could we focus on kind of interesting insights from someone else? And so we did kind of a poll early on, what books should we read it together? Let's try to do a book club together. And this was one of those pivotal moments of growth. And so it did not last very long. The Book Club, the book love did not last, but the intentions were good, the intentions were good and everyone really liked the idea of trying to turn off. Another purpose of that was I was trying to encourage the team to turn off a little bit at night. Sure. And instead of, you know, getting deep into your emails after you've come home from dinner, open a book, you know, Reed did detach, do something that is going to challenge your mind in a way that you're not being challenged all day long. And so that was the premise of it all. And um, you know, as you grow, we're now, we're approaching 100 employees here soon. It's very hard to do, uh, uh, a check on, you know, how you're feeling every day. You can't really go around the room with, you know, so many people and it's really hard to get everybody together for book club when things are just going so fast.

Speaker 2:          00:29:25       Yeah. Are there any books personally that you've gifted often to other people or re-read allot yourself?

Speaker 3:          00:29:33       Yes, I have, um, several different books, but to that we can talk about something I've always gifted and kind of held close over the years. Is the book Shantaram have you read Shantaram okay. I became obsessed with Shandra. I'm like, I tried to join the Shantaram fan club line, like a book club. It got weird for a second, but um, the point is I loved Shantaram and I loved that it took you into this different element of human understanding. And I wanted my team to read it because I think it's actually a great marketing example, how to build a product based on human behavior and how to understand people around you and what makes people tick, not just what's the Roi on some billboard. Right. Um, and so I don't know what it is about that book. I can't summarize it in one sentence, but it just gives you a peak into the soul of humanity, if that makes sense.

Speaker 3:          00:30:29       And so that's a book that I've, I've gifted frequently and I love also the author has a really good, effectively good by public world. You're not going to hear from me for a while. I'm going to continue to do my work, but I'm not going to appear anywhere. I'm not going to do anything. And you've made this public proclamation, which I thought was very inspiring. I fantasize about that all the time. Uh, but wow, this book, a very powerful story that catches people very often, catches people at the right time. What's the second book? So back to the right time when it catches people at the right time. I actually read that book. I, when I graduated from college, I went and got a backpack at Rei and went to Asia for a couple to few months. I have no concept of years or time anymore. And while I was over there, I spent time in Singapore and, and throughout several cities.

Speaker 3:          00:31:22       But I also spent time solo at orphanages in northern Thailand, in Cambodia. Um, and then did a lot of travel through that area. And that was the book I read on that trip. And so I think as you are sitting on this bus that breaks down with a bunch of local Cambodians eating crickets, reading Shantaram, you're almost taking yourself out of everything you've ever known to be true and understanding how big and vast and how great the world is around you and really how small one is. Right. You know, it just gives you so much perspective. So that's one book. Another book that I've been gifting and um, he should probably make me an ambassador. So if he listens to this, this book called the plant paradox of you heard of it, this will destroy your life in a good way. But it's basically telling you that everything you've ever heard about health and wellness is completely false.

Speaker 3:          00:32:19       So he tells you plants are bad for you essentially. And I don't know what it is about this book, but it might be a little bit of Hocus pocus, but I, I'm a full believer and so I think I've sent that book to like a hundred people at this point. How has it changed your behavior or? Well, the big thing for me as I've been so much, I'm also starting to understand how health catches up. So for the first few years of bumble, I mean, I was drinking every night, not at a club. I mean, I have not gone out, I've not been social like a normal 20 something year old since I started bumble. Right? Actually, I became almost a hermit. I became very reclusive and I just wanted to be with my boyfriend who became fiance now husband. And I just wanted to be with people that I really knew and trusted and I didn't want to go anywhere because I was so paranoid that everyone hated me or assumed that these awful things about me that I genuinely just went to work, went home, maybe cooked dinner, maybe cried a little bit, maybe drink some wine.

Speaker 3:          00:33:17       And that was it. And so, um, this health thing has become a bit more important now. You know, here you go to work and you can create as much success as you are able to, but you have nothing without your health. You have nothing without your mental health, you have nothing without your physical health. And so that's why I'm kind of getting into these, these, these books. Um, because I think it's important to have that type of balance. Has it changed your diet or anything like that? It actually has. It's, it's scares you about, you know, what you're putting in your body. So

Speaker 2:          00:33:49       it makes you think, what is your diff? What might a default breakfast or lunch or dinner look like for you now?

Speaker 3:          00:33:54       Oh Gosh, yes. That's a crazy question. Um, there is no default is whatever I can find generally, but now I'm going to be more thoughtful. So the roles according to this guy are that, you know, everything you put in your body as essentially your health, right? And you are what you eat. And so even getting a piece of organic chicken, what you used to maybe think was good for you. Well, what does that chicken eating, right? Yeah. So it's just this awful rabbit hole that you go down. But it's, it's interesting and it's important to understand. We know the effects on the planet and you know, that's a conversation for another time.

Speaker 2:          00:34:28       All right, cool. I'll check it out. Yeah. The uh, everything you put in your mouth on your body is a drug and it has a biochemical effect. So you have to think of it that way when you sent the plant paradox and plants are bad for you. Uh, there are a lot of plants that really don't want you to eat them. Exactly. That's what this is all about. There are a lot of them. And uh, made me think briefly, I'm not going to get into a bit of Zuko who is the Creator Slash Cook Creator? I'm not sure which ofZ cash. Cryptocurrency, really smart guy who eats only meat, does not eat any vegetables whatsoever. And he's been doing that for years.

Speaker 3:          00:35:03       See, because a lot of the plants have defense mechanisms and they will poison you.

Speaker 2:          00:35:08       Yup. Yeah. They're, they're learning to plants. I mean, Nice. Since they are fixed in their mobility, they can't run away from predators. So they'd develop all sorts of very, very, very clever defense mechanism. Currently beans are toxic for you. Yeah. Beans. This, we don't have time to get into the bean rabbit hole. The beans. Yes. This is bins. This comes up a lot. I'm not, well, I'll digress for a second just because you have very strict like militant Paleo, which is like if you eat beans, your GI tract will explode while you're walking down the street. Like you have to be, I'm exaggerating a little bit there. They're like, if you eat beans, it is like swallowing broken glass. Uh, I tend to, I tend to be more moderate and my views of beans, I find them somewhat helpful also given their fiber content and so on for a lot of things including weight loss.

Speaker 2:          00:35:57       But, uh, if you look at certainly, uh, many different plants that have something as seemingly innocuous to say oxalic acid, which is why you get that, that certain feeling in your mouth when you eat a lot of say, raw spinach, which is, can be somewhat innocuous down to [inaudible] and other things that can, they can actually do a fair amount of damage. But we should title this episode, bumble and bumble and bumble and beans, uh, or bar in Austin right next to me and I'd cat. All right. Uh, next question is what purchase of $100 or less, it doesn't have to be exactly that, but what purchase that is not something exceptionally expensive, uh, has, has positively impacted your life in recent memory. It could be a few years ago, could be, um, coconut oil, coconut oil, what do you use it for? Everything. You can take a bath with it.

Speaker 2:          00:37:00       You can put it in a smoothie, you can cook, you can actually put it on your skin. I think coconut oil miracle by, yeah. Yeah, I agree. Has some really fascinating, uh, uh, it's like antifungal antibiotic properties as well. Anytime I curb, you'll, I should say, even if you get a cut, they say you can put coconut oil on it and it helps. Yeah. Coconut oil is, uh, is really fascinating on, on many different levels. Useful for a bunch of diets maybe that are contained and paradox, probably not just because of the concentration of MCT oil effectively. Uh, but the thing you should always keep one in your bathtub, your bathtub, you can put a big scoop of coconut oil in a hot bath, nourishes your skin and it's actually calming and relaxing and then you keep one in the kitchen. Do everything with it. Yeah, coconut oil, almost used to cook it the other day, but the burning point is, is not high, not low. It's around the same, I believe are in the same as all the on of like a smoking points around three 50 Fahrenheit. Apparently oil's bad for you. I don't want to go for cooking groups is. Yep. Alright. So olive oil varies greatly. Uh, your mileage may vary with your olive oil purchase system. Ferris brought to you by the bunch you by bumble. Uh, good, good answer. Uh, yeah. Coconut oil also keeps forever. This is a very useful to have around. Uh, also

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       little, um, Smithson, um, journals, the little, the little mini ones, they come in yellow with a B. I like to gift those to people on my team and just their low price point. I think they're like $60 for actually a pretty big one. And you can actually have it monogrammed. Yeah. And it's just a nice little leather, um, notebook. And I just think taking notes actually is really, really therapeutic and it's also incredibly productive. I mean, you'd be so shocked and I know that you know this, but I was so shocked when I started just writing things down as they came up and the stuff I was going back to that I written down, I would have never in a thousand years remembered had I not written it down. It's fascinating to see how much the human mind actually just disposes of Oh, in terms of memory. And so I think that's a great little gift.

Speaker 2:          00:39:31       Yeah, it, it's really powerful. And I mean, you're kind of preaching to the converted since I've saw many notebooks, but I think as a guy, especially there's this mental hurdle with thinking of a journal is a diary that I just can't sleep over, so I can't, but, but if I feel like this is my activity, yellow pages, then it serves the same function really. You have that chronicle and uh, it's, it's true that we really think we are going to remember forever. The things that we will very soon forget that was made so clear to me actually when I was 15 my first time abroad with any real time was as an exchange student in Japan for a year. Totally changed my life. Lived with Japanese in Tokyo. Wow. Was the only, oh, so ended up the only American in a Japanese school, 5,000 Japanese kids.

Speaker 2:          00:40:23       So if you want to talk about where's Waldo school uniform, the whole nine yards. Yeah. It must have been incredible. Every class in Japanese. Yeah. It was wild. And I had these phone calls with my mom catching up with my parents and she would take copious notes every time after we had spoken so that she could give it to me later. And I look back at those notes and I don't remember 98% of it. I mean now, now I do as a queue. But if she hadn't done that, all of those incredible experiences just would have been gone. Wow. That's fantastic. Uh, it's really interesting. When is the last time you cried? Tears of joy yesterday. Yesterday.

Speaker 3:          00:41:02       Got some big news, can't tell you about it unfortunately, but I got some big news and I got the news in my office with two of my, you know, kind of closest allies and very, very early employees and key members of the team and we all kind of freaked out and we were screaming in my office and HR came over and was like, what's wrong? Everyone's worried or something, what's going on in there? And I'm like, no, everything's great. Can't tell you what it is you'll see in a month. But I'm actually cried tears of joy. It's just, it's awesome when when certain things come up that you felt were so far away in terms of them being obtainable were actually happening, but you've worked really, really, really, really, really hard to get there. Um, when those two pieces collide into actual reality, it's just like such an emotional thing.

Speaker 3:          00:41:57       I also cried tears of joy about a week ago. So my husband broke his back in an awful car accident a year ago, exactly a year ago. And he had, you know, they thought he was going to be a quadriplegic. They thought he was maybe going to die in surgery, who knew, who knew what was going to happen and he was in critical condition for almost a week and that hospital, I mean I just didn't leave it. I stayed in that Icu with him the whole time and this year, a year later, he was fortunate enough obviously he's walking, thank God and he's healthy and he's well and we went back to the hospital exactly a year later and he very generously with his family had donated the new intensive care center at the exact hospital and all of his nurses that took care of him for that week who were, you know, literally holding me as I sobbed and was terrified that they came to the ceremony. And that was just the craziest feeling to go from being in the darkest, darkest, darkest possible situation in a certain building to coming back and being in the best possible situation. That's just like a really emotional situation. So I definitely cried tears of joy that

Speaker 2:          00:43:03       that day. Where were you born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. That's what I thought. So when you're going through this experience with your husband, you're at the hospital, whether you're on the way there at the hospital during that period, were there any mantras or quotes or prayers or anything that you relied on to help or reminded yourself on? If it doesn't have to be during that period, but I mean work questions you asked yourself. I'm just wondering if there's, if there's anything that you go to in moments like that, that you find,

Speaker 3:          00:43:34       you know, I do try to tap into whatever the higher power is, right? I'm not a religious person. Um, I do feel that I'm somewhat spiritual and spirituality comes out in moments of darkness, you know, or in moments of fear. And it's interesting, you almost feel this sense of security when you feel the least secure of possible. I don't know how to explain that, but it's really spooky. So actually the night before his accident, I actually had a dream, something awful was going to happen to him. And I called him that morning and I said, I feel sick. I was like six in the morning. I woke him up early and I said, I feel sick. I had this awful dream. I need to come home. Cause he was actually not in Austin at the time and he was in Tyler where his businesses and so home is kind of, we've kind of commute is I need to come home.

Speaker 3:          00:44:17       I can't go to la today. I, I've got to get home. I just don't feel good about this. And he was like, chill out. Like I'm going to go walk the dogs. You go downstairs like how some coffee call me on your way to work. And I just had this sick feeling and this really bad feeling like something's not right. Something's not right. And I called him on the way to work and he didn't answer it. I just started sobbing in the car and I had to kind of slap myself and both the window down and be like, you're having a panic attack. Like this is so you had too much coffee. And I just couldn't calm myself down. And Lo and behold, five minutes later, you know, I got the phone call back from his, um, chief operations officer who was following an ambulance.

Speaker 3:          00:44:53       And so that really stuck with me through the whole week. And I was trying to wrap my head around that. I was trying to, you know, decipher why did I, why am I feeling those things? So my, my message in that not to ramble is that I genuinely believe ev, every person on this planet has a sense of intuition and it's learning how to separate that from fear or anxiety or panic and really listen to your gut. And, um, I really think that, that, that's what has gotten me to where I am today is that, you know, listening to your gut when you can. And um, so yeah, that was my only really mantra was just to kind of listen to what was going on and try to keep it under control.

Speaker 2:          00:45:35       So I won't go too far into this because the people who don't already think I'm crazy, we'll definitely think I'm crazy, but I probably think I'm psycho. I've been systematically reducing my caffeine consumption so that there's less noise in order that I can better listen to those feelings. Because I have found when I kind of raised the level of volume and static with adrenaline and other stress hormones, it drowns out some of the signal and my dog is all sudden. This is not that uncommon. I mean babies and dogs I think also, but my dog is very much every time she, she never barks, she really rarely barks at anyone. And if she barks are growls at any journalist and member of the media, what I've ignored it, it is, it has within 24 hours, uh, ended up that I should have heated that warning. So I'd use that as one of my many checkboxes. Of course I'm using using some more left brain as well, but I am, I'm valuing more highly the, the less obvious, less perhaps structured thinking because the vast majority of our evolution is not prefrontal cortex. Let's sit down with a spreadsheet. Yep. And so if you have a funny feeling, yeah, yeah, it's worth it. It's worth exploring that. So

Speaker 3:          00:47:04       interesting you say that because every time I'm like, damn, why did I not do that? Or why did I do that? If I think back to when I made the decision against our forest, something, I always had the right answer, if that makes sense. Yeah. But then you go on the other way for whatever reason and you've kind of like, she had to listen to myself. Yeah. And for anybody out there, like even in business, I think that's such a good way to have the answers because a lot of entrepreneurs we don't have the answer is, you know, even though I've had this amazing business partner who has a lot of answers and I've been able to tap into his knowledge, there's still so many days where I have no idea what to do. And you're left with one thing and that's your gut and that's it. And you have to try to listen. But I'm with you on the coffee thing, like I've tried to have only one step because I will literally start spinning out of control. So I'm with you on the toning it down.

Speaker 2:          00:47:54       Yeah. To end a Emmy for it. For people who are wondering, well how does that actually apply? How do you listen to it? And yet in my case, one of the clearest examples, if I look back at the 70 to 90 startups that I've invested in over a 10 year period from like 2007 to 2017, uh, and a lot of those were passive at any given time. There are no more than like four or five active needing my help. So it wasn't a, it was in waves, certainly, but, and not often make it as you know, how do you keep track all of that? That's a whole set. We could talk about it with the whole separate conversation. I call no bucks. Well, I'll give you one once. One thing that I borrowed from Japan, actually this is getting a little off topic, but so there's something called the k two in Japan where if you look at the conglomerates, the very often they will buy a company that can be a supplier or customer for another company within their portfolio or that has some type of knowledge.

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       It can be transferred to other divisions. Every time I looked at a portfolio company, one of the ideal boxes to check was how much can they be helped by end help another company in the portfolio is in the portfolio. Very smart way that decreases the, it increases the efficiency, uh, for everyone, but also decreases the actual so heavy lifting that I have to do as a solo operator. Uh, but when I look at all of those companies, and there's the good, the bad and the ugly within that, as you would imagine, uh, the gut feeling and feeling good about a company or feeling good about a founder isn't enough for me to invest, but feeling off about a founder's enough for me not to invest. And when an agreement, right. So because every, a lot of really good founders are going gonna have a, maybe not a Jobsian level d reality distortion field, but they're gonna be very good at selling and there can be very good at persuading.

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       And if they're not, well, guess what? That tells you something too, because they're, they should be. Yeah. Uh, so it's very easy to drink the Koolaid even if you think you're immune to their charismatic effects. So if I feel good about it, it's like, all right, trust, but verify. Let me, let me, let's get some documents. Yeah, let's look at the documentation. Let's actually look into that feeling. But yeah, exactly. Whenever I've violated that, which I did in some of the early cases where it's like, well, we have this, this leap that we have, all these amazing investors were closing 48 hours, we're oversubscribed. We can fill you out. And all that Fomo Shit. And then I invest on, and I'm like, I fucking knew it. I knew, I knew it within the, not even the first hour, like I knew within the first five minutes didn't feel right with that person.

Speaker 2:          00:50:30       Okay. So that's enough. No, that's really interesting though. Mumbo jumbo, but yeah, just like good advice to people. Yeah. Seriously passionate about stuff. Yeah. There's a book for people who are thinking about how this might apply more broadly, uh, called the gift of fear by Gavin de Becker, which talks about this and how people get themselves into very, very awful situations. Women, especially often by not paying attention to that feeling, that nagging feeling. It's really important to pay attention to what is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you've ever made. And that doesn't have to be money. It could be money, but it could be time. It could be energy. Uh, anything that you've invested into that gave you a tremendously high Roi,

Speaker 3:          00:51:13       best thing I've ever invested into his time and dedication into my team at bumble. Okay? 100%. The best thing I've ever invested in. And you know, it's been such a, um, dedicated effort over the last three and a half years, but really investing that extra, that extra hour or that extra day or that extra thought or that extra, get to know someone. Right? Um, that's the stuff that counts the most because when you do that, you instill more than just a job opportunity. You know, you give more than just an opening at a company. You really leave them with the same values and the mission becomes ingrained in them and they're able to do their job. And in a way that is almost, um, immune to competition because there so on the same page with why you started the company to begin with,

Speaker 2:          00:52:10       what are, what are some ways that you do that concretely? Uh, whether it's in the onboarding process or ongoing or otherwise, like anything you do on a monthly or weekly or quarterly or whatever basis. W can you give an example? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:52:25       So I think that your first 10 hires are what defines the future of your business. Because no singular human can scale culture. It's impossible. There's no way to have the time or the bandwidth or the actual physical ability to go and instill your vision and your values in, you know, hundreds of employees as things grow if you're so fortunate. So those first 10 people, they are your culture warriors. And if you can invest everything you've got into those people, those people will then invest everything they've got into the people that work under them or you know, beside them. And that's how you scale culture. And I'm so, you know, in the early days we're talking weekends, like I would do whatever I could to make experiences for my, my key early hires so that they felt they felt like family, but in a non boundary crossing way, right.

Speaker 3:          00:53:24       You know, we still had boundaries where they still had their own lives and we were trying to keep things healthy. So, you know, having everyone over to my house on a Saturday and making sure that they had a great day, but really explaining to them my pain points that I lived through in my life and why this company's going to make a difference and, you know, share with them how we can actually have real impact on the world, not just a paycheck or the potential to be a big, you know, valuation one day. Right. How do we actually change the world through what we're doing and changing the world doesn't necessarily mean, you know, uh, on the main scale, you can change the world by affecting one person, right? That is putting good energy out there. And so investing that mantra and kind of putting that time and, and really finessing that, that ethos has served me very well and I'm so proud of them because they're all now leaders in their own right. I'm, I want them to feel like mini CEOs of their own in their own way. And you know, I, if I'm not in the office for two weeks, I don't want it to be like, oh, the boss is out because no, there every so many bosses in that office and they're amazing and they're passionate and they're inspiring and they're just as impactful as I am right to this company. And that's how I wanted it to be.

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       What are some of the, the rules are better perhaps as the question is, what advice have you been given by mentors or others that has really helped you in the early stages of building a company? It doesn't have to be specifically hiring but it, but it could. And if that's too tough or just maybe not an interesting question, just advice that you've received from mentors are key lessons you've taken away from any particular mentor?

Speaker 3:          00:55:08       Yeah, I've, I've received a lot of interesting advice and I think that the more you listen and the more you absorb, the better you are. Um, as much as I've tried to say, you know, I'm going to do this my way and your advice is nice and your advice was great, but I'm going to trust my gut and I'm going to build the company that I want it to be. I have gotten great, um, great pieces of advice from so many people. And I think that my business partner, like I said, he had been in the dating industry for almost a decade before me. And so there were times I would call upon him and say, Hey, I'm thinking about doing this. And he'd say, well, I think you should think about it in a different way because he had been through it. And so, I know this is going to sound silly, but the best piece of advice I've ever received was from my husband's grandfather and he said the most expensive currency in the world is experience.

Speaker 3:          00:55:57       There's nothing better than experience. You cannot buy it. You can not pay for it. You cannot go out and get it overnight. So tapping into people with experience and actually trusting them when you feel that they're off base, but really trusting them. That's been such good advice that served me so well because you've probably been here too. You know, here I am, this like, you know, 20 something year old a couple years ago. I'm still 20 something year old, but going out and doing things my own way and saying, oh well you just don't understand or I want to do it my way or no, trust me, it's going to be like this. Tapping into someone who's done it before and even if you disagree with them, really thinking twice before you shut them down. And so I just think that served me pretty well over the years is to not write off people with experience.

Speaker 2:          00:56:41       And then for the more, even if you feel like you're strong enough to figure it out. I mean certainly looking at a lot of founders, I know it can be very, you can feel very isolating as a CEO and a, I remember chatting with Amanda Palmer, the musician much more than musician, uh, certainly done a lot. But if people search Amanda Palmer asking for help or how to ask for help, it's, it's extremely helpful. She's given talks on this as well. But I found it very empowering to realize at times when I have artificially isolated myself to be like, I don't want to burden other people with my shit. Like let me just figure this out and sit down and play a notepad and get stuck in my head and chase my own tail and self flagellate and make this all worse and then punish myself or feel upset when I don't figure it all out. Absolutely. And instead it's like, no, your friends want to help you. Like give them the gift of allowing them to help you and your friends. They don't have to be a friend.

Speaker 3:          00:57:40       Yeah. Even people that I, you know, along the journey I'm, I kind of have this syndrome where I, I'm always impressed by everyone and I don't feel impressive ever. It's just, it's something I've suffered with my whole life. And you know, I've just, I've, no matter who it is in front of me, it literally could be someone that, you know, career wise isn't even on the same, you know, kind of contribution level or whatever it is. But I'm just always impressed by people because I think it's so, it's important to really appreciate everybody else's, you know, kind of story and where they've come from, what they're doing. And so I've always been the last few years scared, like you said, I've always been like, well, I can't ask that person for advice because they're so important and they're so impressive and they're gonna think I'm annoying or they're going to think that I'm needy or they're going to think that, you know what I mean? And so I've almost dug myself into this hole of not asking enough people for help. Yeah. And fear of them feeling invaded or imposed on? Not because I didn't care about what they had to say, so that's a really interesting perspective.

Speaker 2:          00:58:42       Let me give just a couple of thoughts for people who are like, okay, I'm going to ask him for advice or ask you for advice or whatever it might be. If you're, if you want to ask anyone for advice who you perceive as very busy. One recommendation I would make is do not say, can I take you out to lunch and pick your brain? No one has time for lunch. Let's do the brain picking. Sounds awful and nobody wants to do it because it's really nebulous and so the concern is I'm going to go out to knock to be 15 minutes. It's going to be an hour of them trying to figure out what they want to say and it's not going to be a good use of time. So you can, if you can say a, I know you have a thought, I'd get a thousand email if you don't have time to respond.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       I totally understand, but I couldn't think of a better person to reach out to. Just one thing I'm really struggling with, here's the situation, here's what I've tried to do or figure out already had this is this is this is, I've actually used Google. Yeah, right. I'm not going to hit [inaudible]. I actually looked into it. I've, I've tried to figure out this and this. This is where I am. Yup. Super specific question. And again, if you're too busy, totally get it. No problem. And if easier, here's my cell phone. I think that giving them an out recognizing they're busier than hell, which they probably are, and having a really soft delivery but showing that you've put in some work. Yes. But you're not outsourcing your like mechanical Turk stuff to them like yeah. Do you put in some effort and show that you've done that? So

Speaker 3:          01:00:10       a follow up to that. We actually do that in the office. So what I've told the team and what the team has really learned in there, they do it on their own, which is amazing. If you have a problem, please don't come talk to me about it unless you have a suggested yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:23       Solution. Exactly. Yes. Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          01:00:25       I can't just listen to problems come with two potential solutions. Like, Hey Whitney, we've got a huge issue. Um, this situation has completely crumbled and we're committed to this or whatever happened. My suggested solution is either a, we do x, Y, and Z or B, we could do this and here are the consequences of both. Yup. And this is what, um, is going to happen in each scenario. And then we can talk through that and it goes to show that someone has actually thought through, you know, the other side of the fire. How do we get out of here? What's the exit strategy? Not just, Oh, we were in a fire.

Speaker 2:          01:00:59       Yeah. This is so important. And if you think of problem solving as an algorithm or software in a way, if you add head count to say really inefficient, a software development project is just going to make things take longer, right? So the more people you have, in a way you could argue this is really important, especially when you have a tiny team, but the amount of bloat and wasted money, uh, that can really cause problems up doesn't increase in a linear fashion. When you then have a hundred, 200, 500 people, if you have 500 people who haven't been coached on how to do this, it gets even more expensive. And uh, one thing I'd add to that is yeah, this is so important. So when I hire people part time, contract, full time, whatever it might be, they learn really quickly, do not come to me a with a problem without a proposed solution.

Speaker 2:          01:01:53       And if you come with a proposed solution, don't give me a 12 item, multiple choice questions. Yeah, you can give me your top three or four. I also want to know which one do you think we should do and why this one is the best and why have you gotten to that? And I might disagree with it, but it's like put them, I want your top four options or whatever it might be. Three in ranked order and for you to explain why you think number one is the best. Yeah. And then it's a yes, no, right. Or now let me take a closer look. But it's, it saves so much time. Uh, and I think what's important to, to pair that with, and I remember, uh, Reid Hoffman, so the cofounder of Linkedin, among many other things. I mean, the guy is incredible investor and critical guys. Couple guys, and I'll add, I'll add this. I mean, I've had him on this podcast so people can, can look it up, but he's also age from what I've experienced of him and many people who have experienced a genuinely happy guy. It's hard to overstate how rare that is among a lot of these folks. You would use,

Speaker 3:          01:02:56       how many people try to get out there and become successful as a, as a coping or, you know, this is gonna make me happier. This is going to make me happy. And then they get to the next level and they're still not happy and then they want to go to the next level. So that's brilliant.

Speaker 2:          01:03:06       Resumes. Yeah. And, uh, and he, uh, I mean you taught Wittgenstein classes at Oxford also like in his spare time. The dude is amazing. He's done a lot. And he was the fire, he was called, he was referred to as the firefighter in chief that's right by Peter Teal and uh, read, uh, hired a, a young guy named Ben Casnocha to be his chief of staff and to handle anything and everything. It's kind of like an aide to camp position if anyone from militaries listening. In any case, what he told Ben Really early on was, and I'm paraphrasing here, but you can have something like a 10 to 20% footfall rate footfalls just a tennis or a sports analogy. Like you can have a 10 to 20% error rate for the sake of speed. Like I want you to move quickly. I want you to figure things out on your own and like you're allowed to make mistakes.

Speaker 2:          01:03:58       I expect you to make like 10 to 20% mistakes and just try to not make this your margin. And when you tell people that and advance it, it also manages XP to help manage expectations. And it helps to encourage them to do what both of us are suggesting because otherwise they're like, well, I'm, if I'm afraid that I'm going to be punished for making every mistake or slight error, then I'm going to come to you with to try to get your opinion on everything because I don't want to get that negative right. Uh, suffer that negative consequence. That's really interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I read this study, uh, so just, uh, just a few more, uh, what is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love and I'll, I'll buy a little bit of time, uh, because when I say absurd or weird, I really do mean weirder. Absurd. So for instance, and you know, I take a screenshot anytime my phone says five 55, because

Speaker 3:          01:04:52       lucky number five 55, I screenshot at five 55. Are you serious? I cannot ask my husband. I screenshot. If anything is by 55, I'm, I'm a Weirdo with the number five. If I see a door that is like five, five, five, I do the same thing. I swear to you. That's crazy. I'm not kidding. I promise I've ever run into anyone else. I have a freak thing with fives. All right. Well we've, the universe has brought us here.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       That's crazy. No. All right. So that's one. Uh, then you have someone like say Cheryl strayed, who wrote wild and a hugely impressive woman's written a lot more than that. She'll rearrange sandwiches because she wants every bite to contain every layer of said sandwich. I could, she doesn't want there to be a clump of avocado on one half and so on. I get that. Right. But it's understandable. It's still pretty weird. Uh, so besides you're screenshotting, what other odd habits or absurd things do you do? I love

Speaker 3:          01:05:46       people think this is absurd. I just think it's sweet. But, um, I guess I'm not, I'm different. I cannot sleep at night unless I text my mom goodnight and say I love you. Oh, that's sweet. I've been doing it since I left home. I cannot sleep at night. I have to like last night I was so exhausted. I had been doing south by stuff all day and literally I had to roll over and get my phone and say, Goodnight Mommy, I love you. I just can't go to sleep without doing it. I know it sounds kind of crazy. I'm literally a grown woman. I was 28 years old. I just, I just would never be able to live with myself if the next day came and you don't get to see your mom again for whatever reason. And I just have to say goodnight and tell her I love her.

Speaker 2:          01:06:27       Great practice. And you could argue it's even more important the older you get. And that is, I would recommend everybody, people, people who have listened to this for a long time, a podcast, you're gonna be sick of hearing this, but read the tail end by Tim urban please. It really paints an incredible picture in a sense of urgency as it relates to interacting with your parents. And I think the number is something like, by the time you graduate from a May even be high school, I don't even think it's college. You have like 300 days or something that you've spent 80 plus percent of the time you will ever spend with your parents before they die. Something like that makes me like, and uh, so yeah, I think more people should do that.

Speaker 3:          01:07:01       So yeah, I guess you could call that upstart because you don't hear a lot of a lot of adults doing that. So it's probably classified as absurd. But I do think that it's important, you know, and no matter how busy you get, or no matter where you are in the world, but what's more important than your family? Nothing.

Speaker 2:          01:07:18       Yes. Yeah. That have a lot of close friends pass away this past 12 months in it's, and almost all of them are entirely unexpected. So you just don't know yet. You just don't know when your time is up or someone else's. So don't Save, don't save that stuff. Uh, in the last few years, could be five years, two years, doesn't really matter. But what new belief, habit, behavior, tool, anything has most positively impacted your life personally and not the company that your employees, but you, is there any new habit or belief, uh, breakthrough breakdown, anything that has ultimately ended up having a very strong positive impact on your life?

Speaker 3:          01:08:06       That's a really good question. Um, you know what? Turning my phone off from time to time, genuinely, that's helped me a lot. I think I've this insane tech addiction over the last few years, just bumble is on my phone. I mean literally everything goes through my phone. I'm communicating with people all day, every day and it's nonstop. And so turning it off, putting it in a drawer for 30 minutes is actually really helpful. All right, so last or second to last question is if you get put, can't be an advertisement, but a word, a phrase, a quote, question, anything on a billboard. So metaphorically getting this out to millions or billions of people, what might you put? Well, we did it. We put be the CEO your parents always wanted you to marry and we put that on bunch of billboards everywhere. We actually asked that exact question in the office. If we could share one message with the world and we had a budget to do it, well we put up there and that was really the sentiment that our team landed on.

Speaker 3:          01:09:04       It just speaks to everything we're trying to do with bumble. We want to encourage women to be equals and to be seen as equal and in any court ship through friendship or business or love, whatever that is, to really feel empowered and confident and to get out there and be whatever they want to be. Not Go and try to find that in someone else. You can find that in someone else but tried to do within. Also Whitney, thank you so much. Thank you so much. Where can people say hello to you?
