Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism living to show a medal.

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       This episode is brought to you by Peloton and I'd heard about Peloton over and over again, but I ended up getting a Peloton bike in the whole system. After I saw my buddy Kevin Rose, I've known him forever, some of you know, and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic. I asked him as it, dude, you look great, what the hell have you been up to? Because he's always doing a weird diet or another, but it only lasts like a week or two. So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers and he said, I've been doing Peloton five days a week now. That caught my attention because Kevin does nothing five days a week and you know, I love you Kevin, but it really peaked my curiosity, ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week.

Speaker 2:          00:01:11       I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling really boring usually, but peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into your home. You don't have to worry about fitting classes into your schedule or making it to a studio with some type of commute, etc. New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New York City instructors in your own living room. You can even livestream studio classes taught by the world's best instructors or find your own favorite class on demand and in fact, Kevin and I rarely do live classes and you can compete with your friends, which is also fun. Kevin, I'm coming after you, but we usually just use classes on demand. I really like Matt [inaudible] and his eye in high intensity training sessions that are shorter, like 20 minutes and I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone seems to have their favorite instructor or you can select by music duration and so on.

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking metrics. I think that that along with the realtime leaderboard are the main reasons that this caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before. It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep your attention. The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you would expect so it can fit in a living room or an office. I actually have it in a large closet, believe it or not and it fits with no problem.

Speaker 2:          00:05:59       Hello, boys and girls and demoss he caballeros. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers of all different types to tease out the tactics, habits, routines and so on that you can use. I am recording this intro and a Mexican airport after a top secret retreat doing top secret things, and maybe I'll talk more about that sometime, but this episode you're going to hear is with one of my favorite people, Tim O'reilly and I recorded this sometime ago and held onto it like a piece of gold to my chest to release at the right time at Tim O'reilly on Twitter. It's one of the most fascinating polymaths and autodidacts, one of the most curious minds I've ever encountered. He's been called the trend spotter in the world of tech and certainly involving wider macrotrends.

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       He's been called the oracle of Silicon Valley. He is the founder and CEO of O'reilly Media Inc. His original business plan was pretty simple, interesting work for interesting people and that's worked out pretty well. He's generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue at doing many, many different things around the media, delivers online learning, publishes books, runs conferences or just companies to create more value than they capture and tries to change the world by spreading and amplifying the knowledge of innovators. But as he would say himself, one of my favorite quotes of his, sorry for the noise. This is some audio verite for all of you guys, but he would say quote money in a business like gas in a car. You don't want to run out, but you're not doing a tour of gas stations. And we talk quite a bit about that. Tim has an incredible history of convening conversations that reshape the computer industry in 93 that's 1993 for you.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       Youngins he launched the first commercial website that was very Sean Connery, the first commercial website. And then in [inaudible] 98 he organized the meeting where the term open source. I've been speaking too much, Gus the Yanno. My English is not happening. Open source software. My God, let's try that again. He organized the meeting where the term open source, I swear to God, I'm not drunk guys. Open source software. It was agreed on and help the business world understand its importance. In 2004 with the web 2.0 summit. He defined how web 2.0 represented not only the resurgence of the web after the.com bust, but entirely new model for the computer industry based on big data, collective intelligence and the Internet as a platform. Web 2.0 is actually one of the conferences where the four hour workweek reached it's tipping point, so also thank you to Tim for that. In 2009 with his Gov 2.0 summit, he framed the conversation around the modernization of government technology that is shaped policy and spot initiatives at the federal, state and local level and all around the world. He has now turned his attention and is very focused on artificial intelligence, the implications, artificial intelligence, the on demand economy and other technologies that are transforming the nature of work and the future shape of the business world.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       He really has a both a 30,000 foot view of the larger shifts, the tectonic shifts that will produce changes in 10, 20, 30 years but is also on the ground and really in touch with the people who are shaping the details of how that will come to pass. And uh, his brand new book, which I encourage everybody to check out his WTF, what's the future and why it's up to us. And I will link to all of that in the show notes of course. And if you, if you'd like to Kevin Kelly, he is a bird of a feather with this fine jet, Tim O'Reilly. So without further ado, please enjoy this very wide ranging extremely for me. Certainly enjoyable conversation with Tim O'reilly.

Speaker 4:          00:09:45       Tim, welcome to the show. Thank you for making the time. Thanks for having me. I have been looking forward to this for some time and most recently your name came up because I was in a car in the back mountains surrounding. Part of it was Becca, Stan with Kevin Kelly and our friend Kevin Kelly on a very short list. When I asked him, who do you think I should absolutely have on the podcast? Tim O'reilly was one of the names that came up. So I also leaned on Kevin for some, some deep intel and suggested topics and questions. But I thought I would start with what's on everyone's mind, which is why are you similar to cookie monster?

Speaker 5:          00:10:29       Yes. Well, I often joke about myself, uh, you know, as a VC and a business person, uh, that I'm a little bit like the, um, some episode I remember for my kids were little on cookie monster. I made, I have this completely right, but he's on a game show and he has to pick his prize. And behind door number one is $1 million and they tell him that behind door number two is a chateau in France. And behind door number three is a cookie. And of course everybody knows what he picks. And, and what I like to say about myself is that I always go for the cookie. Uh, you know, because in some sense, you know, what I really care about, what's my cookie is a finding people who are doing something new and interesting that I think other people want to know about and that they can learn from. And you know, my whole business has been built around, you know, finding people who have cookies and then sharing it with the world.

Speaker 4:          00:11:30       So not, not to take the cookie monster discussion too far, but you didn't know this. I happened to be standing in a house where seasons one through 10 of sesame street. We're partly written. So many of the characters including cookie monster were actually written where I am standing. So it's coming back amazing. So it's come full circle. And when I bought the house, they were going to throw everything out. The former owners, including a season one staff jacket for sesame street, which of course I kept and uh, that is hanging in the doorway. But when we come back to ideas and we'll certainly spend a lot of time talking about publishing in many things that are perhaps a little more recent in your life, but I want to rewind the clock a bit and to start maybe with an odd story. Could you tell me about how your father, who my understanding was in neurologist also deeply religious injected radioactive copper isotopes into your arm? Is that a true story? Has Absolutely. Tell me I need some work on tax done.

Speaker 5:          00:12:47       It wasn't my dad who injected them. It was a guy named Leroy Shipley. He was the, the lab tech and Oh my God, he was amazing. He was very funny. But, uh, I was, uh, my best friend that I, and my best friend's sisters when I was 14 there, the girls were a little older, uh, agreed to, um, participate in a study of Wilson's disease, which was, it is a disease of the abnormal retention of copper in the body. It's a genetic disease. Um, my dad was a, you know, sort of a pioneer in early genetic medicine, also radio medicine and, uh, Wilson's disease was one of his specialties. And so they needed to have control subjects to understand how copper is excreta normally. And so they would inject us with radioactive copper. And then every day we went in and lay in this room with, it was massive thing, you know, it wasn't like today's a Mris, but it was just this whole room that was called a whole body counter.

Speaker 5:          00:13:42       And they, they, they kind of traced where the copper went accumulates in the liver, uh, in, in, uh, and then in the brain of people with Wilson's disease. And it's normally excrete it, uh, after, uh, about, uh, you know, some relatively small amount of time. So it was copper 64. It's got a half life or a few weeks. And so I presumably it was all gone. Uh, but if I ever come down with liver cancer, I may have my father to blame, but we think we actually did it twice. Uh, but, and again, he obviously took some thought about whether it was safe, because once we became lab rats for him, uh, there were other researchers who wanted us to do other experiments and he, you know, said, no, I don't want you to do that one. That doesn't seem, seem right to me. So, uh, he of course, used himself as a Guinea pig for, uh, for, uh, his experiments.

Speaker 4:          00:14:31       What did your mother do? I mean, you had, as I understand it, let's see, seven children total in the family. That's correct. What did your, I mean, that's certainly a fulltime job just to take care of the kids, but what, what did your mom spend her time doing primarily?

Speaker 5:          00:14:49       Uh, you know, I think taking care of seven is huge. I still remember her, one of my memories of my mom is her on her hands and knees in the bathroom, scrubbing the toilet, and she looks up and says, life is not a bowl of cherries are. Of course, the idea of my mom, uh, like, that brings up another great story about the time that she likes to tell. Uh, she was apparently, uh, you know, up on a piano stool trying to dust a light. And she fell flat on that. She fell off and it was lying flat on the floor. And my brother, James, he must've been eight or nine at the time, came running in from the school yard. We lived about a block from the school, sees her on the floor and says, mommy, what time is it? And she says, James, I don't know. And he goes, okay, and runs back out. And then later she said, what did you think I was doing lying on the floor? And he said, well, I don't know, maybe it dusting under the piano.

Speaker 5:          00:15:51       So she was basically, uh, uh, she was the old school, you know, I mean, she made every bit, I mean, I kind of went back and I go, shit, I should've made us do more of the work. You know, we had some chores, but basically she made all the beds. She, you know, you know, it was just, you know, it's a lot with seven kids. And again, of course, you know, the, the, uh, you know, I was in the older cohorts, so there were still, you know, young babies. Um, you know, and I think, um, the thing that's actually been been such a great delight to me in my life, my dad died very young, died at 60, uh, you know, so, and, and that's now, uh, you know, 40 years back. Um, and, uh, just, uh, my mom, uh, you know, later came to travel with me.

Speaker 5:          00:16:35       She would just come with me on, on, uh, my business trips. And she was just such a, a willing, interested travel. She was, she was a girl from the back of the mail and Yorkshire, you know, kind of grew up, uh, you know, uh, you know, from, uh, uh, actually, you know, the, the, the, uh, her parents and her grandparents before that were factory workers, but her dad was also a bookie, uh, you know, taking bets on horses back when it was illegal. And so, uh, she always would tell us stories, which for her were full of shame. But for us, we're full of romance of how she used to have to go collect Beth's from strangers in the park when she was a girl and the police would come, he'd have to light out over the back fence is, uh, we, we, we, we, we took great delight in the thought that, that, uh, we were descended from petty criminals.

Speaker 5:          00:17:21       I mean, again, of course by the time, you know, I was a teenager and went to visit, uh, the, it was legal and his son actually had the bedding business and a little betting shop. Um, but, uh, uh, it's, uh, it's a lot of fun and it actually brings up something that's completely irrelevant, but kind of a bit of pattern recognition. Uh, you know, the fact that here was a guy who, you know, had a living doing something that was illegal and then when it became legalized, he was able to do it. And, uh, uh, it, um, made me think of what's happening right now with, um, uh, you know, with weed in, in places like California where it's been legalized. And, um,

Speaker 6:          00:18:10       mmm,

Speaker 5:          00:18:12       uh, sorry, I'm trying to think of the, the head of the San Francisco Foundation, um, was over at dinner and, um, you know, we're, we're, we're talking about various issues and, and uh, he says, uh, this is Fred Blackwell. He says, well, what about the weed problem? I said, what do you mean the weed problem? He says, well, you know, there's all these people coming in now and they're making all this money selling weed. And the only people who can't participate in this new economy are all the black and brown people who have convictions on their record for selling weed. You know, and, and, you know, it's just that kind of interesting thing that we don't think about. You know, when we changed the rules, what do we do about the people who, you know, played by the old rules, the new rules. And that just kind of leads me down the path of a lot of what's broken and our society is, you know, this sort of layering of ideas that change, but they change in completely, uh, people have this, you know, effectively bad map of the world.

Speaker 5:          00:19:23       It doesn't work anymore. And uh, you know, same kind of thing. Again, a lot of the work that we do at code for America, my wife's nonprofit is around, you know, fixing some of these things. Yeah. We do a lot of work and a expunging, you know, low level, you know, uh, offenses. That's why we were talking with Fred. Um, you know, from people's record, they pass something called prop 47 here in California and there was something like 30, $40 million spent to pass this proposition. But the implementation, nobody thought about it. And so a tiny fraction of the people who are eligible have actually done it. And the same thing we saw with the healthcare.gov failure back in 2013, you know, people pass policies and they don't actually think about how are we going to do it? How are we going to actually do this thing?

Speaker 5:          00:20:13       You know, so right now if you want to clear your record, you have to go get your, you know, go to the DA's office and you pick up this form and then you go somewhere else and get it signed by someone. And you know, these are people who don't have the time to go, you know, spend months on this process. You know, if they were going to pass this, you know, they could have thought through how are we going to make this easier for people. And a lot of the work that we do, the other work we do things like a w we work on improving access to um, you know, food aid. And we got brought in, uh, because they didn't really understand why people were signing up and then falling off the program and then signing up again immediately. And it was just administrative stuff that people didn't know how to comply with and they didn't have any measurement.

Speaker 5:          00:21:00       You know, in the tech world, you know, people have gotten very used to ab testing and measuring things and understanding, oh, this, this is, this is where people are falling out of our pipeline. This is where things don't work. And a lot of what we've ended up building at code for America are our alternate pathways that are designed to teach us about what's wrong. You know, so we're, we're, we're sort of their exploratory, a Jen, my wife Jen Pahlka calls it apps to ops. You know, we're basically building apps that actually do let us follow the users so we can say, Oh, you know, here you are losing some number of people because your application takes 45 minutes to fill out. And there are people who are trying to do this in libraries where there is a 30 minute timeout and you have no mechanism for them to save their work.

Speaker 5:          00:21:51       You know, stuff like that. Or, you know, hey, you know, uh, you're telling people their documents are uploaded successfully, but they're not, you know, or you're sending out, uh, uh, you know, in some counties they were sending out, uh, you know, letters about people's appointments that they were hers to make. And they would come in, uh, they would come out 25% of them or some significant fraction. We come out after the date of the appointment and they didn't know it. That was the worst part. Not It was bad enough that it was happening, but they didn't know it at the same thing. True. You know, we, we work, uh, uh, you know, a lot with at the federal level, under Obama, uh, generous, uh, deputy CTO and help set up something called the United States digital service. And, you know, a lot of the problems at the Va were very similar.

Speaker 5:          00:22:36       People would be applying, uh, from library computers, you know, homeless vets and they couldn't get through the process. And, you know, basically the people in Washington w, you know, the Va headquarters for saying, well, they're obviously not eligible because they're not succeeding. And you know, they had tested and you know, the, the, the, the procurement process meant, oh yeah, we have to test this APP. But they tested it with a particular combination of Internet explorer and Adobe software. And that wasn't what was out there in the real world and it didn't work. And so they went out and just film the users and then they were able to go see, look, it really doesn't work. And in some ways that's been my life. You know, it's funny because code for is that have a latest incarnation or one of the latest incarnations of that. But when I was early in my career, you know, it was just like, oh, this is not, you know, doing documentation, you know, writing down the steps. I still remember working with one author on one of our early books and he said, I can't write this chapter yet. And I said, that's what he said. I said, why? And he said, because the software doesn't work. And I said, that's what you have to write because

Speaker 7:          00:23:47       you know, while you're sitting here not getting this book done and this, this piece of the, of the software that doesn't work, people are beating their heads against the wall and they think it's them telling them that it doesn't work is actually the documentation that's needed right now.

Speaker 4:          00:24:05       Uh, so I want to underscore something, see this question of how can we make x easier for people or why isn't, why easier for people? And I do want to rewind just a little bit because I, and many people are very interested in how you think and how that leads to, for instance, identifying edges. I mean, you've been a great pioneer on the edge of many different frontiers. So I want to go back to not necessarily the bookie, but to, to ask what, well, first of all, this is just personal curiosity. What do your other siblings do these days as professions or any examples?

Speaker 5:          00:24:48       Well, let me kind of go through my, um, uh, my oldest brother, uh, has had a pastiche of careers. He owns a small fleet of taxi cabs where he's been competing with, uh, with, uh, with, uh, Uber and Lyft and, and, you know, kind of fulminating against the taxi system. He, you know, he would like to be able to operate like Uber and Lyft and can't, you know, and, and, uh, um, uh, he also runs a, a a business reselling used books, including mine on Amazon. So he's kind of in these, and unfortunately he's dealing with two very, uh, uh, declining industries. Uh, and, uh, he, um, uh, uh, my, my next brother as run a small publishing company that I started with him called travelers tales, which a row basically was a story based approach to travel, you know, rather than guide books, which tell you, uh, in a what to do.

Speaker 5:          00:25:49       It was like more like people sharing their experiences so you can go, oh, yeah, that sounds like exactly what I want as opposed to kind of like the catalog approach. And, uh, uh, so he's big, been a travel writer for many years. And then, uh, my, uh, all of my sisters, uh, have basically, uh, just, uh, have raised families. Uh, although it's interesting, a very heavy percentage of homeschooling in, in my family. And, uh, so that's, so they've been teachers as well as, as a, uh, as parents. My younger brother, frank is a builder, a in ecology, be basically built, um, uh, uh, a house to live in and a, and never looked back. You know, it was like, they went, I think it was a junior, he had a friend built the house that they, they went and lived in and then they weren't, this was great. So they rented it to some other students, uh, the, uh, uh, and then built one over the summer

Speaker 7:          00:26:44       and lived in that and then, you know, anyway, so he started, uh, and it's kind of funny because he's really built the hope. He still lives near the college he lived in and he's built, you know, the church, the school, the library, you know, the, uh, the home is that many of the people live in. And he now has a, you know, kind of a business that's a rental businesses, some actually fabulous places he's built on the Shenandoah river that, uh, uh, he ran since kind of interesting because he's actually been a lot like me and that he built his business just intuitively from the ground up by following his nose. And what was so interesting though, when we were growing up, if you had asked my mom, she would have said that frank and I were the most dissimilar. Why is that? Well, because, you know, I was always the top student in school and he was, you know, he got D's And F's and you know, and we were with my brothers and I were always say, no, no, he just isn't interested in it because we would see him at home.

Speaker 7:          00:27:42       You know, when he was 10 years old, he, he got totally obsessed with the civil war and he'd read it was reading Bruce Cat and then all the history, you know, he did a lot, lots and lots of history and, you know, and, and setting up these enormous recreation's of battles of the civil war. And we were, he's just not interested in school. And, uh, you know, I, and, and so, you know, just sort of interesting watching. He's, you know, he's, he's, uh, seven years younger than I am, but watching him kind of have the same path of building his own business, uh, you know, creating a lot of value for the people around him, uh, uh, and, and, and pivoting as necessary. You know, he, he got into the, the, uh, even though he started with this sort of rental thing in college to be, it was basically building and selling homes. Uh, and then after the 2008 financial crisis, nobody would finance, uh, you know, homes unless you had cash. So he basically, but you could borrow for a business property. So he ended up, you know, building, he had these lots and started building places then renting them and he actually got pretty good at it. So he, he, uh, you know, he is a variety of, of businesses and a [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          00:28:53       What, what advice would you give to a parent who has a kid currently, like your brother who's clearly very, very bright but just doesn't seem to be interested in school and therefore is getting poor grades? What would you, what would you say to someone like that parent in that position?

Speaker 7:          00:29:12       It's a, it's a, it's sort of a tough one because sometimes you do have to push kids. I think the main thing, and this is true, whether you're a parent with your kids or whether you're, uh, you know, a business person or just somebody trying to solve problems in your own life is having an attitude of receptivity and openness and looking really looking and understanding what's going on. I mean, you know, at the end of the day, uh, there are no recipes and so many problems come from, you know, people following recipes or following maps that don't match the reality. And you know, like frank didn't match the, the, you know, the recipe of what you were supposed to do in school, but it was pretty clear. He w he was following his own path. Same thing's true, uh, of, uh, you know, I have two daughters and one of them school was easy.

Speaker 7:          00:30:10       She always did well. The other one, you know, not so well, but she was like totally following her own path. And she's become this amazing sound artists, these artists and residents of the exploratorium, uh, you know, created a, you know, uh, uh, you know, an iPhone app for something called rhythm necklace is this different way of visualizing, know rhythm. Uh, she's sort of exploring medieval hocket and, and she's, you know, scored stuff for, uh, you know, Bjorks biophilia tour and, uh, you know, created a, you know, the sort of all these sort of odd musical instruments. Just totally built her own curiosity driven pass into the world. And, and uh, you know, so the, the, the thing I guess I would just say is like, look at your kid. You know, there's a wonderful book, I forget the name of the author. Um, it's called loving every child. Uh, and it's about a guy, uh, in Nazi Germany. Uh, he, he basically had two schools and, um, one was, you know, for, uh, children of, you know, so wealthy, you know, Germans, uh, you know, and then the other was a segregated school for Jews. And when they came to take his Jewish kids, he went with them and died in the concentration camp. And, uh, sorry, um, uh, funny how we can forget those things.

Speaker 7:          00:31:41       Uh, but anyway, but it does, the point of the book is, is, you know, if I love your children, look at them, understand them, and listen to them. And, and, uh, the thing that I think, you know, the, you know, treat them as people. I mean, a lot of people treat their kids as objects. You know, I've been in a room with people where they talk about their kids when they're there, as if they don't, you know, they don't listen. They're not there, you know, or they just, um, you know, as the kids are on show or they're, uh, you know, told what to do and, and yeah. You know, it's like treat them like you would want to be treated. You know, I guess I felt like I did my best, you know, as a parent, parenting is a hard job, you know, to just be there with your kids and, and, uh, talk with them and listen to them. What, are there any questions that you'd like

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       to ask your kids a lot. Are there any uh, or questions that you've taught them to ask themselves? This might seem like a non sequitur, but it's what came to mind for me.

Speaker 7:          00:32:52       So good. I, you know, uh, I, I wish I had an easy answer to it and I don't, um,

Speaker 2:          00:32:59       that's okay. I don't have kids. I don't have any answers to it. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:33:03       Well, the one thing that I, I, this is not a question, but that, you know, there's one piece of life advice that I give in the form of a quote. It's almost like a psychiatrist named urban yellow, who is also a novelist. And he wrote a novel called when nature wept, uh, which is, uh, an imagined, um, uh, the story of early psychoanalyst, a analysis. Actually Pre Freud, there was a guy who was a predecessor to Freud and it's, it's basically him, uh, analyzing nature. There's this one line in it that really stuck in my head as lions do sometimes from books. And it was, um, uh, first we'll what is necessary and then log what you will. And you know, it, it does have to do with the one thing that I think we do have to teach our children. Oh Wow. There's a lot of things we have to teach our children. But one of them is that everything doesn't come easily. And there are some things that you have to do that you don't want to do. And one of the secrets of success in life is to first, you know, we'll those things and then come to love them. And you think about that with exercise, the great example, you know what I mean? Once you know, it's like, it's, it's hard to get started, but once you get in into it, it becomes a joy.

Speaker 7:          00:34:33       And, uh, there are a lot of things that are like that, you know, doing the dishes, cleaning the house, uh, you know, looking after other people and, and so, you know, sort of understanding how having an understanding of, of what your responsibilities are and then working at them if necessary with will until they become something that you love is just an incredibly useful piece of life advice.

Speaker 2:          00:35:06       So I'm definitely going to want to come back and talk about what you've, what you have personally found difficult or difficult moments, but I want to ask about a decision that you made. And this is transitioning from a classics degree, uh, to writing technical manuals, uh, for lack of a better descriptor. You could certainly give some more context, but how did that happen and why did you decide to

Speaker 7:          00:35:37       trend in that direction? Well, it, it, it was pretty simple. First of all, let me give a little context for the classics. Um, I had worked in the early seventies when I was actually just even a teenager with a guy named George Simon who, uh, had developed this theory about the evolution of consciousness and also about, uh, sort of a, a sort of an experiential approach to, um, you know, kind of inner spiritual growth. You know, I could kind of go into it in more detail, um, but let me just, and, but one of his ideas was that the had been this profound evolution of consciousness over time. Uh, and then there was a sort of a historical art to it and that we were in a period of a sort of individuation that had really begun in classical Greece. Um, and yeah, you know, there are actually books like grittiness, Nell's, the discovery of the mind where you can kind of see this, you know, that when they talk about, you know, in home or, uh, you know, uh, [inaudible], uh, doesn't decide to do something.

Speaker 7:          00:36:49       You know, Athena puts this idea into his two mosques, his liver, and he acts. And then by the time, you know, 400 years later, you know, you know, when you're reading about Socrates, you're seeing them wrestling with these ideas that really are at the heart of, you know, what is truth? What is justice? What is, you know, uh, you know, uh, what is happiness? And, uh, but that was sort of the subject of my thesis in classics was really about, uh, it was about mysticism and logic and in Plato of, because they would kind of talk about, well, you know, these mystical passages, he must've been influenced by the orthotics. And I'm like, no, you know, these things that we now kind of rehearse, you know, like ideas of justice. They were incredibly new and powerful and yes, they felt like, uh, you know, these mystical kind of things that they were wrestling with.

Speaker 7:          00:37:41       And, and, uh, but anyway, but I digress. But, so the point of the reason I was interested in classics was deeply connected with George's theory because I was into like, okay, we're now entering into, he had this idea that we were entering into this new phase of global consciousness. And as a real irony, because my long detour into tech, uh, was, uh, it turned out not to be a detour at all because who would have thought that, you know, uh, you know, I'm trying to think how much longer, 30 years later, I would be kind of the profit of global consciousness in the form of web today and mediated by technology. But to answer your question very specifically, uh, it was, you know, uh, my, my wife and I have been talking about having kids. She was saying, you know, I have about six, she was seven years old and I, I wasn't, she was ready before I was

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       and I was 24 and I basically said, you know, one day I said, I'm ready. You know, she had been saying what some kids, and I said, okay, I'm ready. And, and the very next day, uh, I still remember it, you know, these three things happen on the same day and it was almost like a sign. One of them. Uh, well I guess the, the, the main thing I would just say is once I decided it was sort of like, oh, I have to start really being the breadwinner, I have to be a provider. And it was sort of like a, a light gun, you know, switch got flicked, you know, it was like, wow, daddy juice kicked in. And uh, you know, I had been, uh, so I, uh, the, the three things that happen the day of that decision or the day after that decision, one, it was, it was not really meaningful other than, uh, just a psychological boost.

Speaker 5:          00:39:29       Uh, I had a friend who was dating the Philippine ambassador to the UN and he was trying to remember a quote from loud and she knew that I was really deeply into Lao Tzu. And uh, so yeah, she called me up to say, Hey, my aunt and my friend needs this quote free speech. He's going to give it to you, ed. You could, you could, you know, it was, and it was just kind of cool air. I am as you know, this kid being asked as a source for this speech that gave me a boost. The other thing was, uh, I got approached by another friend to write a book about Frank Herbert, which is the scent. And the thing that ended up convincing me that I was a writer. And then, uh, the third thing was I had this friend who was a programmer who got asked to write a manual and I said I would help him. And so in some ways it was a, you know, like I made the decision and then magically, uh, the, all the pieces arrived on the table, you know, for me to start assembling the puzzle of my life

Speaker 4:          00:40:32       or I need perhaps you also, I just had the selective attention. Yeah. To spot those things. I've had a couple of questions I don't want to gloss over this. One day I woke up and I said, I am ready. Yeah. What triggered that? It was there a conversation you had in your head over that cup of coffee that morning? Was there a realization what, what actually led you to proclaim that you are ready?

Speaker 5:          00:40:57       Let me kind of go back to George Simon because a lot of what he taught was a kind of a, a kind of mental discipline. And that was rooted in a model of how consciousness happens. And it was, uh, it was sort of framed somewhat in the language of, of uh, Alfred Korzybski is general semantics. Uh, cause he had this wonderful diagram that he drew. It was actually a tool that he used to train people. He called the structural differential. And of course Lipsky's fundamental idea was that people are

Speaker 7:          00:41:34       stuck in language, but language is about something. And so he represented the process of what he called the process of abstraction so that people could kind of ask themselves, where are you in that process? And so the structural differential ha, the first part was a parabola. Uh, you know, and the idea was the reason why it's a parabola is because reality is infinite, but we can't take in all of reality. And so hanging from the parabola was a circle. And the circle was our experience, which is our first abstraction from reality. And then hanging from the circle are a bunch of, you know, a label shaped tags, like multiple strings of them. And these are the words that we use to describe our experience. And Chris Sinski's training was for people to recognize when they were in the words, when they were in the experience, when they were open to the reality. And George kind of mix that in with, uh, this, uh, work of, of, uh, Sri Aurobindo who was, uh, you know, uh, Indian sage and kind of had come up with a model that kind of an integrated, kind of a spiritual view of this m and a practice, which was a kind of, of just listening, you know, being open to the unknown.

Speaker 7:          00:42:56       Is that an active, is that, yes, it's a tactic thing. You know, you, you, you, you know, it's just like, uh, you can see when somebody is doing it, but it's just like letting go, letting things come in.

Speaker 1:          00:43:09       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:43:10       And then actually letting, if you do it correctly, what starts to happen is you start feeling things and you don't really know what they are. They don't match. You know, it's not like, you know, you, you put your hand on a table and you feel the table, but there's kind of a spiritual energy that you feel and you sit with it and eventually ideas for him. You'll see this actual process that was described by the, the, the structural differential you can actually use as a spiritual practice and you're wrestling with a problem. Like, am I ready to have kids? You're not sitting there down in the labels saying, you know, pros and cons, you know, there are people who do that, right? But using this approach, you simply say, you know, uh, you know, let me pose this as a problem to this infinite universe and let me sit in an attitude of receptivity and listen to one answer counts. And I think this is what a lot of people mean by prayer. Uh, but, but it's really interesting to put it in the context of perception because this same process happens in the real world. You know, it, it is what happens. You know, there's these things outside you and you don't really look at them

Speaker 7:          00:44:24       and no, you don't take them in and then, you know, but so there's sort of this, so basically the answer is I kind of said, am I ready? I just had this attitude of openness and this, this internal process that goes on. And then one day it just crystallizes and the label that hangs off that moment, the first label is, I'm ready, you know? And then the next label is, uh, you know, here are these, these things that I'm going to do. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:44:53       So I am fascinated by this. The, did you pose the question then? I have a number of friends, uh, Josh Waitzkin, who's best known as the inspiration for the book and the movie searching for Bobby Fischer, who's thought of as a chess prodigy. But there's a lot more than that. Reid Hoffman also as a similar approach to journaling where they will pose a question to themselves, the day or the night prior to when they journal in the morning for you. Did you pose this question at a particular time when, uh, and you know, maybe there are, is this, is this something that you have used in other places?

Speaker 7:          00:45:35       Oh, absolutely. I mean, you know, for me, I mean at that particular time, you know, when I was younger and closer to that as, you know, a big part of my daily work, uh, I think it was just sort of a natural outflow. I mean, at the time what I was doing for a living was actually teaching these techniques. So it was sort of, you know, I lived and breathed this stuff. Um, and, but, but it's, it's, it's continued to be this key part of my life. Whenever I'm confronted with a problem, you know, you find yourself wrestling and you go, oh wait, I'm just rearranging the labels.

Speaker 2:          00:46:10       Could you give me a useful, could you give me a real world example from your life? Um, or a hypothetical? Uh, but yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:46:18       Well let me, let me give you a very, you know, um, a specific business example. It's not quite the same in the end that it wasn't, um, you know, kind of this explicitly enter

Speaker 7:          00:46:31       process, but it was certainly an outgrowth. Oh, it actually, it wasn't an or process. I take it back. Uh, so I had, and this is my sort of my contribution to the evolution of the open source movement. So I was sitting there and I had been part of this Unix community and this Internet community and I noticed something and what I noticed was that the people, for the most part, the people that I knew from Unix, which is really represented by people who are around this community of this conference called use next. And then the people from the Internet who were kind of would meet over the IATF with relatively few exceptions, didn't overlap. Right. And then they did overlap with my life because I was publishing books about, you know, both work coming out of both of these communities. And I thought, I want to bring them together, but something was

Speaker 8:          00:47:30       stopping me. You know, like I had this idea, I wanted to, uh, you know, get people from the community. And I started thinking about it and I kept delaying and delaying and delaying and it was like there was something, um, that was not letting me do it.

Speaker 7:          00:47:49       And then one, you know, and I was, I was at one and then Netscape announced that they were going to, to release, uh, what later became Mozilla as free software. I went, Damn, I'm too late. You know, I've, I've done this, I should, you know, kind of moved on this sooner. It's now starting to become a story about it, a free software and why it's important. And, and, uh, and, and then I got kicked me into gear and I organize this event that I first called the free, where summit, where I invited in people from all of these different communities. And it was at that meeting that, uh, Eric Raymond said, well, you know, we were meeting a couple of weeks ago and Christine Peterson came up with this new name open source software because you know, free software has these, these problems, uh, you know, as, as a, as a name.

Speaker 7:          00:48:39       And we voted on it and they all agreed to use, you know, free software has, uh, that, yeah, I mean, open source software as this name. And we, I had organized a press conference at the end of the day even though I didn't know what the outcome was going to be and we kind of, you know, I put people up on this stage and said, look at all these guys, they all have dominant market share in these interesting categories of software and they all have this thing in common. They give their software away for free. Uh, you know, and we've come together and we've decided on a new name for it. We're calling it open source software. And the thing that was sort of interesting about that was first of all, yes, I noticed that something was wrong in the map of the world. You know, that basically people who were talking about free software, we're only talking about Linux and it was his whole other world of free software over on the Internet side that was left out because the dialogue was, you know, about, you know, the battle against Microsoft and the PC and so on.

Speaker 7:          00:49:34       And so I just kind of, you know, so I was just sitting with it, you know, and, and, and trying to think about what to do and that sitting and the attitude of receptivity, it was something very similar that kind of happened in some sense. One day, you know, this thing happened. It was I something that uses the analogy of you're doing a puzzle and you can't solve it. And then somebody dumps new pieces on the table, right? And then you go, oh, there that one go, it fits right in. And that's exactly what happened there. But that waiting, that waiting is this psych part of the psychological process. You know, like if you're sort of simple, if you kind of have this engineering mindset, well, we're just going to go and work with all the pieces that we have, you know, you may not get to the right answer.

Speaker 7:          00:50:16       And, and, and so this, this receptivity to the unknown, you know, and I actually often think of soccer thieves in this regard. He referred to something, he called these diamonds, you know, just like listening to this inner voice that would tell him yes or no. And I also think there's this great line that recurs a continually, and my favorite translation and loud Su, uh, the way of life according to law suit by Winter Benner and as the line is, he has his no, and he has his yes. And listening to that no. And that, yes. So, uh, you know, I had this know about, I'm not ready to have a child. And then one day I had a yes, and I had this, no, I'm not ready to bring all these people together. And then I had a yes. And the fact that that there's this, yeah, like I had no way of knowing that this new term had been introduced, but if I had had my meeting a month earlier, the term open source software would not have been there to be picked up at my meeting.

Speaker 4:          00:51:23       Hmm.

Speaker 7:          00:51:25       You know, and you, you can't, you can't miss a mystery. Why is it that, you know, like, I didn't know that, but some things stopped me and I was kind of kicking myself, but like listening to that inner voice that just said, oh, I'm not, and then one day it's like, yes, know he has his note and then he has his yes. Or she has her. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:51:44       So I, I think that you, and I might, I don't know if you drink alcohol, but if you do, then maybe this is more of a conversation for several bottles of wine. But I do love what I'm about to bring up. So you mentioned a deceased, Aka Ulysses and the sort of, uh, uh, God planting an idea or desire in his liver. Right. And then you have a flash forward to, I think you had mentioned Plato and grappling with this concept of justice and then you know, what seemed to mystical now being part of the norm. Is our consciousness evolving or uh, looking back at the framework that you were discussing with the parabola then abstraction. So we have reality than it abstraction of experience and a further abstraction of language. Are we just getting further from reality or are they the same thing? Evolving consciousness and getting further from that direct experience of greater reality? Well,

Speaker 7:          00:52:46       you know, I think it's different. I mean, when you say we, if you mean all of humanity, I think we're all uh, know rediscovering, you know, that process in our lives. You know, um, I, I think, uh, societies can get further or closer, uh, individuals can get further or closer, but I think as a whole we have in fact taken in more and more of that parabola. You know, the, the, the circle has gotten bigger and the, the, the, the useful, you know, labels have gotten bigger. Also, many of them have gotten, you know, things would get mislabeled. But I, you know, if you think I, and this was sort of another piece of what I learned from, from George Simon, and it really was this idea that that is our work. Our work is to take in more of the unknown and to bring it into our experience and to bring it into our knowledge. And there's always more, you know, George used to have this great formulation, he referred to God as et Cetera, all the rest.

Speaker 2:          00:54:00       I love it.

Speaker 7:          00:54:01       Yeah. And I love that it, you know, and it's just sort of, for me, it's, it's a useful, not just mental construct, but psychological construct, you know, and it comes up for me, you know, the way I, the way I, you know, when I have an idea like this, I just see it everywhere. You know, it used to be this, I mean, it still is, I think this, this, um, mock Tarot deck called Morgan's Taro. I've never seen, it was just, it was popular in the 70s. I don't know if it's still available anywhere, but it had these, these, uh, fabulous cards. And my favorite card was always the one, it was basically a blank card with the caption. Always remember this, always remember, you know, and it was just that moment of just listening to the silence. And, um, you know, when you have that ability to listen to the silence, you also have the ability to, uh, you know, take things in a different way and see the world fresh.

Speaker 7:          00:54:59       So, so that I think about Morgan's through. But I also think about, uh, about a Wallace Stevens, my, one of my favorite poets, uh, you know, uh, an ordinary evening in new haven. We keep coming back and back to the rail, to the hotels and not to the hymns that fall on it, out of the wind. Uh, you know, uh, uh, you know, reality is the beginning, not the end that the naked Alpha, not the higher infant and mega, you know, he's kind of talking about the way that our mind endlessly elaborates on what he calls the eyes of the eyes, plane, something vulgar of experience. Um, you know, and it has all the great line, you know, um, a poem is the cry of it's occasion, a part of the thing and not about it. You know, this dialogue between the mind and the stuff that we engage with in the world, you know, is our life.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       Uh, there's so many directions we could go. Uh, I, well, I'm going to tie this into a later question, but I wanted to flash back to Frank Herbert. You mentioned the name and in, in passing, uh, you wrote, as you mentioned, you as an opportunity to write a biography. It's correct me if I'm wrong, but a Frank Herbert who is the author of the Dune series, Dune is

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       one of those fiction books, the first UN that shaped a lot of how I look at the world in some pretty, uh, wide reaching ways. Uh, why did you decide to undertake that? Were there any lessons that you took away from studying his life or his work?

Speaker 5:          00:56:46       I, you know, again, it was a complete serendipity. When my friend Dick Riley asked me, yeah, when I write this book, he had been appointed the editor of this new series of, you know, critical monographs, detective novelist and science fiction novelist. Uh, uh, you know, I first said, oh, I wanted to write about Samuel Delaney who was at the time, my favorite writer because I had a, I love the little book of his called Empire Star, which was as you might expect about the nature of consciousness. And, and, and Dick was one said, no, no, no, I think a book on herb, you know, we'll do much better. You should really do, do, do. And I had loved doing, well, I have a very funny story about it going back to my childhood when I think I read it when I was 12 and I got it from the library on. And I remember my dad picked me up from the lake or said library in San Francisco. And I was used to get, you know, you could check out eight books and they'll get eight, you know, big books. And, you know, he looks at this and he says it's sinful. So larger books should be devoted to science fiction. So I couldn't quite bring myself when I wrote the Frag herb book to dedicate it to my father with that. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:57:56       Ah,

Speaker 5:          00:57:57       eh. Uh, but, uh, anyway, but, but yeah, I was really grateful to Dick Because, uh, you know, I do, I can't, I mean, I had loved doing, but getting deeper into it and spending time with frank, you know, it was definitely one of the, you know, he was, he was the other, you know, I've had multiple fathers in my life, which is a wonderful thing. You know, people who've kind of helped shape me, you know, and it does make me think that one of the things that you know is so missing in our culture is that we don't have enough fathers, mothers, you know, sort of like when, when you think about, you know, how we were meant to be raised, you know, in, in these communities, you know, the, uh, you know, the, the, the sort of, the nuclear family is kind of a crime against humanity.

Speaker 5:          00:58:50       That's a strong word, but just like, how do we build stronger communities? Because I think in my life, you know, how important it was to have people who said, you're special, you know, and I know you deeply and I see something in you. And just to expect that, like, you know, to adult parents and the only people who can do that for you. Yeah. How do we build richer communities of adults who help model and shape our children? So I was just super lucky because I had my own dad and I had George Simon and then it had frank Herbert and I had, yeah, my, uh,

Speaker 7:          00:59:22       my ex wife's father Jack, the guy named Jack Feldman, who kind of inspired me to think about business. And yeah, it was just so interested as I built my business. You know, when he died, it was almost like I had been leaning on this wind and I almost fell over, you know, because it was, it was just like I hadn't realized just how much is continued to interest was feeding me, you know, it's like, Eh, and uh, you know, the, the love and interest we can give to other people is such a gift.

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       Did you spend, and I apologize that I don't know this, but I suppose it'd be boring if I knew all the answers to my questions for this. Uh, did you spend time with Frank Herbert or was it

Speaker 7:          01:00:01       oh yeah, I did. I did. You know, I the, um, and it was, it was, it was funny because I met with him two or three times when I was writing. I did two books. The first book was this, uh, you know, critical biography. And it was just really about his books as much as about his life. Um, and it only went up through, uh, uh, doing messiah. You know, none of the later doing books had been written and that point, which is fortunate because they were just basically, you know, he was kind of milking the

Speaker 2:          01:00:30       milking the golden franchises,

Speaker 7:          01:00:34       whereas the first three books were really conceived of as a whole from the beginning. Uh, but, uh, and then the second book was a collection of his essays. So I, I basically, which I, you know, I edited it and an interview, so I interviewed him on the road for the first book. He would, you know, be at some science fiction convention and so on. So I interviewed him two or three times, I think in that period. Then what was sort of frustrating was I wanted to get below the surface. He was, he was sort of like, he was a brilliant conversation list and he kind of would, you know, just very inspiring ideas about how we have to live on the edge of crisis. And it's what keeps us alive. And you know, it just, you know, it was just a fount of fascinating ideas and, uh, you know, so it was scintillating stuff that, you know, if you could do a do these interviews, they, you know, you could publish them immediately, you know, but I kind of wanted to get under the surface and learn more about who he was and how he thought and, but I couldn't because he was sort of on, cause he was on tour.

Speaker 7:          01:01:36       Right. And then when I did the second book where I was like, I need some more of these sort of frank on fire interviews.

Speaker 2:          01:01:43       I went through it. He

Speaker 7:          01:01:44       was home in Port Townsend, Washington. I know we hung out for a couple of days. And uh, yeah, he was just mellow and relaxed and I kind of learned all I got to know him and you know, but it wasn't all this great material and it was sort of like, I got the interviews in the wrong order. So anyway, but he was a, he was a really wonderful guy, uh, who, you know, thought very deeply about the world, had very prescient ideas about the things that, uh, you know, continue to bedevil us today. I think of many great lines, you know, uh, um, from his books all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:02:21       Fear, fear is the mind killer. Yes. And the desert and there's so many good lines. If you were to, so I was a nonfiction purist for a very, very long time, for decades. I'm embarrassed in retrospect to admit this, but I was of the mind for a very long time that if I wanted to make stuff up, I could do that in my own head. And I want it to actually learn things. By reading nonfiction, I've realized how, at least for me, how off that was and how many deep truths are better transmitted through fiction, uh, for nonfiction addicts who are willing to have an intervention and read a few fiction books. Are there any that you would suggest that you might suggest people start with,

Speaker 7:          01:03:08       Ooh, that's so tough.

Speaker 2:          01:03:10       Or to make it less pressured a few of your favorites?

Speaker 7:          01:03:15       Well, look this certain way, uh, you know, books that have sort of shaped my life. I mean, doing definitely one of them. Uh, I highly recommend that, uh, is, uh, another, uh, fantasy book. I always not really fantasy in the sense of, you know, heroic fantasy that people think it is a book called Islandia, uh, written. Uh, it was actually a personal passion project of a Boston lawyer named Austin tapping. Right. Uh, it was just an imaginary world. Uh, it was, it was probably the closest analog in the real world is New Zealand. Uh, you know, was this pastoral country somewhere in the southern hemisphere that had been closed off to Western civilization. The guy started writing it in like 19, 10, and uh, uh, he died in a car accident in 1930 or so, and in the mid forties, 43, I think it was, his daughter had carved out of his, you know, writings about some imaginary world, this book Islandia, which was published and it actually made it up to I think number three on the New York Times bestseller list.

Speaker 7:          01:04:18       And it was rediscovered in the 70s, which is when I came across it. Wonderful Guide to kind of the values of, you know, living a slower life because it's all about this guy who's, uh, you know, his roommate at Harvard class of ought six, uh, was a, uh, uh, was from Islandia. And so he learns to speak Islandia and, and then when they're trying to open up the country, he gets tapped. It becomes the console and he's sort of struggling with, you know, the kind of like the modern way of life versus this. I land in way of life in it. A lot of people I've tried to give it to find it too slow. Um, but what a rich Cornucopia of wisdom is in that book. Um, you know, in terms of, of, uh, of, uh, you know, classics.

Speaker 9:          01:05:06       I mean,

Speaker 7:          01:05:07       you can't do better than Jane Austin. I mean for an understanding. And, you know, the, the human soul, I still remember discovering pride and prejudice. I think I was

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       14 and that was a little embarrassed to be reading what I saw was as a girl book. Yeah. For sure. But it was like so good. And, uh, uh, in a similar vein, I, I've come to love Anthony Trollope, uh, uh, because he's just, he's like, let's get this plot stuff out of the way. I just want to talk about the people and the ice. He read a book like the warden that you kind of go, I'm, oh my God, I'm reading a novel about the moral quandaries of an 1850s British cleric and it's fricking fast.

Speaker 5:          01:05:53       Uh, uh, I think of another, uh, uh, a book when I read, uh, what was it called? Night train to Lisbon. And this is not, I wouldn't say is in that that same category, but sometimes it's just a line in a book. And this was, uh, you know, that just changed my life in some ways. It came at a critical juncture and it, when I was 15, it was, and the line was a given that there is so much in all of us, what happens to the rest and yeah, that kind of moment of cause. And that, that hit this very deep. Pardon me, when I was a teenager, I used to have this fantasy that I could live multiple lives, you know, but I didn't want to just kind of have a different life. I wanted to have multiple lives all at the same time. I want it to be this multiplex person who could be, you know, be multitudes. The other thing I would just, you know, highly recommend, highly recommend in addition to fiction is poetry.

Speaker 8:          01:06:53       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:06:53       You know, I mean, the thing that changed my life with regard to poetry, I'm not sure why it was, but, uh, when I was a junior in high school, I decided I wanted to get poetry and I just picked up the collected poems of William Butler Yeats. And I read the entire book. It's, you know, three or 400 pages of poetry. And the two things that I learned from that, we want how to read poetry, you know, because a lot of people just are unfamiliar with, you know, kind of the stylized form. But more than that, what I learned was, oh, most of, you know, 20 of them do nothing for me. And then there's one that just goes bang. And, um, you know, and so learning that, you know, and so many people don't learn the love poetry because they, they'd been forced fed 19 poems and they never got to that 20th. Paul.

Speaker 4:          01:07:47       Such a good point. It's such a good point. I, uh, not to, not interject, but I resisted poetry for far longer than I resisted fiction, which is saying a lot. And then, uh, interviewed actually a friend of mine, a Rolf Potts who wrote a wonderful book called vagabonding, which I took around the world for me for 18 months and 2004, 2005 and he suggested a few starter books for poetry. And later I ended up picking up a fantastic, uh, roomy collection by, I think at Coleman Barks. I want to say the name is the introduction alone to that book will make the hair stand up on your arms if you have hairy arms, maybe somewhere else otherwise end. Uh, I found when I asked a very good friend of mine has a huge Rumi Fan, how should I read Ruminy he said exactly what you just said. He said you need to read a lot of them because for me it's every 15th, every 20th. That just really grabs me and I know is going to stick with me. Uh, so not expecting that you're going to get or like every single one of them. Uh, are there any places that you would suggest people potentially start when it comes to poetry?

Speaker 5:          01:09:03       Well, I think you pick up a good one. I actually, uh, my exposure to a copier room, he came through Robert Bly. I loved Robert Bly is Kabir book. Uh, what I liked Coleman barks a lot as well. Uh, does father the Steven Mitchell additions. Um, but, uh, you know, you know, this just good collections of poetry, you know, and the poems or the English language or, um, you know, I personally, I, you know, maybe it's too intellectual for most people, but a Wallace Stevens, go find a couple of poems of Wallace Stevens. If you can't read a mere being or aesthetic demal and come to some like, oh my God, this magical, then, you know,

Speaker 10:         01:09:50       uh,

Speaker 5:          01:09:52       again, he's, he's particularly difficult because this is a, or an, oh, actually here, this is where I would start,

Speaker 10:         01:09:59       uh,

Speaker 5:          01:10:01       east coker by ts Eliot. Oh my God. That, that's one of my favorite poems. It's about death and rebirth and, and, and uh, unbelievably good.

Speaker 4:          01:10:12       Yeah. Tsla, it's hard to go wrong with. Yeah. So I, I've, I wanted to come back to living multiple lives and having multitudes contained within a single person because I think you have lived many, many. Yeah. And My basketball. And, uh, I have more questions on books and I'll, I'll just give out a teaser. We'll come back to this, but I've heard from a reliable sources that you love to read old bestsellers from generations ago that are now long forgotten. So I want to find out why we're going to come back to that. But since a lot of people listening are curious about the edge that you often find. So in 1993, you launched, uh, the global network navigators. I understand it. The first web portal, first site to be supported by banner ads and

Speaker 5:          01:11:04       Oh, call me, correct you on that. Not Beginner banner ads came two years later. Ah, okay. The very first ads were much closer to, um, yellow page ads. And the reason was that there were only 200 websites, right? So we basically were like, hey, we can put content for you on the web. So it was close to putting up a website. Then it was the putting up a banner banner ad. It didn't come until the word off websites that you could point people somewhere else.

Speaker 4:          01:11:31       Good point. That's a very good point. And the AOL bought it in 95. Is that right? That's correct. Okay. Why do you think you were the first or one of the first to recognize this opportunity? Uh, meaning ad supported web portal? Uh,

Speaker 5:          01:11:54       well, well, first of all, uh, I, I should be clear that, um, you know, I came up with the ad supported part. Uh, Dale Doherty, who was one of my key people at O'Reilly media for many years, went on to actually start make magazine and maker faire. And we spun out that into a separate company called maker media was the one who kind of discovered the worldwide web for us. And it was really following, you know, earlier threads in our business. Uh, uh, Dale had been very, very interested in, um, online publishing. Yeah. In 1987, he had created our first ebook, which was a hypercard version of, uh, of a book I had, I had created called Unix in a nutshell. And, uh, so he had been pursuing, uh, you know, ebooks and we, uh, he'd started something. Uh, actually I may have the timing wrong, but I think it's all right. So we had been basically trying to figure out how to we, and we had these books on something called the x Windows system and we started working, uh, this, this is before XML existed with something called SGML standard generalized markup language, which is before the web. And we were trying to figure out how to represent our books, you know, for online publishing. And there was a piece of pattern recognition that I had done, which was, oh, you know, um,

Speaker 6:          01:13:24       uh,

Speaker 5:          01:13:26       you know, the world, they're starting to be a lot of of commercial software products for reading books. But I felt like we needed a standard of some kind for our online content because we weren't going to be a software company, but we wanted everybody to be able to read the same content. This was sort of inspired by, yeah, we were a documentation consulting company and we worked with this guy who had to maintain 200 different versions of his software. And we were like, screw this, you know, so because we had all these people who are coming to us because our, our, our x books had been adopted as the documentation by a bunch of, you know, Unix work station companies. And HP had answer book and you know, son had info explorer and you know, so there were like five, six, seven different kind of, and we said, no, we want to have one format that everybody reads.

Speaker 5:          01:14:19       And so Dale had started working on developing that format, which can be called doc book. And uh, it was really for representing technical books in, you know, in a markup language. But then we realize, and we, one of the things that we learn from the x window system, you know, this is Bob Scheiffer had kind of told us this. He said, look, you know, you know what? We really are the way that we use free software. You know, this is a big contrast to, you know, how, you know, uh, you know, Linux grew up was simply we're trying to build a reference implement, not naming a reference implementation, a sample implementation that people can improve on. And so we had this idea that we needed a free book browser and date. I'll discover this tool called Biola, uh, which was really the first graphical web browser and that led into the web.

Speaker 5:          01:15:11       And then, uh, you know, Dale introduced me to Tim Berners Lee and, and Dale was like, we were just publishing our first book about the Internet book called the whole Internet users guide catalog, which we publish in 1993 and uh, are actually 92, fall in 92. And uh, he, he had a catalog in the back, uh, of, of Er interesting Internet sites. You know, if you tell that to this site, you'll get earthquake information if you, you know, it was go for the, the web. We actually, Dale was on, I said, we got to have the web in here. There were only 200 websites. And we, you know, the editor, Mike Luca is actually wrote a chapter of the last minute right, for publication. It's so we can slip it in, but then pay way. Who was the, he was a student at the time, that guy had written viola, you know, uh, uh, I said, well, I can make a cool demo for the catalog in the back of the book, you know, and the, the, the, the catalog was, um, it was kind of this list of couple of hundred interesting sites on the Internet that people could try out.

Speaker 5:          01:16:13       And uh, so he built this thing and it was, uh, it was basically a point and click catalog of the, uh, of the early Internet. And I said, hey, that's not a demo. That's a product. And so our first idea was that the internet was still very early. So we, our first idea was we were going to build a kiosk so people could try the Internet using this point and click interface. And so that was what we built. And then Dale wanted to deal with a magazine, kind of like what make magazine became for the maker Movement about the early people over the web. And I said, you know, he originally thought of as a quarterly magazine. I said, no, actually I think they all, I think people are going to have the web open on there. Uh, you know, there'll be, there'll be looking at the way of every day, you know, so we have to have it constantly updated and we kind of brainstormed back and forth and you know, we kind of developed, so there was the catalog component, which was part of what we were doing and, and then kind of articles about the people behind this, you know, this new thing.

Speaker 5:          01:17:09       And I was just kind of looking at my desk one day and then, you know, kind of, we followed the industry through these print magazines and, uh, you know, the way they worked was there were articles in, there were ads and there was a Bingo card in the middle, you know, which is this card with, you know, kind of like ms giant matrix of numbers. Like a multiple choice exam because then you would circle 82 and the ad or the article, you know, corresponding to number 82 would send you a package in the mail. I remember those. And I thought, that's really inefficient. We could do that on the web, you know, so, so we can deliver the information directly. So, uh, that was the original vision. And it's sort of funny. So the advertising that we invented for the web was really the, I was really the website, the commercial website because up to that point, there were no commercial websites, you know.

Speaker 5:          01:18:04       And so the, the banner ad, it was this much later layer, which is simply the idea that you could build a commercial website that advertise your product or service and gave you information about it. So their first ad we did was effectively a website for our, our law firm. You know, uh, you know, within Gnn. It wasn't because we didn't set up the entire website, but it was, it was literally, um, um, you know, just, here's Hillary, Roman white McCall. If, here's what we do, here is how to reach us. And, and uh, you know, yeah, it was an ad. It was a, so we had this sort of uh, uh, directory, you know, cattle. We had this sort of, hey, here are all these cool sites and now here's the commercial catalog.

Speaker 4:          01:18:45       So, so I wanted to, uh, just to confirm something about the whole Internet users guide and catalog. So this, this book you mentioned 92 and in a piece titled the Oracle Silicon Valley, I think it's just an ink. Uh, there's a, there's, there's a description of one of your marketing approaches and says to market a general interest book from a small publisher about a relatively obscure topic or Riley devised a novel marketing strategy. He would turn himself into an activist. He hired the former director of activism from the Sierra Club and devised a campaign that treated the adoption of the Internet, like the effort to save the rain forest, emailed copies of the book to every member of Congress and then went on a media tour in New York City in Washington DC. And then this is a quote from you, I was saying the Internet is coming. The Internet is coming. He says, uh, and O'Reilly media, has the owner had the only book that could explain it to you? Is there anything that you would add to that? Anything you would correct? I just, it's, it's a, it's a fascinating story, but that's all I have

Speaker 5:          01:19:48       as is the case in so many of these stories. You know, there's sort of the hero story. It wasn't my idea to do that. It was this guy, Brian Irwin. We had hired Brian Darwin, uh, from the Sierra Club and yeah, we were able to hire, we were up in Sebastopol. He was actually commuting down to San Francisco. Wow. This a is a company up here that might be interesting. Uh, and then he came in and he said, you know, he is the one who taught me about activism. It wasn't like I had this idea, it was like, no, Brian was this master of activist and then he invented early Internet marketing and he's kind of one of the unsung heroes, you know, he was the one who said, first of all, he, he, you know, he, when he said to me is like, people are not going to care about our book.

Speaker 5:          01:20:30       You know, we want to make them care about the internet. And uh, that was real really. He taught me about marketing as activism about big ideas and he was the one who said, we're going to go do a press tour about the internet. Uh, and he also gave way, you know, copies of the Internet to people who are unused that uh, you know, uh, really kind of pioneered a lot of tea influence or marketing techniques. This is 1992. Um, and uh, you know, he's kind of, it, it's, it's, it's sort of sad that he has not gotten enough credit. I always try to say his name again. Brian Irwin, how do you spell his last name? Er Win is in, in, I think he's still, he left the company around 2000. Uh, and he, he's, I think he, he's, he's a marketing consultant still. Uh, and, and, uh, uh, living in Santa Rosa.

Speaker 2:          01:21:21       All right. I'll track them down and send a link is way, uh, the, the observation that you brought up about the cards in the magazines where you circle number 82, that's really inefficient, right? So this also kind of relates to the how, how can we make x easier for people? Uh, so could you, these types of questions or heuristics are interesting to me. Uh, and I'd love if you could elaborate a bit. I actually don't know this name, I'm embarrassed to say, but Hal Varian and his observation that if you want to understand the future, just look at what rich people do today. Could you elaborate on that please?

Speaker 5:          01:22:04       Well, first off, uh, how, uh, you know, first came into my Ken because he was the chief economist at Google. He was the guy who figured out a bunch of things about the Google ad auction that made Google such an economic powerhouse. So, uh, but it turns out he was also, he wrote the textbook on microeconomics that almost every economist learned from, uh, you know, learn from. So.

Speaker 10:         01:22:27       MMM.

Speaker 5:          01:22:29       Uh, but yeah, he, he, he's made that comment famously, and I remember talking with him one night, we was dinner with me and Andy Mcafee and Erik Brynjolfsson, the office of, of, uh, the second machine age and machine platform crowd and, uh, Carl Shapiro, the guy with whom, how had written a book called information rule. So you've been one of panels, Grad students when he was teaching at Berkeley. And,

Speaker 10:         01:22:55       uh, um,

Speaker 5:          01:22:59       Carl had just been at the White House and he was a reacting with horror at the statement of house, you know, and it, you know, it's like, it sounds like, oh my God, this is the worst silicon valley libertarian kind of observation. And it's very easy for people to react that way to it. But yet if you think about it, you know, it's like, Ooh, first owned automobiles, rich people, you know, who first owned cell phones, rich people, you know, rich people used to fly, uh, you know, or, or not fly. They would do the grand tour of Europe, you know, now soccer hooligans follow their, you know, their team around Europe, you know, and, uh, uh, their whole, you know, uh, you know, rich people used to eat out, you know, now everybody eats out, you know, it's like more people eat out and then cook, you know.

Speaker 5:          01:23:46       And so it really is a really interesting tool for thinking and tool for seeing, you know, and I think that's kind of like a such a key concept for me is, uh, you know, people on this kind of goes back to the structural differential and people kind of trying to, you know, judge ideas against other ideas. Is it some kind of zero sum game? You know? And it's like, no, all of these things in a reality is, uh, is infinite. You know, reality is far more than any of the, the nets we weave to catch it in. All right? So if you accept that, then you kind of go, these are simply tools to help us see. And so I go, does this help me see? Yes. And so, for example, in my forthcoming book, there's a whole chapter that's in some ways based on this juice, it's called, why we'll never run out of jobs, you know, and it's because, you know, uh, uh, you know, you, you look at what happens in rich societies and, and how basically commodity products get elaborated in more and more ways.

Speaker 5:          01:24:51       So, you know, look, think about craft beers that are more expensive than commodity beers. Think about specialty coffees that are more, you know, uh, expensive than, than, uh, commodity coffee. Right? And what's added in a lot of ways, it's a story that's added, you know, and yes, sure, the story has physical components. You know, this came from, this copy is actually address Alexis madrigals a containers. Podcasts is fabulous. This subject. Then episode four is about the history of [inaudible]. So the evolution of the coffee, uh, market, but, you know, yeah, this coffee came from this particular, you know, coffee plantation and Guatemala. Uh, you know, all the things that, that, you know, have to come into place, uh, to make that, you know, bring that to, you know, uh, a particular coffee roaster and they tell that story and as a result of that story and, and, and the reality that goes with the story that this is actually a unique flavor. You know, of course, if it doesn't match, if it doesn't deliver, then people got not much to the story. But if it delivers that people, yes, they will pay more. And so this is why I believe that, you know, like as we commoditize labor,

Speaker 5:          01:26:05       there's, or one of the reasons I should say, you know, with Ai, with robots, you know, we can find new things for people to do. I mean, there's three things. First of all, again, this is a major theme of my book, which we haven't really talked about, but let's get into it. You know, one is there's plenty of work to do for Christ's sake, you know, so the big question is not, you know, in know, you know, we talked too much about jobs and not enough about work. Because if we, if we focused on what work needs doing, then we start to ask what's keeping us from doing that work? And we realized that there's something broken in our economic system that's made diverting our energy and investment away from doing the work that needs doing towards, you know, financial games, you know, and, and people who are sort of extracting money from the economy without actually getting the work done that we need doing.

Speaker 5:          01:26:57       So that's one piece. The second thing is obviously, you know, this all this work being done that, uh, you know, is not being compensated for now, I have this sort of metaphoric can't originally came to me in the context of, of, um, open source software. Uh, but it really can't entered my consciousness as a mental tool, uh, in the 70s, uh, when I read it and in Stewart brand's coalition quarterly, I was a concept called the clothesline paradox, which is this thing is that simply disappear from our economic accounting. You know, so you think about, uh, uh, and the clothesline paradox, it really was like, okay, we're measuring solar energy versus, uh, in renewables versus fossil fuels. And if somebody puts their clothes in the dryer, it's fossil fuel usage. But if somebody takes the clothes and putting them on the line, it doesn't accrue to the solar column.

Speaker 5:          01:27:53       Right. And, uh, you know, and I kind of made an analogy from that to open source software, which sort of disappeared from our economic accounting for so long before people like Google and Amazon and figured out how to build enormous businesses on top of it. Um, but you know, if you look at our economy today, you know, it's like taking care of people. Yeah. Mostly uncompensated, you know, a lot of creativity, you know, poorly compensated. You know, it's like, why is it, you know, if these things there are so valuable, don't get paid for, right. They're, they're, they're, they're you, they're taken out of the economic paradigm. We need to fix that. And, and you know, it's not necessarily saying, well, that must pay for this, you know, cause the people all supply and demand, there's all kinds of hacks that the societies have used, uh, to value things differently. You know, just a good example is child labor. You know, how did we, so we didn't start, you know, saying, well we have to pay children more. No, we're going to stop using them for this thing. Right? And that actually it actually reduced the workforce that we reduced working hours. And what did we do with that? We sent them to school.

Speaker 8:          01:29:03       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:29:03       Right. We actually paid as a society sent kids to school and then later we don't need all these teenagers on the farms anymore. Oh, let's send them to school. You know, it was blessed, you know, and then the high school movement started around 1909, you know, 9% of Americans went to high school in 1909. By 1935 it was about 70%. You know, it's like this amazing social revolution, you know, so what is it that we could do today around like, okay, let's actually, it doesn't have to be that we, we start paying people could be that we do universal basic income, but we some we somehow need to revalue some of the things, you know, education, you know, creativity, caring in our economy. And again, uh, in that whole creativity economy, you have to understand that that economy writ large is wrapped up in that Hal Varian statement.

Speaker 5:          01:29:55       Because if you look, you know, I mentioned coffee and beer, but just food in general, you know, 2% of our population now, uh, you know, in the u s works in agriculture, right? Yet we have more variety of foods and we ever had in the day when we all worked in agriculture, that design pattern is what we need to be exploring, you know, to make our economy, you know, we need to basically say, Oh, you know, let's figure out what kinds of things become valuable. As other thing has become commoditized and let's start valuing them appropriately.

Speaker 4:          01:30:33       Is, is the decision to value something appropriately? What are some of the drivers of that change? Potentially? I mean, you have market demand, right? So there could be, yeah, just a, for instance you have an Uber or something like that and all of a sudden this access potential excess inventory or idle time of resource x can be, can be valued differently when people devalue owning cars for instance. Uh, you have regulatory rights in the case of say Cha Child Labor you that you can change the rules of the game so to speak. So that the, the incentives are different. What are, what are some of the other drivers? And are there any particular examples of things that rich people are doing now that you think are going to be commonplace? Uh, and, and much more widely adopted? Yeah. Well, I mean, the thing

Speaker 5:          01:31:29       most rich people do that are, you know, could become a big driver of the economy is experiences.

Speaker 5:          01:31:37       You know what I mean? You know, you were talking about, uh, you know, high cannon, it was back to side with Kevin Kelly. You know, it's like most people don't get to do things like that, you know, and uh, yeah. But just the experience economy writ large I think is, you know, and that's everything from new kinds of food, a new kinds of, you know, I think we're going to have a lot in augmented reality. You know, there's already a lot in media. It's, it's new kinds of experiences, you know, uh, you know, new kinds of learning, you know, I mean, learning is a huge, I mean, you know, it's like teaching people to enjoy learning and, uh, uh, uh, to always be, always be learning new things. You know, this is an economy in that. And, um, the, the, um, the things that the, the, that I think policy wise that we need to start thinking about is, first of all, we have a lot of economic policies that reward nonproductive investment.

Speaker 5:          01:32:35       What do we mean by non productive investment? It's sort of summed up pretty beautifully in the tail of a Ge where Jeff EML was in a recently forced out. I mean, by all, I mean, you know, Ge, so to say, oh no, no, he meant to retire. I don't buy it. You know, it was basically an activist investor bought a stake in the firm, started agitating for, you know, share buybacks. Right? And a among other things. I mean, you know, and the, the thing is so amazing, they wrote this white paper in 2015 and it describes in detail what a great company Ge is. You know, they have bigger market share than their competitors and these categories, they're growing faster, they're getting more focused, you know, and it's like this amazing story of how Ge succeeding in the real economy and then they go buy this, you know, but the stock prices lagged, you know, we must fix the stock price and the way that, you know, they should do these various, you know, things they need to spin this out in.

Speaker 5:          01:33:38       Some of those things might be rational, but they should also borrow money. And you know, basically, you know, when you buy back shares it tends to, it reduces the number of shares. So the earnings per share go up. And, and think, since stocks are often, you know, uh, prices, uh, as a multiple of earnings per share, stock price goes up. So Ge should borrow $20 billion to make the stock price go up. Who benefit from that? Who benefits from that? Ge doesn't need that. Ges customers don't need that investor's benefit. And, and it turns out that at this point, 85% of all investment in our economy is of this kind. It's for the benefit of investors. You know, we're, uh, um, Warren Buffet, uh, put it really well in this quote from, uh, Rhonda [inaudible], Wonderful Book makers and takers, which is all about this other financialization of the economy.

Speaker 5:          01:34:32       And, uh, it, uh, you know, he says, you know, he told her, you know, sometimes people prefer to go to the casino, then the restaurant and, you know, we have built an economy that is largely a casino. And this is why, you know, I think both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders played on this, you know, and people know there's something wrong, you know, and, and, and, you know, our government has basically been supportive of this paper economy. And they're wringing their hands. But this, this failed idea and this is kind of brings me back to my book, which it, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:35:07       the title of which is WTF what's the future and why it's up to us.

Speaker 5:          01:35:13       Yeah. And the why it's up to us is the, is the, is the key part, because you know, there's this sense of technological determinism, determinism, uh, you know, the, that I revolt against, you know, this idea that technology inevitably wants to eliminate jobs. I believe, you know, the technology wants to solve new problems and we have to ask ourselves, what are the incentives that we've created in our system. So, uh, I want the book is really, in some ways it's, it's a, it's a, an economic, a polemic wrapped in a business book wrapped in a memoir. And a memoir starts with kind of my experiences, uh, you know, dealing with and thinking about, you know, the great platforms of the computer industry, you know, started with Microsoft. Uh, and what I saw was that Microsoft took too much of the value for themselves. Uh, people deserted their ecosystem and went elsewhere to the Internet.

Speaker 5:          01:36:07       And then I've watched this story replay itself as you know, Google and, uh, you know, Facebook and Twitter and so on, have competed with their developer ecosystem and made it less of a good place to be. And, you know, that lesson seems to be lost. And then I of course, by extension I've seen, oh, that's also how our financial markets, which were originally designed as a, as sort of an enabling platform for the economy and for society. I've ended up trading against society taking too much of the value for themselves. And so it's this sort of ecosystem view of platforms and, and, and, and, and, you know, and actually also in the book, it's kind of interesting seeing how I, uh, uh, I, I hate the books are slower than, uh, you know, the, the modern media, because I was kind of saying, you know, I kinda call it a little bit on Lyft versus Uber, you know, because I say, look, they are creating more value for their ecosystem of drivers. And that really matters in the long run. And sure enough, I mean, you know, Lyft is really gaining on Uber because Uber is extractive business model is sort of caught up with them.

Speaker 4:          01:37:14       So as a question for you, I have so many questions of course, but the uh, you have, and this is, this is related I think to what you just said. So you've built your, you're somewhat of an anomaly in the silicon valley area in the sense that you build a profitable business with several hundred millions of dollars in revenue without any venture capital. This slogan is what I'd love to touch upon. We can take this in any direction you'd like, but how did you come up with the slogan and maybe you could give some backstory, create more value than you capture.

Speaker 5:          01:37:47       Ah, that's actually Brian Erwin again. Um, I just want his last gift of the company. We had a management retreat in 2000 and I think I told the story, I won't mention the name, but as you more, more than one answer, I said, yeah, more than one internet billionaire has told me that they got started. Uh, you know, with, you know, their, their whole business with yeah. What they learned from an O'Reilly book. Yeah. And, uh, Brian laughing, he said, yeah, that should be our slogan. We create more value than we capture.

Speaker 4:          01:38:18       So it came up and it,

Speaker 5:          01:38:21       of course, we all went, yes. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:38:25       why is that, uh, that you've had, as I understand it, discussions with Eric Schmidt about don't be evil, uh, Google slogan. What do you, what do you think of that slogan? Is that sufficient? Is it,

Speaker 5:          01:38:40       well, the thing that, you know, I, the problem I have, and, and the, the, again, I mean, this was a, you know, we were at Google Zeitgeist and we had a conversation in the lobby. It wasn't like we had this profound, you know, the, uh, you know, but I was trying to say, look, don't be evil, isn't measurable, you know, create more value than you capture is measurable. And, uh, you know, and, and it is, and again, I, you know, I, I'll expand on this quite a bit on my book. You know, the, this idea of, you know, when you have a system where there's a platform or an economic system that creates more value or an RN, an ecosystem, this kind of goes back to Frank Herbert and what I learned from him. Uh, when you have an ecosystem, it has to actually create value for all its participants and, and you have to be able to measure that.

Speaker 5:          01:39:32       And we need to actually start thinking about as a society, how we measure more holistically the ecosystem value against created. Because what we've done is we've created a set of measures that are focused exclusively on one set of, of market participants, which is really the market owners. You know, if you think about, you know, what the stock market is about, it's about the people who own the systems to companies. And we've just, you know, we've sort of forgotten that, you know, the, the financial markets are a map of our expectations of what's supposed to be happening in the real economy. And instead we're just kind of manipulating the map and, and kind of go, well, you know, let, you know, and hoping nobody notices that the real economy is going to shit, you know, while we're telling ourselves this great story. And, and, uh, I think that the, you know, figuring out, you know, are there other measures, you know, we, uh, you know, uh, Clay Christiansen's also written about this, you know, he's, uh, you know, uh, the author of the, the original, his original book was, you know, the capitalist dilemma. Uh, I'm sorry, not the capitalist dilemma, the innovator's dilemma, but he has a, uh, a paper he wrote, and I believe that maybe a book now called the capitalist dilemma, which is really about this question of we started measuring the wrong things and, you know, effectively we started measuring, you know, a small subset of the things we ought to be measuring about the health of the economy.

Speaker 2:          01:41:05       So what, uh, and maybe this is related, maybe not. So feel free to tackle this in whichever order. So I guess what I would love to ask is, what should we measure? But you, uh, I've, I've read that you think the financial markets might well be the first rogue AI. Uh, it's so if, why, why do you feel that way and what should we do about it? And maybe that relates to the measurement. I Dunno. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:41:29       Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess the thing that I, uh, this is sort of an extended metaphor at the core of the book. I'm trying to sort of explain what I learned from platforms. And so I kind of look at, for example, at a Google and the way they manage search quality. And you kind of understand that even though they have this, you know, Cornucopia of, of algorithms, including, you know, AI is all about serving a master fitness function. You know, the, the thing that they're trying to optimize towards in this case is relevance. Whether it's the relevance of a search result or the relevance of an ad. And, uh, you know, and it's this constant battle against bad actors against new inch. You know, you're trying to deal with new information, but you're always trying to optimize towards that goal. So then I look at Facebook and gang, okay.

Speaker 5:          01:42:21       So we see that they have, uh, a related, but somewhat different fitness function. You know, Google's fitness function is we serve you something out and then you go away, right? Because you, if you've got the real answer, you, you went away, right? Whereas Facebook's is if we give you the thing that we really want you to get, you come back and you spend more time, right? So it's almost an inverse. But again, they still have this master fitness function. There's is, you know, you could describe it as engagement and, and I kind of talked through fake news and how you can see how a fitness function can lead you astray. And how mark right now is sort of saying, oh, wait, you know, the things we told our computer to do, our system or not, what we really meant. And actually this is a couple of quotes that I can't believe they've sort of been life quotes from me.

Speaker 5:          01:43:13       And I can't believe that I did not actually put them in the book. Uh, one of them was, there's a great quote from Walt Mossberg, uh, uh, you know, the famous tech journalists to once said to me years ago, he said, I told Steve bomber, he said, if you guys could just dial back to the greed, only 5%, you know, people would like you 100% more. Yeah. And, and, uh, or people wouldn't hate you. And, and, and the other one was this, uh, you know, quote about debugging, uh, from a guy named Andrew Singer who was a friend of mine who I hadn't seen for many, many years. But if he wants said to me, said, debugging is the art of finding out what you really told your computer to do instead of what you thought you told it to do. So in some sense, so like right now, you know, mark is trying to debug the, you know, the fitness functions of Facebook's engagement paradigm, you know, so that be, you know, he's, we're talking about real communities.

Speaker 5:          01:44:13       How do we support more real communities of interest as opposed to these sort of fake manipulative, you know, communities that are contributing to polarization. But when you look at our financial markets, we have that same challenge. We have a master fitness function. You know, and it's sort of interesting to realize that the master fitness function that we had after World War II and that golden period when, uh, of the growing middle class was actually full employment. They were scared shitless because after World War One, all those, you know, they, they'd seen first of all in America, you know, you had, you know, all the returning soldiers who were, you know, you know, homeless, you know, whatever you, all of this had led to the Great Depression. We saw all of this stuff. I mean, it wasn't just the returning soldiers, but it was, they went into this period where people were out of work and, uh, you know, they see, so what happened in, you know, the rise of Nazis in Germany and they were really focused on putting people to work, you know, and that was all of the policy interventions.

Speaker 5:          01:45:12       Where around that. And then in the, you know, the seventies and eighties, it really, you know, we kind of shifted the, the fitness function to shareholder value and, and you know, kind of if the, if it was good for the stock market, it was good for America. And now we're kind of looking at it and going, oh, that didn't work. And you know, in some sense, you know, kind of what I'm trying to lay out the challenge in the book. I'm trying, you know, there's a lot of people are saying this, you know, I mean the economists, you know, politicians, whatever, I'm just trying to make the, you know, another line of argument reasoning from tech and what we learned from tech platforms. You know, the, in a similar way, we have to look at what are we telling our economy to optimize for and realizing that we make choices in that, you know, the, the economy, despite all of the ideas of that, it's a free market.

Speaker 5:          01:46:00       It isn't at all. It's a design system and it has all kinds of rules. Just like Google has all kinds of rules for, uh, you know, achieving relevance. We have all kinds of rules in our economy that bias it towards the outcomes that we're optimizing for. Namely shareholder value. You know, we have tax preferences around capital gains versus how we tax labor. We have rules about whether people can organize. I mean, you know, you know, it's no accident that, you know, labor got a bigger share of the pie when labor organizing was supported as opposed to when it's not, you know, and a lot of things went wrong with unions, you know, and, and that has to be debugged to, uh, you know, we have to rediscover what it means for people to be able to stand up to, you know, the, the, the machines that we built. Um, you know, there's no rules about how much people work, how much time off they get. And you can see there's different, you know, like, just look at German stakeholder capitalism and go, oh, here's a different system with different rules as different outcomes. Uh, you know, look at, uh, um, you know, the interventionists, uh, you know, evolution of the economy and countries like South Korea and you kind of go, yeah, this whole free market thing is just,

Speaker 5:          01:47:15       it's a map and it's not entirely, it's got some great stuff in it. It's just not the whole picture. You know, again, it goes back to Chris Escape. The map is not the territory. So we have to constantly check our map and ask ourselves, are we optimizing for the right things? What rules should we be changing in order to get a closer to the outcome we really want. And of course we have to agree on that outcome.

Speaker 5:          01:47:42       But I think we, we, if we want, if we want a human centered future, you know, we can choose that. And again, I kind of ends, I think, uh, you know, an optimistic note kind of looking at the ways that, that people are choosing that. And they are, you know, reaching for that better future, working on hard problems, you know, doing, you know, you know, inventing new forms of creativity that other people are willing to pay for. A and building that wonderful fiction that we have on now we're back to poetry. You know, Wallace Stevens had this amazing idea, uh, that, uh, you know, the reality is, is actually a fiction that we create for each other.

Speaker 4:          01:48:21       That boy, yeah, I mean reality in quotation marks or not. Uh, it seems, seems to be, certainly seems to be that case. I, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:48:29       Yeah. His great line is reality is an activity. It was the most August imagination.

Speaker 4:          01:48:35       So one thing that I really love about both reading your work and just speaking with you is how much the new, uh, relates to the very, very old and vice versa. And what you mean by that, we're even reminds us to reexamine base assumptions. So for instance, I mean, if we look at, we could look at the fanciest of high frequency trading or even some disasters like longterm capital management to see how these, uh, uh, systems and humans respond to incentives. And if you don't look at them closely enough, the debugging process can be super, super painful. Uh, or how cryptocurrency has made people take a closer look if they dig in at what money actually represents. And so I wanted to ask you a question about money and not on a, on a macroeconomic level, but, uh, on, on a smaller scale. And this is a quote, correct me if I'm getting this wrong, uh, in this quote, uh, money in a business is like gas in your car.

Speaker 4:          01:49:39       You don't want to run out, but you're not doing a tour of gas stations. I'm sorry. Yeah. So can you, can you elaborate on that? Because there are people certainly who disagree, right? They would, or they would not say that life should be a tour of gas stations, but they would assert that maybe the function of business is to generate a profit and at that as much profit as is humanly possible. Can you explain, uh, that position and, well, I mean, I, and, and also, sorry, not to interrupt, but also talk a little bit about, you know, a lot of very, very, very wealthy people, uh, in tech who have in some cases come from very meager backgrounds. I'd love to also hear about the, the mistakes that you see in your mind as it comes to personal, in a personal or familial level relating to money or dealing with money.

Speaker 5:          01:50:32       I mean, my own mistakes.

Speaker 4:          01:50:34       Uh, no, just, well, I think you, you appear to have a very healthy relationship with this concept of money and money in general. Uh, but I'm, I'm wondering what we can come back to that. Why don't we, where do we start? I'm asking you like seven questions in one, but,

Speaker 5:          01:50:50       well, let me, let me, I guess I would just say to say a couple of things. One is, uh, anybody who thinks that money is the object,

Speaker 6:          01:51:02       uh,

Speaker 5:          01:51:03       you know, is, I'm sad for them because money is a tool.

Speaker 6:          01:51:10       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:51:10       You know what I mean? It, you know, we want happiness, we want happiness for ourselves, we want it for the people we love. And if we're, you know, great soul, we want it for everybody, you know, and we should want it for everybody. You know, I mean, and you know, the idea, you know, there is sort of a, I think a legitimate debate about the right way to do that. And so, you know, when, when, you know, a lot of people, they were like, we were talking with Russ Roberts, uh, you know, who's is a dedicated in a libertarian free market, or is this kind of, if you've seen his little film, it's a wonderful loaf about, you know, kind of Adam Smith and his book, how Adam Smith's can change your life. You know, these are all kind of, you know, an encomium to this idea that there's this magic when,

Speaker 6:          01:51:57       mmm.

Speaker 5:          01:51:59       You know, people just pursue their own aims and it magically produces, uh, th this wonderful goodness of the economy. And I, you know, but those people are not pursuing money, you know, money is a measure

Speaker 5:          01:52:17       what they are pursuing. And so I guess, so that's the first piece that I would say. And, and then the, the, you know, there's sort of, obviously there's lots and lots of studies that, you know, above a certain level, more money doesn't make you happier, you know, and, um, you know, the, the, uh, I think that, uh, you know, in general, uh, you know, happy and prosperous societies are more egalitarian, you know, I mean, not, you know, I, you know, it's not flat. You know what I mean? I don't think, uh, uh, you know, sort of interesting because a lot of people kind of go, well, it, it, it, you know, if people aren't allowed to become as rich as, as you know, inhumanly possible, uh, then the, you know, your, your, your sort of somehow cutting off, uh, this sort of capitalist impulse. I go, that's not true. I mean, I just look in my own history. Yeah. And I think about the people who drove the industry, uh, you know, when I was young and what their expectations were about how much money they would make. You know, and I think of titans of the industry, people like, you know, uh, you know, pupil and Packard or you know, uh, Gordon Moore and you know, Andy Grove. And, and they probably made less money than some punk kid who built and sold a startup that basically vanished as soon as it was sold.

Speaker 5:          01:53:46       You know, I mean, we have people who are billionaires who created very, very, very little value, you know, and yet we have somehow upped our, um,

Speaker 5:          01:54:00       you know, uh, you know, so our standard of, you know, what it means, it was that great scene in the, in the, uh, you know, uh, the social network in the movie, and it was like $1 million is a cool, you know, now $1 billion now. That's cool. It was just like this vanity, you know, that's, you know, vanity and I just kind of feel what we, you know, uh, you know, anyway, I mean, I guess I would say there's sort of a social, a set of social issues where, you know, self interest should tell you that if we don't build a more just and equitable society, you know, this system is going to fall down. You know, there are people in North Korea who are doing very well for themselves. There are people in Venezuela who are doing very well for themselves, all right. But the vast majority of people are living very badly, and that's a failed state.

Speaker 5:          01:55:03       And that's the end game of an economy in which, you know, this, this ferocious competition of some people to get as much as possible. And, uh, I think, you know, the goal for all of us should be to create as much value as possible and to capture enough of it, but not all of it. And, um, you know, and I, I do think that if you see a, you know, there's a lot of wonderful, I mean, one of the things that I do feel like is wonderful about silicon valley is there a lot of people who say, yeah, that's enough. I want to go, you know, do something really valuable. You know, we've tapped into this with code for America in the United States digital service. You know, people who are saying, okay, I'm going to go to government, you know, uh, or we see in, in, uh, uh, you know, someone like Jeff Hoover at grail know this is okay.

Speaker 5:          01:56:00       You know, I'm going to try to develop an early detection test for cancer. You know, it's like, I don't need, you know, to go, you know, make another startup is going to make a whole bunch of money. Maybe he will make a whole bunch of money, but that's not what he's doing. Or Elon Musk, what a great example. I mean, you all put his own money at risk, you know, you know, a lot of it, you know, kinda going, I want to do something really hard. That's going to really move the needle about making a better world. And he's done it again and again. You know, whether right or wrong about, you know, we need to become a multiplanetary species. I think he's right. Uh, other people go, oh, we should be spending their money here on earth. He's basically, you know, doing something. He's harnessing this machine of the economy.

Speaker 5:          01:56:42       There's a wonderful machine of capital to do something to do something, you know, and uh, you know, it's like he's become rich as a byproduct of what he's trying to accomplish, which is exactly what I mean by you're not doing a tour of gas stations. Meanwhile, there are people, you know, like those people on Wall Street, you know, leading up to 2000, they knew they weren't creating value. They were simply trying to extract it. They were doing a tour of gas stations. And I have to say there are too many people in Silicon valley who are like that. You know, sort of funny because I feel like we, we call people in Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and yes, there are silicon valley entrepreneurs, but they're also a lot of people who I think are a lot closer. If you kind of try to draw the right map, there were a lot closer to actors than they are to entrepreneurs.

Speaker 5:          01:57:37       That is, they're going around looking for a project to attach themselves to, which is funded by, you know, it's like substitute, you know, venture capitalists for movie studio. Right. And you could say, yeah, an actor's and entrepreneur. Yeah. I mean they're, they're basically, you know, they have their, you know, they're driving their own career, but they're basically waiting for somebody to give them money to do this thing, you know, and if they don't get the money, so they really kind of a special kind of hired employee and uh, you know, and that's kind of what, what we're doing with our, our venture firm. My partner, Bryce Roberts has really kicked off this thing called indievc, which is really about how do you build real businesses, you know? Yeah. You might need some money to get started, but mainly you want to get funded by customers, you know, because I've see all these people in Silicon Valley and they basically go from failed startup to fail, start off, just like, you know, an actor goes from one movie to another.

Speaker 4:          01:58:33       You seem to be so forward looking and so, so often at the lead edge

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       of, uh, various, uh, trends and changes that become something seemingly obvious in hindsight. Right? I mean, you're just, you're, you're so a forward looking in so many ways. I promised I would come back to this. Why do you read old bestsellers from generations ago?

Speaker 5:          01:59:01       Well, I mean, really just for fun. How do you pick them and that if that's the goal, it has really, again, one of these pattern recognition things. I mean, I first became conscious of it. Uh, this would be, must have been maybe close on 30 years ago. Uh, I dropped my daughter off at a doctor's appointment and I was, I was, I went for a walk while she was, you know, kind of, uh, uh, actually maybe I had just gone back to the car and it was starting to rain. And I walked by this bookstore that was going out of business and they had put all these books out on the street and it was a box and it started to rain. And I see it was like a box of Zane grey books and I still riders of the Purple Sage. And I thought, I've heard of that.

Speaker 5:          01:59:51       Yeah. And I couldn't bear it to see the books get rained on. So I said, I'm just going to pick them up, put in my car and you know, and I'll give him away somewhere else later. And I, but I pulled that book out and I read it and I loved it, you know, and I, cause it's, it's this sort of like, oh my God, this guy kind of invented the mythology of the old west, you know. And I read a bunch of the others and grade books that were in there. And, uh, that was kind of, I first started to go, oh, there's something interesting, you know, these, yeah, sure. There's still, they're still popular in a certain way, but then they're super dated, but they're like a time machine into a, you know, how people felt, you know, about the world and, you know, like, right as the purple sage written in 1915.

Speaker 5:          02:00:31       And I think, you know, and, um, and, and then, you know, I, I started realizing the same thing about other books that I had written, this, you know, like started to seek them out, you know, and, and, uh, uh, a lot of it was, it was helped by the fact that my, my father and all the time, he had a big library and I could kind of read in his library, you know, and it's like, oh, you know, it's like, you know, I had all seen, you know, the Charlie Chan movies. No, he hasn't. Charlie Chan novel, you know, by Joseph James Earl biggers, you know, and I go, let me read that. And, oh my God, it's like a time machine. It's like the casual racism, you know, it's like, you know, where, you know, people refer to him as the Chink, you know, you know, and, and, but more than that was just this view that the one I read, I forget what the title was, but it was, uh, the, uh, some family from Philadelphia, the daughter has runaway to San Francisco and from there to Honolulu and the view of California, you know, distant land, that sort of kind of the wild, you know, literally the wild west and then, you know, Honolulu off the edge of the earth, you know, and it's just like this piece of magic where you kind of, you know, see into the past.

Speaker 5:          02:01:48       And then, yeah, as I mentioned to Anthony Trollope, or are you kind of looking into the depths of life in the Victorian era or, or, uh, but what I find that sort of interesting,

Speaker 5:          02:01:58       uh, and I, I started to seek out our books that are largely forgotten because, you know, or, or they have some, you know, some piece of them has survived, but they haven't survived, you know, like everybody knows Charles Dickens, you know. Um, but you know, only a certain number of people, yeah, we'll have read, uh, George Demaria is a trilby. Right. But almost everybody knows, uh, uh, maybe not everybody, I'm, I'm probably showing off too much, uh, literary, but yeah, they've heard about mesmerism and they've heard about us Bengali, right? Well, Svengali is a character in George do. Mara is a book write a Trilby, which is, and it's, it's about mesmerism. And the way mesmerism was this sort of, uh, you know, hypnotism was, you know, this rage through Victorian society, you know, in the eighties and nineties, you know, or he was fascinated by it. And it was just, you know, it's like, you know, I guess it'd be a little bit like reading more and more recently, you know, Ken Casey's electric koolaid acid test, you know, they're kind of Guinness or something, her Thomas Pynchon, you know, kind of getting into the, you know, the, the world of psychic, you know, Psychedelia and that era of the seventies.

Speaker 5:          02:03:17       Right. Um, you know, or for that matter reading, you know, uh, you know, there will be a time when somebody could read Michael LewisLewis' and out wires poker and it will be a time machine into this place when, you know, our financial economy went crazily wrong. And guess what, there's actually a novel about that by Anthony Trollope called the way we live now about the great railroad bobbles of the 1860s. And so, you know, it, it, you know, in some ways fiction is, is also a key part of, uh, you know, a way to learn about history. And in a way that's a little deeper because one of the things that I think we're not very good at is, um, you know, we rewrite history all the time. So if you read a modern history, you're reading what we think about it now.

Speaker 5:          02:04:21       Yeah. So you could read an old book of history, but when you read a novel, you are reading how people thought, what they were struggling with. You know, you read a book like a, another trollop that I love. Can you forgive her? It's this sort of pro tow feminist novel about these women who made choices that were unconventional and who they would marry and the fact that that was even an issue, you know? But yeah, we kind of look back on that, but it's like, oh my God, you can see it, you know, as a moral struggle. And he's kind of trying to set you up to say yes, you can forgive her. Yeah. Cause she didn't marry the, the, the, the socially approved guy. He's like, you know, like it just gives you a deeper insight into our own world because,

Speaker 8:          02:05:11       okay.

Speaker 5:          02:05:12       One of the things that were in this kind of brings me back to, you know, of course ipps gave the structural differential. The map is not the territory. My training with George Simon, you know, learning to see our own world in the same way, you know, that um, you know, the things that we take for granted will, you know, we will one day look back on or other people will look back on and say how quaint and you know, the, the, and in our own lives, our daily lives, you know, the ability to sort of go, oh wait, this way that I have always been may not be the only way to be that I can change. So seeing change is, is, is a prelude to being changed.

Speaker 4:          02:06:03       So this, this I think is a great place to, to start to wrap up. And I have this question I've been wanting to ask since we started, but I think that it's more of the answer will be more impactful now that we've covered a lot of the context. What do you do? You strike me and I think many people is extremely optimistic, extremely upbeat. Uh, what do you do or what have you done when you felt down or been going through periods of a darker times? Because there, there are a lot of people who would like to be change of some type, but they feel intimidated or depressed for whether it's personal reasons or because every time they open the newspaper it looks like the world is falling apart in every possible respect. Uh, what do you do when you arch your usual upbeat, optimistic self if that happens?

Speaker 5:          02:07:00       Yeah, well, uh, you know, uh, one, one of the, uh, I, I sent, I gave Romaji and the opening to sesame street and I have to give a little homage also to the other, a wonderful teacher of children, Mr. Rogers. And by the way, it, you know, before I had kids, I thought, Mr. Rogers, this is the stupidest thing ever. Once you have kids, you go, oh my God, this guy was a genius. You know, I'm just, I'm blessed, you know, to me, I just, he was a genius anyway. And I, I have, there's a video of him of him doing congressional testimony was, I forget who it was, what was the reason? It was sort of, I was about Pv, the early days of PBS. And you watched this congressman who's sort of hostile in the beginning, just so they're gradually just sort of start nodding and smiling.

Speaker 5:          02:07:51       It's so great. But I digress. But the great thing that the, your question is this fabulous quote from Fred Rogers, you know, on his show, he's telling Joe, when you see bad things happen, look around for the people who are helping. There were always people helping and you know, it's just such great life advice, you know, it's like, you know, and I just actually just tweeted something like that the other day, you know, I, as I had just come across, uh, you know, uh, there was a new video about planet labs. Uh, one of my companies, I'm an investor in, you know, they're, they're trying to image the surface of the earth every day. You know, they call their, you know, their satellites, dubs, they said like all these military satellites, they all have, you know, you know, Dave's a wrap doors and we wanted ours to signal there for peace. You know, and this is great piece about their, you know, their, their launch of, of the largest, you know, a flock of earth imaging satellites. And you know, I just kind of boasting it with the, I think the tweak was something like, you know, if you need your dose of optimism, uh, you know, you know, watch this video, you know, because here's somebody who's, you know, doing something idealistic maybe was it, I said you do some idealism, you know, kind of, so look for people who are helping the world be a better place.

Speaker 2:          02:09:11       Well, Tim, I think you are one of those people and I, we could, we could talk for hours and hours more, but I will, I think bring this one to a close, but first so people can find you elsewhere, learn more about you and the book and everything else that you are up to. Where would you suggest people find you on the Internet?

Speaker 5:          02:09:36       Well, probably the best place right now is a cycle. Tim Dot [inaudible] dot com so [inaudible] dot com which is our online learning platform, which includes, you know, tens of thousands of ebooks from mostly on technology and business topics, but increasingly other things, uh, but also videos, live training. It's really the core of our entire business. Um, but uh, but Tim's daughter riley.com sort of has a, instead of my personal archive of, for example, a link to this podcast will go on there once it's up. It also points to my book that will be a site for the book, but it's not up yet. The, the, the, the site will be called [inaudible] e t f economy.com. And I think the book is, is something that, it's a, uh, it, it's really covers a lot of the topics we talked about today, but also a lot more, I mean there's a lot about how do you think, how to draw a map of your business model and how to think about the implications. You, for example, I spent a lot of time on, okay, dissecting the business model of Uber and Lyft and then saying, what does this teach us about their story, about self driving cars. You know, like if you draw a correct map of the world, it tells you something about the future. Uh, and so, uh, but anyway, so, so you know, I would say go to Tim dot [inaudible] dot com and from there you'll, you'll find everything else

Speaker 2:          02:10:54       and then on the best place to say hello and social that be at O'reilly media or

Speaker 5:          02:11:00       uh, at, at Tim O'reilly, Oily Tan. I do see all my, my app messages. Uh, and uh, also I respond to email and if you know my name, you can guess my email.

Speaker 2:          02:11:15       Well, Tim, thank you so much for taking the time. This was really fun for me and I have a reading list as long as my arm, which I'm prepared to dig into. Uh, is there anything, any question or suggestion suggested action that you would have for people listening before we completely wrap up?

Speaker 5:          02:11:40       Well, uh, I guess the, the, the biggest advice I would have is so trying to create a daily practice where you stop thinking and start listening to nothing and that they, some people would call that meditation. Uh, but it could be just, you know, like when you go, you know, if you go for a run, uh, don't think, just let things come into your head. You know, if you, uh, you know, sit by a fire or go sailing, those are good activities for letting that happen. Going for a very, very long walk till all the thoughts fall away because, you know, cultivating that, uh, that headspace and that soul space where, uh, you're not filling it up with the stuff you already have you already know, but are just, uh, listening is that, that Morgan's Tarot card, always remember this, the space that let stuff come in to you and surprise you and give you a new thoughts and, and you know, give rise to curiosity.

Speaker 2:          02:12:51       I think that is the perfect place to wrap up. Tim. Thank you so much again. I really appreciate you taking the time. Everybody's check out everything including your writing on media music. Great piece on, uh, how you separate out fake news from real news that a, I think it should be required reading so much more that we can dig into, uh, to thank you first and foremost and to everybody listening, you can find the show notes, so links to everything that we've discussed, including Tim's new book and everything else in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast along with every other episode. It's just check those out at tim.blog/podcast

Speaker 3:          02:13:33       and as always, until next time, thank you for listening. Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a few more things before you take off.

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       Just hell used by businesses on over and over again. I ended up getting again whole time fighting for causes dot. My Buddy Kevin Rose, no to forever, some of you know, and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic. I asked him as said, dude, you look great. What the hell have you been up to? Because he's always doing a weird diet or another, but it only lasts like a week or two. So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers. And he said, I've been doing peloton five days a week. Now that caught my attention because Kevin does nothing five days a week and you know, I love you Kevin, but it really peaked my curiosity. Ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week. I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling really boring usually.

Speaker 3:          02:17:23       But peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into your home. You don't have to worry about fitting classes into your schedule or making it to a studio with some type of cute et cetera. New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New York City instructors in your own living room. You can even livestream studio classes taught by the world's best instructors or find your own favorite class on demand. And in fact Kevin and I rarely do live classes and you can compete with your friends, which is also fun. Kevin, I'm coming after you but we usually just use classes on demand. I really like Matt Wilbur's and his iron, high intensity training sessions that are shorter, like 20 minutes. And I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone seems to have their favorite instructor or you can select by music duration and so on.

Speaker 3:          02:18:13       Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking metrics. I think that along with the real time leaderboard are the main reasons that this caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before. It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep your attention. The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you would expect so it can fit in a living room or an office. I actually have it in a large closet, believe it or not and it fits with no problem.
