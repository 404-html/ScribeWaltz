Speaker 2:          02:39          Hello Ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show where it is usually my job to deconstruct world class performers to tease apart the habits, routines, favorite books, et Cetera, dozens of things so that you can act on from people ranging from chess prodigies to four star generals. Special OPS commander is to everybody in between professional athletes, you name it. In this particular episode, we have an in between a sewed with Seth Goden, his last episode, which covers a lot of his bio and everything else. We really dug into the weeds. Super Fun is long. That one was about two, two and a half hours long. This one is short, it's about 30 minutes long and you can think of it as philosophical steroids. I listened to this. It takes a couple minutes to get warmed up, so be patient. But there are some incredible gems and I listened to a few times including how to keep track of the right things and creating a narrative that serves you as opposed to handicaps you. It's very, very simple, but it's a foundational skill and mindset that I

Speaker 2:          03:45          try to practice myself. And this was a fantastic reminder there. Just some really pithy, actionable things that you can implement. Uh, and I would suggest that you reflect on in journaling and so on. Seth is the author of 17 bestselling books. He is at, this is sets blog on Twitter. They've been translated into more than 35 languages. He writes about the way ideas spread, marketing, strategic quitting leadership, and most of all challenging the status quo in all areas. His books include, and I'm sure many of you have read more than one linchpin tribes, the dip purple cow, what to do when it's your turn and it's always your turn. He's founded companies. His blog, which you can find by typing Seth into Google is one of the most popular in the world. In 2013 he was inducted into the direct marketing hall of fame and he is constantly shaking things up and pushing the envelope, testing the impossible. Very, very brilliant guy. And with all of that said, please enjoy this round two with Seth Goden.

Speaker 4:          04:53          Thanks Tim for having me. What a pleasure to be back. I will start by pointing out how uh, erudite, intelligent, good looking, generous and thoughtful. Most of the people who listen to this podcast are, I was optimistic that as we dive through these questions and as Tim continues to long arc of what he's trying to talk about, people will see over and over again. And then in an economy based on connection, real connection comes from people who seek to contribute to the community first and that that asset, the trust that comes from that is priceless. So looking through these questions, skipping the one about why I look like a lizard and a few other questions that have to do with um, what it was like to be in a movie with James Franco who I've never met. So I've never been in a movie with James Franco.

Speaker 4:          05:52          I find that there are a few groupings. One gooping was, uh, talking about education and parenting. Another grouping was the mechanics of marketing. And I would say the biggest grouping was an understanding of the fear then each of us has to deal with in order to do this original work. I tried alphabetizing the questions in grouping. I've failed at that. So maybe what I'll do is go through them and as they prompt other thoughts, I'll weave those together. So it started with a James Roelof who kicked us off with a question. What's the one thing that most marketers do wrong? And this is easy. We're selfish. We are narcissists, infant tile narcissists who believed that our need for more and our desire for attention trumps everything else. We justify and rationalize our work and interrupt people, spam people, yell at people to save people and playing the short term game again and again.

Speaker 4:          07:00          And again, successful marketers are successful because they don't do that. And it turns out that that scares the folks who are willing to build a story that's true, to earn permission to create a product or service that spreads merely because it's remarkable. That mindset almost never shows up. Next question from Paul Van [inaudible]. How do you build a tribe from scratch? So the idea of tribes I think is fundamental to humanity. It's been around for thousands and thousands of years, but in the modern world in which we live, we can get confused because it might seem that our job is to build a tribe from scratch, but most of the time that's not what happened. Nike did not invent the running tribe. There were already runners before Nike showed up. Harley Davidson did not invent the outside or tribe, a group they called themselves the 1% long before the other 1% showed up.

Speaker 4:          08:08          That what we do when we lead a tribe often is we find people who are already connected and we merely show up to lead them. And for most businesses, most opportunities, we don't even lead them. We merely serve as a tribe that already exists. So then when you find a group of people who share an instinct and interest, a connection, a leader, a goal, and you give that group of people something with which they can take action to where I BVH that long sentence is people like us do things like this. Once you were able to say people like us do things like this, then you have found a tribe that can revolve around what you do. Switching over to the fear side, Jenny Western camp asked what limiting self beliefs did I change in order to become successful and how did I change them? Uh, this was actually work that I did on myself, uh, in college and have tried to continue doing and myself for a long time since then.

Speaker 4:          09:17          The self limiting beliefs, in fact, all of us because all of us like being competent, we like being respected. We like being successful. And when something shows up that threatens to undo all of those things, well then it's really easy to avoid it. And what goes hand in hand with that is the sour mindset. The mindset of we're not getting what we deserve. The mindset of the world is not fair. The mindset of why should I even bother? It's probably not going to work. And one thing, those of us who were lucky enough to live in a world where we have enough, when we have a roof and we have food, uh, is we find ourselves caught in this cycle of keeping track of the wrong things. Keeping Track of how many times we've been rejected, keeping track of how many times it didn't work, keeping track of all the times someone has broken our heart or double crossed us or let us down. Of course, we can keep track of those things, but why, why keep track of them? Are they making us better? Wouldn't it make more sense to keep track of the other stuff to keep track of it.
