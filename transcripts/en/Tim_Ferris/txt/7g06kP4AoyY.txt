Speaker 2:          00:02:26       hello ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where each episode is my job to deconstruct world class performers, to tease out the habits, routines, morning rituals, favorite books, etc. That have made them spectacularly good at what they do. And there are patterns that you notice across disciplines. That is why I interview people from a very broad spectrum of areas like the military, entertainment, chest, sports, comedy, et Cetera. So it ranges from Arnold Schwarzenegger to General Stanley McChrystal. And in this episode we have a dynamic duo. We have Seth Rogen at Seth Rogen, R, O, g, e, n who is an actor, writer, producer, and director and his partner in crime, Evan Goldberg at Evan Goldberg on the twitters, who is a Canadian director, screenwriter and producer. Together, they get into a whole lot of mischief and create some amazing comedy, and I had a chance to spend some time with both of these great gents as well as their team, which is spectacular and I won't mention the location in case they're keeping that quiet, but here's some background.

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       They've collaborated on films such as Super Bad, which they actually first conceived of as teenagers, knocked up pineapple express, the Green Hornet and funny people. They've also written for the Ali g show and the Simpsons. In 2013 evidence, Seth released their directorial debut. This is the end, which was actually a combination of two different ideas and we get into that in the conversation in 2014 set to start in and produced alongside Evan neighbors, which was a worldwide comedy hit and has taken in more than 268 million worldwide and then appearing in the news yet again in December, 2014 Rogan and Goldberg's film, the interview became easily the most talked about news story around the world and that was not just in the entertainment mags but in every different publication because of many reasons. So under extremely difficult circumstances. The film persevered to become Sony Pictures, number one, digital title of all time neighbors too is shooting right now and will be released next May. Seth and Evan are also in production on sausage party, which I saw a clip of a prelim clip, which is a Raunchy animated movie for adults about one sausage, his quest to discover the truth about his existence and I really hope to God that some of the Raunchy or scenes make it end because they will make your head explode.

Speaker 2:          00:04:49       Seth and Evan are producing that film with Megan Ellison and Conrad Vernon. In our conversation, the one you're about to listen to, we discuss all manner of tactics and silliness, including Kule, Cushing, karate, it's God empty hand and uh, how they participated in that writer's block and related debates. Does it exist? Does not exist. How do you contend with it if it does writing process? Uh, I ask questions like, who are the most underrated comedians and comedy writers? What is the odd book that Judd Apatow recommended to them, which happens to also be woody Allen's favorite. How super bad got made after the first drafted around age 13. How kids in the hall influenced them, the movie, they both wish they'd written common pot mistakes. So if you're just listening to this for a marijuana playbook, well there might be something in here for you as well. So recommended newb pot for working versus relaxing and much, much more.

Speaker 2:          00:05:43       So I really hope you enjoy this.

Thanks for having us. I appreciate you guys taking the time, especially in this very busy, busy month that you gents have. And a, I thought we could start with a story that we had discussed a little bit, Evan in the car, which was Kilkee shit. So tell me about

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       karate. He goes [inaudible] we're talking about when we were kids, how uh, how we behaved and how I was a softie. And so I did rugby and karate to cut, try and toughen myself up. And I joined at the Jewish community center, which is one of the places that we became really good friends. He said, had been doing it a few years before me. We'd already met him Bar Mitzvah class and our parents were like a Jewish community center that can't be much, you know, just simple karate and they let us beat the living shit out of. It was pretty, uh, I realize like we were, the bad guys from karate kid were a Cobra Kai. Yeah. Like we were banned from tournament and from tournaments. And then we finally went to a tournament and I realized that like the way they taught us to fight like was not conducive to tournament fighting.

Speaker 3:          00:07:24       And I punched the guy in the throat and got disqualified from tournament basically. And I didn't know that that wasn't like what you were supposed to do. I was just like, oh, he's supposed to beat the shit out of this condition to respond. I have a memory of one time where they made me fight that like 35 year old and when I was 14 and she liked choked me out on the ground until I pass though this was in class. I remember fighting like full grown men too. I remember hitting that guy rod so hard. I rod was like a 280 pounds, six foot three guy and he was like 1,440 and I hit him so hard in the face with like a spinning backhand that he knocked him in, like almost knocked him out. It like dazed him completely and then they let me, they look clean, let him fight me again.

Speaker 3:          00:08:12       Did he like punched me in the mouth so hard? I like couldn't. Uh, I couldn't like I think my mouth started bleeding and then I heard and then, but there's so many stories that are flooding of the day that ended it all where I got kicked in the hip by a 40 year old black belt who fractured my hip. And then he backed up into a pillar and got a piece of wood lodged in his foot and thus ended RQ cause, but I remember fighting with teacher on the ground one time, like the teacher Sean with like I remember like grappling on the ground with him. Ed like to the point where he would just like do anything you can't. And I was like trying to bite him. I was like spitting on him and like that was like what you were supposed to do in the class.

Speaker 3:          00:08:54       One time you did it, you would get in trouble and he'd be like, you could do more. Like it wasn't time. I spat in his face and then he took the spit and the exact same thing, exact same thing to me. And we thought it was like this is what [inaudible] Jewish community center karate is. So you mentioned Gilks in, you're like, I don't think, you know, people get the wrong image when I tell them karate and I from having lived in Japan for a year as an exchange student is first time I got exposed to kill Shin. And those were like the bad boys of the karate world. It was a very well known, like you don't want to get the leg kicks are very famous dude. One time I got there, the dentist, there's like grown men. This was child abuse. Like this guy had the log gets legs and be entirely these little brown slippers and I uh, and he just like kept kicking my legs out from under me relentlessly and there was nothing I can, he may stop it.

Speaker 3:          00:09:53       All of us, they made all of us watch as he did it to him for like, yeah, just like I would get up putting it like try to fight again and he would just like smack my legs out from under me. And just like, I remember just hitting the ground. There was this one guy, the guy who ended up fracturing my hip, which ruined my rugby and karate actually in your hip is not a small hairline fracture. It wasn't terrible, but it's enough that I couldn't run and stuff like that. Uh, Malcolm and he would do this thing to this day. I can't comprehend how he did it in a movie. You wouldn't believe it. He literally like casually put both hands behind. His back in a small room was try and hit me and I couldn't and I'm like 15, 16 real fit. I've been doing karate for like five years and I couldn't even touch him.

Speaker 3:          00:10:34       I remember Malcolm kicked me in the eye once so hard that my parents, I had to call their family friends who were eye doctors and take me to their house after the karate class cause I like couldn't see out of one of my eyes for like three hours. But I regret nothing. I regret nothing either. It's weird. It's weird down cause I'm so I thought it was always like not a violent person but I'm not competitive and I don't like care about any of that stuff that much. So it did it, did it turn you guys off of that type of thing sort of indefinitely? How that point or certainly as somebody who has like Tmj and like has had some joint issues, I can identify that that is too brutal. Like their knuckles were all puffed up and because we would break boards and if you didn't break the board you had to try it again.

Speaker 3:          00:11:19       I'm like, can I split a knuckle into sounds like a liability. It's weird because it was happening to get the Jewish community center and that's what's so strange about it. And then rent like it had, I don't think any of our parents by parents would come and watch some time, but they thought, I guess I hope to get to 100 frame of reference. Maybe something just felt like, oh, that's what crummy classes because he just picked me up and like not comment that I was bleeding from. My parents would come sometimes cause I started when I was younger so they like knew I did it for like over getting for 10 years or something like [inaudible] seven and you did it three? Yeah, I think I started, we did it

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       with our buddy, uh, Fogle and our buddy Corbyn or buddy Glassberg and they would just make us as friends, beat the shit out of each other. It was pretty, Glassberg was soft. He was there. He got to play the younger guys, which made them probably feel pretty good. When did you guys first meet? I mean first encounter each other? Uh, it was, I was going to, I went to like two hours of afterschool Hebrew school Tuesday, Thursday and he went to like a half Hebrew school, half normal school. He was a pretty much like, it was like a Hebrew school. It was like they did half and half studies, but it was like full on like Jewish elements. And he would get out when I would go in and I took the class at the synagogue, which was beside his school. Right. So we would see each other for years.

Speaker 4:          00:12:35       We didn't really know each other, but we would see each other and I was kinda like the loudest person from this side and he was friends with full role. Uh, I became, well yet this guy, Sammy Fogel, who is the [inaudible] of super bad, but he's not really that big of a loser. We just met him. Uh, he and I became good friends and sets mother and his mother were good friends and then it all kind of culminated to bar Mitzvah class. We all took Sunday morning, what was it called? Post to fill holes and to fill in class where they would give us chocolate milk and bagels to lure us to learn how to do our bar Mitzvah portion is departments for class if you gave me, yeah, I know it's a weird mix, but it's delicious and a, and we just kind of met there and because of Fogel we became friends.

Speaker 4:          00:13:14       Yeah. And when did you guys start collaborating creatively? In hindsight, like eight months later. How old were you guys? Around? 13, 12, 13. It was literally, it's not like we pretend we don't remember. We don't remember, but we were watching some crappy movie and we just looked at each other and we're like, we could write a better movie. And then there's like a pause. It's like we should write a better mood. And I think I would use stand up already at that point. And so like there was some context for like, we can write things and they'll become things like I was already like writing things and then performing them. So, um, it wasn't, it wasn't just like two, like we actually like wanted to make a movie, like it wasn't him. And then I'd already seen like, oh, you can tangibly like do something.

Speaker 4:          00:13:55       And a lot of people, uh, you know, I call you came all the way from Canada and, and, and it's not like, like Vancouver is a movie town going to movies at our high school, like almost anyone that we know in America is from. And they all think we're like bumpkins real city where they made tons of movies. And so you would see movie sets everywhere growing up. And our high school, they shot a lot of movies and Diamond Phillips Movie Masterminds starring Patrick Stewart and Vincent, Carl Pfizer. Uh, it's not a fantastic movie, but it was shot at our high school. And, um, and so you would see it around. And so it was like, it was Kinda like, no, we didn't know anyone in the business or anything like that or who was involved in movies. But, um, it was just like around, and so you kind of, my first interaction with our friend Amelia Wasserman's mother, uh, produced like kiddish kids shows and she like, let me try to write some kids episodes and gave me some point and I think Julia Martinez, his dad, like produce TV shows or something like that. I can't remember. Like, we knew people whose parents had like kind of like, you know, uh, jobs and like it was around, it was just kind of around this girl I dated Abby Salzburg. Her mother was a writer for the newspaper and she kind of gave me some pointers and helped me out. So we had like some help, but we didn't really have a hard in. I think one of my distant, distant cousins was a producer on passenger 57. The Wesley Snipes.

Speaker 3:          00:15:19       Yeah, I that I remember hearing as a child, it's really fascinating that you say you're given the opportunity to kind of tinker in the writing perspective with, uh, with these episodes. When I grew up next to the, uh, the gent who created the choose your own adventure book series. What's, yeah, that's awesome. So we had my brother and I had chances to test drive his books, provide feedback, and this is a bad choice. He gave him feedback, ended up using, he would put our names into the books. If you go back there, a handful of books, books and yeah, that was, they were a power couple of his friends was walking through the woods. [inaudible] he was warning the mountains are dangerous. And you guys, is it true that you started working on super bad around that time? And we started writing. We sat down

Speaker 4:          00:16:13       and started that. That was the first thing we ever tried to do was writing. She was writing Superman and it was, it was terrible at first, but it was really bad at first. But, um, but that being said, we liked movies so much and we're so into movies that like looking back, we kind of instinctually like understood the vague structure of movies in like a pretty instinctual way. And like we loved bad movies, which I think actually was extremely beneficial. What not to do. Tons of B movie was this place called Video Matika. Is that what it's called? There were seven movies for $7 for seven days. It was correct. And we would go and do that and watch them all. And it was, you know, get like two good movies in five crappy. But then around this time was when movies like pulp fiction and clerks and like that, like, like a Rushmore and a bottle rocket.

Speaker 4:          00:17:03       Like it was kind of like the dawn of like nineties independent cinema. And we were really, really into those movies too. And again, a lot of those movies, you know, uh, at least in theory had to care. And the myth had kind of like a do it yourself feel. We're like Kevin Smith just make clerks clearly. Like they just got a camera and just made a bunch of friends were like, let's fucking do this. Did. And that was very like inspirational to us, uh, because it just seemed very achievable, you know? Um, and so I think that's one of the reasons we again started doing it. It was just like, we're like, it was about high school kids. We knew high school kids, I want it to be an actor. We knew there was other kids in our school who were trying to be actors and stuff like that.

Speaker 4:          00:17:45       And so it just kind of seemed like we, like if we write a high school movie, we could make a high school movie basically. Yeah. And he had his standup start. And uh, for me it was like, when I was like five years old, if he asked me what I wanted to do was be a writer, I always want it to be a writer. They actually tried to send me to a psychiatrist in elementary school because I would write like dark stuff. Cause my Hebrew school, I learned about the Holocaust and I kept writing about the Holocaust and they thought there was something wrong with me. But I remember we met when he was like the first person I ever met who like wrote recreationally other than me. Like I wrote stand up and he wrote like stories and stuff like that. And I remember like when you're like a 13 year old kids eat a lot of other 13 year old kid who's like, what are their hobbies is writing recreationally. It's not that common. And so he kind of made me realize what the standup, he was like, like he just did it. And so we both were like, what if we just did this? Uh, no one at this age is trying to do it. So if we get a jump on it, maybe we'll do. Okay. And also it seems like the easiest path to becoming a writer. Like I tried to write a novel once and I failed. It is really hot.

Speaker 5:          00:18:49       Those are hard. Yeah. And you just funny you mentioned the school psychologist. So I was sent to the school psychologist. Also everyone in this room,

Speaker 6:          00:18:55       I was for sure

Speaker 5:          00:18:59       the writing assignments I didn't want to do. And so thematically I would turn them into stories about serial killers.

Speaker 6:          00:19:05       I think it's a common reaction,

Speaker 4:          00:19:08       dystopian future story about a bunch of kids trying to get out of a Nazi control

Speaker 6:          00:19:12       future. And it ended with all of them dying. You invented the young adult novel, you invented divergent and the hunger games. The reason they tried to send me to drink is because I drew the

Speaker 4:          00:19:26       picture of all their

Speaker 5:          00:19:27       ups is at the end. That's a, that's a nice touch for those people who wouldn't take the time to read it. You've got to really spell it out. So what was, what was the difference before you set then in the early days, uh, between, what were the biggest differences between writing for standup? And this can be contemporary like in general and writing for film for instance.

Speaker 4:          00:19:46       Um, I, I've thought about it a lot and when we started writing movies I honestly like, and, and when we started doing it more, I kind of became less interested in writing stand up in some ways because like, and I honestly think that good stand up, I wasn't the best stand up comedian is one thing. Like I would, I was pretty good. I was like a B plus standup comedian, a minus. I wasn't like an a plus 10 and comedian and I'm not saying that we're like the best script writers in the world, but we've achieved a plus moments I think here and there. And so that, that was one of the things I was just like aware of. I would just like watch other people do it and be like, wow, this guy's like doing something like that. I like here, they're just better at it, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:20:31       And when we started writing movies, I started to feel like, oh, like we act like this. I feel like we could maybe again like really carve out our own niche doing, which I didn't feel like I was particularly doing, doing standup. I was young and that was at first and each is like I would write about my young person's experience, but then as I got older I found like, I don't know as a standup I was struggling a little bit to find a unique perspective. I have a theory you cease to be tortured. Yeah, exactly. That was part of it. I was like really tortured when I was, I mean, I mean I wasn't that not really tortured like you know, young neuro seasoning. I'll stand standup comics function largely. Not all of them but a lot of them on anxiety. Like self obsessed that much.

Speaker 4:          00:21:15       Yeah. I don't find myself that interesting. Honestly. One of the other things is like I, and I think writing, and that's one of the reasons I think writing movies was, was better is because I was writing other people and I also struggled with stand up is that you could only really, and again good standups do this, but I couldn't find a way to do it is like I can only talk from one perspective in Standup, but in a movie you can write two or three or four or five or six perspectives all in one scene. You could have five guys arguing there about how to, you know, turn it, you know, how to do anything, what's the best way to get out of this room, you know, and to, and as we started writing, like, you know, some of the best scenes that we've ever achieved are literally just people screaming at each other.

Speaker 4:          00:22:00       And so like I think that was something that I thought was very funny that we were good at was like conflict. And it's hard to have like conflict in stand up comedy for me, I couldn't find a way to do it. Other people do it and they tell stories that involve conflict. And the whole thing is about, you know, the struggle. And I look at it now and sometimes I think like, man, if I kept doing it, I maybe would have broken through a wall. But, um, I just, I dunno. And I loved movies. That was the other thing is just like, and I, I loved movies also, but I was a bit more of a comic nerd. He was a comic nerd too, but I was like extreme comic meaning comic book. Yeah. My brother is a natural speed reader. He reads it at a remarkable pace. He can read a book in a day, like a 400 page book, just burn through it. So he would read comics and mountains of them would form and then he would draw them. So I would mimic him cause he was two years older and I would read all the comics he read and then try to draw like him. He's actually an expert. He's a very good artist. He drew all the penises for Superbad. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:23:01       make a cameo in the big Lebowski and he's a lawyer now. But, uh, I tried to like mimic him with that stuff and, and comics are just movie storyboards there isn't mad again. And I read all the comic books too. I think that's it. I mean it's like we connected heavily over Calvin and Hobbes. Yeah. We love artists of all time. The sarcasm of it, like forged our own genius. But I think we just liked like the cinematic, like again, comics and like it just seemed appealing. Um, and again, I think, yeah, and it's funny that at the time, like, like if you look at what we've done recently, like we like grandiose things, we like big things to happen, end of the world scenarios and all that. But at the time, all we knew was that we really wanted to get laid. We weren't getting laid and we weren't super cool.

Speaker 4:          00:23:48       And I think the reason Superbad worked out is it's rare that you are the thing you're writing on at the moment. You're doing it and you're self aware of it. And we're still, I mean, and that's something that we've continued to try to do, honestly. I mean neighbors, you know, it was a very good example. All my friends are having, our friends are having kids or trying to have kids and are married and her getting older and are moving into different places. And like, I don't have a kid and I want to go out and I call all my friends and none of them can that they had. So I think from the get go, um, and that's something that came from stand up comedy. Like there's a comic named Darryl Lennox who still performs, um, who is great. And He, the comics were very nice to me, which is in retrospect, insane.

Speaker 4:          00:24:30       Cause I would not be nice to like a 13 year old kid who was doing standup comedy. I don't think. Maybe I would, but I don't assume I would. But I remember he saw me perform and I used to have like jokes. I would try to like mimic other comedians like Steven writers, Seinfeld, like what's the deal with crazy glue? And he was like, he was like, dude, you're like the only 14 year old. He's like, you're the only person here who could like talk about trying to get like a hand job for the first time. Talk about that. Like, that is like so much more interesting than anything you're talking about. Like, why are you just talking about that? And I was like, oh, you're right. That's actually a very good way of doing it. And then that kind of carried through everything.

Speaker 5:          00:25:09       Yeah. And uh, it, it's, it's, um, I've been really fascinated just sort of observing you guys work and, uh, you know, realizing that at least for me, when you get started super bad at a time when those, uh, all those feelings were very kind of ever present in your lives. And when I look back and say, pass books, people have asked me like, what would you edit? What would you change? And I don't want to touch it because I feel like it was written at a very precise point in time related to very specific pains that I might not be experiencing now because it's a, you know, the chapters passed on. What, uh, what does your writing process look like now? A lot of people have asked me to ask you both this, uh, but what is just from the, the very first sort of concept stages? Well, uh, as I was telling you earlier, it's changed a little.

Speaker 4:          00:25:53       We just did this project preacher with a guy named Sam Catlin chasing bad and, and we used to immediately start like kind of we, we would always write down ideas and he taught us this new trick of not writing down ideas for a good month and just talk, shooting it around and talking and talking and talking. And I kept saying, look, now we're going to write. Right? And he was like, no, no, no. We just keep talking. And that's a new trick that I think was great. Just spend way more time talking to you about it. That's what he said in breaking bad. They would do is just like, before they did anything, they would just talk and talk and talk. And it's something as you look, we did an undeclared. When I look back at it, it's like we're just anxious to get going I think sometimes.

Speaker 4:          00:26:30       But I feel like now, I mean, and it's kind of always been this way in that like we'll come up with ideas and it's like sometimes it's like there's almost like a Darwinistic process food a year later or so. Like if it's something we're still talking about sometimes years later, there's some, I mean like there's this movie that we're talking about writing. I was going through old files, like the first one from like 2011 or something like that. Tangible example is, this is the end. We had two separate ideas. One was a movie about the apocalypse and another one was celebrities playing themselves in a disaster type scenario. Both of those ideas that survived for four, five years and they slowly, we realized if we merge these things, it's going to be a good synthesis. And uh, and that, that's the perfect example. Like we, we, we, you know, we'd just be sitting around working on whatever and it'd be like, what about that apocalypse? Or it's just what we talk about. Like, I mean, it's, it's like, you know, we like what we do and it's fun for us to think about it so organically we'd just be sitting there doing something else. And that's the thing. We would just start joking around about, you know? And then if it sticks around, then it at least means that we like, it isn't, I like, like, like, like, like lately I've been obsessed with artificial intelligence and we're not writing anything about that. But in a year from now, if I'm still talking about it,

Speaker 5:          00:27:52       maybe it'll happen. So when you have something that's really persistent like that, and you have, say the celebrities playing, playing themselves and the end of the world and you're like, you know, this could be really interesting if we combine these two things at the time. Uh, not necessarily now that you have the input from the breaking bad writer on that approach, but what were the next steps you guys took once you were like, you know what, let's, let's try to pull the trigger on this.

Speaker 4:          00:28:13       Well, we, it took us a really long time to figure out how to do it. Honestly, that was one of those movies were bizarrely, it just took us like we could think of the first three, two acts of the movie and then we couldn't figure out how to end the movie. And it little joke was like a year and a half I think until we thought of the idea that they realize they can still redeem themselves basically, which is what allows the third act to happen, which is they're all starting trying to redeem themselves and, and we just didn't think of that and it was literally just like we couldn't do it. I mean, while we're working on other stuff and doing it, it's not like we're just sitting in a room for a year and a half, like bang our heads against the wall. It's like we're still doing things. But that if like, I mean in that example it literally just took us a really long time to come up with the idea that allowed the movie to, to function.

Speaker 4:          00:29:01       And then once we thought of that idea, I remember we wrote the first draft of this in the end and like nine days or something like that. That was all three acts or just set the whole, we wrote the home movie like the whole first, the hundred and 20 pages. We wrote the whole script. We Sat, we had an extensive outline. Yeah, because we'd been kicking it around for years. And like one thing we do, a lot of our movies are kind of genre based, especially lately, you know Pineapple Express and this is the end and the interview to some degree. And so something we do is just watch tons of movies in that genre. And so like with this the end, we just watched tons of these like horror movies and apocalypse movies and movies about isolation and kind of grew little groups of people that are stuck together.

Speaker 4:          00:29:43       And as we do that, we just are joking around and coming up with ideas. Oh it wouldn't be funny if we, we send a guy out on a rope, it's like, oh they need water. And then you just kind of pick up these themes in the movies. Like when Craig Robinson went out of the house with a rope that was based off of the mist. Exactly. And part of it, I mean, and we talk a lot about of it is like really trying to like have our cake and eat it too. In these movies like it, it's like we are kind of like mocking the genres as we were trying to participate in the full heart fully, you know? And in doing that we'd like to, it's almost like the characters in the movie are aware of the same cultural references that we are. And so it would stand to believe that all that stuff would be on the table basically.

Speaker 4:          00:30:25       And so, so that's a big part of the process is just lists of ideas. Tons of ideas. Jonah gets possessed, someone gets puked on, they need water, someone steals the water, someone doesn't like the rules. They try to make rules. How do they split up the food and something like, oop, just at this into like a notebook or do you put it into a word document? It's just a, it's just a running list. There's yelling right now with the latest idea we're messing about with like a 10 page. We have like a 10 page lists and I think there's another 10 pages this week literally. And it's like, it's like a relationship type movie. So there's like I do, it's just like things happen to us. It was just like, oh a fight about this husband who holds back, wife, wife who enhances husbands positive. And then it's just like, it's also just like house warming party.

Speaker 4:          00:31:10       Like it's things like that and like, or we'll go to a party and something funny will happen and you put that in. So it's just a stream of consciousness collection and, and again and like, and like the ideas themselves. As you go through these lists over and over throughout the years, some ideas you kind of stick in your head and you remember and some start to seem stupid and you start to create characters kind of based on the ideas are sometimes you call with the characters first and sometimes you'll just meet someone and you'll be like someone like that, someone who is going through this in life for, you know what I mean? Um, and it can come from anywhere. And then for a while we got really uh, uh, and then process wise I think we kind of strayed a little bit in that. We got so busy, we started kind of like farming it out just a little bit to other people, which is something that we're kind of trying to not do is do a lot of stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:32:01       And so we had other people writing stuff for us and it all worked out very well, but we got it. I think literally at the end of the day if like the thing we are best at is actually writing and, and I think we kind of stopped doing that honestly for awhile in Lou we got to, we got the opportunity to become directors and that was so exciting that we just want it to direct another one and then we'd go home and we will be coming producers as well which and like, and it was all kind of, it wasn't like a plan. It was a very organic thing that was happening as our careers we're building and expanding in a different directions. But that was happening looking back, uh, our writing, which is probably the thing we're best at got kind of pushed to the side a little bit, but now that we've done I think a pretty okay job setting up these other things are producing is going very well or directing, you know, is established.

Speaker 4:          00:32:57       And so I think we can refocus on writing things and kind of settled back into what we were doing really exciting too because the producing and the directing caused this cycle where it was like, we got to get another one out because we need to, you know, you direct one movie, you're not really a director until they can drink like two or three things and then they're like, oh, this guy's not going anywhere. But now that we've gotten past that hurdle, we can go back to what we really liked, which is writing things and not rushing. Yeah, exactly. How did the first script you guys collaborated on, uh, that got sold or got made a cross that chasm Superbad yeah, it took 10 years and years and years. Basically I moved to La to do freaks and Geeks, um, when I was 17. Just a quick interjection then.

Speaker 4:          00:33:43       Why did they do a casting call? It was at your high school? No, it was um, or they went to Vancouver sometimes on, um, based in La. It was, it was, it was based, it was set in Michigan. It was shot in La. But sometimes, uh, Judd and Paul Judd Apatow and Paul Feig, the Creator and Paul the Creator and judge, the executive producer of freaks and geeks. It had a very, they wanted very real kits and they had an idea from the beginning that they wouldn't find them in that if you're in La, you're like an actor kid and that there's a good chance that you are not what they're looking for. That being said, I think they cast, I think everyone but me and one other guy out of la, but so they were kind of wrong but thank God they looked at least because, so what they did is they did casting calls of Vancouver and Boston and New York and Chicago and Toronto and all these cities and I got to audition in May Coover and they were there like Paul and Judd, like we're in Vancouver.

Speaker 4:          00:34:43       Yeah. They were like in the room and I recognize Paul Feig cause he's in this movie a ski patrol, which I had seen Jason's keep control. And so, uh, see the topless woman, no pervy version of Ski School Ski Patrol's not that pervy this may be one. And that's why I was sort of it it, yeah, it's not, it's not ski school. Um, but that threw me anyway. Um, and so yeah. And so they cast me from Vancouver and I moved to l w I went there and shot the pilot and then I came back and then it got picked up and then I'm, and so I was very lucky cause I like moved to La like with a job. Like I wasn't like one of, I didn't have to like go to La and like try to find work for myself. Like I went there employed, which was like, I, at the time I didn't realize like how many massive hurdles when it was overcoming just by doing that, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:35:39       Um, and then so I was there and then meanwhile we're writing super bad and I give it to Judd and Judd Judd was very busy at the time running the show, which was like going down in flames basically, even though it was very good. And so he kind of didn't pay too much attention to it at first. But Jake Kasdan, who was one of the directors of the show, um, who has gone on to direct, uh, tons of movies and stuff like that, he directed the pilot of freaks and Geeks. He, um, he really, he's just like a very nice guy. He was around, he was in his twenties. He's very young and so he just like really took a lot of time to like sit with me and talk to me about it. He would give us notes on it. And like, it was just very encouraging because he was like, this is good and you can keep working on this. And I was just at university

Speaker 3:          00:36:29       see it at McGill in Montreal a little time because I couldn't come to America even if I wanted to, cause I didn't have a visa. His Dad's American dads in there, but I wanted to be a writer and it seemed like via him on freaks and Geeks, we had an inlet. So I studied us history, so I knew who I was writing for. Right.

Speaker 6:          00:36:45       Yeah. Good idea. I loved history and I thought if I understood America,

Speaker 3:          00:36:49       it gets better. I could write better for Americans because I knew that I knew Canadians. And uh, and America is quite different.

Speaker 4:          00:36:55       Yeah. But then after at some point, jug did read it and it was, um, during the show we did a undeclared. So freaking he's got canceled. And then because Judd read super bad, he got another show going the next year called undeclared, which was about college freshmen. I was literally the exact age of a college freshman. And so, and he liked how super bad was written, so he hired me as a writer on the show. And so, and then juring on declared he really like, took, uh, like a produce oriel role on Superbad and we'd give us tons of notes and try to, and that's when we first started going around trying to sell it. That was in like 2000, 2001. And then 2002. Yeah. He said,

Speaker 3:          00:37:45       bring your friend on down. I'll, I'll throw him a tiny bit of cash so he can live and you guys should try to write something else. So I came down and we spent two months writing Pineapple Express, which he told us to come up with a hundred ideas for movies, which is insane. We got to 50 which is great. We never made any of them. And then, uh, and then he was like, these are awesome, but you should instead write a movie about a pothead who's a process server who gets hunted by his own dealer. And we said that's stupid and that will end your career before it ever happened to be like a modern Cheech and Chong. And he just said, ah, but what if it was good?

Speaker 6:          00:38:18       Yeah. We were like, oh what if it was good?

Speaker 4:          00:38:23       We love action movies and you know, die hard and lethal weapon. And they were like, oh what if we kind of make it like a nineties like these nine these action movies that we love so much. And so we wrote pineapple trust pretty like we just loved it. It wasn't, we started doing, we really well [inaudible] ourselves in the morning, like maybe like six weeks or something like that. It was like one of those things where like wake up at 3:00 PM until 6:00 AM we were very unhealthy at this time in our lives. This was that the time when we got a Costco card and gained like 20 pounds reading seafood get passed in cheese because it was cheap all day long. It was gross. So, so by the end of, I think like 2002 both pineapple express and super bad were written and just no one wanted to make them.

Speaker 4:          00:39:08       And it would, it would come close, it'd be someone, oh, we might make it and then it wouldn't happen. And we might make, and every now and then, and like I didn't have the money to do it. I would fly down, we would go and pitch it, or my dad would drive with me from Vancouver and we'd go and pitch it. And every time we pitched it, probably 10 times, Judd and Seth and me would go and my dad would drop me off and we'd go in and they'd be like, we love this, this is great. And we're like, okay, so you're gonna make it. And they're like, oh no, we can't. And I was supposed to play the Seth role. And slowly throughout this process, like I just, I still remember the meeting where like always I was like, I'm going to place that.

Speaker 4:          00:39:40       And that I remember like it took so many years, there was like what BD rose like, I think this was the meeting where I no longer should say that I'm going to place that cause I'm 23 years old. So we uh, these were studio heads or studio exactly what it was. It was, it was some new companies with like weird money that comes from who knows where it was some studios, it was like every type of thing you could imagine. Basically when did the, instead of the other shoe drop in the positive. So meanwhile like we start getting work, we get hired on the leg show, which is great. Um, and it's just, it, it starts to make things like pick up a little for us. I was in the 40 year old virgin, like things like that started to happen and while he was doing 40 old virgin just invited me to participate in some capacity, but I knew I had to finish my degree so I could actually stay legally.

Speaker 4:          00:40:31       So I finished my degree in, missed out on that. And by the time I came down the premiere, it happened and the movie had hit. Yeah. And so Judd started to become a successful movie person. Um, like a, it was now a director and writer and a producer and incredibly successful one. So, uh, an increment had come out and done well, which he was a producer on and then Talladega nights came out and did really well. And I think it was wait, Talladega nights didn't come up before we made knocked up. They made knocked up first, didn't we? We did. I don't know. I don't think so. I remember going with Judd to the Deville Film Festival, I think for 40 year old virgin while he was here in Atlanta. I think shooting Talladega Nights, I'm bad with years in time. But this was approximately, you would have happened. And then around now it's like, you know when you get successful like Judd was, people just start wanting whatever you have. And so it was Sony was just like, we'll make stuff and so they Superbad

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       and then at the time to make an a however much it was like 22 million like it was, uh, it was, it was a bizarre model that had never been done. No famous people, low budget. It was kind of an experiment in the studio was doing to see if they could make big movies at a smaller budget without famous pan. They also, pun, what's crazy is knocked up pineapple express and super bad. We're all made in like one year I think basically like we made them like back to back to back because that it was essentially like once the flood opened we just like shoved everything in there that we like. If you just look at like statistically we're going to be done in two years. Yeah, exactly. So you have to take advantage of the way everything and and then and then knocked up and knocked up and sue bag came out the same summer in both did really, really well. And so he was a coproducer on 40 old virgin and they made him an IEP on, knocked up and judge just made me an e p two which was bonkers. And I remember on the third day, Evan's first day on set, he was an executive producer

Speaker 6:          00:42:34       [inaudible] universal studios. I remember

Speaker 3:          00:42:40       really hard cause I was like, can I just take however much water I want again man, you can have all the water you want. And I was like, what about the coffee cups of coffee a day? And I remember I saw Katherine Heigl and I was like, Hey, what's up? We've been working together for like a week. And then she went up to set and it was like, wow, that guy has got a lot of energy. He's got great.

Speaker 6:          00:43:00       He was like, oh this is his first week on the moon reaction.

Speaker 3:          00:43:08       Evan, when you first found out the sewer bad was going to get made. I mean it was that, I mean I assume I freaked out and lost my mind. Uh, I don't remember. Or was it not such a blur? Because as he said, it all went down in one year. It was just the most exciting year ever. But also for me, like he'd been working, yeah, I've been going to school. Right. Which meant not going to school and getting drunk and hanging out with friends. Like I barely went to class, so I had this shocking shift from like slackers student to working 14 hours a day. And I remember I would have to sneak away and just like go into a bathroom and sleep for like 20 minutes because I wasn't used to it. I couldn't handle it. That's why I'm drinking so much coffee.

Speaker 3:          00:43:48       It was a really hard transition for me, but knocked up was kind of like boot camp because you know, it was his big shot to make something really huge for sure. So we would go 16 hours, 17 hours, 14 hours days, and I almost lost my mind. But by the end of it, I think I was like Kinda a battle hardened to ride, get a condition for it all. And what, what were some of the, the lessons that you guys learned have learned from Judd? I mean, what are the, some of the takeaways for whether it's the creative process or, so

Speaker 6:          00:44:14       that's a, that's a whole other, we could fail. The

Speaker 3:          00:44:18       biggest thing we learned from him, in my opinion, he's like, and, and we talked about this earlier, is don't keep stuff to yourself. Like when you're surrounded by smart people, bring them in and get other people's opinions to share it with them. And most importantly, emotion is what matters. It's an emotional journey. It doesn't matter if the aircraft carrier hits the skyscraper in a collapses onto the hero. It's what is he feeling when that happens and why does it matter that he has to get out of the rubble? He just taught us like emotion is the key. Like the 40 old virgin is a crazy, weird movie. It's insane. But it's about a guy who's got like a wound that he wants to heal. And through this journey. He does. And it's, it's all about that. You mentioned that to me in every, every character has to have a wound that's a big Jug Judaism.

Speaker 4:          00:44:58       Yeah. I think I mean about the process. I mean he basically like, yeah, like taught us the process that we use a lot. I mean, especially in regards to collaboration and

Speaker 3:          00:45:10       [inaudible] he was somewhat revolutionary in, in, in how he did it. Like people had done it before, like a Christopher guest and other people. But Judd figured out a way to make improv and mainstream movies collide in a way that I don't think anything,

Speaker 4:          00:45:23       no one was really doing it like that. And yeah, I mean the filming process itself, um, and how, how to work on set is something that he thought was a lot about. I mean, again, it's all, it was Tufts that was partially figured out together, but he worked for years and years and years before us. And I mean, it's so funny. It often, I remember one time we were filming a scene and knocked up I think, and improvising and he's, or maybe it was even 40 old virgin, the direction he screamed at us, cause he screams direction from another room a lot, which is hilarious. But when he screamed at us was less semen, more emotion. And I think like that is actually like across the board. Good note to apply. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:46:07       yeah. But, uh, I think it was just the area we were riffing on, but I think, uh, yeah, I mean what happened was saying exactly right, like the emotional core. Like what, what does it really you about? Like, um, and, and that the movies and then, and that movies can be very sweet and still like, uh, and especially if you're good at make a movie that is so like, you know, I'm dirty or aggressively, you know, um, you know, uh, filled with profanity and that thing that like, it helps if they're sweet and if you really like, if they're not mean spirited and if you, uh, and, and, and write what, you know, it was a big thing and try to inject your own like honesty and experiences into your work, even if it's a weird spy movie or end.

Speaker 3:          00:46:55       It is just about Jay and Seth and Jay is upset that Seth has found new friends and Seth is upset that Jay seems to be holding onto the past. That's what the movie's about. It has nothing to do with the apocalypse really. That's just the, the, the area at all went down in when looking at filmmaking or comedy movies specifically, if you guys could have written something that someone else wrote and besides your own stuff where you're like, ah,

Speaker 4:          00:47:22       adaptation adaptation, it's the best. It's the best movie. It's a masterpiece and the script is even better than

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       the a movie. I think they made the right choice with the changes they made. But the script is just unreal. That's like one of those, not a lot of movies making like mind blowing. We jealous when I saw that I was just like, like five of my best ideas. Like I was like, oh, there should be a movie with someone who has anxiety represented by a character. And I was like, oh, he did this 10 times better than I ever could, plus 10 other things that I had as a whole. And the mood is like funny and awesome. And like it's just the story of how that came together. Also in terms,

Speaker 6:          00:48:00       yeah. That he was hired to write bad uptake, freaked out and it could do it. It's like, it's metal

Speaker 3:          00:48:08       backstory is, is so funny. And then I would say on the flip side, to me the most magical, uh, emotional beautiful movies, the princess bride, my favorite. Yeah. It's just, I can't watch it too much.

Speaker 5:          00:48:21       That was, uh, you know, I've had this fascination of screenwriting even though I haven't pulled the trigger on anything, but the, the screenplay that the did, it was the princess bride reading. Uh, William Goldman had the book on it. So good. It's a great, all the backstory. It's the one of the scenes in adaptation because you mentioned it. One of my favorite scenes is when he's sitting in the movie Nicholas Cage, sitting in his apartment at this typewriter and he's like, [inaudible] you hear me?

Speaker 6:          00:48:47       Internal dialogue. So hungry, like I need some coffee. What are, what are your

Speaker 3:          00:48:55       opinions of writer's block? Oh, ah, we touched on this earlier. I think writer's block is complete bullshit legion. Is it? Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:49:05       sure. I have it right now.

Speaker 3:          00:49:09       Like it's a term people give to a bad week. Like I have bad weeks. I don't have writer's block. Writer's block implies that like you can't do it. Some things are just harder than other things. Like you could have said that we had writer's block on. This is the end when we couldn't figure out the third act. I don't call that writer's block. I say that was the biggest struggle that we just have never experienced it. Uh, which is why you don't think it exists. But I think that like you think that we've never said no way. I imagine, I think what I think what happens to people actually, and we're just lucky that we haven't experienced it, is they become uninspired like that I think is what writer's block is. And we're just lucky because that has never happened to us. I take issue with the term, especially block writers, difficulties writers struggle with writer's cramp. Writer's block implies like it's just not going to happen. But I think if you truly lose your inspiration or your who you are as a creative person, I think people experience those moments. And that's right here. I think that's what writer's block.

Speaker 5:          00:50:10       What would you attribute that to? Do you think that's because you guys are writing what you know or what is,

Speaker 6:          00:50:17       yeah, this

Speaker 3:          00:50:21       is not doing great. The other one can pick up the weight when one of us is uninspired. The other one could be like by Romans where I'm just like,

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       I don't even know what the fuck we're doing anymore. Why are we doing this? And then he'll just have an idea and I have to just keep going. And then you plow through and there's probably moments he's thinking the similar thing and I'm, and in that moment I'm not thinking that. And so it allows us to keep going. But there's, there's, there's a beauty to writing stuff on your own. But specifically for movies, I think writing as a team is extremely beneficial. Even if you do write alone, you should be sharing what you're writing with everyone all the time, all the time. Because writer's block as some call it, and I would rather not easily be solved by just getting someone to help you. Right. And I think a lot of writers, uh, the biggest problem I think writers have is they're like, I can't show people until it's ready.

Speaker 4:          00:51:04       And that's poppy. You show it immediately. I think if you just talk about your ideas are like, and I think that's how if you have writer's block that like there's probably a reason you have it, there's probably a reason you're uninspired and that is the thing you should be writing about. Like I think and I think in order to arrive at that you need to talk to someone. Sometimes it's like, and I think that's why it's helpful to have another person is like we're very open with each other. We talk about pretty much everything that's happening in our lives with one another. And so it's not like I'd just be sitting there grumpy and he's like gotten an is like no, not, not feeling it today. Like, like we would, I would explain why and that would probably, we do an idea because we like to write them that way.

Speaker 4:          00:51:49       That's why it to both of us adaptations, the most genius thing ever. Cause a guy, it's a movie about writers took writer's block and made it something. And I guess that's my beef with writer's block is like that's, it's just something stopping you, but it'll put you in another direction. So it's, it's still the path you're taking. Who, who in your mind, whether right now, you know, alive or dead or the most, some of the more underrated comedy writers will, Hannibal Burress is a standup comic. He's not a writer, but that man is a unspeakable genius. Hannibal burse, Burris, Burris, he, uh, he started this whole bill Cosby thing and yeah, if you don't bill Cosby [inaudible] attribute that we have a guy who we're working with named Joe. Mandy is bizarrely genius. I think Sasha was one of the funniest guy. I mean, Garry Shandling is brilliant to me.

Speaker 4:          00:52:41       Like the Larry Sanders show, I think in a lot of ways, does a lot of the stuff that a lot of people try to do today. There's a, there's an animator who I think and writer who I think was one of the greatest geniuses to ever live named Don Hertzfeld and he's amazing. He made this thing called rejected. That is the funniest thing I think I may have ever seen in my entire life. He, he, he animates by hand usually with a 16 millimeter camera. He just started using computers a little, but, uh, it's, it's, he's really, it's like stick figures literally, and it's, it's the most genius thing I've ever seen. He's incredible. Um, and uh, yeah, he's probably not as lauded as one could be. I think he gets nominated for, I think he won an Oscar action. Nevermind. Fuck. It does a really good looking.

Speaker 6:          00:53:27       But uh, yeah, I mean I I think like, uh, Matt, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:53:31       and tray of Southpark and book of Mormon to me are like two of the funniest humans ever created. Again, Judd and I mean, who, who is like, like growing up I was really into like SCTV like Martin short and in the hall on SCTV played on a loop in the hall. The hall is like in the halls, like very, it was very influential on us and we watched it a ton growing up. I've seen every single episode. Like, I never will turn on an episode and it's one, I haven't seen it. You want to see what one that kind of changed our lives, Shirley, which is one of the strangest, and they did this short, I believe how sausage sausage is s. H. I. R. L. I. N. G. It's a made up word. But what was great about kids will hold is how insane it was. And like, and it was, and, and, and, and at the time it didn't seem insane because we watched it so much and it was on so much as we got older and started to make stuff, we realized like, I don't think I could get that show on air right now.

Speaker 4:          00:54:33       It's so bonkers. And the fact that they got to do whatever they want it even though like two out of the five times it was a big miss. The other times it's just like they nailed it because they got to do what they really want it to in their hearts. And like, we've gotten to work with Lauren Michaels and I've, uh, I've got to be around them a bunch. And like, that's one of the things we talked to him about the most. Every time we're around him and he, and he's very proud of the show, but he says, I mean, he's like, the key to that show was letting those guys do whatever they wanted and that was it. He's like, that was, that show was like, they had to do all of it cause that's how crazy it was. We also had a, well also quickly, Mel Brooks was like a huge thing.

Speaker 4:          00:55:11       Laura is amazing. I mean, he's not like no one is being a writer by trade or anything, but he's a very funny guy and like, it's like the Steve jobs of columns and it's unbelievable what he's done. And like, he's someone that every time I am around him, it's like, uh, it's, it's, it's truly like an awe inspiring. Just from being in Canada, we had a lot of British television, so we got a lot of those like Fawlty towers and Monte Python. That gave us like a, uh, an attitude towards comedy, that Ab Fab. Did you watch that growing up? My Mom, absolutely fabulous. Yeah. My parents were really into comedy and watched a lot of woody Allen movies when I was growing up and like, uh, are there needs late bloomers in comedy writing who has not say known since they were kids that they want it to be in comedy or in writing who have kind of come onto the scene and done well that come to mind. I mean that come to mind. There must be, there must be. I mean it's a tough question but it's a good one. I can't think of anyone. More comedy directing, acting Ferris.

Speaker 6:          00:56:15       Yeah, exactly. [inaudible] funny. It's usually accidental. Uh, you

Speaker 4:          00:56:22       want a mosque on?

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       I can't, I can't think of any one of those things though where it's like, and, and I think it's what brings comedians together. It's so funny cause like whenever you go, I don't, which I don't often, but at the times I do go to like a Hollywood type party. All the comedians are often like lumped together in one little section because they often all know each other and and their, and their, and often they're the type, they're similar types of people for whatever bizarre reason, known some things and little kids and they want to be a comedian buttoned down and this is maybe overgeneralizing but they comedians know that life is ridiculous and I think that's like a common bond that holds them all together. Well, they're never going to figure this out. This is all absurd and let's kind of analyze how redundant a party. They're all the people who want to stand on the corner and make fun of the Party and so they all, so they all go down and then sometimes the whole Party is that. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:57:17       Brian Callan is a bit on the podcast and buddy's a stand up comic. He gave me my first tour of the comedy store. He's in the 40 year old virgin movie doc off, right.

Speaker 6:          00:57:28       Oh, which one

Speaker 4:          00:57:33       that Vicky is, I could be wrong, but he gave me my first tour at the comedy store and the bunch of the comics, she's ended up standing outside basically making fun of the Party and shooting the shit. But that's where the real comedy is, is right outside the comedy club. When you just think of it could be more broadly outside of comedy, like Evan, I'll ask you first, when you think of the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind for you?

Speaker 7:          00:57:59       Uh, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:58:03       honestly my cousin David was that, I got it.

Speaker 3:          00:58:07       I got two cousins, David and Charlie who live in Orange County and they just have a really nice note life in three or two great kids. And every time I go to their house, I think this is the most successful group of people I know just because they're, they're really happy and they all really like each other. And it's rare to have a family that everyone likes everyone and they're all proud of each other. So corny answer, but my cousins date more people aren't like that or don't have that. Um, I think they just made up their minds and I think other people deliberate too much. Like they were just like, he was like, I'm a doctor. She was like, I'm going to be a teacher. We want to kids, we're going to live there and we're going to make the best of our lives and uh, go to the beach whenever we can. They just, like, I, they seem to have cut through a lot of the bullshit and made their lives very simple in a beautiful way. And, and it's all about their kids and I dunno, I just feel like they are the most levelheaded people I know who have stuff like really figured out. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:59:00       What yourself, when you got to say something emotional, you're going to be Michael Jordan.

Speaker 6:          00:59:05       [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          00:59:11       Uh Huh. Uh, I don't know. My parents I feel like seemed pretty happy and uh, um, yeah, I definitely don't ascribe like a financial meeting Jewish, um, off the top of my head. Uh, yeah, my parents were on a cruise in Alaska right now eating. They just sent me a picture of a meal that entirely comprised of Tater tots and beer. So

Speaker 3:          00:59:36       I'd say they're doing pretty well right now. His Dad has somehow made vegetarianism, unhealthy, unhealthy vegetarian on the entire planet. But, uh, yeah, my parents were very, very happy.

Speaker 4:          00:59:48       Be Honest, Lee and um, and, and have always, uh, I've always seen, they're very like, they're pretty like Zen, I got to say, which to me is like a, a good, a good place to be. And what I strive to be is, is just a peace, a peace with myself. Do you

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       Ooh, uh, Seth give books as gifts ever? If so, I mean, do you have a most gifted book that you've given to people?

Speaker 4:          01:00:13       Um, I don't give books as gifts. I give, I give some times like, uh, like coffee table type books as gifts. Um, but like if someone's in a move, like a, I like coffee table books, I'm not, I read a, and I give comic books sometimes to people. I don't often give books to people as gifts because I'm not myself, like a huge retreat. I'm not like, have I given the people I've given preacher to people, I've given watchman to people. I've used it. I've given hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy to people. Cause I love that book. And if they tell me they haven't read it, I give that to them. I've given this book the art of dramatic writing to people cause it's

Speaker 3:          01:00:51       house. That's, that's something that John told us to read book Judd gave us art of dramatic. Yeah. If you're, if you're a writer, 60% of it's useless and 40% of it is references, a lot of plays that if you haven't read and you haven't because know who has it, it just does it. A lot of it is very referential in certain places. The best part of is explains the importance of premise and how you must have a rock solid one sentence, premise or thesis

Speaker 4:          01:01:18       for the movie itself. Um, I remember when Joe gave it to us, he said it was woody Allen's favorite writing book, which was meaningful at the time. And so, uh, I've given that book to people. Um, the, the, that, uh, conquest of happiness I've given to people.

Speaker 3:          01:01:33       Oh, that's a good book. That's by Bertrand Russell Virtue. It's like the original cell, like the racial epitaphs. Yeah. That's the time at the time were more acceptable than it

Speaker 4:          01:01:43       all. Right. He was written in like 1920 or something like that, I think. Great. But um, it's a, it's a great, it's like one of the gee self help books basically. Right. Um, I think like the gist of the book is like some say life is pleasurable, some say it isn't. So I think,

Speaker 3:          01:02:01       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:02:01       Um, and so, uh, I've given those books to people. Yeah. But not a, I don't give a ton of books to people.

Speaker 3:          01:02:08       I know we only have a little bit of time left, but Evan, what, what about yourself? Do you have him most uh, every uh, uh, new found? Every person who becomes mother, who's a friend of mine, I send this Canadian child's book love you forever too, which I think is just, bless you forever. The number two or wherever it's a, it's got a thing to love you forever. Love you for always. As long as you're living my baby, you'll be, it's, it's like a thing my mother and son and I think that's a beautiful book that I give to anyone. It's, but it's beautiful.

Speaker 6:          01:02:37       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:02:40       Unbelievably depressing. No one's been upset. I gave it to them. Really? That not to you? A little bit. A little prince is phenomenal hitchhiker's guide and then I often give a preacher v for vendetta and the watchman to people. But my main thing is love you forever. I think that like anyone who has a kid should have that book. No, we, we were talking about this briefly yesterday, but could you describe the habit that you picked up from Snoop Dogg? Um, over the context. We were smoking pot with snoop. What happened? Did you pick up and, and we were, this is when we were recording that song and we were hanging out with him and we were smoking. You opposed come in when you, right now,

Speaker 6:          01:03:19       yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:03:22       I can only write with hose around and I don't know how we got to this, but he was like, you look to go for walks. I was like, not really, I don't really. He's like, what do you mean? I was like, oh, I'll go for like exercise or whatever, but I don't just go for walks. And he looked at me really disappointed and was like, you should, you should go for walks, man. That's a bad move. You're making a bad mistake. And it haunted me that like snoop Dogg was disappointed I can take walks. So I started taking a walk in the morning and a walk after dinner. Eddie has massively changed my life. I sleep better. I have a better day because, and I just walked for like 10 minutes, but he just kind of went on like a little mini rant, Sang Lik walking's great man.

Speaker 3:          01:04:03       It's, it's important. I walk with my kids, walk people like having dogs. Yeah. Yeah. Steve Jobs was a famous walker. I'm not joking. He was known for like doing meetings on walks. Like instead of like sitting in a office doing a meeting, he would, they would walk around and now started to, I become obsessed with, like I, I will stretch during meetings and I don't care who it's with. I will as, as with you, I will stand for full meetings because I don't like sitting and a, we're trying to get a new office and when we do, I'm putting a treadmill in there, a bunch of other stuff. Cause when we're writing I'm often just like walking around the room. Like I it in a pencil in my hand, try a treadmill desk on. My friend has it. It takes a little while to get used to, but I don't think I could do that. I've heard it. I've heard it's good. I saw someone running on a treadmill reading a book at the gym this morning. It sounds like no one's written a hilarious joke on a treadmill. That's never happened to me. I have, I have an elevating desk that goes up and down, but I will try the treadmill. What? Uh, yeah, the key is not running.

Speaker 6:          01:05:02       Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And having a safety safety

Speaker 3:          01:05:06       clip on it. Uh, if, uh, if you could have given your seats, this is a 25 year old self, some advice, what would you have? What would you have said? I would have told myself to lose weight,

Speaker 6:          01:05:19       no earlier

Speaker 3:          01:05:22       slots, like 25 pounds. And I feel so much better and my brain is so much sharper. And I was just, I wasn't like massively overweight, but I was overweight for those from 25 to 31 and that was a very, very big mistake. That was very fixable and I wished that I could go back in time and be like, just start walking. You start walking them nice walk. So we'll fix this all. And, and uh, and I found out I was allergic to wheat so I wish I could go back in time and tell myself,

Speaker 6:          01:05:49       cause I found that out three years

Speaker 3:          01:05:51       we go. And if I found that out six years ago, I would have had a lot better of a decade about yourself. So I don't know. I was, I was probably a lot healthier when I was, I was really doing better by all beads when I was 25 that I have right now. Um, I probably would have told myself to propose to my wife sooner. Oh yeah, me too. That would have saved me. And why is that? Just cause I waited. I waited like seven, six, six, nine. I don't know. Probably not. But uh, it was probably like a, what do they call that? Enabling? I think we probably enabled each other, but I don't know, I mean I don't have any like major regrets that have occurred between now and then or any like, I think there's lessons I've learned, but they've been valuable and organic to my living process. Uh, but the proposal I should've proposed sooner that, that I would have done differently. Uh, this could be a set, maybe a similar type of question, but for you haven't, if you could have one billboard anywhere that said anything, what would it, what would be on it? Ooh. Um, uh, I've had a lot of billboards,

Speaker 6:          01:06:58       so [inaudible] you have a child. Exactly. Whatever knocked out when I, before coming out, November 24,

Speaker 3:          01:07:09       I guess my biggest beef with the world that I would throw up on a billboard is, uh, this, this is going to get deep guys. No, except each other. Oh, Evan Uhmm. I don't accept that. I don't like when people don't accept one another. I think they should and I would put it on top of the empire state building. Really? People wouldn't see it very well.

Speaker 6:          01:07:27       Well, okay, fine.

Speaker 3:          01:07:31       She way to the Empire State building, uh, accepting each other's good. I like that. Except each other or just

Speaker 6:          01:07:38       meet with a picture of me except

Speaker 3:          01:07:42       Seth Rogen. Well, I uh, I know we're, we're wrapping up here. You guys have a lot to do. A little 11 more minutes tomorrow. In that case, I would like to, when we leave we have to go back to our jobs. Postpone that a little bit to ask a couple of fan questions. This one is from Kyle Bailey. Uh, he wants to know about the future of comedy and this is what he says. [inaudible] string theory. What is funny on one side of the universe creates a funny reaction on the other side. No one knows why.

Speaker 2:          01:08:18       He says, it seems to me that late seventies and then 80 satire Saturday night live Seinfeld has led to all things funny. That has led to all things funny being absurd. Hence old spice commercials. Having mandatory so on seems like the more absurd, the funnier at least in the mainstream when will the snap back or when will we experienced in the next direction of comedy or is absurdity of the final act of comedy and then somebody added to that specifically on not online where you're trying to grab attention, distract.

Speaker 4:          01:08:45       I heard actually with marketing specifically recently someone told me that uh, that now commercials like actually do better if they make no sense like that. Literally just like mountain dew commercial. Have you guys seen that mountain? Like the horse and the one where it's like this horse a tell you like there's literally like I, someone was explaining to me the theory where it's like the fact that they make no sense actually makes you pay more attention to them then a than a traditional commercial narrative. I actually don't necessarily agree with that. Yeah, I got a degree. It's not absurd. Transparent. It's not absurd. Train wreck is one of the biggest comedies of the year and it's like completely, you know, a us, you know, a very grounded movie. Like we love ourselves and absurd comedy. But Ethan, both neighbors is our most successful movie. And then a lot of ways it goes, it's quite broad at times, but in premise it's, it's about people who have a bunch of kids move in next door to them. Like it's not that bizarre, you know? So I actually think, I think the biggest comedies are, and are not absurd there. There's somewhat grounded in reality and, and the less th the somewhat popular but maybe less popular comedy, he's like, this is the end was, did very well. But isn't it the same universe as like neighbors or train wreck is doing much better than that? Like I think those truly absurd ones I actually don't do as well as the more grounded one.

Speaker 2:          01:10:07       Well, it's like, you know, I'm a mental, I mean I, not absurd, but it's so it's confusing to so many people. I mean, I love Memento, but uh, but it's been set a kind of disheartening to, to find that a lot of my favorite movies did very, very, very good.

Speaker 4:          01:10:18       Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh wait. We always say this will never be number one. And if we are, we won't be that cool anymore. Yeah, it's true. Like we always will have the sense of really where it's like things everyone loves, I hate and things everyone ate. I love. And I'm just, I, and I don't mean that in like a, I'm not trying to be like a hipster. And I do, I also love a lot of mainstream stuff. And like I'm the first guy in line to see a Michael Bay movie. But fast, fast and furious is the greatest time you could have it in a bag. But that being said, like there's some shows that are really popular. I'm just like, I don't understand why people like this and there's some shows that no one likes. And I'm like, I don't call why people don't love this, you know? And, and as long as you have that sensibility, I think there's a good chance you will not be the most successful person.

Speaker 2:          01:11:04       I mean, it's along those lines. It's of freaks and Geeks. Looking back at that, I mean, what, and this is a question from nick, nick, a breakthrough. Uh, what was it about freaks and Geeks at the made so successful

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       in their later careers? Is that a, would you attribute to advice they received or more of a networking effect or otherwise? I'm paraphrasing but

Speaker 4:          01:11:23       I think honestly, I mean my hope is that that judge just, and Paul found people who happened to me very talented and, and I had the talent to sustain themselves and then they cast very well. Yeah, I think they cast very well. And I like having cast movies with Judd. Like he's just got the iron man. He's very good at seeing is it just an instinctual thing or is there, is there some that you get better at it, it's literally just, there's not that many really funny people. And like when you see someone who's actually very funny like, and if you're, it's again when we, you know, you talk about it with investments, it's the exact, like you start to hone in on just like things that for whatever reason you start to think like this is good. Like, and I think you, you can train yourself to become more and more in tune with it. And I think that's one of the things Judd taught us is like keep your eyes out for that person. If you're watching a movie and someone is in one scene and it has one line and is funny, that person could star in a home movie one day maybe. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:12:26       In the first neighbors there's this standup drug Carmichael who's in it and he now has his own show and we're trying to write a movie a with our guys Kaolin reo for him to start it. And it all just came from our uh, coworker Alex saying, I saw this guy and he's, he's got it.

Speaker 4:          01:12:40       Yeah, look, look yourself like a cat. And I think that, I think more than anything, that's what it is, is that they, he has a very good, you know, Paul and Jack both have very good eyes for spotting people that we'll, that we'll keep working on. Another thing is,

Speaker 3:          01:12:56       um, they look long and hard. Like when we were looking for who is going to be the MC Loven Fogel character and super bad, it literally came down to putting up signs in high schools. Allison Jones, the casting director, did an epic search, literally just putting up signs. Does anyone know anyone who fits this bill? And his buddies were like, you should go do this. And we saw like, I don't know, a hundred kids and that's just what we saw. A, you know, a filtered from the casting director onto us. And, and, and, and it's like a Hollywood cliche almost, but when you see that person, you go get him. That's the one. Yeah. So just on Vic loving, because this, this came up surprisingly often. Uh, Justin, uh, nine of Basti I think. And then den Gmo designs, I'm not sure I ask them if they, if they would ever be willing to make a spin off movie about Nick Levin.

Speaker 3:          01:13:45       We are not. But we have discussed, which we'll never do. What am I about to say? But we always thought it would be funny to kind of do something where you take Saul from pineapple, express the James Franco character and Mcclellan from Superbad and put them in a movie together, but it's never happened. So why would you never do it in the same way that Donald Trump thinks, if he changes his hair, he'll ruin his career to us. Like super bad worked. It was everything we ever hoped it would be and more. And I'm not touching it. I'm not. It's like if you throw two bulls

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       eyes and you're like, no, no, don't was actually the best the way I made a sequel to super bad and it was bad. It would crush me. Exactly. Yeah. I don't want to mess with, I couldn't deal with that. Does a, it's of course we'd comes up a lot. Uh, eat. What's that? The marriage you want to do you find it helps creativity, productivity. Neither. Both. I mean, because there are questions about like how do you be youth for you two guys? One, what impact does it have that it makes you a little dumber while you're on it. But for us, uh, you know, no matter what job you have, no matter how amazing it is, it's work and work in some ways sucks. And what we've tried to do at our office, like we have a big buck hunter in our office and just taking five minutes and playing around a big buck hunter.

Speaker 4:          01:14:59       It like lets you chill out, going for a little walk to get a cup of coffee. Well it's been, and for us and for some people it's a very, very bad idea. I would say like most people, it makes them look so much worse that they shouldn't. But some people it relaxes. I think what's important, I think why it's helpful to us is because it's what we do socially and and so it makes work not feel like work. And I was, I was actually just like yesterday reading this thing that Isaac, like it was an old article, but Isaac Asimov wrote about the creative process that was just republished. And one of the things he talks a lot about is, is in his process, how it's very important to create like a casual environment. And it, he says like you shouldn't work in an office. You should work in someone's living room or at a restaurant and you should.

Speaker 4:          01:15:45       And you need people who are jovial, who so you can create a fun environment because a lot of writing is failure. And if you're self conscious that you're going to be rejected, then you won't say your best ideas. And, and I think again, if it's, I think our thing happens to be smoking weed with some people. It's, it's, it's other things. But I think because it makes how we're working feel like a not working environment. It makes our brains function in a slightly more free way. And it makes us pitch ideas that maybe we would feel we're too stupid to pitch if we were in a more rigid environment and it would make ideas like this is the end not exist, not because were stoned but because we are working in an environment that feels very safe and that feels very social and casual and that, um, and, and that lets us pitch out the ideas that might seem like the craziest ideas you could ever pitch out.

Speaker 4:          01:16:40       But because we don't feel like we're in a work environment where everyone's judging us and that we're wasting time or not, you know, hitting the numbers are quotas that we have to be hitting it. It allows us, I think to be more free creative. Yeah. Like in our office right now, Seth has a bunch of paintings that he's bought over the years from home and he put them around and it feels like home. That's what I like. And I had like my yoga blocks and my yoga straps and doing the stretches to me is, is akin to the smoking pot, which is like the best, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       Caucasian squat

Speaker 3:          01:17:11       does. I've ever seen it

Speaker 5:          01:17:14       state. He doesn't have the sitting position. Usually it goes from straight standing to perfect as in Japan that we call it [inaudible] is the shit squad.

Speaker 3:          01:17:22       Yeah. Well it's what they call and tell him what you bought me like a platform that goes around his toilet so he can squat shit. There's one thing people listening to this should take from this podcast. It's, you should be squatting when you shit, it's natural. It's better for you. It's bad for your back, it's bad for your bowels and sit on a toilet, pop a squat.

Speaker 5:          01:17:43       What do you guys use, and I feel like since you guys grew up in uh, in BC that it's a for that is to pot as like growing up in France would be to wine. Is there a particular type of politics? I've had friends be like, no man, you get anxious because of this. You're using the wrong thing.

Speaker 3:          01:18:01       Those friends or possibly correct. Um, I had somebody who was telling me the pots too strong. I don't like it. It makes me anxious. So I went to one of the stories in California and said, can you give me some pot from 1995? And they did and I gave it to the person and they were like, there you go. It goes by as strong as the weakest link. What is the absolute worst weed you could buy now is what the best read was when we were in high school. Probably you can, we have a problem where people will smoke pot with us and we'll be like, take it easy. We don't smoke week stuff. We continued smoking. Good read. But to get name specific, uh, uh, Jack Hair. Yeah, he is a good working one. There's also good ones for work and ones that very simple. There's sativas and indicas and sativas are genuinely kind of uppers and indicas are genuinely kind of downers. And when you're working a sativas generally better because it's not bogging you down. Jack has e h e r r. E. R. H. E. R. R. I think there's one are in the middle. But yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:19:06       Is there a, do you guys have any, uh, just in closing ask or recommendation of the people listening?

Speaker 3:          01:19:14       Um, I would say the, the reason that this podcast is happening right now is because, uh, with that guy don hurts felt, I mentioned there was one day where I'm sitting there, I was like, God, what I would do to talk to him. And then I just picked up the phone and called my agent and was like, can you get me don hurts fillets number. And I talked to him and it blew my mind. And then I had the same thing with a, this guy, Sam Harris, who I look up to very much and I look up and I just called him. And so I reached out to you in the same way and you write about this in your book as well. And I just think if you idolize someone or you look up to someone or you respect someone's work, try to get in touch with them, it's, there's no harm. And so far, I'm three for three and I have an advantageous position. Yeah. With an agent and all of that incredibly successful producer, writer, director there. There's like a, there's some guy a named Jordan who I ran into on the street who I email with and he now works at funny or, and I keep them in mind and I don't know this guy from anything. He just came up to me one day on the street and it's worth a shot. You never know. Well, this Jordan Guy could kill me one. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:20:18       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:20:24       but uh, no, it's so true. I mean some fans of mine, if you reached out to Warren Buffet and getting handwritten letters back from them, you just never know. Yeah. Well it's the same thing. Like sometimes like Seth and I always talk about this, we'll find ourselves doing like an interview or something and we look at each other. We're like, why are we, when did we agree to this? Why would we do this? Sometimes people just drop their guards and agree to shit.

Speaker 6:          01:20:43       They should. Exactly. That's like a wink wink at me at the moment. I've been at whole movies. I don't understand why

Speaker 3:          01:20:52       you called the person on the one day where there will is exhausted from whatever else

Speaker 4:          01:20:57       and they're just like, yeah man, I'll meet with you as long as I can get off this phone call right now. Yeah. That's what I think too is just just do it. I mean like Nike, you meet so many people, Nike, I mean Nike has the best tagline of all time, but it's like we show when people talk about writing movies and we did write a movie and like, you know, my wife wanted to make a movie and so she raised $1 billion and made a movie. Like it's not something that is completely unachievable. It's something that if you are somewhat talented and have a lot of determination and are willing to put yourself out there and are willing to fail, then you can probably do something more than nothing.

Speaker 3:          01:21:40       Neon Superbad was a success, but like make no mistake for 10 years, it was a failure and the first five drafts, like if you read them, you'd be like, this is the worst thing I've ever read in my life.

Speaker 4:          01:21:50       Let's over and over and over again. Like, I don't think anyone's gonna make this movie. I don't think it was gonna be, it was really, and like, it literally didn't even occur to us to listen to them. Like it wasn't even a conversation of like, should we stop? Like, I literally, we didn't even have that conversation and was like, fuck those people. Let's go to the next one. You know, Blake like to picture like Stephen King writing his first

Speaker 3:          01:22:09       looking at me like, man, I'm stumped. I'm going to go, I'm going to go be something else. Can you just keep going blind belief in yourself? Like it was turned down 26 or 27 times also, I mean viciously like violently. I have these like angry sort of infuriated, insulted letters from acquiring it or just turn it down. All right guys. Well let's, uh, I really appreciate all the time. Let's wrap up and we can do that with telling people where they can find more about you guys, find you on the social webs and so on.

Speaker 4:          01:22:45       interview, we're not as active on, we used to be pretty active. Uh, I'm muck about on Twitter, a litter a little in your Evan Goldberg. I'm, I'm Evan Goldberg,

Speaker 3:          01:22:55       editor of Andy Goldberg or Evan. I think it's just having to go over just having goals for while. I will, I will put it in the show notes for everybody. Also, I'm Rogan on

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       Twitter and that's Rogan with an ear or with an e.
