Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Ladies and gents. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode, God damn optimal.

Speaker 2:          00:09          At this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. You posting a question. I'm a cybernetic organism, living tissue infoscope.

Speaker 1:          00:32          That's the usual intro music, but I'd like you to hear a brand new version reimagined by none other than Justin Barreda of the glitch mob. Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it's time to pause and reflect.

Speaker 1:          01:19          This podcast is brought to you by Mizzen and main. Don't worry about the spelling. All you need to know is this. I have organized my entire life around avoiding fancy shirts because you have to iron them. You sweat through them, they smell really easily. They're a pain in the ass. Mizzen and main has given me the only shirt that I need. And what I mean by that and Kelly Starr at loves the shirts as well, is that you can trick people. They look really fancy so you can take them out to nice dinners, whatever, but they're made from athletics, sweat wicking material. So you can throw this thing into your luggage in a heap or on your kitchen table like I did recently, and then pull it out, throw it on with no ironing, no steaming, no nothing. Walk out, and you could probably wear this thing for a week straight or make it your only dress shirt and take it on trips for weeks at a time.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Never wash it. It will not smell. You will not sweat through it. You got to check these things out. So go to a four hour work, week.com all spelled out, four hour work, week.com forward slash shirts and if you order one of their dress shirts in the next week, you will get a Henley shirt for free.

Speaker 1:          03:29          This is Tim Ferriss. And welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where I deconstruct world class performers to find the tools, tricks, routines, habits that you can use. And of course those experts range from billionaire investors to chess prodigies to Arnold Schwarzenegger, to everyone in between. And you do find commonalities. And in this particular episode we delve into a world that I know very little about and that is the world of music. We have Justin Beretta who is a founding member of the glitch mob. And if you haven't heard that name or you don't recognize that name, you will definitely recognize some of their music and it could range from their trailers and where the trailers in which their features. So you could list sincerely to edge of tomorrow, Captain America, Spiderman to their commercial work. So commercials for Fiat, Audi and so on. They also debuted their last album, love, death and mortality incredibly well on billboard number one, electronic album, number one, indie labels, number four, overall digital albums.

Speaker 1:          04:32          And this is fascinating because from an entrepreneurial standpoint, not only are they indeed are not associated with a big label, they're artists owned and we delve into all of this. How did they go from unknown to on top of the world plankton, 90,000 people in Quebec with dead mass for instance. We dig into the war stories, the creative stories, the process, how that has been refined over time and you get to hear some never heard before, early drafts of some of their biggest hits and Justin walks through exactly how those were refined over time to become what millions of people now love and listened to all the time. It's a fascinating discussion with an artist. Even if you feel like you have no interest in music process, you will find things ranging from his schedule to his meditative practice that you can use. It's a really fun interview. I hope you enjoy it. Without further ado, here is Justin Burrito. Justin, welcome to the show. Hey, how's it going Tim? It's going well. I appreciate you making the time. And as a long time fan, I appreciate you making the music first and foremost.

Speaker 3:          05:42          Oh yeah. It's my pleasure to be here. I'm a, I'm a huge fan of, of all the, the four hour empire as well. So it's, it's an honor to, to get to talk to you.

Speaker 1:          05:50          And I know we, I guess initially connected via Twitter. I think it was, is how we, we came in contact. Is that how the the pieces came together? Yeah, I think so. I think you, you had posted something on sound tracking, which is a app that we both used and I started following on there and then, yeah, we just kind of just started chatting from there. That had to be a year or two ago. Yeah, yeah, it probably was. And then I've continued as a consumer of music and now we finally have a chance to dig into the music. So the first question I really wanted to ask you, uh, is.
