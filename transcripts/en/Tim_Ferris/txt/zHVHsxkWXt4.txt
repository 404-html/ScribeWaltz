Speaker 2:          00:00:23       brought to you by Mizzen and main? Don't worry about the spelling. All you need to know is this. I have organized my entire life around avoiding fancy shirts because you have to iron them. You sweat through them, they smell really easily. They're a pain in the ass. Mizzen and main has given me the only shirt that I need. And what I mean by that and Kelly Starr at loves the shirts as well, is that you can trick people. They look really fancy so you can take them out to nice dinners, whatever, but they're made from athletics, sweat wicking material. So you can throw this thing into your luggage in a heap or on your kitchen table like I did recently, and then pull it out, throw it on with no ironing, no steaming, no nothing. Walk out and you could probably wear this thing for a week straight or make it your only dress shirt and take it on trips for weeks at a time. Never wash it. It will not smell. You will not sweat through it.

And guests vary from hedge fund traders to that does make any sense at all. Hedge fund managers to top performing angel investors to people like Arnold Schwarzenegger on the Celebrity Front chess prodigies. And in this case we have not only a chef, but a a chef plus policymaker plus would be professional athlete. His name is Sam Kass. Sam is a fascinating guy. He went from getting a history major at u Chicago. Before that he was on the professional baseball track, then became private chef for the Obamas and then ended up the senior policy advisor for nutrition at the White House.

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       Uh, he ran or help to run as executive director the let's move campaign which used private sector partnerships to pursue the goal of reducing childhood obesity to just 5% by 2030 and for that he was named number 11 on Fast Company magazine's 2011 list of the 100 most creative people. And it's such a multifaceted story. Sam is a, a hilarious storyteller and there are a lot of really concrete takeaways. The book that he could not recall offhand in this episode is a history of world agriculture by Marcel [inaudible] and Lawrence Roux, Dar or Rwe Dart, r. O. U. D. A. R. T. So in addition to the art of fielding auto lendees books and some of the others that he mentioned, there you have it, a history of world agriculture. So now without further ado, please enjoy my conversation and our conversation with Sam Kass.

Speaker 3:          00:04:45       Sam, welcome to the show. So good to be here, man. I'm, I'm excited. Yeah, it's uh, it's, it's an interview that I've been really looking forward to and I am very, very hopped up on caffeine. This is that, this is a, an Amish morning for me. I know this is, I'm usually a 10:00 AM 11:00 AM kind of guy because I'm a night owl and a lot, so I'm going to jump into some morning questions in a second. But I wanted to first congratulate you on the James Beard Foundation, the leadership awards. Uh, thank you. Uh, yeah, that means a lot. It's a James Beard has been an incredible, uh, organization. I mean they are like the, the, the, like that, you know, the Oscars for chefs and, but they've taken up a lot of the important issues around food and nutrition and health and sustainability. So you have a, an award for that and yeah, it's a great honor. I'm excited. Yeah. It, uh, so for those who don't know the leadership awards, and this is a, from their website quote, recognize specific outstanding initiatives as well as bodies of work and lifetime achievement. So that's, that's a hell of a tag line and we're going to get into all that. But first a very important question. Uh, eggs. How do you prefer to make eggs in the morning? So actually, I've eating a lot of eggs,

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       uh, these days. And you know, the eggs are one of the hardest things to cook. Some of the great chefs in the world, their actual, their tests for new cook, we'd be, how to make an omelette would be like their one master test. So I actually liked eggs all ways. Almost always soft though. So either a soft boiled egg, I'll do eggs over easy or really soft scrambled eggs. Um, and I guess the, the, the trick for soft scrambled eggs is I, uh, you know, have to get your butter nice. Not, I cracked the egg straight into the pan, let them cook for a second and then mix them up. And then before you think they're done, take them out because they'll harden a little bit as they sit on the plate. Um, but, uh, I'll, I'll eat eggs pretty much any, any way.

Speaker 5:          00:06:40       And do you, are you a tea guy, a coffee guy? None of the above?

Speaker 4:          00:06:44       Uh, uh, both, all of the above. I do a, I'll do coffee in the morning, but we'll half and half and then, uh, either a little coffee in the day or a tea and then I'll, I'll definitely have some tea at night. Um, some camomile tea or mint tea or some, but, uh, yeah, I drink them both.

Speaker 5:          00:07:01       How do you, do you have any particular, like, uh, do you have any particular type of coffee or a way of prepping or is it just, you know, what, just treated as fuel, whatever will get me through the day.

Speaker 4:          00:07:12       Hmm. You know, I, I wouldn't say that I'm like one of those coffee like lunatics who like, you know, as wild, you know, about every specific thing and talks about it like wine, but I appreciate it. Good Cup of coffee and I really, one of my least favorite things. Is it terrible cup of coffee? Uh, yeah, I just, I can't, I can't drink it. So I'm a big stump town guy. You know, blue bottle does a great cup of coffee. Um, there's, there's some really good coffee out there. So I do French press in the morning. Real simple, some half and half. Um, nothing, nothing crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:07:42       What does the, well, actually I'm going to ask the the morning routine question a little bit later on, but you mentioned a coffee snobs, and this is kind of a good segue because you live in Brooklyn, but you came from a town that is actually really well known for coffee these days. Just Chicago. Yeah. And correct me if I'm wrong, I could get some of my bio incorrect. But you grew up with parents who were both teachers, is that correct?

Speaker 4:          00:08:10       Uh, my dad's a teacher. Um, was growing up? Well he was actually a, he worked in the Ford factory when I was very young. And then he, then he changed jobs to become a teacher. And my mom has been an education like science education stuff, the more from like museums and now she's at the National Science Foundation. So, but lots of teachers, my and uncle are teachers. My cousins are teachers and my sister's a teacher. So I am, we come from, I come from an educational family.

Speaker 5:          00:08:35       What was, uh, what was that like growing up? I mean, how did that impact you or affects you?

Speaker 4:          00:08:41       Um, I, it probably was more of the, how I pushed back against it then, how it is that that was probably the strongest influence. I wanted to be a professional baseball player from the time I was like three all the way through college to be honest. And, uh, I went to junior college trying to make it to the major league. So I, I, you know, as my parents pleaded with me to dig into the books and hit them harder, all I wanted to do was take batting practice. And, and, and she, you know, go after some fly balls. So I, it came back to me when I, when I transferred in college and then beyond.

Speaker 5:          00:09:16       Did the, do you have brothers and sisters? I have a younger sister who's still in Chicago. Got It. And you ultimately in college ended up at U Chicago. Uh, and what, what drew you to baseball? Why did you, why did you play baseball?

Speaker 4:          00:09:32       Um, so I love, I love baseball for a number of reasons. One, it is so hard. I mean if you, if you are successful 30% of the time for your whole career, you'll be a hall of famer. That means if you fail seven out of 10 times, you're one of the greatest players in the history of the game. And so that constant challenge and constant challenge to get better. Something that, you know, always really drew me. It's also, you know, it's a team sport, so you have the camaraderie that is, you know, really powerful and those bonds with, with, with your teammates. But it's, it's also an utterly individuals sports. So unlike, you know, soccer or basketball where if have it a bad game, you kind of blend in. If you make an error and baseball are, you strike out with the bases loaded, everybody knows like you messed up.

Speaker 4:          00:10:15       And so you really have to take account, you know, responsibility and you're held accountable for your actions. And I think that those kinds of lessons of discipline, hard work, but also accountability and learning how to fail. And even if you failed five times in a row, that sixth time you get a shot at it, maybe the most important time can win the game. And how do you mentally prepare yourself to walk into that moment? Clearheaded and, and not carrying the baggage from the previous failures, which could impede your ability to be successful when it mattered. Like those are the kinds of things that I just loved about baseball and, and it really served me well and, and all other aspects of life.

Speaker 5:          00:10:52       And you had a, you had a very good batting average. I believe it's, uh, it, I've read that it was ranked among the best in program history at a University of Chicago. Is that accurate?

Speaker 4:          00:11:04       Um, yeah. I haven't checked recently. I'm sure some of the younger guys that have taken over. I, when I left, I think I was number three, but you know, it was, it wasn't the, you know, we were of c for the education, not, not, not uh, the baseball, but we had a very good team. Um, and I played two years of junior college baseball, just trying to get drafted where basically all I did was play ball a six, six hours a day, seven days a week literally, and sprint training in the morning. Like, you know, it was, that's all we did. So u of C was a little different. It was a two hours a day, five days a week. And I'll never forget the first practice when coach outlined our schedule and said that on Thursdays we didn't practice cause we had science labs. I just almost like passed out. I didn't even know what was talking, talking about science labs, not baseball. So it was a, it was an adjustment for me. Um, but, uh, but it was one of the greatest thing and probably the best decision I've ever made was to go there.

Speaker 5:          00:11:57       Well, like you said, I mean if you go to say Iowa for wrestling, I mean wrestling is your career in college, uh, academics are secondary, but it u Chicago you have obviously very strenuous academic program. What did you do that other players didn't do that allowed you to not only make it through u Chicago and the academics, but to have that high, a batting average for that good batting average?

Speaker 4:          00:12:22       Um, that's a good question. I'm not exactly sure I know a definitive answer that, I mean, I had come from such a rigorous baseball background and where a lot of the other guys were, you know, came from, you know, we're sort of playing baseball secondarily that, um, you know, that part came really easy to me. Uh, and, um, you know, I think the part that was a real adjustment that I could learn from them was like how to really hit the books in a way that I had never had to hit the books before. And how do you organize all that class work and you know, the expectation that you're supposed to read like five books a week? I mean, I mean, that was like absurd to me, uh, going in. So, you know, I learned from them about how to balance that side of it and from my side, um, you know, I think the discipline and how you efficiently use your time both in the, you know, in the gym, in batting practice, like how do you make the most of what you're, you know, what you're trying to get out of it.

Speaker 4:          00:13:17       Um, I think was something that I could bring to the guys and, and was able to be successful on both sides.

Speaker 5:          00:13:24       And the, the, the major you ended up choosing was history. Did, was that a, was that an immediate choice? Did you know you wanted to do history? How did you arrive at that?

Speaker 4:          00:13:34       Um, you know, I looked, I looked at a couple other majors, um, uh, but I ran the history because, you know, at the time there's a lot of things swirling in politics. There's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of work there. There's like, you know, the first Gulf War and there's a lot of things going on that, that I was paying attention to that I didn't really understand what was happening. Uh, and um, and I, and I realized that if I wanted to understand the world around me in politics and everything that was happening, having a, uh, a much better grasp on, on, on history and where these things have come from was going to help me. And I think that that really propelled me to, to focus in on history, which, which I love. I'm a, I'm a history geek.

Speaker 5:          00:14:14       Do you have any favorite history books or biographies?

Speaker 4:          00:14:18       Oh man, that's so tough. That's so tough. I Dunno if I have one. I'll tell you like I like some obscure ones and I got to get you the author. But there's like, there's a history of agriculture book that completely changed my perspective and it's kind of boring. But when you look at, you know, if you're a geek and you look at like the impact of simple tools have had on our society, the transformational shifts, like we forget how fundamental that stuff is. So I'll get back to you on that. There's so many great biographies and great history books.

Speaker 5:          00:14:46       Cool. Yeah, the, the, uh, I'll put the, the title of the book and so on in the show notes.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       So we'll come back to that. Uh, how did you then, this is kind of the missing piece in that the Sam Kass puzzle that I haven't, uh, immediately been able to figure out. How did you go then from majoring in history at U Chicago to food? How did you become interested in food?

Speaker 4:          00:15:13       So I had always, um, sort of love food. You know, as a kid I kind of liked to cook, um, but it had no notion of ever, you know, pursuing it professionally at, in any way. Um, and when I was at UFC, my friend, uh, was the sous chef at this restaurant in, in, uh, in Chicago. And I, I didn't know him super well, but I said, all, you know, one day, you know, I think I'll go to culinary school when I'm old and just so I can learn how to cook for like my kids and wife whenever they decided to show up. And he was like, you know, well, don't do that. Just come in and hang out at the restaurant and see what you think. So I went in, it was like an Italian American, uh, spot in Chicago, nothing, you know, nice place, nothing too fancy.

Speaker 4:          00:15:51       And um, and I loved it. And so I ended up just showing up and like, you know, and potatoes and hanging out and trying to learn some things. And the chef said, well, if you're going to keep showing up, I guess I got to pay you. So I'd, so he did. But I mean, it was pretty much an unmitigated disaster. Like, I knew nothing and they, you know, but I always work hard. So they, they threw me on the line to work the Pasta Station and Oh my God, it was, you know, the dishes that the chef let me send it. The table most often came back cause they were just on that overall, uh, so it, you know, so I guess it was a rough start. Um, but so I had that one summer and then I finished u of C and I had one one semester left and I kind of kicked my way into an abroad program.

Speaker 4:          00:16:35       I got, I got wait listed and then sort of, um, pleat and made a, a strong plea with the Dean to let me, uh, let me into one of the programs. I didn't care where, where we went, where I went and went to, ended up going to Vienna and I, I said to the head of the program, you know, I'm, I worked a little, I worked this one summer in a restaurant. I'm interested in food. Like maybe there's a pastry shop or something. I can go hang in, hang out at once a once a week or something. Totally casual. So I landed in Vienna and she said, so my husband's uncle's friend from college son rides bicycles with the sous chef of the best restaurant in Vienna. That's literally what it was. And, uh, and she's like, you know, he, he can meet you tomorrow, um, if you're interested.

Speaker 4:          00:17:23       It's like, all right. So I meet this dude crazy guy. Uh, and he, he comes up to me and says, are you the Yankee who wants to cook on the street? And I said, I am. And I said, all right, well, we'll come, come to the restaurant tomorrow. And so I did. And, um, it was a Michelin Star, like best restaurant in Vienna. It was incredible. I knew nothing about food, and they ended up taking me in and training me. I'm sort of old school European style, like, Kick Your Butt, uh, you know, until you can't take any more and you figure it out. And, uh, lots of stories from that, from that, from that place. But that's sort of how I really was propelled into it.

Speaker 5:          00:18:05       Uh, so, uh, a few things I just want to explain to people, maybe not in the industry. So shoes a sous chef is, I guess that means under chef, right? That's kind of the second in command in the kitchen. Is that a fair way to put it? Just like Suvi is under, under pressure I guess. Uh, and the, so there are a lot of stories. I know we, we talked about one, uh, over dinner the other night and I can't skip it. So could you tell people about your sort of baptism by fire in that kitchen?

Speaker 4:          00:18:34       Um, so many stories. Uh, I think the one, yeah, the, the, the, the, the, the fever dream. A fever dream had. So, uh, so it was December and uh, and that's the busiest time of the year by far for this restaurant. And the, um, the guy who did all the fish, meats and sauces, what had to have surgery. And so the executive chef had to take over for him and now he was like 40, and was a super talented guy, but was like not cooking anymore. Like, he wasn't running things and being out with the guests and you know, doing his thing. So he was really unhappy about having to cook the line during the most busy time of the year. So he, he, like he walked in when, when we got news and it's like, all right, Yankee, you're with me. And so he had this huge incentive to teach me how to prep everything as fast as possible because he didn't want to have to do it.

Speaker 4:          00:19:26       So he taught me how to make all the sauces, prep all the meats, cook everything. And so then we would work the service together. Uh, but in the middle of the month, on a Friday, the chef came down with like 104 fever and was completely laid out. And it just so happened that my best friend who was a road scholar, uh, at the time was coming to visit me from England. And, um, so, you know, we're supposed to go, hang on, I was supposed to have the weekend off and we were just going to hang. And so he shows up and I'm like, hey man, you're coming with me. I'm putting you in a chef coat, like we can't leave. And uh, they had the breakfast cook, this Guy Wolfgang who was at awesome dude, but you know, he was like, he was like doing platters of fruit and it needs a good cook, but he didn't like Cook Dinner Service.

Speaker 4:          00:20:11       He never had. So it was the three of us trying to figure out this dinner service and it was pretty funny. But the, at the end of the night, the sous chef said, alright, Wolfgang, you've got to take the day off. Um, it's the, it's the two Yankees on the stove tomorrow night. And like the kitchen went silent. Like all the cooks were like, whoa. Like they couldn't believe it. And so we figured out the system. My friends, a smart guy, so he, we studied the words in German of the different, like fish and meats and whatever we needed. So the next night we had like a crate and we were packed. And so the, the sous would call it the order. My friend would take out the fish or the meat and then, and I would cook it. And you, and you know, as I'm cooking on the other side of me also cooking and facing me was the guy who did all the vegetables inside dishes that would go with my meat or fish and I'd look up and he would just be standing there kind of with his mouth open, completely in awe of what was going on because you know, that station that we were working was like what people would work their whole career for us and incredibly prestigious, well-paid position.

Speaker 4:          00:21:16       And here are these two Americans who knew nothing about cooking, working in a Michelin Star restaurant on the hardest station in the kitchen. It was hysterical. Uh, and we made it like we, we basically got through without any catastrophe. And I'll never forget when the last ticket went out. The sous chef, his name was Alice, he turns around, he said, Yankees, we won. And then like just in German shouted for bottles of champagne and bottles of beer. And, uh, and we had a good old party that night. It was, it was, uh, it was a ton of fun.

Speaker 5:          00:21:46       And, uh, I remember hearing this story and just having my jaw dropped open because I've had of course very limited exposure to food and restaurants. But during the writing of the flower chef, when we first met men have been in DC. Yeah, I remember going into a handful of restaurants, obviously different restaurants that very different environments, but when you're, when you look at a line, not at a Michelin Star Restaurant, but, uh, just at any restaurant during a busy period and like 40 menus open at the same time, it is complete chaos. I mean, you have to be doctor octopus to work one of the hotlines. So it's like you guys were kind of yanked out of the audience by the conductor of the orchestra and asked to do Violin Solos. Uh, it's, it's, uh, I can't believe you guys made it through that. What's w what was your internal self talk like when you got, when you got the news and like when you got the news or when you walked in for that, that evening. I mean, how did you prep yourself to that? Because unlike baseball, right, like if you're putting out every three out of 10 dishes is working in the restaurant, you get punched in the face. So yeah. What was your self talk to?

Speaker 4:          00:23:02       It's a great, it's a, I mean I think that the key in a restaurant and the key in any kind of high pressure situation like I think 75% of success is, is staying calm and not losing your nerve. And um, you know, the rest you figure out, but once you lose your, once you lose your, your, your calm, everything else starts falling apart fast. And in a restaurant situation, as the tick tickets start piling up and like everybody else's is waiting on you. So, and particularly in this like the time, it would have to be perfect cause you go up on six dishes and the, the, the guy who's doing all the side stuff has like cooked all this and he's got to get to the next round. So your timing has to be right on. And if you're too slow, all of his stuff gets yes.

Speaker 4:          00:23:41       You know, it gets overcooked and he's got to cook it again. Right. So you can really throw off then. So I think the key thing was like mentally preparing myself. Like when something goes wrong you just stay calm and stay the course. And I think the other thing, one of the first thing the sous chefs taught me, like he gave me some really fundamental rules which have lasted me kind of throughout everything I do. One is the first is never serve anything you wouldn't want to eat, like never served crap. It's like rule number one, rule number two, which is just true. Just so you know, you can have a high standard on everything you do. Rule number two was when things get really busy instead of just like, like plowing ahead and just trying to work as fast as you can and just go through all the tickets.

Speaker 4:          00:24:20       He always would tell me step back and come up with a plan. So look at which dishes you have and figure out what's the most efficient way to cook them. So if you have five of one thing, don't just cook them one at a time. Like get them out, prep them together and do them together so that those kind of like fundamental rules, I tried to hold really close and you just come up with a good system. I think every great restaurant has an incredibly strong system that when the, the pressure gets heated, heated up and everything's moving super fast, you rely on that system to move you through. And I think that was key. We came up with a good system and, and out it went. So I, I've no, you're not focusing on too many things at any one time. Focus on cooking the things that my friend was giving me and uh, and it worked really well.

Speaker 5:          00:25:06       It was a, it was so fascinating for me to visit different kitchens and look at the layouts and, and uh, and the, the methods because they were really sort of the internal workings of the executive chef thrown out into this, the architecture of the room and the process and all that. And just being so surprised at, for instance, a Alinea in Chicago. And how quiet it is. There's no yelling, there's no screaming. It's more like an operating table. Uh, what is the most, uh, unusual restaurant that's a, that puts out very good food that you've come across in terms of just how it works?

Speaker 4:          00:25:47       Hmm. Well, the craziest kitchen I have ever seen. So I worked at a Vac, which is one of Chicago, one of America's great restaurants and you know, it was really a wine bar that ended up putting up such good food that it's won James Beard awards and all kinds of other accolades just because the food ended up just kicking butt, but it was not set up that at all. So it was a teeny line if three people, one big wood burning and gas burning like kind of oven and a little stove and what people do out of that. It's just what we were doing out of that with Tsung was incredible. But the kitchen that's like blows me away the most is the kitchen here in Brooklyn actually, uh, at Frankie's four 57. It's so tiny. It's literally like two guys on to a induction burners in a space that's like, I don't know, like five feet by 10 feet and they cook for this huge restaurant at quality. It's like one of my restaurants in America. What was the name again? Frankie's four 57. It's unbelievably good. And it's like you look at these two guys back there with an n d two induction burners and he, I just don't know. I just don't know how they do it. And it's, the menu is huge. I mean it's, it's still, and it's delicious. So what people can do out of very small spaces is,

Speaker 5:          00:27:04       um, is pretty incredible. So the, for, for people who you, who don't know what an induction burner is and then didn't correct me if Ryan induction burner is basically a stove top that you plug in and you can put on a countertop, maybe it's the size of like a large dinner plate and it depends on what kind you get. But he uses, as I understand it, magnets to yes. Metal. So you could actually take the pot off, put your hand right on the burner and not burn your hand. You got to make sure you don't have rings on. But, um, that actually, uh, raises, so this, this is this question of kind of elegance, right? Because, uh, one of the questions I was going to ask you later is what, you know, what's the most interesting meal you could make an a dorm room, right? And you could, you could, I mean, induction burners in a five by 10 foot space. I mean, that's basically a dorm room that these guys are cooking in. It sounds like if, um, if you had to limit your herbs or spices to three choices for the rest of your life, what would your three, what would your three choices be?

Speaker 4:          00:28:06       Herbs or spices. Oh my God, what a horrible, horrible question for me. Only three.

Speaker 5:          00:28:12       Yeah. Or, or let you know what, I'll give you a little bit of wiggle room. A handful, a handful.

Speaker 4:          00:28:18       I mean, I'd have to have chilies of some kinds. Any kinds. Uh, there's lots of kinds, but you know, some, some chilies. I would have to have, um, any herbs or spices. Uh, I'm, uh, I'd probably have to take Faisal and terragon. I'm a huge terragon okay. Guy. Um, spices. I mean, oh my God, how do I pick just one? Uh, Oh God. I Dunno. Like Kumon is a big, is a, is a really versatile big spice. Um, I love pink peppercorns, although I don't know if that make the cut. Um, yeah, that's a really hard question.

Speaker 5:          00:29:02       Oh, I know. That's why I, that's why this is, this is to get the tea to make the shopping list for myself and I've terragon terragon kind of revolutionized eggs for me. Terragon and, and um, white truffle sea salts of all things. So, which was recommended by a friend of mine. How do you use Terry Dawn?

Speaker 4:          00:29:19       Oh Man. You can just check on it. Anything. I love it in straight and salads. Um, you could chop it up with like some parsley and some days on, you can put that on fish on. I use terragon on stake. Terragon like little terragon and maybe even a little butter on a steak is delicious. Um, uh, anything seafood. I find tarragon goes also really well with, so you can do, if you're doing a pasta like lemon, you know, a lemon terragon something seafood pasta, a fill in the blank on the seafood, you pretty much can't go wrong. Um, so it's, it's, it's one of those interests. You, you know, you gotta be careful because you can use it's strong. So, um, you can overuse it pretty quickly, but if you use it gently it, um, it's a beautiful flavor.

Speaker 5:          00:30:03       You mentioned steak. What is your favorite cut of steak and Y ou?

Speaker 4:          00:30:07       I guess favorite. I guess I'd have to be a rabbi, a guy, but I eat a lot of skirt steak, a lot of hanger steak. Um, I love brazing. So you know, lots of different, you know, the bridge and cuts, ribs and such. But if I'm going to have, like, if I wouldn't have my last steak, it would be a rabbi.

Speaker 5:          00:30:24       When you're cooking, remind for yourself just, just for Sam. Nobody is. How do you, how do you cook it?

Speaker 4:          00:30:30       A grill. I, you know, if I'm doing for myself, but really if I'm doing it for anybody, I just throw it on the grill really simple. Um, and like medium rare to rare and pretty olive oil, salt and to sit sometimes pepper, sometimes not. I'm not a big pepper guy, so I don't put that black pepper on much. I'm pretty much anything really. Um, but I'll stake is the kind of the one thing that I'd be open to that and yeah, in a way you go nothing, nothing fancy.

Speaker 5:          00:31:01       And you put the olive oil and salt on beforehand or afterwards?

Speaker 4:          00:31:06       Beforehand. Yeah. And if I, and if I'm going to do an herb, like sometimes I'll put terragon or some rosemary. Uh, I always do that afterwards because I find that when you put it on before just burned and you lose the flavor. But if you, you hit it afterwards, particularly if you're going to sear it on the grill and then finish in the oven for a few minutes, which is often the way to do it. If you have a thick cut, um, you put that on. So it gets to, you know, it cooks a little bit to round out the flavor, but it doesn't, uh, it doesn't kill the flavor.

Speaker 5:          00:31:33       Yeah. I always, um, finish sort of sear and then finish it the oven at a low temperature and uh, just let the butter and whatever herbs I'm going to use kind of soak in from the top down. Uh, the, so the pet, the pepper point, you mentioned not much of a black pepper guy, but you also mentioned the pink peppercorn. So would, what would you use pink peppercorns for them? Which I haven't ever used or I don't that,

Speaker 4:          00:31:56       yeah, you can. I mean, so you could use them on any meat they like go great on like pork or if you grind them up as a rub on pork or uh, you could do on stake as well. Um, you can, you can do a fun dressing, a salad dressing with them as part of it, but it becomes part of a, a flavor. Whereas like for me, black pepper, it's used like salt. Right. And we use it on everything, but salt doesn't, it's all becomes part of the flavor. It, it elevates the flavor. Worst pepper, like layers on top of the flavor. And it's, it always just kind of blanket things for me. And I dunno, I just, I don't, I'm just not a fan, uh, uh, of that sort ubiquitous pepper flavor on everything. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:32:42       so on the flip side, if a, aside from terragon, if someone, if one of your very close friends were to say, you know, I love Sam but he really overuses this ingredient, what would that ingredient or condiments or herb or spice spicy.

Speaker 4:          00:32:57       Mm. I Dunno, probably garlic, but we all are guilty of using garlic too much cause it's just so damn good. It just makes everything better.

Speaker 5:          00:33:08       I, I literally have minced garlic in my tea right now. I'm not getting, so yeah, I'm guilty of the same sin. Uh, God, uh, how did you first meet the Obamas?

Speaker 4:          00:33:24       Um, so, uh, yeah, so we're both from Hyde Park and high park is on south side Chicago, like where the universe Chicago is and, and um, you know, while he was a professor, actually I known him just from the neighborhood, uh, and the first now first lady, um, and when I was in high school and then, uh, but then lost touch with them for many years and got reconnected with them when I came back from my, uh, my time in Vienna. And then subsequent travels around the world of sort of traveled for about four or five years, you know, through Vienna and then be passed. Um, so I got reconnected with them sort of right as the campaign was, was, uh, was getting going.

Speaker 5:          00:34:04       And was that through evac or how did you guys end depth reconnecting?

Speaker 4:          00:34:08       Um, so, uh, we reconnected because why I be after I've, when I was in Vienna, I was actually there illegally. I had no worker's permit or anything and ended up sort of getting run out of town. Uh, yeah, so that's the story. That's a story for another day. Uh, and, um, so then I spent about, um, for, for you four more years passed that cooking and traveling. And I ended up getting connected to a family that had a place in New Zealand. And so I cooked a couple of seasons down in New Zealand and they were from Chicago. So I, the, after the second season I came back with them to, um, to Chicago to work part time. And the, the father of that family knew, uh, the first lady and happened to run into her, um, on a, on a plane and they got to talking and, you know, and he was telling him, telling the, the first study about, uh, you know, me cooking for them. And, and, and she's like, Oh, Sam, I haven't seen him in years. And so we got reconnected and, um, you know, back then there was no staff. It was basically just them, grandma a little, they had a little bit of help, but, but not much. So I started helping out the first lady as she had to get on the campaign trail more and more when the kids were still very young. And so started helping her out with, uh, with cooking some better food for them.

Speaker 5:          00:35:28       What's meals? What were some favorite meals during that? That, uh, intense campaigning period.

Speaker 4:          00:35:35       Oh, you know, that's all top secrets. Just scared. Disclose. No, just kidding. You know, look at the end during that time and all the way through. I mean, they, there's, there's never been any interest in fancy food at all, really simple food that everybody's going to like, you know, lots of chicken or lean proteins, lots of fish. We always do whole grains. So if we're doing rice, there's always brown rice and always, you know, you know, good, good serving of vegetables. Um, and just, you know, um, nothing. It's always, I think the thing that people, um, you know, think about when they think of private chef, do you think, oh, fancy food, but really you're in your home, right? So people don't want to feel like they're in a restaurant. And that's same was true in the White House. And I think, um, so we always kept at it really, really simple. Um, and never, never did anything. I mean, we ate like everybody else eats nothing, nothing crazy. We'd love a good Burger, you know? Uh, so things like that.

Speaker 3:          00:36:36       What if, if hypothetically you had, let's say five years from now you decide, you know what, just for the hell of it, I'm going to have a couple of restaurants in Chicago. And uh, you go back at some point, you're the owner and you decided to kind of hang out at one of the restaurants and Lo and lo and behold, the Obama's come in for dinner and they say, Sam, make us whatever you think will bring back the memories. What would you make them?

Speaker 4:          00:37:05       How would I'm pretty right to marry? Or would that make them a, that's a great question. I guess it depends. The first thing I'd say is it depends on what the season is because I think one of the keys to great food is cooking with the season, summertime, summertime. So summertime, I'd probably start with a like a, a really nice tomato salad because I'm, one of the best things about being in the White House has been the first lady's garden. And we got to pick, you know, awesome produce right out of the garden, right before dinner. So I'd probably start with an awesome tomato salad. Um, maybe do some barbecue chicken, um, uh, with Muslim good spice. I Dunno, uh, maybe some potatoes and a, just a bunch of vegetables. So we would pick like P and g Zucchini and Bazell Oh, maybe a little egg plan or some peppers. I don't know. It just depends what's going on. We've grown some great corn, so maybe do some, some really good corn with that. Um, some like that.

Speaker 3:          00:38:04       What's, um, what would the tomato salad look like?

Speaker 4:          00:38:09       I love to me, if you've got great tomatoes, you don't want to do much John. I mean, I think, um, if you don't have great tomatoes then you've got to work with them some, but you probably should just do it different salad. Then I, uh, I like it with a little onion. And on this one, like typically have a red onion, really thinly sliced. One of my big things I hate thickly sliced red onion. It's like as thin as you can slice it thinner, the better. Uh, but I'll actually in the tomato saddle widening finally too is, is good. Um, with some nice, uh, olive oil and you know, like a white Balsamic is really nice on tomato salad. It's got a touch of sweetness, um, in any, any number of herbs like, you know, you could do part holy parsley and some Bazell maybe throw in some like green beans or wax beans in there that are blanched. So I'm like, that sounds pretty good to me. That sounds great.

Speaker 5:          00:39:00       What other pet peeves do you have aside from overuse of pepper? Thickly sliced onions. I love pet peeves. I've got a million of them myself. So what other things make you crazy when it comes to food? Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:39:14       I think the thing that makes me the most crazy in food is just when people try too hard and they try to be something that they're not. Like, there's nothing more than I love them. And I got a perfect fried wing or like an awesome burger. But I hate when there's like food that's looks all fancy but tastes like crap. Like, it's like just, just, you know, if you can do food that's beautiful and super welcome post and, and like, I appreciate that too. It's not that I don't like that, but if you're just on foam everywhere and doing all of some weird concoctions because that's sort of trendy. Like I hate the trends in food ag grill, just well executed food and you can tell it has a lot of love in it and a lot of authenticity in it. And I think that that for me is his most important. Um, so I, I did generally, that's the thing that like the determined

Speaker 5:          00:40:05       my experience, uh, and eating and eating somebody's food. That was, that was something that really surprised me when I got to know quite a few shifts in writing. The four chef was that, uh, when they came to visit, say my house for dinner or someone else says the last thing they wanted to have was a five course meal. Yeah. Like the last thing they wanted to have with some type of foam sprayed onto their plate with like tweezer cuisine on top of it. They're just like, no, just give me like a, a really fatty burger or something really simple that I can enjoy consuming. Uh, the, uh, what, what made the, the White House Garden unique? Cause I know that, that a lot of thought went into that and I've become, I've never gardened, uh, but I'd become very fascinated by it because I, when I went to, uh, this, this village called Ogi me in Okinawa at one point, it has the, the longest median lifespan in the world and I just noticed that nearly everyone gardened in some capacity. Um, so what made the White House Garden unique?

Speaker 4:          00:41:11       Uh, well there's a lot unique about that garden. Um, you know, one is the first garden since Eleanor Roosevelt Victory Garden during World War II, which was a really powerful symbolic garden, but it was actually quite small and really didn't produce food to eat. Um, so the White House Garden, the first age garden is really the first garden since the late 1890s, and that, that actually produced food. Um, and, you know, it was designed, it's whole purpose was to really shine a light on, on food, where it comes from, how it's grown, how hard it is to grow good food, and really lift up farmers all over America that are producing the, the nourishment that we need to survive and, um, and, and make it educational. And I, and I think that's really it. You know, so it was a working last card and that we ate from every day.

Speaker 4:          00:42:04       Um, but also we had kids come down for, towards tours on a weekly basis. The kids would come and plant with the first lady and then harvest and cook with her a couple of times a year. We had a compost. It's a really talk about the importance of giving back to the soil building soil fertility, which is a huge issue across the country. Um, and we also had the first ever beehive on the White House grounds, um, which, uh, which is, which is just awesome. And we got tons of honey, but also could talk to the kids about pollinators and why they're so important. And we have a huge, huge problem with Paul, a climate colony collapse disorder and we're, we're losing bees and other pollinators that, you know, really alarming rates, which have massive implications for our economy and our ability to, to produce food. So, you know, I think, um, when you look at the whole picture and what it's accomplished since that garden planted gardening across the country is skyrocket, it's up over 30%. Um, and uh, so it's been a really exciting and, and it was just, it was a ton of fun.

Speaker 3:          00:43:06       You mentioned, you mentioned a couple of things that I think are really important. The magnitude of the impact of B is something I never really understood and I still need to understand more, but, uh, people talking about the butterfly effect and the like, you know, the be affect sort of the ripple, the cascade of different sort of ecosystem changes that bees are involved with is really astonishing. The second thing I would encourage people to look into is what you mentioned, which is the soil depletion. And I remember at one point, maybe one of the listeners can, can find this, but seeing data that, uh, I believe it was from China that looked at the incidence and frequency of a cancer diagnosis in different regions in China. And you could pretty much predict how much cancer there would be based on a top soil depletion in different regions because they would end up with trace mineral deficiencies like selenium and so on. Um, and uh, I remember reading about this at one point, if something like in certain areas because of a mono crops, you know, like the wheat and soy and so on. In the u s the top soil has gone from whatever, 10 feet to like 10 inches. And what do you think needs to be done or what can be done to help reverse that trend?

Speaker 4:          00:44:26       So there's a, there's a lot that needs to be done. And I'd say it's, it's a, a topic that doesn't get anywhere near the attention that it deserves. But everything comes, everything is based on the health of our soil. It is the reason why we have such a prosperous nation was that we had the best soil in the world and it helped us produce a surplus of crops, which allowed, um, you know, big parts of our population to go on and build and create and do other things. Um, and the, the, the dramatic loss across the nation on, on our, on our topsoil is something that is, it couldn't be a more important issue and it couldn't be a harder one to make, get people excited about cause I got dark. Like, what are you talking about? You know, uh, there's lots of things that need to be done.

Speaker 4:          00:45:13       Um, and I think they're starting to see some change. I think people are starting to note to wake up to this, we need to do much better job at rotating our crops to rebuild fertility right now where we're basically growing up just a couple of crops and using synthetic fertilizers to sort of make up for the lack of fertility in the soil. That's a problem. We're having all kinds of, uh, of, of problems from stemming from that run off in our water. You know, massive algae blooms and the golf killing sees life, there's lots of lots of challenges going on there. So I think we need to rotate crops. I think we need to change our practices to really focus on rebuilding that fertility, um, using different, uh, sources of, of fertilizer and natural fertilizers. And you're starting to see people taking back some of that land and rebuilding and hopefully that will continue to grow.

Speaker 4:          00:46:00       And people, I mean, I think are going to continually have to ask, you know, work on, you know, sourcing food that's coming from farmers that are, you know, uh, you know, doing those kind of practices that are, are more sustainable. I think the thing that people don't realize that if we use those kinds of practices, that is the best, one of the best tools we have to sequester carbon. So agriculture is not only a challenge to when it comes to sustainability and our environmental challenges with, with greenhouse gas emissions, it's a, it's a significant producer of, but it actually, unlike other aspects of the challenge, it can actually be part of the solution. And so there's a, there's, there's exciting opportunity there that we don't see in too many other sectors that need to change.

Speaker 5:          00:46:42       Yeah. I'm, I'm excited about the potential for a kind of soil replenishment because I feel like it could be effective in marketing product. Does that make sense? Like there's a, there's a kind of economic self interest that I think could be harnessed if somebody could create the proper campaign. Um, what, uh, what do you see, or what do you think the future is, if any of, uh, say organic subsidies for people who really want to, or large companies that really want to produce organic produce but view it as cost prohibitive or, or something along those lines?

Speaker 4:          00:47:19       Yeah, so this is obviously a very complicated, a complicated question and I'm really complicated politics. I think the place, and this again, is hard to get people super excited about, but I think the place to really start is in research. So over the last 50 years, we poured the vast majority. I mean, you know, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars into researching just a couple of crops. Uh, and, uh, fruits and vegetables, uh, writ large have not gotten, mostly it's gone to corn and soy, some weed, but mostly corn and soy. Um, and that is a loud corn and soy to be produced much more efficiently than it used to. And so a lot of the price difference, we talk about the relative cost of, of, of say sugar and other things versus uh, a fruit or a vegetable. It is because we figured out how to grow those crops much more efficiently.

Speaker 4:          00:48:14       And so if we invest that same kind of research to try to figure out how to grow foods and vegetables more efficiently, we're going to make up a lot of the ground. Now part of the challenges that, you know, the people who are currently growing say the fruits and vegetables, no matter whether they're doing it organic or not organic, they liked the fact that they're the only ones growing it so they not support subsidies for other people to grow more fruits and vegetables. That's interesting. So there's really tough politics because in Washington, if the people you're trying to help are against you, it's going to be very hard to move anything through. It's hard to move anything through if they're with you because there's always going to, people meet people on the other side fighting very hard, investing a lot of money and seeing that not happen.

Speaker 4:          00:48:57       So in this particular one is the politics are really hard to get Congress to, to the shift where we're putting some of these substances now on the organic side, which is a different set of questions. I think the market's going to have to continue to drive the change and you're seeing organic, um, uh, you know, continue to grow at a very rapid way. Although it's a still a very small part of the overall, uh, food economy. But I think the more consumers demand it, I think the more it's going to get grown and it's going to become increasingly more affordable for farmers to, to produce it when we get some more scale there.

Speaker 5:          00:49:35       Yeah, it's a, it's a such a thorny, gnarly topic. Uh, and, uh, I would, I would suggest just as a side note for folks who perhaps want to eat organic but have to pick and choose for financial reasons or otherwise, there's a list called the dirty dozen and I think it might be the clean 15, which is sort of the, the 12 items produce items that are best avoided that have the highest concentrations of pesticides. But I think the research is really, as you noted, super important because if a, it's one thing in the abstract to say organic is better for reasons a, B, and C of and avoiding synthetic pesticides. But if someone could actually look at say, the, the endocrin impact of estrogenic compounds that are found in a synthetic fertilizers so that therefore affect fertility or whatever, then I think the, it could get more airtime. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       I will, I will, I will say just on one thing, on this point though, you know, I think people should try to eat organic when they can, but I think they need to eat fruits and vegetables first and foremost. So I think part of the, the thing to be concerned about is, wow, um, I, I would much rather people eat a conventional, any conventional food, vegetable then like organic chips or organic cupcakes. Right, right. And I think, um, you know, we're getting better, people are raising more awareness. Our agricultural practices are getting better largely because this, I was getting more and more expensive. So farmers are learning how to be more diligent about their applications. There's obviously a lot, lot longer to go, but there's going to be some things that we're going to need some insecticides and pesticides and I think that's okay as long as they're being used responsibly.

Speaker 4:          00:51:17       Um, but, uh, but I don't want people, I think part of that we need to avoid is, um, sort of fear based, uh, if you eat this, it's going to kill you because there's just not the evidence there. There, there's, there's reasons for serious concern and, and continue engagement in pushing on some of these topics. But, but it shouldn't keep anybody from, uh, from consuming that kind of a balanced diet that, that we know is important. Do you, um, so there was an article that came out recently by Steve Case called the future food is food. Uh, what do you, what is your, what are your thoughts on meal replacements like soylent? And so I actually tweeted about, I tweeted about that article. I, I couldn't agree with what's the more, I mean Steve Basically makes the argument that sort of high tech, uh, artists like artificially put together, uh, drinks that you know, are based on some science, you know, Kinda could replace food.

Speaker 4:          00:52:18       Um, and I think the vision for, for the folks that swelling is that they can create a perfect meal. So instead of eating a bunch of junk, you can just conveniently drink this. Um, so I, I, I don't, I don't hate the sort of, the vision there in the sense that they're trying to do something good, but if the future is a disgusting, tasteless, uh, soulless beverage to sustain, you know, just to keep us alive, that's not a future. I have much interest in being a part of, I think, I think it lacks authenticity. I think at lax flavor, I think it lacks happiness. And Joy and all of that goes into what a good, good nourishment means to me. And I think I see a role pre made with elderly people and, and others for improved sort of dietary supplement, you know, uh, meals like that. But I don't think that's a solution that, uh, I, for one, have any interest in participating in, uh, uh, I think real good food grown properly that supports the people who are growing at that supports the health of the people who are eating it. That is damn good is where we should all be, you know, driving for.

Speaker 3:          00:53:30       Yeah. I've, I've done an about face on this stuff because I've always been a kind of supplement addict and, uh, been infatuated with pills and potions and whatnot as, as supplementation. But I mean, there's, they're called supplements for a reason and I've really found that I'm echoing the sentiment of say, Nassim Taleb wrote the Black Swan and antifragile. So he uses a term called a epistemological or, yeah, epistemological arrogance, which is overestimating how much you understand about it. Anything as a human, and I think it's naive to think I've come to this conclusion anyway that you can, that we would understand every element of what's in an apple for instance, or what's in a slice of Ribeye. Like we, we just, there's so much uncharted territory that it's naive to think we could take the four or five things we've isolated, put them in a pill and, and, uh, sort of confer the same nutritional benefit for instance. I mean, that's kind of pointing them a one, but, um, yeah, it's, it's a very interesting, it's a very fascinating subject, but I've, I've gone completely in the, in the whole food direction just trying to consume a spectrum of colors every day, for instance. Yeah. Um, the, um,

Speaker 4:          00:54:49       so can I, do I want to add some of that? Yeah, yeah. I think that is on the nutritional side that that basic point and understanding of our limitations couldn't be more, right. I mean we've tried very hard to kind of reduce, uh, our health to one vitamin or fiber or this or that in a very reductionist way and utterly miss the interplay between all of these different vitamins, nutrients, fiber, protein and also by the way completely miss how our body processes. So it's turning out that, you know, we have 100 trillion bacteria in our gut, 100 trillion, which really what we're doing is feeding that bacteria, which then in turn feeds us and it's going to, the evidence is emerging that the microbiome, the gut bacteria is going to be one of the most important things to focus on in terms of improving our health. And that we've lost quite a bit of diversity in our gut and we don't, but there's, you know, a couple hundred a species of bacteria in our gut a little less and we are just trying to figure out what does, what and how they interact.

Speaker 4:          00:55:54       And it's, everybody's different. The complexities here are just overwhelming. Um, we know that they need to be fed a high diet of fiber, lots of fruits and vegetables. Basically what they feed and from birth. So like we, for a long time there was parts of breast milk, the wheat, the baby's couldn't digest and we didn't understand. We didn't think they were important, but turns out actually all those elements in breast milk are feeding the emerging biome and the young and the baby's got, which is then gives it deals with the immune and inflammation and all these vital things and, and digesting of food. So there's like the complexity is beyond anything that we can comprehend right now. And, um, I think we have continually like w over and over tried to say was, oh, it's fat as the problem. And like turns out, okay, wait, fat's not the problem.

Speaker 4:          00:56:42       Well, it's a deficiency in Omega this and I'll, okay, well turns out, well that's good, but it's not. Certainly they'll panacea that was made out to be, you know, every time we do this we get it wrong. And so I, I agree with you. I mean, I think there's some things that have been tested over the Millennia and um, which his, that kind of balance, good diet of whole grains. And lots of fruits and vegetables and lean proteins. And I think that's where, um, we, we were safest is when we stay in that kind of, uh, that kind of space.

Speaker 3:          00:57:14       And I'm glad you mentioned safest because it's not just, oops, I didn't cover all my bases. When you take a very reductionist approach, for instance, when people, uh, when the media got its hands on the so called promises a Beta carotene, right? People started consuming massive amounts of Beta carotene in isolation. It can actually cause a lot of problems when you're not sort of consuming it and it's natural, uh, environment, so to speak. But yeah, I'd love to shift gears and ask you some, uh, some rapid fire questions. They don't have to have rapid answers, but, um, when you think of the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind and why?

Speaker 4:          00:57:54       Mm, well, two people come to mind. Uh, Barack Obama, uh, and my, and my father, but for wildly different reasons. Uh, I mean, Barack Obama's, you know, success to me, I measure based on, um, impact and the amount of impact that I'm somebody who's trying to have in a positive way on the world around him. Nothing money or, but it's sort of what you do with the place that you've been given and you know, um, there's lots of legitimate disagreements in, in, in politics and I'm sure there's legitimate disagreements with some of the things that the president has has done. And, but he is, you know, I know firsthand on a daily basis that here's somebody who trying to, and it has had a massive positive impact on the world around him. So that, that's something that, um, you know, I, I very much look up to and admire and, and you know, in my small, much, much, much smaller way, try to figure out how I can have the biggest positive impact on the world around me.

Speaker 4:          00:58:55       And I'd say, but on the flip side, you know, but that takes, you know, there's a lot of ambition that goes with that and I'll, you know, disappointments when you fail. Um, on the flip side, like success, my father is, um, he is a, he's a fifth grade teacher. Has He just retired after 25 years? Um, uh, he lives at an incredibly humble life and, you know, as a, you know, a union guy growing up and, and, and the, and the teacher and in a union guy and sort of in the school. And He, um, he, he's utterly content. Uh, he, he has a good community of friends. He's, you know, has a roof over his head and, and, and meals on his table. In fact, when I first went to that restaurant in Chicago, he had never spent $20 on a meal for himself, which I only found out when I invited them in for a meal at the end of my summer time there. Um, so he's just very content in, in like the simple pleasures and the sort of a simple life. And I, and that's something that, um, uh, is, you know, I, I also try to take into what success looks like is, is, is that kind of contentness and being appreciative of, of a, of what you have,

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       right. Having the appreciation, not just the drive for achievement. Yeah. What's, what book or what is a book that you've gifted most often are gifted very often to other people.

Speaker 4:          01:00:20       Mm. Have gift in Dod and pushing around the art of fielding over the last year or two, uh, by Chad Harbach. I love that book. Um, it's like, it's, it's, so it's a baseball theme, but it's really about life and, and all that goes with that and complexities of relationships. And I don't know, there's something that book just sucked me in and I love the feeling of being sucked in, which, you know, it doesn't happen with that intensity too often. So I, that was a good one.

Speaker 3:          01:00:48       The Art of fielding. Are there any, uh, any documentaries, documentary films or movies that have sucked you in, in that way?

Speaker 4:          01:00:56       Hmm. I love documentaries. I'm a, I'm a big fan, uh, and a good and a great movie as well. The, the last one I just saw actually it just came out, um, which I really loved called just eat it and it's about food waste. We waste 40% of the food we produce, uh, which is just insane. There's no other major like life system that is so inefficient. And then it's about this couple that, um, basically for, I forget how long, six months decides the only eat food that they has been wasted that they find thrown away in some way, shape or form. And it's unbelievable stories. So really well done. It's only an hour. Um, I think it just aired on Msnbc actually, but they, they are having to have to give away food. They find so much of that, um, they can't eat it all and it's, so, it was very powerful. Very well done. Um, but that's the one that's top of mind.

Speaker 3:          01:01:51       Awesome. Check that out. That, uh, makes me think there's a book, a read a long time ago, I think it was called the man who gave up money or the men who stopped using money, something along those lines. But it delves into sort of the dumpster diving freegan movement, I guess they call them instead of vegans. Really fascinating. Um, what's, uh, what's hundred dollars or less purchase has had the biggest positive impact on your life in the last six months to a year? Let's just, whatever comes to mind doesn't have to be in that time frame.

Speaker 4:          01:02:24       Um, yeah, the recent purchase, I got a, I got a kindle or recently, which I now before, uh, which has been great. Uh, you know, I, I know people, I'm like way behind, you know, behind the curve and not the highest tech way to read, read, read things. But it's, but it's been great because I'm all over the place and, and so that's helped. I also got an ice bucket and uh, uh, it's made the rose aid that much colder as summer's starting to hit. And that's been, oh, an investment. Well, worthwhile.

Speaker 3:          01:02:54       That's a good call. Ice Bucket. Yeah. Lovers and there's a great, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:02:59       I, um, grew up on long island. There's a wonderful rosé from a wolf or a states. Uh, I know that it's really good

Speaker 3:          01:03:07       winemaker. Roman is just amazing. I'm not too expensive either. What, what does the first 60 minutes of your day look like? Do you, what are morning rituals, whether when you were at the White House or now that have been consistent?

Speaker 4:          01:03:25       Um, so pretty consistent basic routine. Um, the one variable and that like, I used to do a lot more. I don't do it anymore. Like first thing I love to do from a perfect world is to do a short stint of meditation for like 10 or 15 minutes. It's been hard for me to keep those impossible for me to do that. The White House for whatever reason, I just think mentally quieting and slowing my mind was just something that is just say, wouldn't do as hard as hard as I tried. Um, and exhaustion, uh, also played a role, but I wake up and, um, a workout, uh, five or six days a week. Um, do about 30 minutes of Cardio and then do weights, uh, various, uh, sort of sets. What type of cardio do you do? So I'll do 10 minutes, uh, on the bike and then now I'm been doing a 12 minute interval, interval run, run.

Speaker 4:          01:04:20       And then I'm, I'm doing like another 10 minutes, uh, in, in like 12 incline walking at 3.5 on the treadmill. Um, sometimes I do the elliptical, I'm in there and then, and then do weights. Um, and then, and then, uh, so the White House, it was always, you know, take a shower, get ready, and then I do oatmeal, a banana and coffee. Since I'd been, uh, out of the White House I've been doing eggs. Um, one of the, you know, a couple of ways, uh, some of my Colby tell us maybe some avocado, salmon and then, and, and coffee. That's been the routine and then a way I go.

Speaker 3:          01:05:02       Do you do it? Do you do anything in particular before bed?

Speaker 4:          01:05:06       Uh hmm. I don't have that same kind of routine at night. Often cause nights there's like much more variable. Like the morning has always been the time that I take for myself, um, and carve out because after that it's like anybody's guess what's going to happen. Um, but try to, you know, try to come bring down a little bit. But oftentimes, and certainly the White House, I was working until one, two, three in the morning, um, pretty consistently. So, um, it was sorta like you worked til you fell off, fell off your chair and call it to bed and then got up a few hours later and it started doing it all over again. So, um, so I don't have that same kind of night routine. Got It.

Speaker 3:          01:05:47       And when you, when you meditated, what type of meditation did you do? What did that, what did that look like?

Speaker 4:          01:05:54       Um, so I, so I, the, the woman who taught me is one of the most amazing people I've ever known. Um, she was an 80 year old woman, uh, who was actually from France who I met when I was traveling on the border of Malaysia and Thailand on an overnight train. She was 80 years old and she had spent the last 20 plus years of her life just traveling with a teeny little for like eight pound backpack. And that's all she had. And she went everywhere and she was just the most amazing person and she, um, so it's like a, you know, but she's not like a, you know, formal teacher. So, you know, just trying to sit up, you know, have good posture and just, you know, fundamentally relax and focus on my breathing is like as sophisticated as I got. Um, and trying to let your mind relax and repeating that, forcing your mind to get back to that state, which is, you know, it's always been such a challenge. It's so hard. Um, uh, has as sort of how I would do it for as long as I, as, as I could. But when I do it, I feel so much better and so much more grounded and, and sort of calm through the day. It's a, but it takes a lot of discipline to carve out the time. Um, in any given day.

Speaker 3:          01:07:09       Yeah. I've found for myself because I meditate 15, 20 minutes each morning, Eh, usually 20, uh, two things really interesting. Number one, it takes about 15 minutes for me just to let the dust and the or the mud settle. Um, so I really only feel like I'm meditating in the calm sensor last five minutes, but it's the you need, I need the 15 minutes just as a warm up or cool down maybe. And then secondly, that posture I've noticed if I just sit with very good posture and kind of lengthen my spine, imagine my head being kind of pulled up on a string. Even if I don't get to some sublime state. If I just focus and sit that way for 20 minutes, there's a huge benefit for me anyway. I feel the same way about that. Yup. Yup. Uh, we'd love to ask some questions from, uh, people on Facebook and Twitter who were very excited that we were going to be chatting. Uh, the first is a tough one. Uh, but it's from Andrew Zimmern. Uh, Oh, I love that man. He's awesome. Andrew's great. That also has been on the podcast and he wanted to ask some questions. He hears them very often, he gets asked them very often and it's always curious how other people answer them. So the first is, uh, if it's illegal to sell cigarettes to minors or drugs, slash. Booze, why do we let fast food or sugar drinks into schools?

Speaker 4:          01:08:29       Yeah, so, great question. So a couple points. So one, uh, because of the new standards, uh, that are in play, um, there are no more sugary drinks in schools and those are out. Um, and I actually need to give the, you know, the beverage homies credit, they actually volunteerily voluntarily pulled out most of those beverages around starting in around 2007. But the new standards utterly eliminate all sugary drinks. You can have a low calorie in high school, you could have a low calorie Gatorade and you can have no calorie drinks. So Diet Sodas are allowed in high schools, not in middle schools and certainly not in lower schools. Um, so those drinks are out on the fast food side. Um, I have always been pretty appalled that as some of these, particularly the last healthy companies have set up shop in high schools. Now this is not ubiquitous by any stretch of the imagination, but they definitely exist in some number.

Speaker 4:          01:09:25       And I actually need to look and see because their food does not meet the standards. So unless they're changing their offerings. So I am not sure how many, like where, where they are in the evolution of either what they're offering in schools or if some of them have had to pull out, you know, the truth is, I don't know the answer that, but I'll, I'll dig into that and come back to you on it. Um, but I agree. I think it's really inappropriate to be serving, you know, have a fast food, pretty unhealthy restaurant set up in a, in a high school. I find that to be, I've always found that to be very off putting.

Speaker 3:          01:10:01       Cool. Uh, yeah, we'd love for people listening who participate on the blog. Uh, obviously there'll be a post with all the links and resources and so on, including things like, uh, you know, organizations like American farmland trust that have done stuff with, if you want to sort of get involved with some of these things. But I would love to hear ideas for what types of campaigns or angles could be taken to remedy that from folks. Uh, I do pay attention to the comments up. Next question is from cinema air. This is on Twitter. Best use of wine, that's too old to drink.

Speaker 4:          01:10:34       So, um, you know, depending on the kind of wine and you know, I think there's, there's probably a little mad at depending on where you are and how it goes, but you know, that's how you make vinegar. So, uh, you know, grape juice turns into vinegar, right? So, um, there you could, you, depending on how close you can use it, kind of in that, in that way, a lot of people use it for cooking, but you know, no, no real chef would say you should, uh, if it's not good to drink, whether it's really not good to cook with. So the truth is like there's a, there's not much to do with it. I gotta be honest. I would get that. At least not that I know. Um, maybe somebody out there has got a good thing, but basically like drink it before it goes bad is my best advice to you. And you know, the thing that, you know, if you get just one of those simple air pumps with, with the, with the rubber top, it pulls the air out, you add, you know, a week or two depending on the wine, a life to it. And that's what I use. You know, we use that in our house. Um, and it makes a big difference because there's nothing worth, there's like one of the worst feelings in the world is dumping out a half a bottle of wine that you didn't get the finish. Yeah. Pain.

Speaker 3:          01:11:46       The, the vacuum is really cheap and really effective. I, yeah, I use the same device, uh, on that point. Uh, Stephan, I think it's Stephan. Um, Bendel what should home chefs stop doing? So wasting wine would be one.

Speaker 4:          01:12:05       Wow. What should home chef that doing? La, there's, there's a few things. Um, watch it. Home chefs started. Do I need to spend more time with home chefs to give you the best answer? I think dragging the knife across the cutting board like as like a shovel is something that like you never supposed to do. If you need to like move like the vegetables of scoop them up, use the backside of the knife, but like scraping the knife on the cutting board just drives me crazy. It's just really bad for your knife. Dulls it immediately. Um, something that I cringe at. I think, um, chest, the home cooks need to um, work with heat. Uh, I like not be afraid of, of of heat. More so particularly when you're sharing fish, it's like you need that pant hat. And so letting, like putting it in, like getting your pants super hot and then putting your fish down and leaving it and not touching it and letting it get that Nice, you know, a good sear, good Golden Brown on it before you touch it.

Speaker 4:          01:13:02       It's like key to fish and those, most people don't get their pan hot enough, don't heat it, don't ever get it out and up. Don't take the time to heat it and then play around with the fish, which, which ends up really hurting. It's its ultimate um, feel. But I think allowing, I think babies, the one thing that's the big difference between a pro and a home cook is that like the see the getting real color on things. Be it meat or any vegetable that's on the grill or anything you're putting in the pan. Like just let it go when you think it's like ready. Like give it another minute or two and like get that really dark, dark color on it. It adds a ton of flavor.

Speaker 3:          01:13:37       When can you tell that your pan is hot enough for that nice sear on a fish.

Speaker 4:          01:13:43       So like when you put the oil in, like you don't want it to immediately start smoking. Like then your oils done. Like, don't put it in there. If it's like you put it in, it's like smoke, but like you should see the oil, get that kind of those lines in it, that kind of Shimmer and it should just start to go off a little bit of like you could see to us and little that a smoke. Um, that's when you're, you're ready to go. But it should be like, ha. Like when you put it in and she'd be like, you're like, it shouldn't be like go crazy. Like if it's just like a little mild bubble, like you're not, you weren't ready.

Speaker 3:          01:14:14       And what, what type of oil do you like to use with, with fish? For instance?

Speaker 4:          01:14:18       Um, you know, you can use a lot. Like you can use olive oil, it has a lower smoke point, but you can, you can get away with it. Um, I like grape seed oil is a great oil to cook with. Um, uh, you know, you can do high. He canola is totally fine. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:14:34       uh, those are probably the main ones to go with. Peanut oil is awesome. That's expensive. Yeah. I've been playing myself a little bit with avocado oil because it has high omega three content, decent smoke point, but it's so rich depending on the food UniKey easily or enhance or completely contaminate what you're doing to try to make, uh, this question is from chaos and Nata. Uh, when you fall into a Rut in the kitchen, uh, what book resource or person do you turn to for inspiration?

Speaker 4:          01:15:08       Oh, interesting. Um, so I don't, yeah, it's a good, I mean I try to get out and eat or go to the store or go like see and feel and touch and smell is the thing that I try to do when I'm, when I'm just sort of feel dad and use the actual ingredient soon, inspire what I'm going to do. But I'd say the book that I read that I look at, I really don't look at cookbooks a ton anymore, but the one recently that I have is all of auto language's books are awesome.

Speaker 3:          01:15:36       How do you, Oh, wait a second here. I know this name. Uh, how, how do you spell that name or the first name?

Speaker 4:          01:15:41       Um, a little lag at lemme. Lemme. Um, O. O. T. T. O. L. E. N. Uh, let me let, let me just pull it up for you. Um, Ott, o. L. E. N. G. H. I, uh, he is an incredible chef. Him and his partner, uh, actually one is, he's a, you know, there are Palestinian and Israeli, uh, uh, team couple and um, they have plenty is probably their most famous book, but they have Jerusalem and plenty more. Their books are just spectacular and the recipes are simple but so delicious. Um, I, I definitely cooked a few out of them and they're always, they're always awesome.

Speaker 3:          01:16:27       If someone is new to healthy cooking, where would you suggest they start? What could they start with as anything simple they could, they could use to get the ball rolling in terms of like a dish, a dish, stocking the kitchen. Unstacking stocking the kitchen. It was, it's, it's a general question. So I'd say you can interpret it any way you want.

Speaker 4:          01:16:52       So I think the key is like starting simple. And I think people whenever they approached like, okay, I want to make a change. They think I got to overhaul everything. And so then they tried to do a dramatic thing and then then of course it's not sustainable. You can't keep that up. You revert back to kind of who you've been and it then you just completely stopped. So I would think like little things. So one place to start is vinegar. If you want to start with a small like getting really good vinegar makes us like a salad, go from really uninspired, so really delicious. So one place that I did actually invest a little, if you're going to invest a little resource in is getting some really nice vinegar to make really beautiful salads and salads or like some, some, some kind of green, like a good combo is some kind of some kind of leaf.

Speaker 4:          01:17:34       Um, some kind of texture. We had cucumber, fennel or you know, various things, acidity. So you could add, you know, any kind of citrus fruit, there's always great or just a really nice vinegar, some nuts of some kind and achieves. There's unkind, like a farmer Xan or Pecorino or different, if you like, that kind of basic components. It's hard to really make it terrible. Sometimes, Geez can throw you off. So you can play around with that. But you get good texture, you get good flavor. And if you have a nice vinegar like the world is yours and that's a really good place to just add some salad on and you know, to your dinner is a, is a great place to start. But I would just try to add a piece of fruit, try to add another thing of vegetables at dinner. Like if you just start there, those two things. And I think the other main thing to start is drinking more water. Um, it, there's nothing better than water. The more water you drink, the less sugary beverages you're going to drink, which is really key if you're going to try to live a healthier life. And um, you know that that's a great place to start. And then from there, you can you build from there.

Speaker 3:          01:18:43       Yeah. The one or just to echo that for people who might be following a diet of any type of slow carb or Paleo or whatever to try to lose fat. If your liver is burdened by even partial dehydration, it's just not going to do a very good job of helping you to you to oxidize fat. So I've, I've noticed tremendously even with getting into say ketosis because I'm experimenting with that more water. I drink, the more I walk, uh, the better off I am, the faster I'll drop into a state of ketosis. Um, but, uh, the, the other thing, just on your point with nuts and cheese, if, if I've, it seems like with almost any dish, if someone wants to impress a dinner guest, just put Parmesan and sliced almonds on anything and it looks real. It looks really fancy and it tastes amazing. Yeah. Uh, and on that note, uh, this is, will McClellan, uh, there may not be a best meal, but what's the best meal to impress a girl with? But it's easy to make. This is, I'm sure a question. This is guys have a phobia. A lot of guys have cooking in any capacity. So what would be one meal that might impress a girl? But that is easy to make.

Speaker 4:          01:19:56       That's funny. Uh, well I was just talking to one of my best friends, in fact, that guy who was with me in Vienna and then he was telling me about, uh, a date he was on in just yesterday and he was saying, Oh yeah, I cook that risotto again. I, you know, he's like, man, yeah, you tell me that, that one time. And I've grown with that for the last 10 years. Uh, I think it was, oh, it's a really good, very easy dish, uh, to make that, um, that you can do a lot of things with that seems very fancy and impressive, but isn't that hard. Uh, basic risotto is you start, you know, start with like an onion or shallot. You Cook that down, you cook your rice, you have a stock of some kind, so you can buy a nice chicken stock or uh, seafood stock depending on what you're gonna put in there and make sure that hot and then you're just adding some stock as you go and you go.

Speaker 4:          01:20:47       So sorry, onions. And then you put the rice in it, mix it around a little white wine and let that evaporate. And then you're just adding stock as you go until the rice is like done. Do you want it to be a little, you know, dente that you want it to be a little, have a little tooth to it's you don't want it mushy. Um, and then just finish it with whatever you want. If you're going to have like some scallops and there you can do a whole seafood thing. You can do a lamb or Zoho, you could, you can do a vegetable risotto, you can do anything you want and it's hard to mess it up because you finish it with a little butter or some olive oil and a bunch of Parmesan cheese. So like, it's like hard to go wrong there. Um, and it's sort of one of those dishes that, uh, it's hard to make it perfect, but it's, it's,

Speaker 3:          01:21:29       it's easy to make it good, easy to make it good. It's so true for so many things in life. Right. Um, so, so I want to get a little granular on this cause that actually like to try to make it this weekend. So you, you, you take the onions or shallots, those are, uh, pretty thinly sliced, right?

Speaker 4:          01:21:48       You want a dice those up, you want to make them very small dice, like a mint.

Speaker 3:          01:21:52       Got It. And then you throw that in the pan or pot, I guess, pot in this case with some like olive oil and you just, uh, would you have olive oil? Would you, would you have some type of oil in there to start with?

Speaker 4:          01:22:02       Yup. Yup. So yeah, some olive oil, you put that in and you cook it a little bit. Um, then you put in your rice and you know, you've, depending on how many people you have, you know, Cup Cup to two cups. You know, if you're not doing a ton, you know, a cup of rice should probably be enough. If it's too, we'll will be enough. Two people, then you cook that a little bit, get that covered and coded and then you add, you know, a bit of of white wine.

Speaker 3:          01:22:25       Now the stock is the stock already in there.

Speaker 4:          01:22:28       The stock's not in. Their stock should be in a separate, separate pot and it should be, you should, it should be hot. You should bring that to a boil and keep that warm. Got It. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:22:37       onions. Then the cook that down and let it kind of caramelize a little bit. Uh, not, you don't want to color on it, you don't want to color. Okay. And then you, then you had the rise, then you add, so you have a cup of rice. How much white wine would you put in there?

Speaker 4:          01:22:52       Yeah, I'm not sure. And I'm not a great recipe guy. Like, you just want to get a nice like couple of splashes in, they're like, oh, that's fine. I don't know, maybe like a quarter cup. Okay. Um, at the most. And then you, you cook that down. So you want, when you, when you know you're, you want to get rid of all the alcohol. So you know that like when you lean over the potty, you kind of put the, what's evaporating kind of you, you put your mouth nose over that. If it kind of burns the inside of your nose, you know that there's still alcohol burning off. And like once that sort of burning sensation comes and it's just like, okay, that smells good, then you know, you're, you're ready to go. It should be pretty dry. It should be drive basically, um, before you then start adding your stock.

Speaker 3:          01:23:32       Got It. And then how long once you had the stock, is the, this sort of cocktail, is it on like a medium feed or what's the heat?

Speaker 4:          01:23:40       Yeah. So you want it to be a nice simmer, um, uncovered simmer and you only use a wooden spoon because you don't want to damage the rice and you only want to use a Borio rice. Really important, uh, which is a nice starchy rice. So you'll get a good, a nice starchy kind of a broth. And so when you, so yeah, so you, so you just add the stock as you go. So you cook it, you know, it'll start absorbing you guys. Okay. I'll need some more. You started absorbing, you keep adding and now if you run out of stock you can finish with water. No problem. Um, uh, you know, you want to heat the water up. You don't want to put in a cold liquid into your Giotto cause that stops all the cooking process and kind of start breaking down the rights over if you do that too much

Speaker 3:          01:24:24       decided I'm going to try this this weekend because it seems like you could also, for instance with like scallops which are so deceptively easy to cook, you can kind of muck around with the risotto and if you're kind of flying by the seat of your pants and half screwing it up, since the scallops only take whenever you know, four minutes, two minutes to cook, um, you can kind of do it last minute and just drop them in.

Speaker 4:          01:24:45       Yeah. So for like if you're using the base cops, the little guy, it's like basically when you were, Zoho is basically done or just, yeah, you put them in, you just give it a stir and he'd turn it off and like they'll basically cooked through, uh, just as it settles cause you want, you'll want, so at the end, so you cook it, it's getting close whenever you're done. So like Bateman, it's basically done. Then you put in your primary John and you put it in some butter, you put in a little olive oil and you give that a good stir, you're going to want to let it just rest for a minute and it'll kind of come together. If it dries up, like when you put it on the plate, you wanted to just kind of relax onto the plate. Like you don't want to hold up and kind of a ball.

Speaker 4:          01:25:20       You don't want to run either. So you may need to add a little stock to you, make it, you know, it should feel like it's got a little soft but if not saucy, right? And, but then you can literally add whatever you want. Any kind of herbs at any flavor profile that you like. Like if I love Bazell asparagus and Zucchini, I can add that at the end. Let that basically warm up. And you guys just have a beautiful [inaudible] if you're doing scallops. I love like a lemon seafood risotto so you can add a bunch of lemon juice, a ton of lemon. Jeff possessed like lots of lemons asked, maybe Swedes have a Lennon and say shrimp and scallops and an terragon. It's a great herb for that one killer risotto. So you can, that one will impress any, any lady, m whoever, whoever asked that.

Speaker 3:          01:26:08       I'm going to try that. The Saturday. A question from Carrie Kim Minsky. Uh, what dish have you most frequently made for house guests?

Speaker 4:          01:26:18       Wow. Most this most frequently made. I don't know the answer to that to be honest with you. I mean, I love the grill. I'm a just a grill freak. It's super simple. Less dishes, uh, and biggest flavor. So I throw like PR when it's warm. I throw everything on the grill, I grill all of that. Stubbles like I, we grow eggplant, we grow where Piney, we grilled peppers, Zucchini. I just, it just all goes up there and took, it's really healthy way to cook because you're using very little. There's, you don't need much, you know, there's no heavy fats or anything. Um, and I've been doing pork chops up there, some stake, even pieces of fish depending on what it is. Shrimp. So, I dunno, I just, I just try to keep it fun and simple. I think the one thing is, it's actually kind of reminds me, I think the one other difference between home cooks and and pros is just acidity level. Like at when you think it's ready, like add another lemon. Yeah, totally. We always like pros bump up the, the, the acidity level, which is what is like one of the Sikh that's like one of the secrets. Just we add a little more acid and it makes everything taste better. Yeah. It seems,

Speaker 3:          01:27:26       it seems like pros use lemon juice is as they might use salt at the time. Yeah. Uh, what are some of the mistakes that people make with grilling?

Speaker 4:          01:27:38       Um, what do they make with grilling one? The grills not hot, so they ended up not getting very good color, um, to, I think that's the, that's the main mistake. Um, I think, uh, they also like play with food too. Like when you throw it on there, like let it go, let it get that nice color and before you start moving around, um, and um, you know, I think grills are best when you get to see her, but like if you're doing a piece of meat or even a piece of fish, letting it finish in the oven, even just for a minute or two, depending on how big your piece of, uh, of meat is, the, is the best way to do it because it, it'll cook more evenly. A lot of times if you are using a really hot grill, you'll get like a lot of well done and then like a little bit of rare or medium rare in the middle, but like the sides will be super dry and tough. So if you get a really hot grill, got a great sear, you'll lock the flavor and then you finish in the oven. And it's always the best way to do it,

Speaker 3:          01:28:34       yeah. To, to avoid the black and blue steak. Yeah. Uh, next question is from Daniel Law. Haun uh, what is the best way to systematically develop and refine your palate? And, um, I'll just, I'll modify that and say what is, what is one simple way to start systematically developing and refining your palette?

Speaker 4:          01:28:56       Wow, that's an issue in question. I've never, I've never, I've never been asked that. I think, um, I think basically just tasting everything you possibly can and really tasting it. Like, thinking about it, like breaking down the flavor and just paying attention to it. I'm smelling things. So smell is a really fundamental part of tastes way more than we realize. So I would, you know, make sure you're really smelling, touching, and tasting as much as you possibly can. Eat at restaurants, um, go to farmer's markets, um, tried things out and the more you taste like, the more you'll start understanding the subtleties and complexities. Um, like, I don't know. I don't know of a resource. I mean that's just the way I learn is like cooking and tasting things. And that's the way most chefs learn. I don't know of a resource that's like a guide to palate development. Um, I'm sure there's something out there, but I don't, I don't know of it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:51       Yeah, it's uh, it, this was a, this was a question I had to tackle for myself, um, when I was attempting to learn to cook in the beginning. So I would s I would say to Daniel, a couple of things really helped me. The first was, uh, going to restaurants, going to the same restaurant, say five days in a row. Maybe you can't do five days, but going there regularly enough on off days, like Tuesday to Thursday, Monday to Thursday to get to know the staff. I'm always keeping the menu with you when you're eating so you can, you can read along as you eat dishes. So you know what's in it, like the five or six, seven ingredients, whenever it might be a smelling your food before you eat it. It looks kind of weird, but it's smelling food before you eat it. Cause I've, I've always had chronic, well up until I started using um, kind of Sinus rinses, I had chronic sinusitis and I have a lot of trouble smelling. Um, and then, uh, last thing would be for unfamiliar ingredients that are mixed into a dish. And this is part of the reason that you would go during the week, asking them to give you a little bit on the side so that you can taste it individually before you eat it in the mix I've found and there's a, there's a fun book called the Flavor Bible also.

Speaker 4:          01:31:10       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good.

Speaker 3:          01:31:11       That is a cool book. And a lot of chefs use that to come up with unusual flavor combinations. Next question is from ads. Uh, if you had to pack the essence of life into a Burrito, what would that burrito would be like?

Speaker 4:          01:31:25       The essence of life into a Burrito? Yeah. Yeah. Meaning like what would the ingredients be? The food ingredients. Yeah. Wow. All right. Here we go. Um, okay. Uh, okay. I think I would have, you'd have, um, uh, you know, you'd have some brown rice in there for like fortitude, sustenance for like, you know, your grit and determination. Um, I would have, um, avocado, lots of avocado for like the richness, life, beauty, color, flavor, like excitement. I would have, um, would be my protein. I definitely have beans. Um, uh, I think beans are like this, you know, the see their growth. Uh, they, they, they, they harness promise for me. Hope Opera, you know, Opportunity, optimism. Um, I'd have a little, maybe a little skirt steak for strength and, um, but not a lot. Um, and I'd have a Habanero salsa for like the spice, the excitement, uh, the, you know, so the being vigorous, uh, part of what makes life so amazing. Um, and then maybe I'd let the chef throw in one other mystery ingredient, uh, to stimulate curiosity, which I think is, uh, the most important or underappreciated quality of, uh, of, of people who lives great, successful, awesome lives, which is just being curious about the world around them. So I let the, I let the chef throw a mystery, a mystery ingredient in there. How's that?

Speaker 3:          01:33:17       I love it. It looks like, looks like my cheat day on Saturday. He's going to be doing burritos. Uh, if, uh, if, uh, just two more questions. Uh, this is, this is really fun and, uh, people can certainly let us know if they want more, more. Sam, I'm sure a lot of people will be the two, two more questions for you. The first is if you could give your, let's just say, uh, give yourself advice when you were just graduating from u Chicago and what advice would that be? Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:33:52       MMM. Wow, that's a great question. Um, well if I would've given myself advice when I graduated from when I went in, I would have said study a little harder, you know, work a little harder. But I, when I, when I left, I mean, I, I think the advice that I, um, that, uh, that I live by, which it kind of holds, which is basically get out there in the world, be open to it, explore it, um, uh, be, don't, don't, don't worry about having a, a clear plan because I didn't know enough to have a clear plan. Um, and you know, follow things that I really cared about and, and, and go all in. When I, when I found some that that interests me because passion, like passions and overstated word, I mean I think passion develops. So like I was really into food and was interested in it and, and I threw myself into, into food, but I, I, it didn't become a passion so I can, you know, really combined.

Speaker 4:          01:34:52       Although I was like passionate about it, did, it wasn't a life passion until I can like combined, you know, food and nourishment with health and sustainability and politics and policy and what we're doing to really help make sure that all people can live healthy, productive, you know, awesome lives through the food that they're eating. That's what sort of became that, that passion. So I think a lot of people are like, find your passion. I think passion comes from a combination of being open, curious of really going all in when you find something that, um, that you're interested in. Um, then then that, then that goes and I, and I think always just trying to figure out how to do the right thing, you know, trying to remember why you're doing what you're doing. Um, is our kind of the lessons that I've tried to live by and, and they've, they've served well on the, you know, getting out in the world gives you a perspective on a wherever you are that I found to be transformative and um, and just the foundation of, of, of who I am. So, um, it's been, uh, it's been good.

Speaker 3:          01:35:54       No, I, I I really want to underscore something you said then I think is really important and that is just related to finding your passion. A lot of people ask me, how can I find my passion? And I think that in their mind, do they see this singular thing that is this lightening bolt that knocks them off their feet? And in my case, just like you, it was an unexpected combination of things that came together by trying a lot of things and being not having, and Mike is, it didn't have like a five or 10 year plan, but it was, uh, I will do the best I can at this, this next Gig, whatever that is, and look for doors that open. And, uh, so I don't want people to think, to feel like, and I've seen people reflect this feel like a failure because they haven't had a single activity hit them like a cupid's Arrow or whatever. Um, what if you could make one ask of the people listening to this, what would that ask be?

Speaker 4:          01:36:53       Oh, great question. Um, what we might want to ask. I think my one ask would just be too, um, to be your engaged. I think right now, uh, we're, we're suffering from lack of engagement, uh, around some of the issues that really matter. And you know, there's lots of solutions. There's lots of different ways to think about, and particularly in food, I think, you know, there's, you know, there's nothing more important than making sure our kids are getting food. I mean, we have so many hungry kids in, in, in, in the country, we're wasting so much food. We're not getting enough nourishing food and the face of climate change, there's gonna be, it's gonna be even harder to grow healthy food and produce it at an affordable, uh, at an affordable price for people. So the challenges are higher and, and allow, we're so, I mean, so engaging and caring and trying to improve the food system through the choices that we're making every day. There's a start. And I think for people who really get into, right, it's starting to translate that into and into politics and actually caring about, um, these issues in terms of who's us in Washington.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       And I think that's a, um, the politicians follow the people,

Speaker 4:          01:38:00       the end businesses follow the people. Like they try to like shape decisions and they market it, etc. But in the end, they're following. And so we need to lead. And then we're leading every single day in ways that sometimes we're aware of and sometimes we're not. And so I think that kind of awareness and engagement can have a profound impact on what companies are producing and what policies are being made. So I think that's my big ask, at least in my, in my world. But the truth is that that kind of same, uh, same principle applies to just about any issue. Um, and I think we just, the more were engaged,

Speaker 3:          01:38:37       the, the, the more democracy works. Agreed. Yeah. Give a damn people, there'll be apathetic, finds fun, something to get excited about and care about. Uh, Sam, where can people find you on the Internet? Uh, where can people find you on Twitter? I guess you're at Chef Sam Kass.

Tim This podcast is brought to you by Mizzen and main. Don't worry about the spelling. All you need to do is this. I have organized my entire life around avoiding fancy shirts because you have to iron them. You sweat through them, they smell really easily. They're a pain in the ass. Mizzen and main has given me the only shirt that I need. And what I mean by that and Kelly Starr at loves the shirts as well, is that you can trick people. They look really fancy so you can take them out to nice dinners, whatever, but they're made from athletics, sweat wicking material. So you can throw this thing into your luggage in a heap or on your kitchen table like I did recently and then pull it out, throw it on with no irony, no steaming, no nothing.

Speaker 2:          01:41:56       Walk out and you could probably wear this thing for a week straight, or make it your only dress shirt and take it on trips for weeks at a time. Never wash it. It will not smell. You will not sweat through it. You got to check these things out. So go to four hour work, week.com all spelled out for our work, week.com forward slash shirts, check it out, four hour work, week.com forward slash shirts and you'll see some of my favorite gear, including the one shirt that I've been traveling with. And until next time, thank you for listening.
