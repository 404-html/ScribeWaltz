Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism.

Speaker 2:          00:00:23       This episode is brought to you by wealth front and this is a very unique sponsor. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way, set it and forget it. Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than two and a half billion dollars under management. In fact, some of my very good friends, investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. So the question is why? Why is it so popular? Why is it unique? Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only pay pennies on the dollar for them, and this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations, bloated sales teams, et cetera. And I'll come back to that in a second. I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their advice, run with it, do it yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       You can do that or as I would, you can set it and forget it and here's why. The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't great investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax loss harvesting, rebalancing your portfolio, cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large amounts of money over longer periods of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned, since it's using software instead of retail locations, etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely impossible right off the bat, you never pay commissions or account fees for everything. They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for free. If you use my link, wealthfront.com forward slash Tim, that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.

Speaker 2:          00:02:11       Now, normally when I have a sponsor on the shows because I use them and recommend them, in this case, it's a little different. I don't use wealth front yet because I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal. They wanted to sponsor this podcast, but because of SCC regulations, companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials. So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast, but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant amount of my own money, at least for me, uh, in the team and the company itself. So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client. Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener, you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account.

Speaker 2:          00:04:01       Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where each episode it is my job to deconstruct world class performers to tease out the habits, routines, favorite books, serials, whatever it might be that you can test and apply in your own life. And this episode is an interview you've been asking for since before I started the podcast, Morgan Spurlock. He would also have been on my top 10 dream list when I was drafting up potential guests for this podcast. In the very beginning, Morgan Spurlock at Morgan Spurlock on Twitter is an Oscar nominated documentary filmmaker based in New York, which is where we did this interview in his office. He is a prolific writer, director, producer, and Human Guinea pig. His first film, which many of you will know, supersize me, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004 winning best directing honors. The film went on to win the writer's guild of America best documentary screenplay as well as Garner and Academy Award Nomination for best feature documentary.

Speaker 2:          00:04:59       Since then, he's directed, produced and distributed a ton multiple film, TV and digital projects including some that I love, arguably even more than supersize me and I enjoyed that movie a ton including the CNN series, Morgan Spurlock inside man, the FX series, 30 days and the films were in the world is a song of bin Laden, confessions of a superhero freakonomics. The greatest movie ever sold, which you talk about quite a bit in this podcast and many, many others. Morgan's latest project is a tech startup called collect, c l e c t.com. Check it out. CLE CT like collect c l e c t.com which is a community for high spending collectors with a onestop marketplace where people can browse, sell and buy collectibles of any type imaginable. And for a nerd like me, this is just heaven, Star Wars, smurfs comics, a Millennium Falcon made from motorcycle parts is one actual real example.

Speaker 2:          00:05:54       If you go to the website, you can see that imagine comic con Pinterest and Ebay with a lot more thrown into the mix and as someone who owns 10,000 poly bagged cardboard back to comic books at home. Yes, I am a Dork and this episode we cover a ton and I wanted to ask Morgan many of these questions for years we talk about how Morgan got his biggest breaks and in some cases made his own luck. We talk about tips for aspiring creators and filmmakers, how to get people to care about important issues. That is a very tough needle to thread. Favorite books, documentaries, movies, et cetera. Morgan's thoughts on the future of media and storytelling and much, much more. Before I recorded this episode, I threw up on Facebook and Twitter a request for questions for Morgan. And there were two links that popped up a couple of times that I wanted to address because it underscores a scientific literacy problem that I want to highlight.

Speaker 2:          00:06:48       So everyone listening, if you haven't read bad science by Ben Goldacre or the Appendices, which are an excerpt from that in the four hour body, you should read these. Uh, because a number of folks asked, well, why a, are there particular articles that have trouble replicating the results that Morgan had in supersize me? The first one, which is related to a teacher who lost 61 pounds using caloric restriction, but with junk food, losing weight does not apply. It is fundamentally completely a different protocol so that you can just dismiss out of hand. And then the second one was related to a study by Frederick Nystrom in Sweden. And the article that was most often cited was actually preliminary data and the preliminary data, as it turns out, just like with split testing ended up getting flipped in a lot of ways. When it got to the final results, which I tracked down and ultimately the results are as follows and this is from Skyler tanner.com but uh, it is a reprint effectively others suffered almost as much as Spurlock with one volunteer taking barely two weeks to reach the maximum 15% weight gain a lot by the ethics committee that had approved the study.

Speaker 2:          00:07:57       And it goes on to say that these results are highly individualized and this was a study that allowed exercise and I should highlight that as not what Morgan did. So again, you need to be basically scientifically literate to assess when the media spins studies to serve their own interests in the form of a headline very often. So I feel very comfortable supersize me at this point and there are some people who said it's impossible to eat 5,000 calories a day. I would beg to differ. You can eat a lot more than that on a daily basis. You could read the four hour body for more on that. With all of that said, please enjoy my wide ranging conversation with Morgan Spurlock. Morgan, welcome to the show. Thank you. I'm stoked to be here. Yeah, I'm really excited to be in your offices. Finally. I know we've had a couple of lunches, a couple of dinners over time. Yeah. And it's nice to see the operation. And I thought we were talking just before we started recording about breakfast and he said, well I don't usually have breakfast, but if it's a breakfast meeting, I can't be the guy sitting there kind of judging the other person.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       That's right. Do you get that a lot after supersize me, what happened?

Speaker 4:          00:09:00       Whenever I'm at a restaurant, people will walk by and they'll look at what I'm eating and sometimes they'll comment and so they'll look at what I'm eating and though, and you know, sometimes I'll see what's on my plate and another time

Speaker 3:          00:09:12       better than Mcdonald's. Right. And so I get it and I'm like, it's been 12 years like that. I'm going to be, that is my, I'm married to that forever. That's your thing thing. I'm all, I'm okay with that. I was at the Russian baths yesterday here just about to pull off the underwear and uh, there were two fans who walked up and they're like, Hey, trying to get four hours where the sauna in 15 minutes. And I was like, Yup, I kind of deserve that. I guess I'll be the four hour guy. And definitely, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:09:36       When somebody asks you, what do you do, how do you answer that? I say I'm a storyteller. That's what I am. I'm a professional storyteller. Where did that first start in terms of being bitten by the bug? Was there a particular experience or mentor who steered you in that direction? Yeah, I mean I made, my mom was probably the biggest one when I look back as a kid. Um, like I loved comic books. I started drawing and writing my own comic books when I was really young. Um, just in a notebook like this. Like I would make the squares draw the blocks in making your draw the characters tell the stories and uh, and so, yeah, I mean that was when I was like maybe eight or nine years old. My mom was really encouraging of that. So I think she was probably the first one.

Speaker 4:          00:10:20       And then at the same time they were, you know, it was the 70s, so the parents took you to see things you should never take kids to see in movie theaters. We didn't wear helmets on bikes, we didn't wear seat belts in cars. You pack 10 kids into the back of the cutlass and took them to baseball to cat, listen to going to baseball practice. But like, so my parents would take me to see movies like jaws, the exorcist, things you would never take a kid to see today. It's this, this, this wrong in so many levels. But um, so they were taking me see these movies, but these were the movies that made me want to make movies. Like I loved horror films. And so like the movie scanners, like when that guy's had exploded in scanners, that was the moment where I said, I have to do that, whatever that is now.

Speaker 4:          00:10:56       What was it about the head explosion was just the shock value, the ability to grab someone's attention and just the way that it looks like the for, cause when I was a kid, I originally wanted to be Rick Baker. I wanted to be Tom Savini. Like when I saw American Werewolf in London, I mean it blew my mind what great, it's a great movie and what the effects did then. And these were all practical effects from his hand growing to a snout growing. Um, there was no CGI, it was all, they was, all things that somebody made and created and figured out how to do. So that was kind of the bug that I had first. It was kind of wanting to be in that side of it. And then once I learned you could actually go to college and learn how to make movies and you know, direct movies and produce movies, I said, well that's the path I want to go on.

Speaker 4:          00:11:31       So you went to film school? I went to, I went to film school first at, at Ua. I tried to get into USC film school and I applied. I got into the broadcast journalism school, this was like in 1989. And so I said, well, I'll go to USC, I'll go there. Cause like if you're going to make moves, you've got to go to California, you got to go to Hollywood. And I grew up in West Virginia and so Hollywood was a million miles away. Good wrestling state, good rest, exact rates. They for wrestling, even, especially when they're not family members. But, um, so I went, so I went to Hollywood because I said this is where I have to be. And so every semester I would apply to film school at USC and every semester I would get rejected from film school at USC, I applied five times.

Speaker 4:          00:12:07       I still have all the rejection letters. I keep them all. I kept them all. Um, and so finally, the fifth time I was like, I can't keep putting all my eggs in this USC basket. And I was so stupid at the time. Like I wouldn't apply to UCLA just out of principle, which is so dumb when you think about it because UCLA is in such a better part of town. It's such a more beautiful cancer. You just adopted the rivalry. Israel already, like I was a Trojan through and through. I was like, I'm not going to go to UCLA. I'm not getting even apply to their film school. So I applied to Nyu and I got into Nyu and so I moved to New York and New York is so much better for me as a person. I think, I think it suits my personality much more.

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       Not to mention my skin tone because I, I'm spectacularly Pale over, but we're both on the tail end of the spectrum. How did it fit your personality? I see. I think that I grew up in a, in a place and in a family and are in a culture were you mean what you say and you say what you mean. And that's kind of how I was brought up. And I think that New York is very much a city that, you know, says what it says and means what it says and we'll tell you to your face, you know, it will stab you right in the chest and tell you like, you suck. And here's why. And his word, what we don't like about you and what you do. Whereas in a, you know, Los Angeles, it's the inverse yet is the university in la at least we'll actually sit in New York rather if it's about money, you'd know how to interact with someone and if they're blunt, it might be a brace of beliefs.

Speaker 4:          00:13:22       It saves you time and you know where you stand. At least. I know from the, I know from minute one where I stand with somebody in New York City, whereas in La you talked to somebody and the whole time they're talking to you, they're like looking over your shoulder to see who more important or more interesting might be coming into the room. That's so disconcerting. Yeah. Like life first futures to La. I was like, well, what is happening right now? Like somebody else here. What about, what about me? I got here, uh, the experience in film school. What were the most important lessons that you learned in film schools? Well, the cool thing was, I mean it didn't want you, when I was at film school, there is, it taught you the hustle. Like the thing about Nyu is you had to raise your own money for your movies.

Speaker 4:          00:14:01       You had to, you had defined by Hook or by crook anyway to make the film. So I mean that was, it was so realistic and I mean it was a much more independent mindset I think of preparing you for life after film school. Whereas at USC, like if you were in film school there, they paid for your movies and your pendant. Bird. Yeah. And they, and they own your movies like so he basically USC pays for your films then they own the films. I had no idea. Yeah. Um, cause it's kind of part of their legacy. Like people who go through the directing program, we pay for the films, but now we own Ron Howard's movie, his student film forever. Um, so I think for me it prepared me much more for what was coming next, which was the hustle. You know, what, what you have to do when you get out.

Speaker 4:          00:14:36       What was your first, uh, in your mind? Major project after film school? Um, what was my first major project after film school? I mean, and by major I mean in your own mind and my mind, I tell you that. Here's what, well, there's, there's an interesting that it had happened to me after school. So, um, I got a job, my first job was being a PA on the professional at the Lucas on film. And so it's a pretty sweet gig. It was a pretty sweet gig. And so here I was, I was 22, 23 years old and it was awesome. Like it was so exciting to get to be on this movie and kind of see him. And so I was kind of Schlepping, you know, being a PA for the next three, two to three years working on any movie I could get on.

Speaker 4:          00:15:14       So I was a pa on that movie and then I was on, I worked on woody Allen's bullets over Broadway and, um, barbay Schroeder's kiss of death. And so it was on kiss of death where, um, I got offered a job. I've got a friend of mine, a job, a girl named Sarah Casper, who I'm, I went to film school, which she produced my senior thesis film. It's one of those things where you get out of film school, you finish your thing, your senior thesis film, you're like, now I'm going to send this out to film festivals and this is going to win all kinds of awards. Hollywood's going to come calling, I'm going to get my big movie. And then none of that happened and nothing, I'm nothing happened. So you convince yourself that I'm going to finish this thing and everything's gonna Change and I'm going to get these big movie deals.

Speaker 4:          00:15:48       And of course none of that happens. The, I'm probably 2.01% that happens to everybody else. It doesn't. Um, and so I got out, you know, not that didn't happen. So I was like just hustling through you kind of inching my way up the ladder of, of production. And I got a friend of mine, a job on this movie in the casting department. She was working for a woman named Tracy Moore Maribelle who I to this day, I look at it as kind of one of my mentors cause she changed my life completely by what happened next. I'm, Sarah was casting for this job for someone to be the spokesperson for Sony Electronics. She goes, so she goes, yeah. She goes, I can send anybody in for this. You should go audition for this job. And I was like, I don't have an agent. She goes, I can send anyone, it doesn't matter.

Speaker 4:          00:16:27       And so I went downtown to pick up film from set one day, dropped it off at technicolor on my way back to the office. Um, I ran an audition for this thing and two weeks later I found out I got the job. And so everybody in the, I was like, oh my God, that's great. Congratulations. Here's the bag. See you later. Like, everybody was so happy. I was sleeping. I was like, good, get out please out. Get out of this. They get out of this movie. Um, and so over the next two and a half years, I traveled around the country working for Sony as like this carnival barker on stage like that. So they went to trade shows, they went to sporting events, they went to colleges, you name it. And they were one of the sponsors of the bud light pro beach volleyball league.

Speaker 4:          00:17:03       Yeah. So it's so it's sorta like Ron Popeil origins, like selling Sony from the state. It's a big, chose this, it was this giant tour truck that when I first went on the road with it, it was all about Sony auto sound. Like Sony had launched this big car stereo division. So it was all about getting P and I didn't have to know anything about the product. I just had to get people to come over. And so I would just like on this stage, say, come on over, check this out, blah, blah, blah. And people would come up and toward the truck and look at everything. And then the next year it became Sony playstation. Then the next year it became Sony Vio when they launched their computers. And while I'm on the road with them, my boss on this, at the time, a guy named David [inaudible] said, we need to make a video about this tour and what we're doing.

Speaker 4:          00:17:39       Um, who should we have do that? And I said, you should have me do that. I said, I went to film school, let me make that. And so I made this film for them about this. And then I made a bigger film for Sony about mini disk. And then I made bigger film about something else for them. And then probably then my biggest project that I ever did with them was there kind of ces, the consumer electronic show in like 1990 burning man for nerds. It's like burning man for nerds is exactly what it is, is it's super nerd prom. And so I made kind of their ces experience movie where you went into this theater and I mean they spent millions of dollars on it. And it was like the biggest thing I'd ever done. So the biggest thing I did out of film school, the first biggest gigantic thing I did was that wow.

Speaker 4:          00:18:16       And so, and it was so like off track of where I thought my career was going to be going or what I thought I'd be doing. But little did I know that all of those things that I was doing were ultimately putting me on a path where I am now. So this is a theme that recurs a lot in these interviews with say for instance Jamie Foxx, where these things that were seemingly unrelated to his end destination prepared and perfectly for it. Totally. And I was going to ask you a little later in our conversation about how you build rapport with people. Yeah. But let's dig into it right now. So if I watch say inside man jet love or a, you know, 30 days. Yeah. I'm consistently impressed with how you get people to embrace you from different worlds and accept you and trust you.

Speaker 4:          00:18:58       How did you develop that? Or have you always been hardwired for that? Oh, I think the biggest thing you have to do is, is you just have to listen. The minute you start listening, it's amazing how people will talk to you and how people will embrace you. We live in a culture where we don't listen to begin with. I think that's one. Um, and I think we also live in a culture and we live in a world where a lot of people aren't honest with each other and just don't kind of openly have conversations with you and, and talk about things that are hard to talk about or talk about things that may be difficult or, or hurtful, um, or potentially hurtful. And I think that if you come in to those types of moments, just, I think I'm wanting to kind of wanting to understand and wanting to understand where somebody else is coming from.

Speaker 4:          00:19:39       It doesn't have to be confrontational, it doesn't have to be ugly. Um, you can have a really honest above board conversation that is meaningful. And I think that's, so for me, I think that's the biggest thing is I, I think the best thing I do sometimes is shut up and listen. So if you had, let's just say you were teaching, went back to Nyu and you're giving a guest lecture to would be documentarians and somebody came up to you and they said, you know what, I just had some incredible opportunity. I'm actually going out this weekend to interview 10 people for my film for the first time. Yeah. I've never done this before. How do I get them to open up? Right. What would you say to them? Um, I would say first talk about things that they care about. You know, get them to talk about things that are meaningful to them in the beginning.

Speaker 4:          00:20:22       Uh, things that they like, things that they love. You don't want to go right in to like, so what's it like to have cancer? You don't want that to be the first key question. How do you want to kind of work up to this? Cause you want to, you want to have, it's it's relationship. You're building a relationship with someone over the course of a conversation and you want to have them trust you. Um, and part of what you also want to do in that conversation is offer up things that are similar and kind of where they're coming from or experiences that you've had that kind of put them in a, in a comparative level. And I think that then you kind of build up and build up and then you can start chipping away at the information you really want, but you need to take the time to build that, that relationship.

Speaker 4:          00:20:58       I think the, uh, the providing of, she lets me ruining the podcast right there with my thoughts. Okay. This is, this is cinema, audio verite, the, Ah, the advice you just in the movie theater, everyone, the advice you just gave about being, well, I'm paraphrasing here, but you're being vulnerable yourself to illicit vulnerability. It was also something that was underscored for me by a guy named Neil Strauss who's an author but wrote for rolling stone and New York Times did a lot of interviews and it's incredible how that gear shifts the entire dynamic. Yeah. Uh, why warrior poets? Why warrior poets? That's, yeah, that's the name of your company is the name of my company. And it came a few years ago by, I'll give credit where credit is due. There was a, a former assistant at the Gersh agency who's now a full agent, a guy named Sean Barclay, who right after supersize me, I went out to La to have, you know, it's like when you go out and they have the meetings, like we want you to meet all these people, the deathstar meetings with like you have already been meetings.

Speaker 4:          00:21:55       And so I'm being driven all around town, meeting with all the studios, meeting with all the folks. And so I, as I'm being driven around by then assistant Shawn Barclay, um, he were just talking about, you know, you know what I want to do, what I want, my, what, what, what are we going to do next? And by that point we'd already sold 30 days, 30 days was already going to be the thing we did after supersize me. And so we were talking about kind of the path that I want to be on and the stories I want to tell. And you know, what's important to me. And then I said I want to, I'm starting a new company. I need, I need a new name because my old company, this is, this is, I'll have a quick aside. My first company was a web company, so we started off in 2000 with a web company.

Speaker 4:          00:22:32       The idea as the bubble was exploding was I wanted to create a, a content company where we would create programming online and then spring boarded off to film or television. So we created a company called the interactive consortium. Terrible name, terrible name, but it's been, it's that interactive in the title. So it must've been something and it was a consortium of talented people that came together to tell stories. And so there was, there was a logic in my mind just to [inaudible] name was terrible, but we call herself the con for short cause we called ourself the consortium, which, and it was the con, if you look at supersize me at the beginning it says the con that's the title of Guinea, which I thought was a great name for a company. Not when you're trying to raise money, it's not a good name for a company that's not a good chasing financier's.

Speaker 4:          00:23:09       You don't want to be called the con Jd Salinger and associates and associates. And so this was, so that was the, uh, so that was the previous name of the company. I said, I want to start a new company. Um, and, and so he said, well, what about warrior poets? And I said, as a, as a big brave heart fan and as a Scotsman, I said, why? Because I, because I'm Scottish and because of Braveheart, he goes, hey, he goes, warrior poets has nothing to do with Braveheart. He goes, that's a, that is a, a phrase. It was stolen by, by Mel Gibson for the movie. He goes, warrior poets were around throughout history. Like these were people who, um, who were poets or who were musicians or who were, who were people who the masses with their wit and their in their, in their writings, their music.

Speaker 4:          00:23:49       But when time came to fight for what they believed in, they would lay down their instruments and pick up swords or pick up or pick up whatever they had to go fight or spears to go fight for what they believed in to fight for their country. And I was like, I said, that's exactly what we are. I said, we are warrior poets. Yes, that's the name. And so that's where it came from. And how do you choose your projects? Should it be more specific? How did you decide to do 30 days after? Supersize me cause I mean Bam suddenly got the iron, you know, the, the, the irons hot. Yeah. And as, and this was before we got the idea for 30 days before supersize me, he was even finished. So we were in post on the movie. Um, we said, I said, I decided we just submitted the movie to Sundance.

Speaker 4:          00:24:29       So we had even gotten into Sundance yet. We just submitted the film and I said, we should have a test screening of the movie just so we see what's happening. And cause that's what you did. You had test screenings. The studios all did it. I said, we should do what they do to be successful. We should do that. So we got clipboards cause clipboards make you look 30% more official. And we stood outside of the Angelica right up the street on the corner of house in and Broadway and we said, excuse me, is people were coming out of the movies. We like, would you like to come to the test screening of a new independent documentary and be like Ooh yes I would. That would be great. So we signed up like 50 people who came over to the gold crest screening room on the west side.

Speaker 4:          00:24:59       And it was myself and my two editors. Um, Julie, Bob and Stella went over to the screening and the 50 people watched the movie. And then after the film, this one woman stood and we came down front and we said, anybody have any questions or anything in this? One woman said, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for making this movie and showing the world finally how terrible these corporations are, that they're screwing us and they're killing us. And then a guy on the other side of the is a hold on, what, what movie did you watch? And he's like, what are you out of your mind? He says, that's not what this movie's about it all. And so they start you, you're crazy. You're crazy, you're crazy, you're crazy. So the yelling at one another and I just lean over, lean over to my editors and I'm like, this is awesome.

Speaker 4:          00:25:37       This is amazing. This is going to be, she was incredible. But it elicited this like awesome visceral reaction in people. Like it really struck a chord. And so the next day when we were back in the edit room, I said, how do we do that every, every day? How do we do that every week? Like how do we transition this into something because of the film and the film was fast. Like I got the idea for the film on Thanksgiving of 2002 and a year and a day later, the day after Thanksgiving, 2003 I got the phone call that we got into Sundance. So I mean it was fast. Wow, that's really fast. For a docket super fast. Like from, from idea to like delivery in the film festival. What happened on Thanksgiving that triggered this? I was sitting, I was sitting on my mom's couch in a spectacular trip to fan haze when a news story came on about these two girls that were suing Mcdonald's.

Speaker 4:          00:26:22       Um, and so these girls said, we're fat, we're sick and it's your fault. And I'm like, well that come on. That's crazy. Said. He's like, you're going to sue somebody for, you know, selling you food that you bought that you ate and then blame them for it. I said, how can you do that? And then a spokesperson for Mcdonald's came on and said, you can't link our food to these girls being sick. Can't link our food and these girls being obese, our food is healthy, it's nutritious, it's good for you. And I was like, well, I don't know if you could say that either. And I said, cause if it's that good for me then shouldn't I be able to eat it for 30 days straight with no side effects? And I was like, oh, that's it. That's it. And so that was the, that was the, that was the moment.

Speaker 4:          00:26:50       And then, yeah. So then a year later we got into the festival and, and so it was, we were in the edit. I said, how do we do that? How do we do that on a regular basis? And we said, let's make it a series. Let's make it a series where, and, and the original idea was it was going to be me and every episode kind of putting myself into these situations. At which point my girlfriend said, you're not going to have a girlfriend very long, cause I guess it makes me then I'm gone for six months at a time when we do that six episodes of that show. Um, but as soon as the movie exploded at Sundance and we sold it, I was on a plane to la and we sold that, we pitched that show and sold it to FX the next week. So it was a week after Sundance, we'd already sold that. So the movie wasn't even in theaters and we'd set up that show.

Speaker 2:          00:27:26       And in 30 days we, were there any particular shows or,

Speaker 5:          00:27:33       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:27:33       proposals that you weren't able to make weather with that or incitement. Was there anything that got vetoed their results there? The only thing that ever got vetoed is when we were doing the immigration episode. I wanted to have a great episode by the way. Thanks. No, I mean, I'm really proud of that really strong episode. And for me the best episodes of that show are the shows that I'm not in. Like I understand why everybody's like now the ones that you're under the best, but it's like, but that's, for me, that's not the best because the best proof of that show is people who have to defend their beliefs and when somebody has to get in there and basically to people that disagree with them or contract them to say, here's what I believe and why, and to have the courage to continue to one, you have those beliefs be questioned and also be open to kind of seeing the world in a different way.

Speaker 4:          00:28:10       It takes a tremendous amount of, of, of courage. So, I mean, I think that's the, I love those episodes, but the immigration episode, when we first came up with that, um, I wanted to go across the border and have a coyote bring me over. I said, I want to go to Mexico. And I said, and I want to come over with a bunch of illegal immigrants and who are basically sneak into the country with a coyote and show how it's done. And Big FX lawyer said, no. And I said, well, come on. I said, and then if I said, well, let's talk to the Fox lawyer. So then they went to the next person above that, the coyote being the term for someone who facilitates. That's right. So, yeah, so the, yeah, the coyotes are the guys who bring you across the border illegally. And so then I went to big Fox, his attorney in big boxes turning.

Speaker 4:          00:28:47       He was like, absolutely not. And so it was the only thing that, uh, that I really wanted to do for the show that we wouldn't, because they basically said, if I, if I, and I did, if I did it against their will and I just, cause I said, why don't we, why don't we just do it? We'll just go shoot it and we can put it in the show. And they're like, if you do that, then, you know, they're, they basically threatened it, like cancel the show and then take us off the air and not insure us. And so I said, all right, we won't do that. I got, and they're like, if you hadn't asked us, that's right. That's plausible deniability. I, you've gone and screwed both. Now you've gone and brought it up. So now it's a, I'm a real believer in that it's better to beg forgiveness than ask for permission these days. Yeah. What, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:29:24       for someone who's unfamiliar with your work, yeah. If you had to choose, say, two or three films or television episodes that you would, if you could make mandatory viewing for all Americans, what would they be? Um,

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       let's think. I mean, the supersize me, I feel like everybody's seen. So I'd be like everybody, I'm, I'm stopping to people all the time. We've seen that, which is still mind blowing to me. Um, but I think I'm in 30 days. I love the, uh, the prison episode of 30 days I think is a great episode people should watch. Um, especially as we live in a country where we're still sending people to prison and we've turned prisons into profit. Um, I think it's a, it's a, it's a great episode to watch and it will make you so angry. So I think that's, that's one. Um, I love greatest movie ever sold. I think greatest movie ever sold in just the conceit of that film is spectacular for people. Haven't seen it. I'll just give you the quick rundown. It's a movie about product placement, marketing and advertising where the whole film, it's paid for and made possible by product placement, marketing and advertising.

Speaker 4:          00:30:25       Very Meta if spectacularly matter. It's so good. Um, Mane and tail. One of my favorite sponsors of all time is they sponsored that movie for is you don't know what Mane and tail his mane and tail is a magical shampoo that it's for both horses and people. Yeah. Which I which I also love. I love it cause cause you know how many times have we all been there where we're in the shower with our horse and we say why? Why do I need to products high heart. Why is there just not one shampoo for both of us? I'll tell you, I'll tell you a quick story, which is my favorite things when we were making that movie because when I saw this I found it and you see it, you see in the film when I find this in a store, like I had no idea this existed and I find this product and I'm like it is one of the greatest days of my life that I have found this product that I'm, and you read the label and it gives you like the instructions on the back of a bottle of mane and tail are amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:31:13       Like is it tells you how old are you? Use It to watch your horse. It's ridiculous. And so I keep, so I start calling Devon Catsa Devin, who is now a very good friend and he's the president, president of the company. So I'm like calling you. I'm stalking him, trying to get him to return my call to be in the movie, to be in the movie. And finally he calls me back and he says, um, Egos. So, so just tell me, what is this movie about? Anyway, so I explained that what the movie is and he goes, so what, so how would you see us in the movie? Like how would we, because we don't pay to be in movies, you know, we don't do that, you know, so, so how would you see? And I said, okay, well here's, here's how it is. So now picture of this.

Speaker 4:          00:31:47       So it's a close up on a bottle of Mane and tail, and the camera slowly starts to pull back. And as the camera pulls back, you see me washing my little boy's hair in, the camera, pulls back a little bit more. And then you see me and we're in a bath tub and you just see me washing my hair in the bathtub and then the camera pulls back a little bit more and it pulls by more in the ECB turned to my left and I'm washing my Shetland pony and the guy goes into the phone is silent for a minute, and then he goes, that's the greatest integration I've ever heard in my life. It's amazing. He goes, oh, that's fantastic. Oh for a minute there, I thought you were gonna do something weird with the product.

Speaker 4:          00:32:24       But then he goes on to tell me, he goes on to tell me, because apparently it was in the Will Ferrell movie blades of glory. And he said, he goes, so, so I said to will, I said, listen, I just want to make sure, like you're not going to do anything like masturbate with it, are Ya? And I was like, I love it. That's where he draws the line of what's weird. We'll barrel masturbating with Mane and tail in blades of glory would be weird. Me In the bathtub with a horse. Totally fine. Totally fine. Oh my God. Yeah. It's amazing. Okay, so back to the results. So there's that movie inside man. There's so many episodes of inside man that I love the season one of inside man, we do an episode about elder care and this is on Netflix. All three seasons of inside man or on Netflix, all three seasons of in 30 days or on Netflix season one of inside man, we do an episode about uh, about elder care where I move in with my grandmother and it is for me, it's one of the most raw, honest and powerful things I've ever made.

Speaker 4:          00:33:18       Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Uh, the, the marijuana episode also a super, super strong, such a good show and it's like that Guy Steve de Angelo and what they're doing up at harborside medical in, in Oakland is phenomenal. Like, cause you go there, you have these visions of what dispensaries are going to be and everybody thinks they're like dodgy and shady and it's going to bring crime to the neighborhoods. And this place is beautiful. It looks like a health clinic and they run it like a health clinic. They have, they have a health instructors who were, there are, they have reiki instructors, they have psychiatrists that you can meet with. Not to mention all the product that you can buy there. I mean, and it's run like a proper clinic and it's phenomenal. Like that's how every clinic in America, it should be like every dispensary should be. When did you go?

Speaker 4:          00:33:58       Just since we're talking about health, I think it was the inside man, uh, when you went to Thailand Bumrungrad yeah. And Bronwyn Grad and Thailand, which is incredible facility. It's phenomenal. Would you ever w why or why not? Would you go to Butler and Grad for medical treatment yourself? I mean, I would, I would go back after being there. I had such a great experience and depending on what I had to have done, like if I had to have surgery that had real serious recuperation where I was going to be laid up for like weeks going there and having the surgery done and then knowing that I'm going to uh, be on a beach for like the next four weeks in a place, it's going to cost me a fraction. Um, I think is worth it. And uh, and I've spoken to people who since that episode had gone there for medical procedures just because they saw the show and they're like, it's half of what it was going to cost me in the states or less, you know, it's, it's remarkable.

Speaker 4:          00:34:50       Yeah. Particularly, I mean if you're doing say an elective surgery or something that doesn't have, you're not having a brain tumor treated right necessarily might not be covered or it might not be covered. Exactly. I mean, I went to Nicaragua at one point, this is when I was writing the four body and realized, wait a second, if I just do say my, my full panel of blood testing, what is considered sort of the highest end, and I don't necessarily recommend Nicaragua for everybody, but uh, while I'm there on vacation, it will pay for my vacation. Yeah, that's what she was incredible. That's right. And not only that, but they did a stat, which means for people who aren't familiar, you get your results back in 24 hours. So it was like literally turned around everything in the hospital in four or five hours. It was just phenomenal.

Speaker 4:          00:35:33       Well, that's what I love it when I was a bummer Grad, you'd get a blood test, everything's in one building. She'd get a test on downstairs and I'd go upstairs to see my next doctor and whether it was an MRI or a blood test or other, other panels they were doing, and you have your blood test. I get it done downstairs. And by the time I got upstairs, the doctor already had all the results, like in real time. They were getting the results to them because they also process the blood in the hospital. So it wasn't being sent out to a lab like they do here in the states. You didn't go down to the, what are those lab clinics that you always end up going through their own popups. Oh, Labcorp, Labcorp, labcorp. Where it's like a guy in like a basement with like, you feel like you're going to a methadone clinic.

Speaker 4:          00:36:08       It's rough. So dodgy. But it's like everything, everything in one place. And part of the reason they said why we can do it so cheaply is cause everything's under one roof. We're not kind of third partying anything. And he's like, and I'm there and I'm like, why can't we just do more of that here? Why can't that just happen here? Medical tourism, that's, I feel like I should, I should. Uh, well people go watch the episode. Can people, there we go. Episode. Yeah, they can watch it. It's a, it's a season three of inside man album run Grad U. M r u n g. R. A. D. Correct. And uh, people will be very, very impressed. It's, it's, it looks like a more seasoned, not at all. Yeah, exactly. It's not what you would expect at all. Yeah. Uh, one of the questions that came quite a bit from my fans was how do you get people to care about important issues in an environment where there's such a delusion, such a barrage of noise?

Speaker 4:          00:36:55       Yeah. How do you accomplish that? Yeah, that's a great question. Cause it's like every day we feel like, are we even doing anything they did. I'd actually are people paying attention, you know, you, you hope that you make things that will make a difference or that people will listen to or at least create some level of empathy and, and change of viewpoint for someone. And I think that, I think the hardest thing is one, getting people just to watch. So I think once you get them to watch, I think that the way that I hope people get affected is because when we tell the stories, I get affected by them. Um, once you get immersed in them, and I mean, you know this better than anyone is once you kind of get into these worlds and see it, it's a part of you forever. Like that becomes a part of your life.

Speaker 4:          00:37:32       And whether it's me going to a foreign country for medical tourism or um, you know, me was, I was doing in, in, in this past season where I'm just like eliminating toxins from my house, all these like poisons and cleaning products and stuff that we use everyday that we just don't even realize. Um, I think that, uh, I think for me it's, it's taking people on this vicarious journey with me. And so long as I am open and honest with you, then you're willing to pay attention. And I think that's a big one. Um, a friend of mine a few years ago gave some, gave me some good advice where he said, uh, he said, you can't be afraid to show your scars. He goes, that's, that's, that's what you, that's who you are. And he goes and you can't, you have to continue to stay true to that. And I think that's, it was some of the best advice I ever got.

Speaker 4:          00:38:16       What would you consider some of your scars? I think it's just being open and honest about your life. I think it's, you know, talking about the fact that, you know, I'm divorced and talking about the fact that, you know, I uh, um, you know, kind of what led to that and, and, and being open and honest about your life and the things you've experienced and not being afraid to talk about that you know, your upbringing and how that affected you. I think the more you can have those, the, that, that honesty in those relationships that you build with people, that creates a trust and it creates a trust not only with the people who watched the show, but with the people that you're talking to. If you are looking at a particular idea that you want to put force in the world or explore and it could be adapted to documentary format or television format, what are the factors that lead you to choose one or the other?

Speaker 4:          00:39:04       You mean whether it's movie or TV? That's right. I think it's about, I think it's, it's can it sustain one because there's some movies that are meant to be some ideas that are going to be movies and there's, and you see this a lot of time when you watch documentaries when 45 minutes and you're like, this should be done now as, but, but everybody wants to make a feature movie like, no, no, I'm going to make it a feature. And it's like, no, this should have been about 40 minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes. But they end up making it 75 80 and that lasts 30. You're just like, oh, it's just trudging along and it should have been over. So for us, we avoid that by never kind of putting ourselves there. And so we say this is this, there's things that are meant to be 90 minutes because they're big, big, deep explorations.

Speaker 4:          00:39:39       But especially now there's other ones that you can take to TV and I can have an even deeper exploration if I can do two to three episodes on it and therefore episodes on it, um, that are hour long. And then you can have a real deep dive into these topics. Um, I think that, uh, so for us, what, I mean this was, that's why it's great. Like I loved being a storyteller right now. I love being a content creator, being a filmmaker, a director, whatever you wanna call it, because there are places now to tell all these stories, whether it's 90 minutes or 30 minutes or 20 minutes or 10 minutes or three minutes, like we made an amazing bunch of movies, um, a few years ago, uh, called focus forward, um, that GE paid for where we basically made these three minute short films that were all about innovators around the world, people who are doing incredible things.

Speaker 4:          00:40:19       Um, and each one of these movies were three minutes long and they're powerful. They're, they're so beautiful and inspiring and now like they've seen like they'd been seemed like 100 million people around the world because it's one of those where anybody will give you around the boxing. Like anybody will give you three minutes and once you watch one, then you'll watch too. You watch three. What we saw is it whoever, if you, if you made it through one, then you watched five, the average was five, which is awesome. So going back to the guest lecture at, uh, Nyu. Yeah. So I'm going to, we're going to be calling me soon now.

Speaker 3:          00:40:49       Hey, uh, we heard the lecture. Yeah, the podcast and Tim's right. You should come to a guest lecture in Septic, the administration at Nyu. And so you have all these bright eyed bushy tailed students who are say fixated on the feature film documentary and they say, I know you say that we, we, we could do these short things but you know, really, really obsessed with this idea of doing a feature. Uh, what cat warnings or advice would you give them? And I just want to repeat one thing that you mentioned before we got started to be, we're looking at my, the audio equipment and I have here, which is very simple. It's, it's a zoom h six which h with XLR cables that plug into simple is good, simple, good. Sm 58 sure. Mikes. And we were talking about, you know, fancy every time I tried to get fancy and could they give this to you or you have a big assignment? I hope they gave no, no zoom. That

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       one's on me next time call me. Uh, the, and you said once you get fancy, fancy gets broken. That's right. And it's just such a nice mantra I think to keep in mind that could really help someone. What did, what warnings or advice would you give to aspiring documentary? Me, the biggest thing is we try to overcomplicate things. When you start making movies or even TV shows, whatever it is, you have these grandiose ideas of everything that you need and everything that has to, has to be done. And especially today, like the youtube of vacation of content creation and content consumption has shifted our, our concept of what, what it means to make something good or palatable. Um, we are infinitely more forgiving of stuff that looks dodgy for good story. You can sacrifice quality for great story. So for me it's like, it's all about the story.

Speaker 4:          00:42:19       It doesn't matter. Like I'll watch shaky camera footage now. I'll watch somebody like shitty thing on their phone. So long as it's a great story and I'm engaged because we've gotten to the point now where we are past that we're forgiving of all that. True Vadio too. Yes. Rubato like you'll, you'll so long as I can hear it and it's not just the whole time I will, I will be, I will still be forgiving of it. Um, and I think that's what I tell. I tell young filmmakers all the time, his story first, it's all about the story. It's like everything else about what you want it to be or how long you want it to be. It should be as long as it needs to be ultimately, but it's all about the story. And if you've gotten the beginning and middle and an end and you've told your core in 40 minutes or 60 minutes, then don't stretch it out because now you're just putting your, just your dressing ups on the, it doesn't need it.

Speaker 4:          00:43:00       If you wanted to give people examples or resources for masterful storytelling, there are any particular books, films, resources. For me, the best of the best resources are the movies themselves. Like, I mean I'm such a, I am such a movie freak, um, for nonfiction movies, like if you're watching nonfiction sounds like my favorite nonfiction film of all time, which kind of pushed me to seeing documentaries, excuse me, seeing documentaries. I was like a viable outlet for my creativity as I got older was, it was when I was in college, I saw the Joe Berlinger and Bruce and off ski film, Brother's keeper, brother's keeper, brother's keeper, which is one of the greatest films. Everyone, this is like, it is in New York City. As you guys can hear. This is what happens in New York. We get a train going by, you can hear everything rumbling in the office.

Speaker 4:          00:43:43       Sounds like an earthquake. It's an earthquake. Like all the glasses shaking. It'll stop in a second. This is, this is New York. Um, the, so it's a film called brother's keeper. And I saw it in a movie theater. Uh, cause I heard everybody talking about it and was like, I have to go see this film. And it was the first time I think I probably ever paid to see a movie, a documentary in a movie theater. And um, cause I, I was in film school so we were watching a lot of docs in school but never been never gonna actually where I bought a ticket. And so I bought a ticket, went to see his film and the film is so good, it's so dark and it's so creepy. And it's about these three brothers where one of them is accused, it's an upstate New York. So it's like these three country brothers where one of them is accused of murdering another one.

Speaker 4:          00:44:22       And as it goes on in the trial of the sky being brought up for murder charges, that there was like, there was like incest and it's like, I mean it gets dark and weird and so good, but that's one of his films were that there's, there was so many levels of emotion you feel when you're watching that. And it was so beautifully shot. And one a years later when I got to meet Joe and Bruce, I just, I mean I gushed over them like this movie. I was like, that movie changed my life. Like it is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen in my life and I to this day, I mean I'm still such a fan. Like when I see people, I'm a little fan boy. When I see somebody that I look up to, it's like I will go over and just like and just like cover them with fan girlness.

Speaker 4:          00:44:56       Yeah. Who else falls in that? I mean Errol Morris is a genius. Like Errol Morris, Errol Morris, who is like that guy. His the amazing, here's the thing about if you, if you go to Errol Morris Morris's website arrows, Morris is such a craftsman. Can you describe who he is and I apologize them is the Errol Morris did the fog of war. Errol Errol Morris did the thin blue line like years ago. Errol Morris was one of the guys who started putting like real dramatic produced recreation's in movies. Like when he did the thin blue line, people attack to the film. And this is crazy to think about back when he made this and whatever 80 something, they're like, this isn't a documentary. It's like you got real yet. Yet you fake get actors in there doing things. You've got stuff that you staged, you stage things in a movie that's not a documentary. And when you look at that, like the movies gorgeous but it, but it set the tone and it's like, it basically changed what we think of what a documentary could be.

Speaker 4:          00:45:46       And so, um, you know, at the same thing happened years later. I remember when I was on a panel with Al Maysles and Al Maysles, there's like right when supersize me came out and Al Maysles told me, he goes, he goes, yeah, what you do, they use what you do isn't documentary. He goes, you don't, you don't make documentaries. And I, and again, it was like there was a transformational moment, um, of I think what people's interpretation of what a dot could be was why did he say that? Because he saw it being like from a first person standpoint, he didn't see like me telling a first person story as being a documentary. Um, same thing. He didn't think Michael Moore made documentaries. Um, and so he's, so that was said that was kind of his idea. But like Errol Morris, you know, back to this amazing craftsmen, like his stuff is so beautiful and if you go to his website, like how Errol Morris like really pays the bills as he makes commercials.

Speaker 4:          00:46:30       Um, because there's not, it's not like we're going out and buying boats, making documentaries say, let's be honest. Like we don't have like a fleet of Ferraris outside. It's like you, you make these movies because you believe in them and what they represent. But if you go to his website, it's like if I, and I think it's Errol morris.com. I'm not sure if you go there. It's like, it has like all these commercials that he's made and just experiments that he does with the cameras, which is awesome. Like, and you see like how he, he will take somebody crazy commercial money and do something he's never done. And then once you tries that, he starts to apply those tricks and transplant and transplant it to his movies. And it's cool. It's so cool to see. But it's like he's a, he's a talent. Like I have mad respect for him.

Speaker 4:          00:47:03       And then there's somebody like Steve James who I think Steve James is just a great storyteller. Steve James did hoop dreams. He did Stevie, he did life itself. Um, apart from Steve James just being an epic human being, like he's a magnificent human, like I'd say all the time. Like when I grow up, I want to be Steve James because he's a, he's just a great individual who treats people well, you know, his is, you know, we'll return anybody's phone call, talks anyone, he's the last guy to leave when students are asking him questions. You know, I, I really admired that. And so there's, there's Pete, things like that that I take from people, but, but he's also a great filmmaker. You know, he really believes in what he does. And so I think when you look at his films and he's one of those guys who makes movies over years, you know, like he'll make a movie for like five, seven, eight years and, and that type of dedication I really, I really look up to.

Speaker 4:          00:47:51       That's a huge commitment. That's right. And on the, on the point of films, so do, do you still, why still make films and the reason I ask is that when we're talking about formats and say the future of media, I think about this quite a lot. There are people who say can create very, very popular blogs and then get courted by the big publishers in New York City and published books. And the book still to this day for whatever reason, occupies a unique part of mind, space and human beings. It just carries a level of Gravitas that is not associated with the Internet. Right. Quite wrongly, I think. Yeah. But people can become sort of part of the cultural zeitgeist and have a real impact with books in a way that is very difficult with something that is viewed as a femoral online. Yes. Do documentaries still have that in and maybe it's just something I perceive that difference compared to say TV or is that, am I making that up?

Speaker 4:          00:48:47       No, I mean I think that what's happened though now is there's been a couple of things that have happened. One on the heels of like Hbo and Netflix and showtime and especially Netflix where more people, I think I've seen the things I've made on Netflix than anywhere else, which is fantastic. I think that they have created a larger audience for documentaries than ever before. And I think that type of hunger is what's also starting to drive this push into smarter nonfiction television. Um, both from a Netflix standpoint and from a television standpoint. Because what happened in television is there were all of these people, all these networks, and it started with like FX. It's diverse, diverse. It was HBO who raised the Bar for scripted television, started making scripted television beyond what any of us thought was possible for TV. I mean, they just started crushing it.

Speaker 4:          00:49:28       And so then other people said, well, we should be creating that level of television. That's, I mean, when I was working with FX back in the day, John Land Graph, brilliant guy, one of the smartest PV people you'll ever meet in your life, um, said this. That's what we like. We want to be naive to HBO for, for Commercial Television. And that's what he created. Like he was the champion that made that and raise that bar for FX. And then, you know, then showtime did. And now if you look across the spectrum of TV, every network has at least one amazing show. Like USA has Mr. Robot, which is spectacular. Like every, you go down the line, everybody's got one big, big fiction show, but nobody had smart nonfiction. Everybody kind of left that down here. It was lowest common denominators. So while the rising tide lifted all the ships for fiction, it didn't happen for nonfiction.

Speaker 4:          00:50:07       And now people are realizing as, as they're abandoning ship with these all these crappy TV shows that were missing the boat. There's higher expectations from our audience and now they're starting to push that, you know, as HBO did with the Genx. And again, HBO leading the charge of Let shanks was great. It was fantastic. They said, let's show people that you can make smarter nonfiction, dark, dark, so dark. And so there was that, there was making a murderer on Netflix and now everybody's like, oh, people want to see smart non fiction. We should be doing that. Which is great for us. It's great for people like Alex. Give me, um, who's, uh, Alex give me who did smartest Enron. Smartest guys in the room. Yeah, he did the Scientology movie going clear, going clear. Oh God, another creepy one. Alex, he's, he's a great person I should talk to on the podcast.

Speaker 4:          00:50:48       He's an amazing filmmaker. And again, somebody I really look up to because I think he's, he's incredibly cerebral, very smart. That was a, I mean, the amount of data crunching and just review required to make going clear was so evident. Threat in the making. And the thing about it, and he's, he is a deep researcher and I really, I, I think he's fantastic. But, uh, but it's one of the things that for people like us who have been kind of living in the space and making this type of conduct for a long time, it's fantastic because now it just opens up and broadens the spectrum. So for me, I feel like there's still a place to make movies and, and then there's, now there's a, now there's more places to make smarter TV, which I think is really exciting. What do you think you will be few head to speculate.

Speaker 4:          00:51:31       What do you, what, what do you think you'll be creating an five or t three, five or 10 years, whichever we're, we're about to start doing some really awesome VR projects like that. It'll be this year we're going to be doing some incredible stuff. We've, we've, we've held back for, I didn't want it to kind of jump in early, um, as everybody else is kind of jumping on the Vr bandwagon. And we've been, we've been smart about what we've been navigating through and the projects that we want to make. And so that's, that's going to be something that's going to be real. And, and I think that VR has the ability to become an empathy machine. I think it has the ability to put you in places and experience things and feelings in a way you never have before. Um, so that's super exciting for me as somebody who believes that you can actually, you know, start to chip away and make the world a better place with entertainment.

Speaker 4:          00:52:14       You know, I think movies and TV shows have a profound impact on our belief system and I think that, uh, there's just something we can do there. So for me, I think that's, that's where it will be. I think we'll be doing, I mean, it's in five years probably won't be exactly five, maybe closer to 10, but there's going to be one pipe that delivers everything. There's gonna be one pipe where I watch everything, whether it's on my TV, at home, I'm on my, on my tablet, on my phone. It'll be everywhere. I mean, one pipe that feeds everything. And that's going to be an exciting time for a couple reasons because now anything I want to see is suddenly going to be right at my fingertips, wherever, whenever, wherever, I'll be able to watch anything awesome. But simultaneously you're going to be to the point of, still back to the Youtube effication of our viewing habits, where, how do now, how do you now bring eyeballs?

Speaker 4:          00:52:54       How do you let people know it's there? And I think that's the next step. You know, there were three stages of, of real shifts in entertainment that I think were big. And one of the first one really helped me because it made supersize me possible. And there was like this democratization of production, democratization of cinema where suddenly anyone with a camera and a computer and a good idea could make a movie that was huge. So now suddenly everybody had access to the tools. Um, you could put in the sweat equity, you can make something really cheaply and easily get it out for the world to see. Next was kind of this democratization of distribution where now I didn't need to have, you know, Sony or or, or paramount put out a movie and a movie theater. I can put it online now. Anybody in the world could have access to my content, you know, via youtube or via Vimeo.

Speaker 4:          00:53:34       But now how do you get people to see it? That's the problem. So it's out there, but it's invisible. Now comes the next big step, which will be huge as the pipelines converge, which is almost like this democratization of curation, this democratization of marketing, how to now we point people towards what matters and that's where it's going to be. Influencers are gonna be people like you. It's going to be people like me who people trust and those voices are going to be even more resonant as we move forward because people are going to trust in them even with even more, I think importance

Speaker 2:          00:54:05       here. Here. Yeah, I agree. I was a VR skeptic until I had a demo with the HTC vive running valve software in Seattle where I was fully kitted out and in maybe a 20 by 20 foot space and where you can walk around, we can walk around else come up yet. Oh God. And what, just what struck me as someone who for a long, long time listeners to this podcast know, maybe I may or may not have dabbled in various types of plant medicine or other molecules, the time distortion that I experienced in that immersive Vr, which is still model t by comparison looking towards say what's going to exist three years from now. Yeah. I thought I was in for five or six. No, no. I thought I was in for five or six minutes and I was in for almost 25 minutes. Wow. And I, that's when I was like, okay, there is something really fundamental going on. Yeah. And you said this empathy machine, I mean, just like the simulacrum and uh, the ability to elicit emotion is so far beyond anything coming from a flat screen. That's right. It was just mind blowing. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:55:13       It was just that I was just at Google this past week and meeting with their VR guys and seeing some of the stuff they're working on and you, it's like you're in the matrix. Like suddenly it's like, it's the closest thing I could imagine to suddenly being neo and taking the pill and being thrust into the machine that, that, that I could. And it's, I mean, what's coming is incredibly exciting. Yeah. And it just as and as a and as a content creator and as a storyteller to it just makes you realize we've barely begun to scratch the surface of what's possible. Like it is, as you said, it's a model t like it is so early and it's, that excites me. Like we've always been a very early adopter of technology. I, you know, we've always been, we've always tried to be a little ahead of the curve and, and what we use the tools we use to tell stories. And so for me, I think this is going to be incredible.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       Which filmmakers out there do you feel are pushing the envelope in terms of technology or innovations in the space? Because I know Vibey for instance like James Cameron and his cameras phenomena. I mean James Cameron I think

Speaker 4:          00:56:06       invented the camera that he used on the last movie. Like it was him and his partner created the pace camera and camera to use on Avatar. Like they changed the whole box that made that movie. It's bonkers. He invented the technology that created like the, the the, what was it like the chrome, the chrome cop in terminator two because, no, but everybody's like we can't do this. And He's like I'll fund it myself. And what's, what's so cool about that? Creating like a storm to basically do that technology. Which a correct me if I'm wrong, cause you'd be the person to correct me. That the abyss, which I enjoyed but was not, I understand the commercial success is where he honed that technology that later enabled him to, to create the use it in terminator two. That's exactly right. Which is such an awesome story.

Speaker 4:          00:56:47       And it was out of that yet cause it was out of that where he, that's where he got the idea of what could happen with this other character. And what it could be. And He poured all his own money into making that a reality, which I love. I mean, I'm somebody who fly. I mean, I'm a real believer that you should always bet on yourself first and pre. When we made supersize me, I remember I was, uh, because this was right when we sold our, showed MTV the first show we created online when, you know, from the interactive consortium when we had that company, because here's the con. So when we created the first show we created under the con was a show called, I bet you will. And so we sold that show to CBS and then to MTV and then nine 11 happened.

Speaker 4:          00:57:19       So we had proof of concept, we proved that we create, could create programming online in spring boarded off. So we created the first show to really go from the web to television as a series sold at the MTV. Then nine 11 happened. Everything stopped. Like production just came to a stand still in New York City. So we had no money. I was evicted from my apartment. I was sleeping in a hammock in my office that was so that's, so every morning I would get up and go to the gym around the corner, The New York sports club to like shower and workout. I was in great shape because it says I didn't have a choice. Um, and that would come back to my office and we had, I still have people coming to work and to make sure that they could pay their rent and pay their bills.

Speaker 4:          00:57:50       I took out credit cards and so I was basically paying their rent with credit cards. I was paying their bills with credit cards. I was paying credit cards with credit cards and I amassed about a quarter of a million dollars in credit card debt, um, in, in about a year. Wow. And so, but I still had an office and I still had a business and I was like, I'm not, as, I was like, you know, I'm, I'm still betting on us. And so that's when MTV green with the series and we did 53 episodes of that show. And during that time I paid off like $50,000 worth of that debt. And then when they cancelled it, I had another 50 grand in the bank. And I was like, well, I can either pour this $50,000 into that bottomless pit of debt or we can make a movie because we owned all the equipment.

Speaker 4:          00:58:25       Again, is the same thing. We had the cameras, we have the computers, let's make a film. And that film was supersize me and it changed everything. Oh Wow. Yeah. So I, so that's why I mean like James Cameras, when those people that I really look at and admire because he will always bet on him and he'll always bet on his ability. If you haven't read the New Yorker article about James Cameron when he was making, um, when he was making Avatar, not only is he a genius, but he also is a bit of a bully and says like some terrible things to people who work for him. There's some of the greatest lines that you'll ever hear him say to human beings, which there's a guy who's like rigging lights. Um, and he says to the guy, and he goes watching you lights, like watching a monkey fuck a football.

Speaker 4:          00:59:01       And he yells to another guy, he's like, hiring you is like firing too good men. It's like, ouch. Some of the lines are phenomenal. It's like I read that and I worked with, but he was a thing. But it's like, I mean, pardon me is, he may be saying this and I worked with a guy years ago, um, a guy named gene Licht who ran a printing shop back when I was in college and worked for, I worked for gene through a friend of mine at Nyu, um, who worked there, ran the print shop. And so I would go to this print shop and gene was one of those guys who would basically yell and scream at the top of his lungs and say terrible insulting things that I thought. I thought it was spectacularly funny and really entertaining and um, and so for me, but I also think he did it in jest to be funny, even though he was mean about it.

Speaker 4:          00:59:42       But he was also saying it in jest also. Make other people laugh, which I feel like James Cameron is doing the same thing, but it's a, so gene, you know, rest in peace. He was a, he was a phenomenal guy. James, uh, this is a quick side note. I remember it down the podcast. He hasn't, I would love to do with him. I've met him once. I went on the zero gravity like zero g flight where the the like the payload was ridiculous. I mean if we're really fortunate the plane didn't go down cause it was like Elon Musk, James Cameron, like you go down the list. It was nuts. Amazing. And uh, I had a chance to get some schwag advertise Schwag because it was a, it was uh, I, I obviously I paid for the flight and brought a reader along actually who want some type of competition I'd thrown.

Speaker 4:          01:00:24       And we all got tee shirts that had been given to the staff, uh, and the crew working on Avatar. And this shirt was great. The shirt said, and I might be getting this slightly wrong, but it was in huge font right across the check and it's a chest. It said, hope is not a strategy, luck is not a factor. Failure is not an option. Hyphen James Cameron. It was like, wow. It's like setting the tone, setting the tone for production. And I wore that shirt when I was reading the four hour body, which just about killed me literally and figuratively. But one experience. Yeah. And it's, you know, it's like, is there anybody, you know, who is that exacting and forward thinking? Who is it brutal in some respect? I mean I think, no, cause, pardon me, it feels like you have to be so steadfast in your belief.

Speaker 4:          01:01:15       You have to go to, if you don't drink the Koolaid, nobody drinks the Kool aid. Um, I mean it's got to be, who's the other person that's probably in that, in that same type of state? Like Kanye is Kanye there and I meet Connie is probably aren't even a different level than like James Cameron, but, but comparable I think and kind of maybe a mega, mega maniacal way. Um, but I think that, uh, I think you have to, you have to believe in you first. Toray um, the, who's the, he's a great writer. I'm commentator. Uh, was, did, he told me the story where he went to Connie's house once. And so he's in Connie's house and inside Connie's house there's a big giant poster of Kanye, like right inside the living room. And so it's a Tory said to him, he goes, um, he goes, Kanye, why do you have a giant picture of you on the wall? And he goes, well, I got to cheer for me before anyone else can cheer for me. And I was like, there's some fantastic logic and that's actually a good response. Good logic. I don't know if I can stomach the grief. I would get for putting a huge, like Tim Ferris posters herself, like Burt Reynolds centerfold,

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       kind of. And if you've ever seen white chicks, there's this one, Terry crews. I don't know if my friends will let me get away with that. Well, as you come into my office and there's like, there's like posters of the films that I've made the wall. So it's like those are my, that's my guess. My con you moment. Got to cheer for yourself first. I know we only have a few more minutes. Sure. Just a couple more questions and then hopefully we'll do a round two sometime. But the, I'm not going to go through all my usual rapidfire questions, but one I would love to ask is what is the book that you have gifted most to other people?

Speaker 4:          01:02:51       Oh, um, I tell you what though, there was a, I gave the Bhagavad Gita to a lot of people. Um, yeah, this was right after, I guess it would have been right after my son was born. And then right after I got divorced, somebody gave it to me. Andy and I got a lot out of it. And then again, it's, there's been multiple, multiple interpretations, multiple writings of it. Um, um, but, uh, there was one in particular interpretation. I can't remember who the writer was. Um, the guy who basically did this, this translation, but I gave that book to, I don't know, a couple dozen people

Speaker 3:          01:03:25       who they like. Yeah. I'm just like, tell him I'm having a hard time right now. I don't know what to do. And I was like, you should read this book. This is one of these books that has come up so many times in my life that I have not yet read. So this might be the final I'm going to, I'm going to send you, I'm going to send you the translation that I read. Cool. Yeah, I appreciate it. It's, it's kind of like the tout ditching. It's like I put it off for, I didn't put it off. It just never took the step to read it for decades and decades. Cool. This is good. This is a nudge that I need. And, uh, we, we talked about technology earlier. You have a lot of irons in the fire. Would you like to tell people about what you're up to in, in the tech space? Um,

Speaker 4:          01:04:00       yeah, so we, uh, this is, this is a great thing. I was just out at Jason Calacanis launch in San Francisco where we give it, we had a, we had a company that had been in his incubator slash accelerator for the last four months called collect. And this is a company that you can go to it, you can go to [inaudible] dot com where you can download the apps in the iTunes store, but it's a, it's a, a company that is held as you would expect l e c t got. Yeah. Yeah. So it's the whole genesis of this and what it is. It's basically like a geek collectible marketplace. So anything that is geek, anything that you would imagine at comicon that you love from, you know, walking dead to whatever, you know, posters to action figures, whatever those geeky things you love. Vinyl. Like I collect a lot of, a lot of like uh, um, like vinyl characters, characters made by pop artists.

Speaker 4:          01:04:45       So anything, no matter what it is, is that you can like find it on collect. And so I was being chased by, I was finishing a movie in London and the founder of the company, this Guy Steve Bromwell was chasing me, chasing me, chasing me. And he finally said a, and I said, what is it? He goes, you're the only person that's going to get this. Like you'll understand in a couple of years ago, I made a movie with Stanley and Joss Wheaton about comicon. And then two years before that I made the Simpsons 20th anniversary special for Fox. Like, so I'm, I'm like a geek to core into my core. Um, and so I said, what does it show it to me? So he showed me just like a flip deck of what it was. And I was like, I love this. And so we sat down, we talked about the company I came on board is one of the, one of the founders early on, um, put money into the company.

Speaker 4:          01:05:23       And it's one of those where I just, I believe in this like of the, what is it to think? It's $18 billion a year that's spent on Ebay. A third of that 6 billion is everything that lives within this Keke space. So I think there's a great place to give people a better experience where you can actually have a geek too, geek experience. So there's a, there's kind of a great social atmosphere to it. Um, but then there's also the ability to buy, to sell, to trade with fellow geeks and, and you know, feel like you're actually getting something you love because that's, that's awesome. Do you have any particular favorite categories or items that you've seen on the site? Oh my gosh, there's so much fan art. Like there's so much stuff that people create on their own, which is awesome. And so I love seeing the stuff that people draw on their own posters.

Speaker 4:          01:06:02       They create a, it's, it's spectacular. So for me, I love seeing things like that. Um, I love the people who have stuff that's still in the original packaging that's been on their shelves since like 19. Some people have like original star wars toys from like when you and I were kids, it's still in original packaging and like that's, that is dedication. A lot of decades. A lot of self control to, even when I was a little kid, I still have all my old stuff like original star wars toys. Yeah. But like the heads are not on the hands always got chewed off because it was a little animal. Yeah. Like I still have, like I have my original Darth Vader carry case that's in my kid's room with that I wouldn't let him play with for years until like last year when I knew he wouldn't totally like junk all the toys.

Speaker 4:          01:06:38       So now he can actually play with the action figures. So Click C l e c t.com. Correct. Yeah. And so, uh, yeah, we just went through, we just went through like our, our kind of seed round. It's, it's, it's exciting. It's a cool thing. And it's like I love having had my first startup, which I started, you know what it was that 16 years ago and was going around and doing all the angel meetings back then. I mean for me it was exciting to kind of be back in that space. And it is, it is a very similar hustle to raising money for movies. Um, you're just talking to, I think a lot smarter people like with the people that live and breathe in that space are blue or people who pretend to be.

Speaker 3:          01:07:09       That's right. That's true. That's true. You meet, you meet a lot of them as well.

Speaker 4:          01:07:15       Okay. Last, last question before we wrap for this. This round one is if you could put a billboard anywhere with anything on it, not an advertisement necessarily for anything you're doing, what would you put on it? Um, oh. I feel like right now it has to, it would have to be a, has to be something Trump related. Right now I just, I would, I would have to have something with like his, with his tiny little hands and remind people what that means when he gets to the White House. Do you want these little hands on the button?

Speaker 3:          01:07:42       I feel like I want to be, do you want these puckered lips yelling at foreign dignitaries? Do all these little hands on the button. Oh, please. God,

Speaker 4:          01:07:54       it's, it's becoming for reals right now. It's, it's unbelievable. Yeah. I mean, I'm in all, I'm speechless. I'm absolutely speech. I feel like, I feel like it's, I, it is, it takes a lot to make Morgan Spurlock speechless, but I feel like I'm in the middle of a reality show. You're watching. It's like, how is this actually happening?

Speaker 3:          01:08:10       I don't understand all this is happening. Oh, good golly, Miss Molly. Yes, it was, dude, these are, these are scary, desperate and surreal times that we live in. A, where can people find you on line? Learn more about you. Say Hello on social, on Facebook, on, which is just, you know me, it's a Morgan Spurlock. Then on, on Twitter at Morgan Spurlock. Uh, Instagram's at Morgan Spurlock NYC. Um, snapchat. You'll be able to track me down. I'm all over. I'm all over the, all over the social media, all over the interwebs. So the interweb which do you tend to eat? What is your primary, would you, if I'm on Twitter all the time because Twitter has become my newsfeed, like Twitter is my AP exactly. Like I'm on Twitter all day long and it's just constant updates. I use it in the same way. Yeah. And I love that. It's like, it is a constant new source.

Speaker 3:          01:08:55       Um, we're, I'll check in to other newspapers along the day. Like, you know, y'all check in with the times and, or like, you know, talking points memo or, or the New York Post or whatever. Cause New York post is spectacular and you have to, um, but I feel better, but it'd be like the Twitter I'm, I'm on, I'm on on Twitter all day long, five like eight, nine, 12 times at Morgan Sperlock at Morgan Spurlock. And uh, I'll give you just since we're talking about tech, one tip that I found really useful, which is a service called Nuzzel and use the z e l, uh, made by friend of mine, which effectively looks for patterns among the people you follow. And it will take, say the top five stories that are being spread and pushed out by the people you already follow. That's awesome. Create a digest for you that smart. So it's a really, really cool service that I'm surprised Twitter didn't make itself. You're saying I should stop following Kim Kardashians?

Speaker 6:          01:09:46       Well it depends. Yeah, it depends on who else you're following. I guess you might want to stop calling all of the Kardashians. That's right.

Speaker 6:          01:12:14       this episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way, set it and forget it. Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than two and a half a billion dollars under management. In fact, some of my very good friends, investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. So the question is why? Why is it so popular? Why is it unique? Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only pay pennies on the dollar for them. And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations, bloated sales teams, et cetera. And I'll come back to that in a second. I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you at and if you just want to take their advice, run with it, do it yourself.

Speaker 6:          01:13:09       You can do that or as I would, you can set it and forget it. Here's why. The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't. Great investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax loss harvesting, rebalancing your portfolio, cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large amounts of money over longer periods of time. Wealth Front, as I mentioned, since it's using software instead of retail locations, etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely impossible right off the bat. You never pay commissions or account fees for everything. They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for free. If you use my link, wealthfront.com forward slash Tim, that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.

Speaker 6:          01:14:03       Now, normally when I have a sponsor on this show is because I use them and recommend them. In this case, it's a little different. I don't use wealth front yet because I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal. They wanted to sponsor this podcast, but because of sec regulations, companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials. So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast, but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant amount of my own money, at least for me, uh, in the team and the company itself. So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client. Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener, you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account. But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you. Take two minutes, fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash. Tim, it's fast, it's free. There's no downside that I can think of. Just take a look, see what portfolio they would create for you, and you can use that information however you want. wealthfront.com forward slash Tim and until next time, thank you for listening.
