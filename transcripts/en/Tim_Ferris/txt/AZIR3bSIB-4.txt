But if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim, that's m, e e, u n d, I e s.com, forward slash Tim, you can see all of the underwear that I've been wearing.

Speaker 2:          00:01:09       There's some pretty ridiculous ones. And, uh, I will also highlight my favorite, you'll probably be able to guess which it is. These underwear made from micro model, which is extruded from Austrian beechwood trees in the Alps. Yes. Fancy. And it's two times softer than cotton, scientifically tested using the collar bottom method developed in Kyoto. And you know, those Japanese very crafty. And, uh, I will say a few things. Number one, if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim, you get to see all of these spectacular underwear that I've been wearing and I am a bit of an underwear connoisseur, socks, fashion, sense with sweat pants, not so much underwear. I understand. So check them out. And if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim, you will also be able to see lots of hot ladies wearing me undies, female underwear. And that's just a lot of goodness for both the men and the women out there.

The world class performance range from hedge fund managers to actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger, to people like General Stanley McChrystal to chess prodigies and everyone in between. And in this case we have a business icon, none other than the oracle of Silicon Valley.

Speaker 2:          00:03:49       That's Reid Hoffman. He's referred to as the Oracle Silicon Valley by a lot of tech insiders who look at his company building and investing track record, which includes for instance, well of course paypal, linkedin, but then Facebook, airbnb, flicker and on and on with awe and rightly so. Read is co founder and executive chairman of Linkedin, which has more than the 300 million users. Before that he was executive vice president at paypal which was purchased by Ebay for one point $5 billion. There he was nicknamed firefighter in chief by the CEO who is Peter Teal who's also been on this podcast noted venture capitalists. David Z says of Reed. He is arguably the most successful angel investor in the last decade or past decade and they're both now partners at Greylock partners. He has a track record to envy and in this podcast he is joined by a friend. He's joined by Michael McCollough, MD who's also co founder of questbridge.org and a successful investor of his own right with training as an er physician.

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       Michael is political professor at UCF and previously served as the on call er physician for the Dalai Lama. Michael is also a road scholar, Kauffman fellow and a showcase a fellow. He is an avid meditator and is particularly interested in investing in technologies and companies pertaining to the mind. So we bounced around a lot in this conversation. We covered a ton including how Reid met Mark Zuckerberg for the first time and how he decided to invest in Facebook, lots behind that firefighting and started beyond using board games to develop strategy reads view of what Uber has done well and what they could improve upon. Some of read suggested philosophers for entrepreneurs, we talk about going off algorithm per se in the Er to manage life and death decisions, the three types of Ceos and much, much more. It is a very dense, intense and useful episode and of course we discuss questbridge as reading and I are both on the advisory board.

Speaker 2:          00:05:42       Questbridge guys have to check it out. [inaudible] dot org currently supplies more exceptional low income talent, meaning kids to top universities than all other nonprofits combined. Questbridge has created a single standardized college application that's accepted by 36 or so top universities like Stanford, MIT, Amherst and Yale. This allows them to do some very, very clever and innovative things such as giveaway laptops and the giveaway forms, double his college applications. This offers scholarships to many kids who might otherwise not even think of college. So if you want to break the cycle of poverty, questbridge is easily one of the most fascinating, effective and highly leveraged tools I've ever seen. So check it out. [inaudible] dot org we will talk more about that. So please check out the show notes. There are a lot of cool show notes for this episode, four hour workweek all spelled out.

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       And uh, you can find a lot more there about everything that we talk about. So without further ado, please enjoy this conversation with the Oracle Silicon Valley, Reid Hoffman and Michael McCullough read. Michael, welcome to the show. Great to be here. Thank you for having us, Tim. I'm thrilled. I'm really excited to have you guys on and I know you've both known each other for some time and I was thinking about the commonalities that, that you might have the common threads and uh, we'll, we'll certainly come back to this, but I had heard Peter Teal had said, have you read that you are the firefighter in chief at paypal? And I think that, uh, Michael certainly based on our conversations at least certainly is exhibited tremendous firefighting qualities. So we'll come back to that. But I thought we could begin with just some basic context for folks and, uh, repress. We could start with you. When people ask you the question, what do you do? How do you answer that?

Speaker 3:          00:07:38       Well, there's a short answer and the long answer, the short answer is I'm an entrepreneur and investor. That's what I want to be very quick and move through the question. The long answer is I essentially a build design and improve human ecosystems through software, either as a creator or as a, uh, an ester and partner. And what that means is everything from, you know, things like paypal to Linkedin, to airbnb. Each of these things are ways that you craft how people find each other, how they interact with each other, how they establish their identity and how they make progress in their lives. And that's part of what I mean by building and improving human ecosystems.

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       I love it. Uh, Michael, what, what about yourself? You, you wear many hats, but how would you answer that question and

Speaker 4:          00:08:27       these days? Yeah, I'd say it's probably pretty similar. I'm, I'm uh, uh, I create and I help people create things, uh, uh, entrepreneurial investor as well. But I'm an er physician by training and actually began my life in, in reverse from most people kind of creating a non profits actually first. So I made eight nonprofits before my first accompany, including like angel investments and things like, you know, heartflow and such. And I'm, uh, currently a partner at, I can remember going to healthcare

Speaker 2:          00:08:58       and, uh, that's, uh, I'd love to bridge just on the medical side of things. Uh, Michael, you'd a very, uh, difficult beginning so to speak. And that is going way back to birth. I was, I was hoping you could just give us a brief description of your experience at birth. Sure.

Speaker 4:          00:09:18       It's interesting how sometimes small little slips from like an intern or like a resident can alter your life. Where I was eight weeks premature, uh, with, uh, uh, twin birth. And, um, basically it's a little too hard on my head and it hemorrhage and it was missed for nine years, so I couldn't speak much until I was about in high school. I couldn't speak as fluent as I am now till I was in my thirties. And even even like right now I have it like a speech impediment device kind of like they have in the king's s uh, uh, speech movie, always speak in accents if I need to speak more fluently. Uh, so, uh, for me I learned how like watch people a lot when I was younger cause it was harder for me to interact with them kind of properly.

Speaker 2:          00:09:56       Got It. And, uh, the as, as the lines, uh, for both of you started converging and, uh, but before you met Reid, you went to, as I understand it, a somewhat unconventional high school in Vermont, I think it was the Putney school where you farm to Maple Syrup and drove oxen. Uh, what did you, what did you take from that experience that stuck with you, if anything?

Speaker 3:          00:10:20       Well, I was actually a, uh, at the time, you know, it's funny, it's kind of was your older, each decade you look back on your life and you actually in fact have a different view of your early decades. So if you'd asked me 10, 20 years ago, it's like, well, it's completely off track. I've become a technologist and entrepreneur or none of that stuff was actually a directly relevant to now when I kind of look back at it. And I said, well, actually in fact it was very grounding. Um, I had experiences, there are everything from black smithing to actually a bunch of artistic things. Um, I had, you know, kind of some intensity around cross country speed skiing and sports and all of that actually I think helped me understand the breadth of human condition. You know, typically, um, silicon valley entrepreneurs and, and, and, uh, investors and, and technologists tend to be very narrow focus. And I actually think it's helped me keep a broader focus, uh, as I think about kind of what it is to be human and how do we increase our humanity.

Speaker 2:          00:11:26       And I might be skipping ahead a little bit, but do you have then a sympathetic ear for say, nontechnical founders who come in without technical chops a or how do you look at that?

Speaker 3:          00:11:41       Well, so I um, it depends on the project. Um, some pro or depth of technology. Usually when I talked to a non technical founder who wants to create something, I, the very second and third piece of advice I give them is to find a technical cofounder. Uh, because you know, it's not, you know, it's not so easy to just say, oh, well I'm going to hire some engineers and some remote location to build the APP that I think of because actually in fact, you have to be much more detailed, much more specific about how it's evolving. And so if you're building technology and you don't at least have a, uh, a good tech technical cofounder, you have a problem. Now that being said, there's a number of, of businesses that, um, the technology is only one compete. It's an important piece, but it's only one piece. Like airbnb for example. You know, Nate's very technical, but Brian and Joe, our design folks, their product folks, there are folks, um, they both, you know, kind of, uh, coming out of [inaudible] and so, and actually that helps fundamentally with the airbnb product. And so it isn't that you then, it isn't that everybody in a founding team has to be technical, but if you're doing the technology thing, at least one of you does.

Speaker 2:          00:12:55       Right. No, that makes perfect sense. Where did philosophy enter the picture for you? Because I know a lot of people in Silicon Valley think of you in part as a philosopher, a at least a thinker along those lines. Ha. How did you become interested in philosophy and why?

Speaker 3:          00:13:11       Well, it's funny actually and very, uh, I'd say one of the small critiques of Silicon Valley is it, this may actually speak more to you than the people of Silicon Valley. A very few people in Silicon Valley interface with me as a philosopher. It takes up another thinker, like you would actually ask that question. But, um, the way that I got to it is I did my undergraduate at Stanford University in, along with Michael and, um, my undergraduate degree was called symbolic systems, which is in short speak cognitive science and artificial intelligence. And, uh, I've always actually been very interested in kind of what makes us uniquely human and, and, uh, and that's continued throughout my entire arc of my career in childhood. And so then it was like the scientific study of, of thought and language. But then what I realized when I was at Stanford is that actually in fact, even though we were trying to be scientific about what it is to be intelligent about what it is to communicate about what it is to have a point of view on the world, um, the science hadn't really gotten there yet. And actually in fact, uh, I should experiment with philosophy to figure out the, the whether or not the, the, the rudiments of understanding these things I could get out of philosophy in order to pursue a more scientific view of intelligence. And so, uh, because the modern analytics, a view on philosophy is it's pre science. It's like how you think about things with precision. Uh, uh, and then science births out of philosophy. And so I went to Oxford in order to, uh, study philosophy.

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       Are you currently drawn to any particular schools of philosophy or philosophers in the context, say recommending someone who has never been exposed to philosophy or fuels that they haven't? Uh, what, what starting points might you suggest?

Speaker 3:          00:15:00       Well, one of the things that I, uh, the papers that I read at, cause it's a, you'd, when you do a course, you read a subject, one of them was that can shine. And so, uh, one of the things I actually frequently, uh, refer people to when they're thinking about kind of how do we think of ourselves as, as, as, as sharing a world as talking to each other about it as understanding it. A matter of fact, I recently, when I was explaining a theory on Bitcoin, uh, to some fellow technologist, I said, look, it's like a can Justinian language game, right? That the notion of how you play it. And they're like, okay, how do I understand that? I'm like, okay, well here's some good books on Vic can shine and here's a couple of points. Right? Um, but it is, that would be the one that I would probably start with just because I think he is one of the, you know, um, one of the fundamental philosophers who is still being understood because the, the, the, the, the kind of one of the bedrocks of modern analytic philosophy is to think of of if you're trying to talk to someone else about some problem and you trying to make progress, how do you make language as positive and instrument as possible?

Speaker 3:          00:16:15       And what are the ways that language can work and what are the ways that language doesn't work? And so for example, on that, on that thread, when I wrote my thesis in Oxford, it was on thought experiments because most philosophers actually in fact analyze and argue through thought experiments. And there's actually more limitations in the methodology then, at least many belief.

Speaker 2:          00:16:36       No, it's, it's uh, I find language just an endlessly fascinating topic because you, you'll find, I mean, silicon valley and elsewhere, people will debate say the existence of God without ever defining, uh, what God is for each of the parties involved. So Michael, well, you and I have spoken about, I suppose philosophical topics a lot about meditation. Uh, and, uh, I think people gravitate towards say religion or philosophy respectively to too often face the prospect of death or mortality. I would love you to elaborate if you could, uh, about going off algorithm in the Er and what that means because I've had some fascinating conversations with you about this and I was hoping you might be able to just explain that and give a few examples. Sure. Well, I, I think, I think algorithms protect a lot of people,

Speaker 4:          00:17:32       particularly from, um, if physicians aren't being fully attentive or on top of all the literature, but in within a bell curve there that might be ways to save people or even improve people's lives that, that in kind of the standard operating procedures. So like I had a patient one time who came in with headed to a burns and, and you can look at him and you would know once you intubate him and have him in the ICU, he, he wouldn't possibly actually wake up again. But he was lucid enough and I thought, you know, I don't want to call a few people before I had to go to sleep. So I gave him my cell phone to you as much to their chagrin of, and the people in the room, um, better make a few calls. But even even there, like I had to stop them from making additional calls but he got to call a few people. Uh, he had begun to swell as airway shirt, so I had to make sure I could intubate on kind of the first try or, or a pub would have lost my job. But um,

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       and by intubate you may get a tube down his trachea. Yeah, completely closed. Yeah. Cause if you in

Speaker 4:          00:18:40       inhale hot air, then you're, the, the soft tissue in, in your kind of, your mouth will swell up and you won't be able to breathe. Now in, in, in his case, it didn't change outcome that much cause he was either going to a die in the er or in the ICU. So, so I thought enabling him to make kind of a human, a connection ahead of the ICU would be, would be helpful.

Speaker 2:          00:19:04       And now in, in uh, in your experience then when you look at the, let's just define maybe the use of the word algorithm. So is it, is it, is it fair to say that in this context one could think of an algorithm as a mandatory checklist, which also excludes certain options? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:19:23       I think a few, and I think a tool, a guanine work and other shows, a checklist is profoundly helpful. Checklist Manifesto. Yeah, it's really good book. And, and even things like washing your hands between patients with things as simple as that will save water lives. However, sometimes you do know everything on the checklist and sometimes there are things you can do that aren't on the checklist that actually ought to be done. So, um, example was also that, um, I had a patient who, um, in our ear or they have a policy of making sure they call their donor network after the patients actually passed away to see if they can with the permission of the family and the, to the patient, um, help with us, uh, skin transportation or like a cornea. But they became confused to think, well, that means you then you shouldn't call earlier to talk about the heart or the liver and things like that. So in that particular case, in an algorithm or a policy, actually, um, make people not appreciate the more important organs to kind of think about too. So, uh, have answered your, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:20:42       no, no, you have and I just, when we've had dinner before and um, I'd love for you to describe if you could, and it's a, it was, it was fascinating for me to hear and your, your description of this, but what is it like to, and I know we're bouncing around a bit, but to stare into someone's eyes or to look into their eyes as they pass from alive, not alive. Maybe

Speaker 5:          00:21:11       having that happen a few times. And it's interesting cause it often depends on the emotional state of, of the patient, right? So if the patient is afraid

Speaker 4:          00:21:20       you're trying to give comfort to them is they're dying and, and other times patients die and they're giving you a sense of peace and kind of universality that that would be hard to, uh, pay for kind of a depth of understanding that they are dying and you know, this is kind of the moment of their death. And so, um, it, it's an honor to be there or either way to either like witness it happening from a person who is a content with it or to comfort and hope the hand of someone who's not.

Speaker 2:          00:21:51       And uh, in that type of context or just in general, what in your mind separates a good er physician from a great er physician? What are the great people have, do or not do that the, that the good, uh, lack,

Speaker 5:          00:22:07       yeah, I think a good or for this and it's thorough. You know, they make sure they don't like needlessly missed anything. We're not like, you know, wash their hands between the patients. I think, um, if you are layer on to that and that you actually care about the patient, you know, you, you like to like laugh could be alcoholic or to make, um, or to help the dorm in the first trimester of her pregnancy feel comfort that she is, you, you're likely not to lose her child. But even if she does, it wouldn't interfere with her being able to get pregnant in the future again. And so you could either pay attention to say the odds that, that she'd lose this particular pregnancy or to make sure to reassure her what she's actually worried about is, you know, will I ever have an infant, will ever have a family? And I think, um, like, like a lot of people don't know that a third of all pregnancies are actually lost. And that's normal for humans. Every animal has like a normal weight of like losing one. And that's a known a pregnancy. So it's lacking more like half. And yet, since we no longer live in a tribes with other people, we hide the fact of losing an infant in the first trimester. So if you don't take the extra time to a comfort people, sometimes they think they're normal when they actually are not. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:23:35       No, that makes perfect sense. I don't think that applies to therapy of all different types. I mean, outside of the context of an emergency room, the uh, the firefighting that I mentioned earlier, uh, read it. My understanding was that you had, you were many, many different hats and uh, had the, the, the role of interacting with a lot of external entities when at paypal, whether that was regulatory or the credit card processors, maybe that's not the right description of them, but, uh, what makes a good entrepreneurial firefighter in a context like that? Or what, what did your coworkers feel made you good at that?

Speaker 3:          00:24:18       Well, the most to relevant factors where Peter Teal, who was the CEO feeling when I was good and solving the problems, uh, everything else was, was a secondary to those two considerations. I mean the, um, on the firefighting side, I mean, paypal had, uh, perhaps the most, um, the most kind of a parallel thing to, you know, to date myself a little bit like a star wars, you know, flying into the trench and trying to actually hit the target and a lot of different ways you could, you could fail. And, and so in, in, in the paypal case, for me, a lot of that was, um, uh, building an understanding of what each particular problem particularly throughout was, what the key moving a variable was and then being able to solve that and then propagate that out to all of the places. So, you know, for example, one of the, um, the kind of challenges that Peter handed to me was, um, we had thought that paypal might be a bank.

Speaker 3:          00:25:31       And so we had started the process of applying for a banking license. Then what we discovered and decided upon inference was that actually in fact, banking regulation is so fierce in terms of not innovating, not building new things. It would be very difficult to build a new company on that basis. So I essentially had to move to, um, to go persuade the regulators that it was okay. That even though we had applied for a banking license, right, uh, that we, it was okay that we were not going to be a bank and that and that it wasn't a tell that was we'll just inconvenient for us or anything else. And, and to give to full color to this, the, the, the basic statement about whether or not a, a, a company as a bank starts with the claim. You accept deposits, which obviously if anyone has, has exposure to paypal, they said, well, you could frame what paypal does as accepting deposits, right?

Speaker 3:          00:26:32       You know, uh, why is it you're not a bank? And so that would be the kind of challenge, uh, that was handed to me. And then what you had to do is you had to figure out for this, uh, problem, which could kill the company. What were the key moving variables, learn them, talk to really smart people and then solve that problem so that it was then fundamentally part of the cornerstone of what you are doing. A, and it ranged from relationship with Ebay to visa and mastercard to international. Right. And we just, uh, just a very long list of things. And um, and each one, the, the, the, the, the looking at the problem had to be reframed. It was almost like building a kind of a, a view of the world. And then what are the key moving parts in order to get right in order to make people succeed.

Speaker 3:          00:27:21       And when you were defining the moving variables, uh, is that a list of the unknowns that where you need to go seek out information or is it, uh, how, how would you go about putting together that list? Well, it kind of starts with a, what is the end result that you want to have happen? So for example, uh, and, uh, like in regulatory one, the key thing is that, uh, you can't, regulators will never tell you that they can't, that that is not their job to regulate you because there's no interest on that for that. Well, they will simply do is say, oh, actually, in fact, there's nothing for me here to actively regulate. They won't tell you, I won't, you know, you're outside of my scope. They'll go, ah, okay, fine. You now seem like you're an okay. Like I don't need to actually regulate you because you're not in my positive probate.

Speaker 3:          00:28:13       And so you say, okay, how did you get that state of affairs and how do you propagate that? And then you start working back from that to say, okay, well how would they make their judgments? What are their key considerations? Uh, how can I learn about that? Who would I need to know? Cause those were some of the unknowns come in. Uh, what are the kinds of things that would get them to say, okay, uh, you're, you're, you're, uh, I think you're being reasonable and within my per view of how, of how I am out to help govern society, help tech to consumers, uh, help protect other entities. Uh, you're good by me and that, and then you, then you work back from that is the, essentially the way you do it. And how did you learn how to do that? Uh, were, were you part of a debate team?

Speaker 3:          00:29:03       You studied negotiation? Did you work at a State Fair for the summers? I mean, how did you develop the ability to, the ability to not only deconstruct a problem like that, but then to interface with all these various stakeholders at the table? I think the most fundamental was I, uh, I dunno if, if you're, uh, audience, uh, knows what this is a, you probably do as a child, I played a lot of Avalon hill board games. Uh, and each board game is actually a complex set of rules and circumstances. And essentially as you're analyzing each one of them, you kind of look back from, okay, these goals mean that these are the kinds of moving parts and how do you do it? So it was actually in fact my childhood gaming for being able to build a model of what a game was. That was the, essentially the fundamental thing that informs, you know, my strategic sense. Um, because this all comes out of strategy.

Speaker 2:          00:30:03       And if, if you were giving advice to say someone leaving Stanford Undergrad and they had, they had no gaming background, how might, what would you recommend they do to try to develop a strategic ability? We're thinking,

Speaker 3:          00:30:20       well, um, you know, there's a lot of different paths to it. Most people think they're better at strategy than they are. Um, and so you really have to actually really hold up a very clear, you have to have a very deep self awareness of am I in fact really good at it? Because like having an idea or saying like for example, you said, well I'll just do this. Well one move, a real strategy is actually built up off a, you know, what are your competitors doing? What is their mindset? What are their assets? How are they going to move, how you're going to move, what are your, uh, what are your edges? What's the way that you could make that work? How is it when they're playing against you, you can still play to win. Um, so games are very good way to do that.

Speaker 3:          00:31:04       And getting a lot of different exposure to computer games cause computer, you know, AI strategies are usually not that interesting but against other people is very useful. I think it's also useful to read some, uh, which I did as a child, you know, military strategy, some zoo von Clausewitz, other sorts of folks, more modern folks. And to think about kind of like what are the set of principles that when you're thinking about how to, how to win a game that's in, in contention in conflict. And then a lot of people also of course have some, um, sports knowledge on this too. Although one of the things, it's frequently a little limiting on sports is that, uh, the sports game that a person tends to, they tend to be like, I play soccer, I played football, I played basketball. And then they have a very deep sense of what the strategy is there.

Speaker 3:          00:31:57       But they haven't played enough different kinds of games and have different circumstances. You know, it's um, uh, it's like understanding like, well, what happens if I change these four rules in basketball? Right, right. How would you play the strategy now, you know, totally that that's the kind of thing because actually in fact, most of the circumstances you find yourself in actually, in fact, you have to figure out what is the current game look like and how do you play that. Uh, and that's of course also by the way, the reason why frequently, um, you know, companies rise and fall is because they learned to play one game, they got good at it and then the marketplace changes and now it's a new kind of game and you have to adjust the playing that new game. And that's actually in fact a part of recognizing when a strategy applies.

Speaker 2:          00:32:45       Absolutely. Yeah, it'd been, I was just having a conversation with someone about the rise and fall of Codec, um, yesterday. And of course this is sort of the, the disruptive theme that one encounters so much in silicon valley. I, um, I, I, I wasn't planning on asking this, but I'd be so curious to hear, given your experience with regulatory risk and so on, what, what do you feel, uh, if you have an opinion Uber has done well and what could they have, uh, executed more effectively or strategically?

Speaker 3:          00:33:18       So what they've done well is essentially quickly deploying their product so that it's clear that there's a bunch of people who are benefiting from it. Uh, both consumers and drivers, uh, in various circumstances. So that there is an ecosystem of people by what you go look, see, we can actually add a lot of positive to the system. I think that's been kind of one of the things that they've done most positively within it. On the negative side, you know, the company tends to be very combative and you know, when you actually think about the mental space in which regulators, um, tend to operate, they tend to have gone into that job because they view themselves as protectors of important groups in society, whether they're consumers or workers or other folks. And so they don't tend to respond very well. It's not a competitive game with them.

Speaker 3:          00:34:13       It's not you bulldoze through them or over them. They're actually in fact what what they want is they want to know that their, their concerns are being answered. And it's frustrating of course for the company because you know, the regulators are being triggered by you know, a competitive interests like, you know, taxi cab companies and other kinds of things, which I want the world to stay only exactly as it is, which is not actually good for anyone to just say, you know, the way that we had to run is the way that we were running in the 1950s and that's the way we're going to be running in 3000. You know, that's obviously not a very good idea. So actually in fact, innovation and change and the pushback as frustrating. But nevertheless, when you're interfacing with the regulators, uh, you have to interface with them with the understanding that there, that may be conservative, they may be slow to change and maybe risk averse, but their goal is a mission of protecting society. And she should interface with them on that channel more than on the just get out of my way. I'm innovating all right, and treat you like I treat a competitor. Uh, and that's, that's, that creates a lot of unnecessary friction.

Speaker 2:          00:35:16       Right. No, that makes sense. You are of course, considered a company builder. Uh, you've had a integral part in building some massive successes, but you're also very well regarded as an investor. And, uh, I would love if you could tell the story of getting introduced to mark Zuckerberg and how you decided to be one

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       of the first investors in Facebook. Well, actually I could have told you I was interested in investing in Facebook even before, um, Mark Zuckerberg. I track the product. I thought it was extremely well done. Uh, when I tracked it, it, you know, he and his cofounders, Dustin, Chris and others, uh, or, uh, in, uh, Boston, you know, going to Harvard. Right. And so I want to ask too much about it. I was, angel investing is too much of a hassle as a venture capitalist. I probably would have flown out there, but I was like, it was an angel, too much of a hassle. And so I kind of went, oh, that's cool. And then went back to it and then I got this call from Sean Parker who I'd known from his work at Plaxo and you know, it was a good product and venture and good systems thinker on these things.

Speaker 3:          00:36:24       And Sean's had a, I've just met, um, uh, these really good guys, you know, Mark Zuckerberg and others who are doing this thing on Facebook that I'm joining. That's really awesome. And I'm like, oh, that's really cool. You moving to Boston? And he's like, no, no, they're here. And I'm like, oh, that's interesting. He's like, yeah, and we're looking for it. That's when I'm like, I would definitely like to meet with them. Um, you know, I'm super interested in this. Uh, I tend to think, and one of the things I said, which is I think totally, you know, even though it's probably the most expensive economic decision I've made in my life, um, but it all in a good outcome. I said, look, you know, when I did, when I led the series a in French or a, I got a lot of pushback on am I having my cake and eating it too.

Speaker 3:          00:37:03       Cause even though I don't see any conflict between Friendster and Linkedin, you know, it just generated all this stuff. And part of having integrity and having, you know, a high sense of ethics is not just having it but also making some work to appear to have it. So actually I think we should do is we should have Peter a lead there. Peter Teal lead the round and I'll follow because then Peter can be the board member. And even though I'm super interested in this, I think that's probably the best thing to happen. And so, um, my actually very first meeting was Zuckerberg was at Peter teals office, uh, uh, with Sean there who I'd known and with, um, with, uh, CSEC. And then Matt Cohler was there as well. And who was working for me at the time. And, uh, that was our very first meeting. But you know, uh, basically the meeting was very confirmatory because they'd already seen the product, already know the product, what are the amazing, already seen it having traction.

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       Um, and, and really what I learned from the, from the meeting, which is hardly a surprise, especially now in retrospect, was the Zuckerberg extremely smart, very much of a learning machine. Uh, very good at, uh, um, you know, the evolution of technologies. Um, and so, but I'd already more or less was positive, you know, if he'd said, I don't want to meet with you, but when you want to put in money, I probably would have put in money anyway. Right. And, uh, did you, what was the, what was mark Pincus his role at that, at that point or his involvement with Facebook? Uh, well, it actually, so the way mark had also, Pincus had also known Sean Parker back from Napster days. Um, uh, pig us had done a, an early startup called freeloader. But a part of actually how mark got involved in the Facebook investment was separately mark and I had bought a patent called the six degrees.

Speaker 3:          00:38:50       Pat Seems has some number which describes the viral expansion of a system. And, uh, and you know, again, kind of on the, on the AEC space, this, I went, look, mark and I are partners on this. We're actually trying to protect all these new web 2.0 viral companies. That's our principal goal in this patent in, in going and buying this patent. But you know, um, uh, you know, given that Facebook's also in this, I should act in fact a split the investment with mark, uh, because, uh, you know, basically, um, uh, it's part of being a good partner with him. And so that's part of how mark now, he also had known Shawn Parker and Shawn had talked to him about it as well. So there's, there's a bunch of different things, but that's fundamentally how pink is also became a, a series a investor in Facebook.

Speaker 2:          00:39:40       Got It. And on the, on the, um, the decision, or maybe it's not related at all, but the um, the suggestion that Peter Lead the round, uh, it's the impression of some people that, that you have actively decided in the past not to be, to take the CEO role yourself. Uh, and do you, have you sort of proactively made decisions in your life to avoid being a, to taking the CEO role or, or having it for a long period of time and if so, why is that the case or is that a misperception?

Speaker 3:          00:40:17       Well, there's kind of three different CEO jobs at levels of scale and the organization as CEO jobs of, call it 10 20 50% organizations or CEO jobs have, you know, hundreds to, you know, like 150 to 500 people organizations and then their CEO jobs have, you know, over 500 people, like a thousand or thousands. I've always known that I'm fundamentally not really interested in the CEO job that the large scale CEO job, when you're doing the large scale CEO job, your primary responsibility, you have to invite me the strategy. You have to think about the things the right way, but you're probably problem primary thing is the organization, you know, having the right or a culture, having the right structure, the organization, the right people in it, the right way of hiring new people, the right way of empowering them, even though you're making kind of strategic decisions.

Speaker 3:          00:41:07       And there are people like Jeff Wiener who are completely awesome at that and I rather help them rather than being doing that, uh, personally. Then you get to the other to see our job. So you get to the mid stage CEO job, I'm okay doing that. It's not the thing I'm most passionate about. I actually prefer to work on, you know, product a strategies, firefighting things, um, uh, business strategies, uh, problem solutions. I'm thinking about how to reconceptualize strategy the entire business and either myself or we're working with people on that, but I'll do that in order to make it work. And then in the early stages, I'm actually pretty perfectly comfortable doing it. It's not necessarily a job that I say I walk, I must do it. But being the CEO of a 10, 20, 50, you know, even up to 100% organization, I can do that just fine because then you're still all kind of working on the same problem.

Speaker 3:          00:42:04       It's less about how you build the org. Obviously you have to build a very strong team, but it's less about like, okay, how do we take the org from a hundred people to a thousand people? It's actually much more um, uh, like, okay, how do we just solve these key problems and that stuff I like to do. So it isn't really a, a specific don't want the CEO job except in the very large scale. What it is is, uh, m I am, I am only interested in the CEO job as it's instrumental to something serious that I want to accomplish. And then as that organization grows, wants not to be the CEO. And you've had some experience, uh, searching for Ceos, uh, what should founders remember when looking for someone to replace themselves or things as you keep in mind? Well. So the first thing is generally speaking, founders should try to go, like I'm still very active at linkedin.

Speaker 3:          00:42:59       Uh, should, she'll to try to go the entire course of the company to the degree to which they're passionate and can be useful. And companies are always stronger with founders, more in the more connected and committed to it. Um, but that being said, sometimes you go, look, my great skill set is, you know, a product or migrate Skillset is evangelism or migrate skill set is, you know, something other than building the scale organization, in which case the fundamental way you look at it is, and then so the, the formal way that silicon valley used to look at it, which is, I wrote an essay about this, it's published on my linkedin influencer posts and all my, my sight, you know, Reid hoffman.org. But the funnel, the way that Silicon Valley used to look at this is like you bring in gray hair and executive a person with management scale.

Speaker 3:          00:43:46       And by that you want those skills. But actually in fact, I think what you're, what you're, who you're bringing in as a founder, as you're bringing in a lake later stage co founder and you bringing in a later stage cofounder, ideally who has scale skills, who knows how to build scale organizations is passionate about this one. You know, has their identity as closely tied or, or, or nearly as closely tied to the organization as you do. It's, it's this specific mission is something that they really care about. They're not just like, oh, I'm a hired gun, but actually in fact, I'm a missionary on this as well. And, and then someone who would partner with you very well, and that's actually what you're looking for. And so, uh, that's part of, you know, the reason why Jeff Wiener has been so successful linkedin is because, you know, he cares about not just scale organizations, but how do you transform people's careers?

Speaker 3:          00:44:36       How do you demonstrate you can be doing compassionate business and the compassionate management is a high performing a culture of a company. Uh, how do you have people who are, who have a culture of, we make ourselves significantly better every year? Um, you know, how do you bring all of that? That's part of what he actually really cares about, which links, which, you know, uh, which, uh, is deeply tied to the linkedin mission. Uh, and so he cares what the organization, he cares about the way he manages and cares about the product at all as a, uh, essentially a later stage cofounder. And that's the kind of thing that you, uh, you should be thinking about when you're a founder and you're thinking, okay, it's time for me to bring in a nother person as a CEO.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       Thank you. Michael. I, you mentioned accents a little earlier and, uh, that you use accents in the Er often. And I know you've mentioned to me before southern is best and I was hoping you can elaborate on that because

Speaker 5:          00:45:39       do you reckon struggle? But, um, no one, when I hit my head injury as a kid and brain surgery is, uh, in the fourth, fifth grade, yours like looking for like ways to be more fluent. So, uh, in speeches I talk like I'm a European, it's a good accent for speaking, but if I'm in the year I took a gun from Alabama, Georgia cause it's a good accent for sick people. You can almost like yell at them, they don't think you're mad. So it's, you can kind of raise the volume of someone who is hearing impaired pretty loud. They don't make him mad at him and it keeps the nurses also kind of humorously enter attained as well.

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       And how has the er experience or the skills developed or exhibited there translated to the other things that you've done in the nonprofits or, or in the fall for profit? Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:46:30       investment world. The Er particular has helped a lot with my investing cause most of the specialties interface with the Er and enabled me to like reach into like ophthalmology or a cardiology and invest it in things like heartflow. Um, I can just pick up the phone and speak to an eventual to hearts tuitions and things like that. So, um, I think from a decision making capacity, it, it teaches you the importance of actually making a decision because you don't always have all the information you need, but the stakes are high. So I think there's a lot of entrepreneurial kind of a crossover there that can also be helpful,

Speaker 2:          00:47:11       right? Making important decisions with incomplete information. Well,

Speaker 5:          00:47:15       well, what also just the importance of having actually a made a decision as well, right? Because if you're always kind of like waffling, it's uh, something, you know, nothing actually happened.

Speaker 2:          00:47:25       And you and I have talked a lot about meditation, but more broadly speaking, the people listening are very interested in morning habits and morning routines. So I'd love to ask you guys the same question. Let's start with you Michael. Uh, what does the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like and what time does it start? If we could get into specifics, that would be great.

Speaker 5:          00:47:47       Sure. More recently, many I, I, I used to fight at this kind of hour and a half awake in the middle of the night thing between two sleep cycle's not kind of actually just kind of get up and do like probably half an hour to an hour. But I committed Taishan between like three and 4:00 AM in the morning or foreign five and that then hence me half an hour of real clarity after that to kind of think about kind of my day and how I'd like to end up using it.

Speaker 2:          00:48:15       And what type of meditation do you practice?

Speaker 5:          00:48:18       Uh, there, there are concentration and mindfulness techniques that you can use it a pretty common I think rather than talk about the type of, I do, I think a lot of the debate between types of meditations, kind of like the debate of kinds of like weight lifting people do. And I think the important thing is that you actually dislike, you know, lift the weights. Right. So, um, I, I'm not convinced any one type of mindfulness training is the superior to another, but clearly almost anyone would be superior to actually not actually doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:48:51       Do you have any opinion of neurofeedback?

Speaker 5:          00:48:56       I think generally, even as an investor, I think there's beginning to be a commercial break down between the interface of um, the brain and you see these, the EEG feedback pieces of equipment I think, or not, not quite as far along now as they should be, but I think you're certainly seeing some nursing applications with people better taking, uh, the interface with the mind out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science and such. And I think, um, uh, there even like a prep high schools who are doing a controlled experiments on mindfulness to see how it affects homer Kendo performance and things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:49:39       Yeah, no, definitely an Adam Gazzaley who was also in this podcast at UCF is too, except really interesting work with uh, iPad based or tablet based games for quantifying um, progress in meditation and mindfulness up read. What about yourself? What are your morning rituals look like? In an ideal day, assuming you have control of your morning, uh, the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day, what, what does, what does that, what does that look like if you had your sort of optimal recipe?

Speaker 6:          00:50:09       Well, I dunno or not, but, um, and I also don't know how it interesting is, but you know, most of my days are pretty packed, uh, because of, you know, responsibilities to Greylock responsibilities, the linkedin portfolio companies as much well things. So where my morning tends to be most highly tuned to is what does a creative problem that I've identified. Uh, either they like as something that I was like, okay, I want to work on this. I want to think about this, the night, the day before that, before. It's like, this is a key thing that I want to think about a product design, a strategy, a solution to a problem that one of my portfolio companies just looking at the, that sort of thing, uh, or I need to solve this thing creatively for a meeting I'm having later today. Like, I'm, uh, we're making a decision at Greylock to invest in something.

Speaker 6:          00:51:00       Uh, you know, a team is going to be pitching me or there's gonna be some kind of business development relationship between linkedin or another of my portfolio companies. And so the very first thing I do when I get up, uh, almost always is to actually sit down and work on that problem because that's when I'm freshest. Um, I'm not distracted by like phone calls and, and responses to things and so forth. So I'll, I'll, I'll actually, it's the most Tabula Rasa kind of blanks like moment that I have. And so I used that to maximize my creativity on a, on a particular project. I'll do you usually do it before I shower has frequently, like if I go into the shower, then I'll continue to think about it as I'm doing it, but I'll get it all fired up. Uh, ideally I would have 60 minutes for that.

Speaker 6:          00:51:49       Some mornings I do a frequently, it's like around 30, um, just because of the press of the day. And then, uh, the next things that kinda round out of it's only 30, um, or a combination of a quick triage three email to see if there's anything that's a, uh, an emergency that's or kind of something that's temporarily or otherwise important, uh, that I need to get on right away. Uh, and then, uh, frequently, um, most of my, during the workweek I almost always have a business breakfast. Uh, on some project could be anything from a nonprofit, you know, like Mozilla to a portfolio company or uh, just a general meeting with someone who's been recommended to me. Uh, and then on the drive to that breakfast, um, frequently I'll do a call. That's kind of one cause it's one of those, uh, usually, uh, the days are so packed with meetings at some of the, the, the, the, it's the typically the only real phone time I have.

Speaker 6:          00:52:51       And so if there's someone I need to talk to a that is not co located, that's usually when I called them. Got It. And when you're working on that first creative problem, is that something that you've put in a notebook the night before? Is it on a laptop? How are you storing these problems and then working on them. Um, so we'll either be most commonly, cause you know, I kind of grew up where I was thinking by using a pen and paper. Uh, most commonly I will a sketch to few things, thought about a few things. Uh, it will be a salt know and usually it's

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       in the notion of how do you solve this problem? Like a little bit back to the thing where you're talking about is like setting up that framework, like a strategy, you know, within a strategy of the game. What are the kind of key things that you know, might be constraints on a solution or might be the attributes of a solution and what are tools or assets I might have. Because part of what I'm trying to do is I actually think, you know, Mo, most of our thinking of course it's subconscious, is part of what I'm trying to do is allow the fact that we have this kind of a relaxation, rejuvenation period and sleeping, uh, to essentially possibly bubble up the, the thoughts and solutions to it. And so when I woken up, not only am I kind of Tabula Rasa, but I'm also, uh, possibly primed for that. And so then no, that's the way I do it.

Speaker 2:          00:54:20       Yeah, no, that makes perfect sense. You've said before, read that your network is your mentor and that you learn from everyone in your network. I'd love to just tick off a couple of names of people I believe, you know, and here the first thing that comes to mind in terms of what you learn or have learned from them. Uh, you mentioned earlier the CEO of Airbnb, Brian Chesky. Uh, what would, what's the first thing that comes to mind there,

Speaker 3:          00:54:44       Brian? Um, uh, one of the things I paid that I thought was an excellent focus from him is that he, if he calls us seven star design, which is, you know, most review systems are, uh, you know, go to five stars. And so seven stars was a thinking about the design at a much broader scope. But the precise way of thinking about it is what he came to realize that airbnb is not just an online product. It's not just the, uh, marketplace, a website, but it's actually the whole entire experience that you have of going to the room or apartment of checking in, of staying there and of leaving. And how do you actually, in fact, uh, best design within your abilities of doing a peer to peer marketplace, that entire experience. And so the way the, the, the, the placeholder he uses for that is this thinking of seven star design, which is thinking through each step of the experience. And so I thought it was a highly instructive and something I know a use myself use when I talk to other people because, um, uh, our product isn't just, the website isn't just the mobile application. It's the way that people are embedded in the environment when they're using it. And you should think through that as much. You can, even though you may have some very limited ability to control other aspects of it.

Speaker 2:          00:56:06       Hmm. Or shape. And, uh, what about, uh, one of your partners at Greylock, John Lilly?

Speaker 3:          00:56:13       So John is about as deep and interesting as a technologist. You get a foreign investor, he puts together of both

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       the aspects of being very deeply technical about platforms. I mean, he was the CEO of Mozilla growing it to being 20% of web browsers with also kind of a design experience. Like he is a consulting professor at the Stanford School of design. And so for me, you know, part of the thing that, uh, I get from John and I've learned from John is to think about the intersection of kind of user design with deep technology and how, for example, design patterns then shape deep technology patterns and kind of the, a set of different questions that you'd ask about, look, what's the structure of the design space and does that inform the structure of your technology space? Um, and so we talk about a whole wide variety of technologies, but those are the kinds of, of mental and strategy and thinking patterns that I've gotten honed to a fine edge from John.

Speaker 6:          00:57:19       Also a hilarious guy. Very, yes. Sharp sense of humor. Yes. What about your former coworker now SpaceX, Tesla founder, Elon Musk. So Ilan obviously super smart, obviously relentless, uh, obviously thinking, you know, like for example, the, the, the, the old phrase, the sky's the limit. That's too short free lawn, right? You know, Mars and beyond. Um, uh, the thing that I most learned from Ilan is actually in fact, um, that so previous to Elan's amazing successes with a Tesla and SpaceX and solar city, uh, I had come to learn that, uh, that part of the business strategy is to solve the simplest and easiest, most valuable problem. And it actually in fact, part of doing strategies to solve the easiest problem. So part of the reason why you work in software and bits is that they, that Adams are actually very difficult. You have, uh, sometimes real material, you know, product development, risk, inventory, risk, material science, you know, all these things that makes Adam products harder.

Speaker 6:          00:58:29       And so if you can work in the bits products, it's a lot more valuable at scales more quickly and so forth. And all of that's true in terms of the fact that, that it wasn't, that that lesson I'd learned was false, but what Ilan taught me was actually in fact, if you have a very deep vision for something, you're relentless and you choose something that really matters, that the competitors are in fact really weak. Right? Right. Like there are not actually in fact, like for example, you know, all of the rocket contractors, um, we're mostly focused on how do they milk government contracts, not on how do they build new propulsion systems, not on how do they take advantage of the last couple of decades of, of actual progress. Um, and so that actually gave him a, uh, as, uh, it's a very hard challenge. What he's done is extremely compelling and, and you know, very few people could pull it off, but that gives you a sufficient window even when you're taking on a hard problem. And that's actually one of the things I learned from Ilan

Speaker 2:          00:59:30       and Juliana. kiva.org chairwoman. Yup. What would you, what would you say to that?

Speaker 6:          00:59:38       So Julie, um, now I knew this already, but, um, but Julie is a very good model for this, which is that you can have someone who is a, a worldclass entrepreneur, uh, Cirelli experience with it is a general learner, has done enterprise, uh, companies, uh, has transitioned to thinking about open source, um, uh, and was one of the early kind of people of how to apply open source of things, can also go and thoroughly apply all of those things into a, not just the for profit world, not just her own companies, not just her angel investments, not just her work with areas kind of incubators and others, but also into the nonprofit world. And where it's one of the things when you say, you know, we have a tendency and in Silicon Valley to say, you know, entrepreneurs are heroes. Um, but you know, one of the things I think is truly heroic and awesome about what, uh, Julie has done is, hey, look, I can take all these skills I can take my entire life only just building economics and, and, and, and enterprise businesses and other kinds of businesses.

Speaker 6:          01:00:52       But actually, in fact, when I begin to think about how do I scale and how do I change the nature of humanity and human ecosystems, I'm going to take my technology skills and apply them to philanthropic projects with the same kind of scale, with the same kind of impulse. And I'll put real time into it. I'm not just going to talk about it and, uh, and I'm going to do it with, you know, the full set of skills that a worldclass entrepreneur does. And so, you know, I've seen, I've taken heart and inspiration from Julie about, uh, the value of, of diving in and getting your hands dirty on projects that are outside of the commercial side for, uh, that are really ones that you can actually in fact get to massive scale.

Speaker 2:          01:01:38       And, uh, last last for this list a US Senator Cory Booker, who I actually met for the first time at an event that you co hosted. So thank you for that. But, uh, what, what have you learned or admired, uh, as it relates to Corey? Well, it's a, Corey is I think a great civic.

Speaker 6:          01:01:59       Um, he, uh, you know, is a entrepreneurial and bold himself when he's was the mayor of Newark. He lived in the housing projects in order to know what the experience was in order to be able to be, to understand, you know, kind of how does he maximize the happiness and the economic potential

Speaker 3:          01:02:19       and the, and solve the problems of the people that he is there to help, you know, help as a mayor. And then as a senator, uh, part of what I have found him to be practically unique in, in like, or the leading edge. There's, there are a few others, um, uh, who I think also do this, but he does, he's the, the leading edge of I get that there's silicon valley's creating all this kind of interesting technology. Um, and I get that there's these really powerful commercial models and want to learn from them. But when Corey comes out to silicon valley, of course he has the interest that every politician does, which is, you know, raising money and there's a bunch of money in order to inform political campaigns. But he's first, second, and third questions aren't about how do I get you to give me a check?

Speaker 3:          01:03:07       It's how do I learn from you in order to solve a problem that's critical for the American people and in particular, critical for the people who may be being left out, uh, but all people as well. And so, you know, whether I'd, his focus is on, you know, we have a really serious problem with mass incarceration or whether the, the challenges, um, you know, what do we do? Um, in order to, you know, kind of have a good foreign policy, you know, any of these questions he starts with, what do I learn from you that can then help me figure out how to help us be better, uh, as a, as a country. And, and then of course, you know, when you, you know, if he ends up with alignment and he says, look, you know, can you help me with x, Y, and z? At that point, he speaking your language, um, and, uh, and as understood and has asked you to participate and helping being a good citizen. And you know, uh, if we could have a more senators like, uh, you know, Senator Booker, Corey my friend, uh, I think the world would be a much better place.

Speaker 2:          01:04:15       Yeah, totally agreed. He's, he's exceptional at asking incisive questions. Uh, and not just for the sake of asking the questions, but for actually listening to the answers. Yup. Michael, uh, what is the book that you have given most as a gift or books?

Speaker 4:          01:04:34       We suddenly actually reach book with a been a, because Nosha at the startup of you

Speaker 2:          01:04:43       and uh, why, why have you chosen that book?

Speaker 4:          01:04:46       Uh, it, it just has a lot of principles in it for young people right out of college or kind of in the middle of their 20s and such to think about how to pursue their careers.

Speaker 2:          01:04:56       Got It. And what, and a, what would be your will be your second book if you had to pick a second,

Speaker 4:          01:05:02       uh, well, to young people, I often give them a simple book you've probably heard about called getting things done. David Allen, combine that with, uh, the seven habits of highly effective people because I think the former helps you to actually to, to action and the ladder healthier side, which actions to actually, you know, take. So I mentor a lot of young people. Um, and I think those two books together are probably good for them.

Speaker 2:          01:05:37       Wonderful. Yeah, we're going to, we're going to dive into quest Virginia second because I want to make sure that we covered that. Uh, read. What about yourself, the, the book or books that you've given most as gifts besides the ones that, uh, that you've been involved with directly?

Speaker 6:          01:05:51       Yes. Well, obviously I tend to give out my two books to start off with you and the alliance, uh, a fair amount of partially because you can sign it and you can make it very personalized and it becomes a very, you know, a personal touch gift. Uh, I'd say the two books that I have recently most given out, um, one of them is a conscious business by Fred Kaufman and Fred is, I think to some degree the modern high spiritual priest of capitalists business. Uh, his whole kind of thread is to say, actually, in fact, how you can, uh, express business and capitalism as a spiritual practice of compassion. Um, and I, you know, he, you know, it's a, it's a book that opens with a discussion of Aristotle and, you know, not, not, not, you wouldn't be surprised, be surprised on a business book. So that's one. And then the other one is Sapiens by Yuval Harari, which is a very grand, it's one of the ones I've read most recently. Um, a grand theory of humanity and kind of how does the, is cognition work? Um, and I don't know enough to know, like, is it really deep scholarly work or not? But it's exactly the kind of broad thinking book that I think should be more and, you know, a general consciousness.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       And Michael, you, uh, you mentioned mentoring. I think this is a good segue. Uh, could you please describe a questbridge, uh, and what questbridge does because of course, that's, that's a common thread that ties everyone on this call together. Uh, reed being, correct me if I'm wrong, but a chair of the advisory board, I'm, I'm one participant on the advisory board and very honored to be part of that. But could you describe a, and you of course, are one of the cofounders of questbridge. Could you describe for P for folks, uh, what it is a questbridge does and some of the results or numbers?

Speaker 4:          01:07:48       Sure. I'll describe what it does and when the problem it solves as well. Um, and, and you said Ruby does the head of the advisory board and we've really appreciated your, her both with Tim. So, uh, questbridge is on one level simply a common application for super smart low income kids heading to top schools like Princeton and Yale and swap mourn, Emerson such, um, you can apply to other schools for free whether application online, um, the schools help to offset the costs of the pool so we don't have to raise a lot of money and kin of focus on execution. Uh, the scale is reached, um, insignificant and whereabouts, um, at, at some schools, about half of their diversity. And we put in more low income, uh, kids in all the other nonprofits in the country actually all combined. Um, but there are a lot more out there.

Speaker 4:          01:08:43       And, and the interesting thing in America that people don't know is there's actually no shortage of smart low income kids to use up. All of these kinds of wonderful of financial aid opening schools can afford to pay a full tuition award. Um, it's just, they simply aren't handing in applications. And so we're trying to make that process simpler. But in real numbers, we had over 140 kids accepted to Yale last year, over 110 my were excepted. Um, the majority of those accepted would actually go. Uh, so I'm the one hand, our numbers are large. On the other hand, we've probably gone from, from finding and having them apply like one in 14 of the qualified kids to one in nine. Um, you could fail, uh, several, uh, times over every top school with smart, qualified going to come back at Demec kids for all the financial aid openings.

Speaker 2:          01:09:44       And uh, I'm sorry, go ahead. I didn't mean to interrupt. If you had more there, but I,

Speaker 4:          01:09:49       oh no, I didn't. My wife and I had been doing this. Now I'm in some form for about 20 years or so and uh, are, are, are hitting a good scale, but our Brooklyn people like we had another is to try to increase our scale. And also now we have about 8,000 students in our schools. You know, how do you bring them into the corporate world in like medical schools and things also?

Speaker 2:          01:10:12       And, uh, the, uh, for those interested, uh, the, the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal's had some, some excellent feature pieces recently on questbridge read. You get asked for you to participate in different projects, different startups, different nonprofits all the time. What is it about questbridge that led you to decide to participate, to contribute to it, to be part of it?

Speaker 6:          01:10:38       Well, it's actually a very similar process to how I actually make a decision to be an investor. Um, uh, not 100%, but close, which is, you know, roughly speaking, I think the mission of life is how do you maximize humanity, uh, the expression of human potential. Uh, our consciousness, our, uh, our, our, our sense of ethics and ethos are ways of being with together. And when you look at Questbridge, you'd say, well, here is actually in fact one very intelligent system design for that because the, you know, the way that you can change a life of this high talent, low income kid by providing a path and an understanding and a, an a way of succeeding through a strong college is not only a way to change a life, uh, but also to change the world, uh, because you know, those, that not only did they change their own lives, but then they, they model for others, they can essentially get back to the community.

Speaker 6:          01:11:41       Uh, and also then folks who, you know, benefit from elite universities, have the knowledge and understanding and compassion to, you know, kind of what are the, the challenges for lower income and can help participate in a really positive way. So a part of, you know, um, I think if anything, you know, Michael's being, uh, you know, kind of, uh, socially, uh, EPT and discreet and not, you know, kind of saying, look, it's a, it's an application but not all as an application. It's a community. It's a community, helps, uh, helps those kids succeed through college and then connect with the world around them at large. And so it's, it's, uh, it was a very quick and easy decision to, uh, to join and help.

Speaker 2:          01:12:32       And so, Michael, what I'd like to do is just give a, as a, an example of the type of thing that gets me excited about questbridge and fee. Please feel free to correct me because I know this is just a small part or maybe one example, but for those people listening, I mean I'm, I'm involved with a number of nonprofits, but I, it, I try to apply, like read the same level of scrutiny and high expectations to nonprofits that I would to for profits. And that's it. It turns out to be very challenging. Um, but in the case of Questbridge, Reid mentioned earlier, part of strategy being solving the easiest, most valuable problem. And I think part of that is identifying of course the right problem. And, uh, as you mentioned, Michael, there's a lot of money out there. There is a lot of money.

Speaker 2:          01:13:27       Uh, beat at colleges will give students more than $300,000 each to go to college. The, the, one of the issues is simply the lack of applications. These kids don't apply oftentimes, and they may not have the social support. It may not even enter their minds to apply. So how do you solve that problem? Because a lot of people are trying to solve the wrong problem by throwing more money at the problem, doing it too late, and they miss the window of opportunity. And so what, what really caught my attention first about questbridge was, uh, just one small example, which was in these communities where they may not even be thinking of applying to college, uh, doing, for instance, an Ipad giveaway or a giveaway of some type and the application or form to sign up for this giveaway potentially, uh, and when just so happens to also be a standardized application that you've convinced 36 top schools to accept as, as college applications.

Speaker 2:          01:14:25       And so these kids are incentivized in a way that is kind of culturally relevant to them. And then they get a letter in the mail saying, Hey, by the way, uh, Princeton University here, we'd like to offer you a full ride for four years. And it's just such an elegant solution. And it's such an example for me at least of putting in a, getting a very large result for a, uh, a small input, a small intervention. Um, and that's why, you know, I've been so excited to, uh, to talk about questbridge and I've been looking forward to this interview for many other reasons also. But to try to showcase it for people to say like, not all hard problems have to be hard to solve. You just have to really surgically focus in the right place. Um, so I'd love to ask just as it relates to Questbridge, uh, what's, what if for people who want to learn more, where should they go? And, uh, there, there are many people listening to this show who are perhaps like me, have recognized how they were set down a very fortunate path by having educational opportunities that are not available to everyone. Um, so for, for people who might want to contribute to such a, you know, an effective Archimedes lever like questbridge, you know, where should they go and, and how might they be able to help?

Speaker 4:          01:15:51       Sure. Um, I, I think to clarify the problem to so your listeners can understand it. Um, the, uh, before questbridge, about three quarters of the diversity withdrawn from only fifth Patina, urban areas in the country. So you were more likely to hear about heading to a school like Swarthmore, if you had a 2.8 from Harlem and if you had a 4.0 from a lot of other areas in the country. So questbridge recruits that at uh, you know, in New York, in Chicago like other people do, but also in like buffalo and Syracuse and other areas of the country, um, in defense of the kids, it's not intuitive at a school and give you $300,000 for free of course. So, so, so to get their application data quest is unique in that we have our own kind of application data set. So as you said, if we create, um, a prize or if others you wanted to help us do that, uh, we've had a lot of success in attracting applicants to fulfill out a college application for a proposition unrelated to the application itself. Um, so if it's a student who wants to get involved, they can simply go to our website@questbridge.org. We have an application actually open

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       now for, um, this falls application cycle. We have access to about half a billion dollars of, uh, financial aid from our universities. And we'd like to, um, uh, you know, harvest more of America's latent talent from areas that we haven't reached earlier. Um, I, I'd say to your listeners to make sure that your local high school actually uses our application and that I'm only about a third of the, the high schools in the country have handed applications in. Um, and then for people who would like to create their own intervention, let's say for low income kids wanting to do maths and science of low income women are low income people from the south or almost any interest, they can even reach out to me, to me directly. And uh, uh, on your, uh, body, you can feel free to put my email address if you'd like to. Okay, wonderful. And would you like to give that out now or would you prefer this one? Yeah, yeah, it's Michael, um, uh, at quest bridge.org. Great.

Speaker 2:          01:18:17       And by prizes, you mean people could offer some type of what w what might uprise look like?

Speaker 5:          01:18:23       Yeah, it's really odd. It could be, it could be nonmonetary like we'd like to say, um, you know, have a, a leadership award at like the White House Strip something. Um, but it can get simple as we ran a pilot for native Americans where we give away a 20 laptops cooking the actual university application up to the uprise application and we grew from having only 34 applicants one year, two or 350, um, the year after that.

Speaker 2:          01:18:57       So for everyone listening, I just want to really encourage you, I, I am very, very, uh, I have a very, very tight filter tightness filter when it comes to working with nonprofits and uh, this, this one is worth your time. So I would just encourage you to look at it. Um, forget about the label nonprofit as an intervention that can better humanity. Um, as, as reed mentioned, this is, this is one of the rare gems out there in my opinion. And you know, other organizations that I've worked with, like donors choose, for instance, Charles Best is a huge fan of questbridge. And he said, the first thing he said to me when I mentioned a few years ago that Michael, you and I connected, he said, that is an excellent choice. That is an awesome choice. Um, so people check out questbridge.org and you can reach Michael if you'd like to discuss, uh, collaborating in some way. michael@questbridge.org. So I'll just ask one more question guys. It'll take a one or two minutes and that is, um, let's, uh, let's, let's start with you Michael. If you could have one billboard anywhere that said anything, what would it say and where would it be?

Speaker 5:          01:20:04       I probably have people do what you do to Jim. Pick something you're afraid

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       of every day and in kind of go after it. And uh, I'd put that on kind of peoples a way to work I suppose. What about yourself read?

Speaker 6:          01:20:22       Well, this is kind of a I a funny reflex, but was just something I would thinking about recently. I think I would take the billboard in Washington DC. I think I would target congresspeople and I say, have you worked with someone across the aisle today? Because what matters is not partisan conflict, but how do we govern our country to actually have a better future

Speaker 2:          01:20:44       here, here. Definitely. Last question guys. Do you have any ask or request for my audience? Uh, read, we can start with you. And then where can people find you online? Where can they ping you on social networks, et Cetera?

Speaker 6:          01:21:00       Well, on social networks it's very easy. There's this service that maybe a few people have heard of called Linkedin, uh, you know, find double there. Um, I'd say two things. Uh, one is, uh, you know, I would also echo the fact that, uh, questbridge is a scale, uh, way of, of, of changing the world for the better of actually making us more of the, you know, kind of for us in the u s the American dream in terms of the ability for, uh, for talented low income youth to actually, you know, uh, live in a meritocracy. So I think it's a awesome, and whatever way you can support whether it's contributing or helping or, you know, pointing out the right talented young kid added is all great. And then the second is, you know, last year I published a book called the alliance. Uh, your audience tends to be highly literate, not a surprise given you, uh, and so in as much as they're thinking about how has the nature of, of employment and how has the nature of, of um, of the relationship between an employee in a company changing, I think it might be something that could stimulate a few thoughts.

Speaker 2:          01:22:13       Definitely. And I have a copy of that book at home and as f everybody, uh, highly worth the read, uh, so highly recommended there. Well Gentlemen, uh, this, this has been wonderful. I've really enjoyed the conversation and for everybody listening, I will put everything we discussed in the show notes so we'll have links to questbridge, the book recommendations and so on. Uh, just got a four hour work, week.com all spelled out and click on podcast to find that. And, uh, guys, I really appreciate you making the time. This was, this was a lot of fun and I have pages and pages of notes just for myself.

Speaker 6:          01:22:48       Tim, I'll always a pleasure and always an honor.

Speaker 2:          01:22:51       Thank you for the conversation to all right guys. Until next time, thank you and everyone else. Until next time. Thank you for listening.
