Speaker 2:          00:02:56       Hello my dangerous dainty friends. This Tim Ferriss, and this is another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where I try my best to deconstruct excellence and world class performers. That means interviewing people who are the best at what they do, or one of the best of what they do, whether they're investors or chess, prodigies, actors, athletes, everyone in, anyone who fits the bill of top performer. I will try to dig into the habits, the routines, the favorite books, the meals, the mule timing, their sleep habits, meditation techniques and so on and so forth to provide you with recipes that you can test. So not a whole bunch of Highfalutin abstract concepts, although we explore some deep stuff. But the really tactical tools that you can implement on a daily, weekly basis to become better at whatever you do or want to do. And this episode is no exception. We have Whitney Cummings, so Whitney is hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       Whitney is a Los Angeles based comedian, actor, writer and producer. She's a multihyphenate. And uh, let me rattle off just a few things. Uh, she's executive producer end along with Michael Patrick King cocreator of the Emmy nominated CBS comedy. Two broke girls not to broke curls are a lot of ks, two broke girls. You've probably seen it, heard of it, observed the advertisements for it. It's all over the place. Uh, which was recently picked up for a fifth season. She also wrote, produced and starred in Whitney, which aired on NBC from 2011 to 2013 not only that, outside of television she has headlined with comics including Sarah Silverman, Louie Ck, Amy Schumer, Aziz Ansari and many others. Lots of big names. She's famous for some other skills that will explore like roasting other comics and celebrities. That is a fascinating and fun conversation that we dug into her first one hour stand up, special money shot, premiered on comedy central and 2010 and was nominated for an American comedy award.

Speaker 2:          00:05:02       Her second standup special Whitney Cummings. I love you debuted on comedy central and 2014 and she is shooting a third hour for HBO this August, which is set to air in 2016 in this conversation and we talk about her process for writing both comedy and other types of writing difference between fiction and nonfiction, we get really granular on how she develops her jokes. I asked her questions like, if you had eight weeks to take someone, I, he, me who's terrified of standup, no experience to get them ready for a real performance, what would those a week, eight weeks of training look like? And we also turn back the clock, look at her childhood, look at the things that have formed her and informed her of the mistakes that she's made, managing other people, Lessons learned, uh, because she's had massive teams, hundreds of people, which I did not know. Uh, and we even delve into some very esoteric stuff like equine therapy using horses for therapeutic work. Really fascinating. I love this conversation. I hope you do as well. And she is, I've added funding lady making me laugh. So I hope you enjoy Whitney Cummings. And I usually say without further ado, Whitney Cummings, but I've said when he come, he was like 17 times already in this intro. So Whitney cat makes Whitney Cummings, Whitney Cummings like Candyman enjoy

Speaker 3:          00:06:33       Whitney. Dear, thank you so much for being on the show. Thank you sir. Like I caught you opening your beaches.

Speaker 4:          00:06:40       Look, I'm really into beverages. I don't know if you noticed this about me. It's my weird collection. I think I'm a hoarder. Uh, I'm really into hydrating, but like sneakily sell like nefarious hydration. It can never be actual water. It's always like something just a, they cost $8.

Speaker 3:          00:06:56       Right? We'll beat you us of, and a lot of endurance athletes are big on beaches. That's what I'm here to tell you. I said I've made my transition into being an intern. That's my new, that's why you were grilling. Yep. Yeah. Like American Ninja Warrior competitor who wandered water to the living room. Some of your questions and uh, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:07:13       Yeah, no, I um, I feel like I didn't make a lot of great health decisions in my early twenties so I feel like I'm overcompensating now with, you know, things like this

Speaker 3:          00:07:26       better than going the other direction right here. Like, you know, I was so healthy, I was so orthorexic I was competitive athletes.

Speaker 4:          00:07:33       I feel like our parents just kind of dropped the ball. I mean, now that we know so much about GMOs and high fructose corn syrup, I feel like I'm like on borrowed time.

Speaker 3:          00:07:43       Well, I think that maybe they dropped the ball, but they didn't know they were carrying the ball in the first place or percent. Yes. They didn't know that they have plausible deniability. Right. That'd be like a saw my fault that I gave you chicken mcnuggets so why I smoked when I was pregnant. Krispy Kreme. Oh, exactly. The fruity pebbles every morning

Speaker 4:          00:07:59       go pubs here, right. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Um, so I feel like I'm kind of like trying to rectify a lot of that damage that was done.

Speaker 3:          00:08:06       So, oh, look at this. I just noticed. So I love you. How is that on your arm? And I've got that for you. I have something else to tell you. Pull of the exciting confessions right off the bat

Speaker 4:          00:08:18       that you just said, uh, because as, um, what you guys can't see, hopefully, unless you're Weirdo Stalker, I have a white tattoo on my lower left forearm that says I love you and I don't think anyone has ever noticed it without me having to point it out. How is that? That's so interesting. Reduce. I have another white one right here. Uh, oh yeah. It's an anchor. Um, be, it's basically, this is like someone who's incredibly commitment phobic, who wants a tattoo but doesn't want anybody to see it. Um, so that's, yeah, so that's

Speaker 3:          00:08:48       one of my weaknesses. But is it, is it done with an electric needle without any ink? Nope. With white ink, but it has to go much

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       deeper. So it's more like scarification so basically hurts like twice.

Speaker 2:          00:08:59       So I am fascinated by that.

Speaker 4:          00:09:02       Twice as much pain, but half the recognition sounds like a lot of business ideas. I've had worst investment Basel. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:11       The, that's fascinating to me because I've never seen a tattoo like that before. But I read when I was in Japan as an exchange student, my first time abroad when I was 15, I became obsessed with Yakuza tattoos and sort of deep traditional tattoos that were associated with organized crime. And I read about this type of Tattoo, which is pretty much exactly what you have on your arm. They would only become visible when the skin was flush at, say, the public baths. Wow. So if they wanted to keep it under wraps that they were organized crime member, but then wanted to scare the shit out of everybody when they're in naked in the baths. Wow. You'll have like full back white tech.

Speaker 4:          00:09:47       That is so cool. It's almost like black light tattoos today or something. I don't even know what a black with a black light, you can do a black light tattoo. This is mostly for, I guess people who do Lsd and did like special k, but you can do it with black light ink so you can only see it in her black lives. This gotta be good for you. Yeah. This is so funny because I wrote my senior honors thesis in college on Tattooing. Really? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:10:06       So I've, uh, no, I think you also have, if I saw correctly, something on the back of one of your arms. Yes, yes.

Speaker 4:          00:10:14       I have a safety pin on the back of my right arm, which I always forget I have because I hid it so well that I always forget it's there. But what is the story of the safety pins? Safety pin is sort of um, uh, well the I love you is first uh, for you Tim. Thank you. I wanted to subtly, it's really a requirement for podcast guests. This is what I have it really divulged sign the release. You get the Tattoo, then we can talk. Right, right. I've been Brandon, um, I got the, well let me do them in order. I got the anchor right here. I'm on my wrist. Michael Patrick King and I created a show called two broke girls, which is on CBS. Michael Patrick King, you know, did sex in the city. If you had a girlfriend at the time you probably had to watch it.

Speaker 4:          00:10:55       Uh, he did a show called the comeback, which is a brilliant show. It is so well done. I'm sort of about an aging actress in Hollywood and sexism in Hollywood and it's just, it's just incredibly well written and performed and a, we did two broke girls together, a simultaneous, I was doing a show on NBC, which was a Sitcom as well as a talk show. So I was doing three shows simultaneously, which doing one is already going to say glutton for punishment, Herculean task. So, um, so I was just, I was having a hard time, um, I dealt with some just, you know, as a comedian, you know, you become a comedian because you want people to like you, you know, and then all of a sudden you're sort of thrust into the zeitgeists is like a public figure and then, you know, not everyone's gonna like you, which in standup is usually a good thing because that means you're being specific, you know, as you, I believe, say, uh, when you try to please everybody, you please no one.

Speaker 4:          00:11:47       Right. Exactly. So the idea is you want to polarize some people, but then all of a sudden its critics are like, wait a second and then you recreate your childhood circumstances and you're like, Dad, I mean, critics just become your dad who won't accept you or your mom whose approval you're trying to get. So you just sort of time travel back and to being a kid. And so that was really hard on me. And then, uh, I just kind of eviscerated myself. I did everything wrong in terms of being a boss and managing my time and managing people's Egos and depleting myself, which I've learned a lot in the last thing you were working on when I was working on these three shoes, I was the perfect example of what to never do. This is before I knew about you before I, you know, had a, I'm in a 12 step program for codependence called Alanen.

Speaker 4:          00:12:30       Uh, and I do trauma therapy now. I do all this stuff, whatever. But this was before I had any kind of that recovery or had done any work on my sort of neuropathways. I was using a lot of really old survival skills and I was like people pleasing and caretaking and I couldn't fire anyone and I was terrified to tell someone no and I couldn't have uncomfortable conversations and uh, I was all of a sudden the boss of like 400 people and I, it's a lot, it's a lot of people. I was not the number x three different show I've worked on big TV shows, a TV show. It is very, very minimal. 400 people. It's a lot of people too. I mean it was just between three different shows. I have three staffs, 200 each, you know, it was probably more like 600 over the year.

Speaker 4:          00:13:11       Um, and they're all looking to you for clarity and being decisive and just saying yes or no instead of well, I just, I feel like I'm so sorry. It just, I was so apologetic and so, you know, desperate for everyone's approval, um, which makes a great comedian, terrible boss. And uh, and so I was just having a really hard time and I remember Michael Patrick King, who's sort of one of my mentors, he gave me a ring that had a, a anchor on it. Just sort of that, you know, who's like, just stay grounded, stay in your shoes. Because anytime someone would come would come to me, I would just like abandoned, you know, myself and just jump out of my skin to try and take care of them and manage them and please them instead of just keeping my feet on the ground. And then of course, I promptly lost the ring.

Speaker 4:          00:13:51       Uh, so I decided to get the tattoo of it in white of course, because being on television, you have to go in like an hour early to get tattoos covered. And I don't want to give up, you know, an hour a day, five hours of my week. That's five minutes. That's it, right. Every, yeah. Every, you know, an hour a day times five days a week. Yeah. That's, you know, five hours of tattoo covering, which I just don't have time. So hence the white. And then the safety pin was sort of, um, I grew up in, this is not funny and we're going to get funny. Uh, and you kind of to be in kind of an unsafe environment. And, uh, my parents would argue a lot when I was a kid and I used to play with, we didn't have a lot of money. I was poor safety pins where my toys, I just remember playing with safety pins and I remember opening them and closing them. And I just remember that was just, I did Emdr, which is like a, um, a trauma thing, movement, eye movement, uh, deeper desensitized desensitization. You can say that word station and reprogramming. Got It. Involves eye movements

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       for overcoming trauma or sure.

Speaker 4:          00:14:55       Basically Reprogram your trauma in terms of putting them into putting a trauma to a different folder, like in layman's terms. So the way that my trauma therapist explained it to me was, you remember the episode and I love Lucy when there was the conveyor belts. Sure. Of was it the bon bons or was it bottles with gloves? I want to see it was bottles. I want to say it was bottles and she was putting the glove on it. That was in the open. But anyways, so she explains it as our brains taken 3 billion pieces of information a second. Right. So, you know, Tim shirt is, you know, camouflage and how he feels, how he looks, how this house feels, trampoline outside. That's the longer story. Listeners is the trampoline that all I want to do is leave this podcast to go jump on it. Um, and, uh, and then when we get traumatized, her brain freezes.

Speaker 4:          00:15:40       Uh, but the information keeps coming in. So if right now someone came in and held up a gun to our heads, right, the information would still come in white walls, wood in a apple computer, this cactus, and then it would be filed into the folder of trauma. Right. So later in five years, I'm sitting at dinner and all of a sudden there's a cactus and I'm anxious and stressed out and I don't know why exactly. And I'm triggered, you know, so it's like reprogramming some of those triggers into a folder that is more benign. Got It. Essentially.

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       And so did the tattoo come after that Emdr? Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:16:12       Yes. Got It. Yeah. When I started doing EMDR and sort of like getting into sort of like,

Speaker 2:          00:16:15       um, neurological recovery essentially from trauma and was the, was the safety pin a trigger for negative feelings? And if so, why did you choose to put on your arm? That's interesting. It was

Speaker 4:          00:16:29       kind of my, and it wasn't necessarily a trigger for me. I think it was more like a symbol for me of sort of a time. And the, I think this is sounds kind of Corny, but like it was open when I was a kid and I would sort of like, you know, not in like a masochistic way, but I was sort of like pricked myself with it when things would get, it was just like a tick kind of like as someone bites her nails or something. And so I sort of closed it. So the tattoo is a closed safety pen that's sort of like you're safe. It's over. Cause a lot of times if you have any kind of trauma as a kid, you become an adult and you constantly are recreating our childhood circumstances and having these completely obsolete, inappropriate feelings to present situation.

Speaker 4:          00:17:03       So I had, uh, you know, it was working with somebody who triggered all these feelings that my family of origin used to cause. And it was like, this is a completely inappropriate reaction. This is an employee who works for me, who's trying to get a scrubbed on and all of a sudden I'm like, you know, reliving these historical wounds, it's not appropriate. So I think it was a sort of me really trying to put an end to that story and respond to present circumstances with presence, appropriate emotions. Got It. That makes any sense. It does make sense. And the I love you. I love you is um, a couple things. Uh, my last special was called I love you. Uh, but I actually did that after I got the tattoo. I um, interesting. I'm trying to like, figure out how to say this without seeming like ridiculous, but something that I sound ridiculous sometimes I'm on the podcast, maybe, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:17:56       I'm just admitting like pretty embarrassing. It's pretty hard to embarrass me, but this, but any kind of vulnerability tends to be a little bit embarrassing for a comedian. Um, I was struggling a little bit with patience and compassion and, um, again, I'm codependent or like I grew up in an alcoholic home, which a lot of times people get a, we have a lot of trouble with patients and control and we want everyone to do what we want to do when we want it to be done. And that's sort of how we survived as children, is that if I could just organize my drinks in the right row, I'm going to be fine, you know, and I found myself and I travel a tremendous amount as I'm sure you do also, or, and I have in the past and I just found myself getting frustrated with people not doing things my way.

Speaker 4:          00:18:37       I don't know if you've ever tasted, it's like every minute of every hour of my life. Okay. So I might have a pamphlet for you. Yeah. Um, but I found myself just being, and I think that's one of the reasons I gravitated, gravitated towards being a writer and a comedian is I get to do it all on my own. Right. You know, I write the material, I perform it. I critique it, I rewrite it. I tore, I do everything on my own because when other people get involved, I just, you know, it's an efficient, and I don't like the way you're doing things. I don't like the way you're saying that. I don't like the way you're sitting, like everything. So

Speaker 2:          00:19:07       is really a low stress to have 600 people constantly just working on projects here.

Speaker 4:          00:19:13       Exactly. Like it's, you're wearing flip flops to work. I mean it was just this like just a way to not focus on myself. And I think ultimately sometimes when we judge other people, it's just a way to not look at ourselves as a way to feel superior or sanctimonious or whatever. So, um, my trauma therapist said like every time you meet someone just in your head say I love you before you have a conversation with them and that conversation's going to go a lot better. Cool. I like, it was just an interesting little trek for 28 days, which is how long it takes to make a neural pathway a new neuropathway. Um, I would just, uh, when I meet someone in my head, whether it's the lady at the DMV who's making me wait two hours, and essentially it's just the notion of everybody is doing the best they can with what they have. Yeah. Which is really hard for a lot of us to accept

Speaker 2:          00:19:54       super hard. This is, I'm enjoying this because, uh, I've been trying to work on a lot of these weaknesses that I have, which fall pretty squarely right into the inpatient Dick category and a very perfectionist. Yeah. Very meticulous in sometimes a helpful detail oriented way oftentimes. And I like monkish overbearing way. Yeah. And

Speaker 4:          00:20:22       great when you're writing a book yourself, but when all of a sudden you're getting a relationship or have employees, it doesn't work as well

Speaker 2:          00:20:27       or have other people involved in the process. You become, you know, a problem author, which is sort of my label. Yeah. Uh, and there, there are pros and cons to being a problem author. You get the cover you want, but then, you know, so and so at the publisher wants to stab you in the face with the pencil. Right. Uh, repeatedly and people still use pencils. I'm not sure, you know, I'm really clawing my way through a vat of vocab decaffeinated at the moment. But, uh, the, um, two things that are very related that really helped me were one, always assuming that people are fighting battles, you know, nothing about. Like everyone's fighting some intense battle internally that you know nothing about. Number one, okay

Speaker 4:          00:21:07       thing that is a battle for them might be super easy for you. Right. You know, and that's, I think my dad said something really who is not known for excellent advice, but he said something to me, um, once that was super helpful because I was having a lot of trouble in relationships where I felt like I wasn't getting my needs met. And uh, he was like, you just have to understand how strong you come off. Like people don't think you need anything. Right? So that's why people don't help you. And it was this interesting thing where I was like, oh, I mean I have a lot of weaknesses and I'm bad at a lot of things, but when I'm good at something, which maybe you can relate to, I'm really good at it, right? Because I've just worked really hard at it. So I'm really good at things that a lot of people might not be and vice versa. So it's like, I'm like, how come? Yeah. He hasn't finished that book yet. How could he ever, it's been two days. Right. And it's like, okay, not everyone reads a book or whatever it is, you know, being, having compassion for everybody, right?

Speaker 2:          00:21:58       Yeah. Not something that comes naturally to me at least. Uh, and it's not that I'm a complete like apathetic serial killer or whatever. It's, uh, but the impatience is really pronounced.

Speaker 4:          00:22:10       One of my favorite quotes, one of my favorite people is Katherine Hepburn. And in a Philadelphia story, I think it was Cary grant said, you, uh, to Katharine Hepburn's character, you have no tolerance for human weakness. And I remember that resonating a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:22:24       Yeah. Which is, it's, it's easy to rationalize lease. I find ways to rationalize why it's acceptable, but you just leave this sort of string of collateral damage. And, uh, the, uh, the, the two things that that brought to mind for me were one, I remember somebody told me, you know, if you walk outside and you go about your day and you meet an asshole, that person's an asshole. If you walk outside and everyone you meet is an asshole. I love that. I love that. And so whenever I have one of those days where I'm like, man, everybody's so ungrateful and since they're such assholes,

Speaker 4:          00:23:00       well, wait a second now wait a second. I'm the common denominator in all these interactions more my problem. That was exactly. So that was my way of, uh, just, it's a shortcut and it's, it's, as soon as I meet someone in my hat, I just say, I love you. And then, yeah, I love you. Can I please get a diet coke with it? Whatever. I mean forever everybody and a Tsa, can you please draw my computer? I'm getting felt up by the TSA guy. Um, you too. And, well, I'm Tsa pre now, that's like third base and I get it filled up with my shoes on. Um, and another thing that was super helpful because at least in my field, I don't know the case for years, I can't speak to it, but a lot of people who are in a performance based field, whether it's writing, acting, um, as, this is a huge generalization, but you can sometimes assume they didn't get a ton of attention as a child or need more attention than most.

Speaker 4:          00:23:58       They have a compulsion to be, need to be seen and heard and appreciated. And humor is usually developed as a shield slash defense mechanisms. So what were they defending against? We don't know, but it was something everyone had a thing they had to defense defend against us child. My last name is Cummings. That was probably what I was managing as a child. Um, and uh, whatever was going on in my household. So you get a bunch of really fragile people who have all these defense mechanisms in one room to constantly show up everyday to be rejected because you're in a writer's room. All you're doing is pitching and the boss is saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. And you're just hearing no all day. You're not good enough. You're not funny enough. Which is what we all translate to. So much of really fragile, sensitive people in one room and uh, who may or may not have done the kind of recovery that I've committed to our therapy. We all always just knew everyone works as hard on ourselves as we do. They know, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:24:51       Well that, that brings up a couple of things for me. One is I have at points tried to chill the fuck out and a, that takes many forms. Uh, meditation has been very helpful. I do have a simple sort of daily morning meditation practice after two of my friends were just like, you're being an idiot. Maybe you should try sitting still. Uh, just I find sitting still and focus, returning my attention to something, whether that's breath or a sound or a word for 20 minutes a day allows me not to feel overwhelmed. Yup. That is due to over responding to things imaginary or outside of my control. But what I wonder is for you, I've sometimes thought, you know what, I'm impatient, but I don't want to totally fix it. I want to dial it back, but I don't want to totally fix it because there are a lot of benefits that come from being impatient. Sometimes it's a strength in moderation or sometimes in extremes. I mean, in the end we could, we could dig into that. But do you, do you worry or have you experienced that doing the work that you've done a, has negatively impacted your comedy in any way doing the work I've done has it, oh, the work I've done, I see you're removing, removing the shield or reducing that codependency. Right. Has it removed some of the magic?

Speaker 4:          00:26:15       Great question. Um, I think the short answer is no. Uh, one of my biggest fears when I went into a recovery program and intensive therapy, like not talk therapy like trauma therapy, which is actually kind of the opposite of talk therapy because talk therapy largely I'm not disapproving of therapy, but for me personally, um, mine has more of a neurological perspective, which is when you have some kind of trauma and you talk about it, you just reinvest the trauma and it actually makes it worse. Right. Um, so I do like, I can't talk about a certain topic for 28 days. I have to replace a negative thought with a positive thought for 28 days. I mean, it's like a pretty hard work. I get really worried. I was like, you know, talking to my therapist and a bunch of people in my program, I was like, I'm just really afraid that I'm not going to be as funny if I'm not as dark and in pain all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:27:03       And it was actually the opposite because I wasted so much time trying to manage, you know, unhealthy relationships and the, you know, having low self esteem and my perfectionism, which can be really paralyzing, you know, perfect perfectionism leads to procrastination, which leads to paralysis. So I could go a couple of days or like getting any writing done because my self esteem was too low. I didn't think I was good enough and just these old sort of obsolete messages and a survival instincts. And um, I think that it has given me so much more mental energy, physical energy. Um, I have much more balance in my life now and I'm much more productive and much more vulnerable, which as a writer you have to be vulnerable. I think before I was so overworked, I was such a chronic workaholic that I didn't have a life. And in order for art imitate life, you have to have a life.

Speaker 4:          00:27:54       I saw a really profound statement. For me art was imitating art because I was, all I was doing was working turns into this weird like recursive self reflexive. Yeah. And then all of a sudden I'm just in like, it's just so Mehta and I'm sitting in there and I remember being in the writer's room and the second season of a TV show about sort of relationships and someone's like, oh, what if they go to a baby shower? And I'm like, no one goes to baby showers. And everyone room was like, you don't, but most people do on a Sunday, go to a baby shower. And I was like, oh my God, I was just so work. I was so myopic and I was so, I hadn't had a conversation, you know, this is going to come off bad, but I'm just going to be honest, I haven't had a conversation with someone that I didn't pay in months. Wow. Which is scary pay not meaning you've paid them to talk to you, but an employee I've been playing. Yeah. I only talked to though.

Speaker 3:          00:28:45       No one else is laughing at her script. The compliments are all memorize it. But I don't hate that idea. That's how sick I am.

Speaker 4:          00:28:55       Um, but yeah, I didn't, I hadn't had like an organic, healthy sort of conversation with someone. Not that the people that I hire are like obsequious to me and won't walk on eggshells around me. I have is a good word. That is a good word. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:29:11       not bad, not bad. I don't use it often, but that felt like the right context. But what I do and comes in with aplomb and

Speaker 4:          00:29:19       so I felt like, um, you know, it was really important to me to have balance. Like I didn't have any hobbies. Like I had to, I got assigned homework from my trauma therapist that I had to do two, uh, two hours a week chunks of something that was purely fun with no work motives purely. So I took up a equine therapy, um, and like some other hobbies and stuff, but it was really a struggle. I was like, I can do that. And I mean, I get hour in, I was restless. I was felled on productive. I felt like I was making notes in my phone. I'm like working. I realized like, Oh my God, I'm doing bits with horses. What's the deal or I mean, I was like, it was, it was a struggle and I mean even like listening to podcasts or I was always a motive of like, oh, I can get a joke out of this or if I listen to it, you know? And it was, it made me realize how a work driven I was

Speaker 2:          00:30:11       the, so going from burning the candle at both ends, workaholic, what was the kind of defining moment where you're like, no more like, I can't continue this way. What was the conversation or the day or the experience

Speaker 4:          00:30:25       by the way in the workaholism and you know more about this than anyone. A lot of it was buisiness. It wasn't actual work. I was taking on a lot of tasks that I had no business doing just because I had been so sort of, um, I think one of the most important things you can do as an artist or in any field, I can really only speak to Comedians, actors, writers, performers, is to get a handle on your issues. Like both. You will never be successful if you're dysfunctional and your relationships and with your employees and stuff, if you have trust issues, if you have abandonment issues, if you're a narcissist, whatever it is, you know, um, if you are controlling, because I found like I remember when I was, I was so apologetic and I was so afraid to ask for help that I was doing everybody's job right, which ends up disenfranchising them.

Speaker 4:          00:31:09       They get pissed, they feel micromanaged and they feel micromanaged. They feel you can't ultimately pick up all that slag. Yes. And I'm exhausting myself and making them feel bad. No, everybody loses. And I remember I was like punching holes in his script and there was like literally 40 other people in that room who wanted to do it. I mean, I just had a bunch of employees that were like, can we please do something? Was so bored. And I was like, I got it. I got it. I was just, so coming from standup comedy, I'm so used to doing everything myself that asking for help, I realized how hard it was for me. So there's no point in having a great script or being a great writer actor if you can't let people help you. Um, so I think a lot of, I realized because again, being like you and I, um, just in terms of your, you know, in patients and all that, like it works really well up into a certain point.

Speaker 4:          00:31:59       So all of these defects had worked really well for me until I had a staff, until I had people who were I had to collaborate with and all of a sudden I'm like, um, was sort of a codependent mass. What's wrong with you people? Oh wait, I know, why does it if you were all just psychic and did everything my way, everything would be fine. Um, and so I think that when I realized that I couldn't fire someone, like, I mean I literally would get a pit in my stomach when I had to tell someone that I, you know, didn't like the script or didn't like their joke, I realized, I was like, I can't believe how hard it is for me to feel like I'm disappointing someone or just to tell the truth. Quite frankly, I had so I was so apologetic and afraid of people not liking me.

Speaker 4:          00:32:37       Sure. That a, it was really paralyzing and really a unproductive and slow down the writing process, uh, confused employees. I remember in the room like, you know, people would pitch jokes and I would just say yes, all of them because I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings and then I have to go later and change it and then all of a sudden the, the script comes out and they're jokes aren't there and they feel betrayed and lied to. And you know, a, a phrase that I love that when I first went to on, I heard someone set up people pleasing is a form of assholery, which I just loved. Yeah. Because you're not pleasing anybody. You're just making them resentful because you're being disingenuous and you're also not giving them the dignity of their own experience and assuming they can't handle the truth. It's so patronizing.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       Yeah. It's a, it's a bandaid that hurts a lot when it gets ripped off. Yeah. And it just, there's a very short book called lying by Sam Harris, who's a phd in neuroscience, has been on the podcast, which digs into a lot of this in a very interesting way.

Speaker 4:          00:33:37       Telec 30 leads a day or something.

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       Oh, I'm sure it's a three, 338. Who does think it depends on the, it depends on the person or which politician you're listening to you. But the, uh, the point being like when you tell white lies or you omit certain things, they can ultimately have the same negative impact as an outright kind of bold faced lie to someone. Uh, so I, I apologize for interrupting.

Speaker 4:          00:34:03       No, no, that's super,

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       I love that. The, I want to come back to one thing you mentioned, which is, uh, actually before I do that, so was there a particular breaking point where like I need to address this?

Speaker 4:          00:34:17       Yes. And again, I wish I had, I wish I lied more actually. I probably should lie. And then your response to his question, I um, got pneumonia and I didn't notice and it got really bad and uh, turned into something called Costco. Chondritis sounds bad, which is does that you get it at Costco? The good news. It's really affordable and it's um, basically the infection from the pneumonia gets, uh, in the muscles of your chest, which is called pleurisy, which people got like in like the civil war. I mean it's like nobody gets this, like you have to go so long without polio. It's like and a, and then it gets inflamed the cartilage under your rib cage. So it starts to just sort of, your chest is really sore and essentially I just wasn't taking care of myself because I was so busy. I mean, I was sleeping like four hours a night and was in, had to be in every meeting and every editing session.

Speaker 4:          00:35:15       And when I rewriting, I was writing for scripts at a time and I was just super over extended. I had some family things happen. My mom had a stroke at a family member going to rehab and I just had no concept of boundaries and you can't give what you don't have. I was the queen of giving everything away. All my energy, all my time, all my money, all my, you know, I was like, I would cook a five course meal for, but then I wouldn't eat dinner, you know. Um, so I think, uh, you know, I had this doctor say to me, you know, he's like, you're killing yourself. You know, like you really like need to figure out a way to be healthier because, and that's when I kind of learned about neurology and stress and cortisol and adrenaline and F and F run and, and how damaging they can be on your body. And, um, you know, I was like, I'm 27 and I have three jobs. This is awesome, but then it's all fun and games until you know, until yeah, you have leprosy till your lungs. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 4:          00:36:12       I just remember being like, and I, I think that to that point I remember being at the doctor and, and having this realization because you know, I grew up on Rosanne and mad about you and three's company and like these like multi cams and I love comedy. I love Comedians, timer and be like, I'm living my dream at 27 I have everything I wanted for my whole life and I'm not enjoying it. I'm at the doctor and I have pneumonia and I'm like, you know, managing people's Egos instead of just like having a great time.

Speaker 2:          00:36:40       What's allowed you or what are the things, and this comes back to something you said about being very, very good at some things and very, very, very bad at others. And I'd be curious to know what you think the factors or beliefs or behaviors were that allowed you to get to that point at 27 I mean, a lot of people will say, Holy Shit, that's really young. How would you get to that point from a success standpoint and professionally? Right? What were the things that that contributed?

Speaker 4:          00:37:12       It got me to success. I failed so many times and um, wasn't deterred by it. I for whatever reason, saw failure as practice instead of as the end the finish line, you know, if that makes any sense. Like I wrote three pilots before anyone even read a pilot I had written, I um,

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       now pilot for those people who are not sort of in the business. That's is that a single episode on Spec,

Speaker 4:          00:37:42       single episode of like basically the first episode of a TV show, which is sort of has to introduce all the characters and it's just a little different than a traditional episode. And I'm asked to be introduced the world and be very specific. So I wrote one about, um, the news in 2040 and it was like about a new station and the news in 2040. And it was kind of this apocalyptic take on what the news was going to be like. And the screen was like all covered an ads and all of the news casters would dress like NASCAR drivers with like brands all over them. And you know, they literally, every other sentence they said, you know, they'd be like, you know, so Costcos, you know, Cincinnati is 72 degrees. Like every state was sponsored by an ad. It was just kind of a ridiculous, um, sort of hyperbolic sort of, um, thing and sort of about, you know, there's a drought and there's no water and it was like 180 degrees out, which may end up not being far from the tree.

Speaker 4:          00:38:40       It might just be a documentary. Um, so I, I, and everyone thought that was kind of insane and no one really read it. And then I wrote one that was, uh, based on this book called, um, uh, uh, it was about, uh, something about, it was like a psychology book, I think it was called, uh, the, uh, I don't remember, but it was about the 14 different kinds of personalities, you know, and uh, and I wrote about three sisters that had the same mother, but three different fathers. And how those three different personality types produce different sort of girls and their relationship. Foxton picked that up. I wrote a pilot for comedy central, uh, which I still today till today I think is the best thing I've ever written. It was about, was based on me and about, uh, just me, uh, falling in love with a guy who was in AA and he can't date anyone outside of Aa.

Speaker 4:          00:39:33       So I pretend to be an alcoholic to get in his life and I go to Aa and pretend I'm getting sober to like get in his life and then I fake a relapse and to get his attention and the pilot and then have to like drink and that actually become an alcoholic. It's this really ridiculous premise. And uh, and they didn't pick that up, but that's what Michael Patrick King read that made him interested in me to write two girls with him. So everything that I, and then I wrote a Spec for a pilot that didn't even go, that was Dane Cook's pilot or something. So I was just constantly, you know, IC. Yeah, IC comedy and writing like med school. It's like this is the only profession where people think they should be famous and be making millions of dollars two years in. It's like doctors go to med school for 10 years, 12 years. Like, yeah, it's not that different.

Speaker 2:          00:40:22       That's really interesting. I had to Adam Gazzaley, he's a neuroscientist at Ucla on the podcast and he was like, I was in school for 18 years. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:40:32       Again, I've, comedians come up to me now because with youtube and how fat famous, everyone gets so fast or some visibility, which I think is great. They don't democratization of comedy and entertainment, but people like three years in, or like I just, I'm working on a Sitcom and I don't have an agent. And I'm like, you should in six years we'll talk. Right. Get good. And then we'll talk. There's this entitlement now have, I have 10 minutes of jokes and like, where's my sitcom? Right. You know, it's like, it's like a doctor going to school for two years and be like, I think I'm ready to operate. It's like, no, Kelsey, in 10 years.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       Yeah. Well there's a, there's an expression in, um, I think I'm getting this right in Japanese, just like he has the Samei Assay, which is like gets hot ease that which gets hot easily gets cold easily. But I mean it's, it's, it's usually referred to people who find a passion that they're really excited about and they go all in and then quickly drop it, which is kind of, I guess my entire business model, but the, the, uh, the, I think that can be applied to so many different industries and skillsets and just a, for instance, I get asked all the time because I've written a handful of books that have, that have, uh, done decently well. Uh, how do I hit the bestseller list? And my point is, you can game hitting the best seller list. You cannot game staying on the bestseller list and the ladder should, the ladder should be your focus. And they're like, well, how should I market my book? And I'm like, it starts with writing a good book because that is how you sort of perpetuate and, uh, the popularity and get the word of mouth. And I think it's, it's, I mean, that's a sort of a content

Speaker 4:          00:42:10       one is to make the best seller list. And I'm really care it wasn't that good. Yeah. You know, cause that's like the hypes and syndrome.

Speaker 2:          00:42:15       Yeah. And then it drops off. And I think that, um, if you haven't built that foundation, it's very hard to have any sustained success, which is why certain people like Justin Bieber, very impressive that he came out of that sort of a youtube. Yeah. Farming's you know, scouts scouting area and has been able to sustain it as long as he has. I mean, granted, I'm sure he's dealt with his own, his own stuff, but, uh, no one should be famous at 20. Can you imagine if you were famous to 20? No. The things you did when you were, and by the way, my judgment, my judgment was bad enough when you were 20 with $50 million. Well, right. It'll like take every bad decision in pour gasoline on it had been, had $50 million at 20. So many people would be dead. The horrible things. What about that? Uh, when you do your best writing, uh, whether that's the pilot that you mentioned that involves AA or anything else, when you do your best writing, uh, what does the process look like when you look back at like the best stuff you've done? Okay. What contributed to that writing? It's awful. It's awful. It's awful. Writing is awful. Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:43:23       It's not sexy. It's not glamorous. It's not easy. It's, the more I've done it, the harder it's gotten. Uh, you know, because you don't want to become a parody of yourself. You don't want to keep, you know, doing the same things. You get sort of disgusted by your own instincts. You know, I've written that joke, I've written that character or like, and then, you know, it's gotten a little bit better cause my inner monologue is a little bit nicer to me these days. You know, I worked on that. I've worked on detaching from my negative, uh, beating myself up. But writing is, um, writings nasty, you know, and you know, I've, I've also gotten better as I've learned about neurology in terms of like not trying to multitask, not, you know, I, my internet is cut off when I write. I don't have my phone near me. Um, I don't try to edit and write simultaneously.

Speaker 2:          00:44:14       You do sort of brainstorming or first drafts on a computer or by hand?

Speaker 4:          00:44:20       I am really, um, very, uh, meticulous. I'm, which I think a lot of people have shame about. A lot of people wanna be like, no, I just like, I don't, I'm not like a, I don't wing it. I write things out. I'm very dorky. It's note cards. It's, you know, 30 pages of a word document of just all my thoughts. And then I put my dialogue into at the entire script goes into a word document before I even open final draft. So I'm pretty much done with it in a word document with the dialogue because I don't like to write in final draft because it's just harder to go back and edit. Okay. Got It. And because writing and editing or two separate parts of the brain going back and forth is just kind of paralyzes me. [inaudible] I'm very easy to, it's very easy for me to collapse.

Speaker 4:          00:45:05       So really I just, I think the, the most important thing is just knowing your strengths and weaknesses. So I know that it's hard for me to stay focused if I'm looking at a, uh, uh, um, a final draft document and seeing the names of the characters. I feel like all my God, I'm screwing this up. This sucks inputs. I like it to suck in word. So the aesthetic of it is, oh, this is just a rough thing. It doesn't have to be good. Yeah. Right, right, right, right. It's a final draft. I'm like, that's interesting. The aesthetic. I'm like, oh, did you feel like it should be better to, exactly. When I see the form of final draft, it's like, oh my God, I suck. I said, what am I doing in here? Right. So I've, I've learned how to sort of like quell my own fears and anxieties.

Speaker 4:          00:45:44       Um, it's a lot of pacing. It's a lot of eating. It's a lot of going on walks. It's a lot of, do you have a set time or did you like when, during these periods where you, where you felt like you put out really good work and that could be now obviously, but, uh, morning, night, middle of the night coffee one, like what's the cocktail? The whole thing. I do not drink pretty much. Um, when I'm writing I try not to drink at all because I think, um, since I've started eating so healthy, my body just metabolizes out. I mean, I used to, I'm 32 now. Something happened to me when I turned 30 where I just could not drink the way I used to. I on my 30th birthday, someone sent me two shots of Tequila and I'm pretty competitive, so he's like, I bet you can't drink those faster than me. And I was like, boom.

Speaker 3:          00:46:31       Okay. So like the oldest trick in the book? I did not. No, it's not that I do that, but it's like, you know, I, I can recognize it. I'm like, Oh my God, I bet you can take these two goofy's fast timber roofing eating competition. I just was like, and I was like on an empty stomach and literally I woke up in my bed the next morning and I had like 30 minutes

Speaker 4:          00:46:54       calls and texts and people were like, did you go home with John Mayer?

Speaker 3:          00:46:58       And I was like, you're like, I hope so. I know. I'm kidding. Did anyone get photos? I don't even remember seeing John Mayer. I was just like, okay, I, I can never drink tequila again. Certainly. Um, but so I'm just like honoring the fact that okay, I just, I can't be as productive and prolific when I drink, so I don't drink when I'm writing. I wait, wake

Speaker 4:          00:47:17       up. Um, I, uh, have like 30 minutes online. You know, I'd, I, I really try to keep it to like four basic sites. What are the, what are the, I always do Huffington Post. I do salon. I do slate, one of Madison, Ashley Madison, the Haka, Laura, Ashley, Ashley Madison. Um, and then one kings lane, which is like my sort of, you know, um, thing. And Dig sometimes and it kind of depends what I'm working on because it's also, if I'm writing right now, I'm writing a pilot for HBO that's sort of about gender and, and it's got a lot of science in it. So I'll go to psychology today. Jazz Bell, the Frisky, which are kind of um, the Friskies, the Friskies is like a, it's like a website for girls that's got a lot of like studies and this many women admit to having orgasms and masturbation is good for your health. Sort of like edgy. It's like cosmo. Some citations. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:48:15       Smart cars, smart guy. And uh, so if there's anything that's relevant or you know, and uh, I'll look at Twitter, you know, I sort of follow all the major news things on Twitter, but I, once I get into that, it activates a part of my brain that's a little too self conscious and what's everybody else doing? So I tried to not do that cause I do know that all of this is an addiction and I have to sort of keep it under control. I do coffee, I do vitamins. How do you do your coffee? I do my coffee. Um, in a Keurig. Yeah, I do. Correct. That's a hard one. Pure Ag. I know. I couldn't say d. What was it? Decent today. It's a lot of syllables. That's that I need to do. I need, I'm going to do, I did any of that one out of the park. Um, I do a with almond milk and this something all natural sugar. I had this woman come in and take all the carcinogens out of my house, so I'm like making my own almond milk, like an Amish slave these days. It's really lives, make amazing coffee.

Speaker 4:          00:49:19       Um, so, but I usually tie those beards back. That's right. That's right. And I try not to do too much coffee and then I do on a smoothie. Would you heard about, but it's, it's like kind of like everything I need for the day, so I'm not worrying later about what I should eat for lunch. Have I had enough time? Are you waking up generally? Usually about, depending on how late I'm doing shows right now I'm touring to get ready for my special. So on the weekends when I am on the road, I'll wake up more like 10 or 11 but when I'm writing, I try to, I try to wake up early and when I was writing a script last year, I would wake up at like 5:00 AM and try to work from like five to nine and go back to sleep. Cause isn't that when our brain is the most kind of for awhile?

Speaker 2:          00:49:56       Well yeah, it depends. I mean the of the writers I know who are really prolific, uh, and put out good work, it seems like they all, there are a couple of exceptions and I hate them because I can't do what they do, which is like, they're like, oh yeah, from one to 2:00 PM I'll kick out an article. No, can't do it. No. These writers, the more common case I, they write when other people are asleep. Yeah. Whether that means staying up really, really late, which I can't do. Or waking up early really early yet. And I was always the night owl version. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:50:26       But yeah, it's great to wake up at 5:00 AM cause you're not getting emails, you're not on the mass emails and whatever, you know. So I would do that and then go back to sleep. Got It. Which was super helpful cause my circadian rhythms are, um, I, my nap game is pretty strong, I believe. Very strongly enough.

Speaker 5:          00:50:44       Okay. So wait, let's, so let's revisit that time period then. Okay. So you wake up at five, five, you do a four hour blitz, like go back to bed. When do you wake up?

Speaker 4:          00:50:56       I'll go back to bed at like noon or one. A lot of times I'll sleep for like two hours and then take another nap from like seven to eight because then I'll go to stand up at night. So what I usually try to do is break my day into two days, like too many days because I mean, I don't know how can be, I think a lot of comedians sleep really late. But if I'm gonna wake up at eight and then I have to perform at 10 right? By the time it's 10 o'clock, everyone else's winding down. And then all of a sudden I have to be like hilarious and charming. So I'll usually take a nap at like six to seven so that I wake up and like I'll have a little bit of coffee and then like go do stand up. Yeah, game on.

Speaker 5:          00:51:33       Very large, very Argentinian. That's what they do kind of for the, for the tango. I lived in Argentina for nine months and the, in the tango world, nothing really get started until 11 o'clock at night or, or midnight. And so people would do exactly what you're describing. Yeah, the, okay. Got It. So then, uh, during that four hour blitz, you wake up, are you still doing the 30 minutes of Internet in the beginning?

Speaker 4:          00:52:02       I guess I don't, yeah, I'll do it in the morning. Okay. To me, that's always my eye because I know how many interests we all have and how many priorities we have. So it's, we want to know what the news is. We want to put nutrients in our body, we want to connect with our parents or loved ones or whatever it is. So I'll try to get that all done as early as possible so it's not looming over me all day. So it's like if I've just checked all the news, okay, I know everything that I checked box, I have my smoothie with all my nutrients and it checkbox

Speaker 5:          00:52:32       can, you know, I know during the sound, the sound check, which was spectacular, but I made a solemn promise not to use that. So could you elaborate on this movie?

Speaker 4:          00:52:42       Okay. So I, um, uh, this woman, uh, her name is Lori Cohen. Peter's, uh, she's pretty amazing. And she comes to Your House and tells you everything in your house that's killing you. Uh, basically your cleaners, your food. I mean, I thought I was like going to this super all natural grocery store and she literally, I mean, I had almond milk and Hummus and raw and a mommy. I mean, I think I'm nailing it right? And literally, I'm like, this one's going to come over and I'm gonna get a refund. She opens and she looks at me like, like horrified. And she was like, you're eating this. And I was like, almond. She's like, it's full of let the sin and level of law. So cause I was also having some trouble with 'em and my energy level and my liver was a little and I wasn't converting folic acid properly.

Speaker 4:          00:53:29       They were just like a couple things that were up. And uh, so she put the smoothie together for me that it's uh, uh, Kale of course that shovel of the hour cause like guys do vegetable. Um, I was in Savannah like two weeks gone. Some was like, are you eating Kale? And I was like, Kales officially made it. It's in Savannah. People know about Kale. It's fish, it's, it's officially in the Zike guys. It's Kale, carrots, Kiwi raspberries, avocado, olive oil, flax oil, some kind of green powder. And then we put all my sort of pills in there, which is like a adrenal support cod liver oil. Yes. That's good. Uh, no mercury, vitaminK , uh, Alpha lipoic acid. Okay, thank you. Um, desensitization, uh, uh, think, oh co Q 10, and I think that is maybe that's playing 2% of the pelvis. And then we actually make the shit. And then we add the ingredient, right. That's step one.

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       Uh, got it. And um,

Speaker 4:          00:54:46       okay. That all the old released of like, okay, I can kind of eat whatever I want all day and I've gotten everything I needed cause I could be, so I don't know if this is the case for you. If I need somebody to be done, I can't stop thinking about it until it's been accomplished. So I just have to do it right away. I can't be like, oh, eat a healthy dinner. Cause then I'll just like worry about it. That's on it. Have it on loop. Yeah. So I know my limitations and I try to just,

Speaker 2:          00:55:08       and so, so let's take, uh, if you think, well, let me ask a couple of kind of rapid fire questions just for people who want to get more familiar with your stuff. So if you could recommend that someone listen, listen, or watch five minutes of your material, of your stuff, five to 10, let's just say, what would you point them to?

Speaker 4:          00:55:31       I would first tell you to put your kids away. Yeah. Um, I would point them to my last standup special, uh, as you can see on my arm is, it's called I love you as part of the advertising campaign. Um, and I would, I would just do the first five minutes of my last special. Okay. The first or the last first five minutes of the last five minutes. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:56       So if we, if we take a look then at the first five minutes, and I don't want to give away any secret sauce necessarily, or the punchline, literally, I guess, but, uh, if, if we look at that, where did it start? Like what was the, the kind of development process of one of the five minutes? Yeah. Or of like one of the bits, if that's the right word. Yeah. I don't know in those five minutes, like where did it, where did it come from? Them were, or, uh, I'd love to just kind of track the, sure.

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       The growth and development of that idea from pain. It came, my stand up is, I'm always comes from, uh, sublimating or alchemizing really painful situations and to figuring out how to make it funny. Okay. Uh, and so I went, I was in a sort of really codependent, unhealthy relationship. I'm going to get an embarrassing question. What does codependent mean? Go to Bennett. I was actually heard it used a lot and I'd never been 100% clear. That's actually a great, uh, question because most people use it wrong. Most people think codependence means spending a lot of time with people or I can't be alone or whatever, which could be an element of, but codepen dense is essentially that you look to other people to decide how you're feeling. So I go up, Tim's in a bad mood. Uh, okay, now I'm in a bad mood. It's like essentially you're a reactive person and you put other people's needs before your own.

Speaker 4:          00:57:13       I got it. All right. Thank you. That, so, you know, I have a doctor's appointment. Tim asked me to drive him to the airport. I'm going to drive you to the airport and I'm going to forego my doctor's appointment. Your comfort comes first, essentially. And it usually codependence breeds resentment, right? So I'm going to do this for you. And then two weeks later you're five minutes late. And I'm like, well, I drove you to the airport and you're like, well, I didn't want you to, you offered you martyr yourself, essentially. Got It. Um, which is, it's pretty nefarious because you're, uh, masquerading as really kind of Nice. So everyone, when I was in the height of my, my codependent glory days, uh, I was like the next person who would help you move and I'd pay for the bill and I was like the nicest person yet people pleasing as far of assholery.

Speaker 4:          00:57:57       So then I was like annoyed at everybody for not taking better care of me and keeping score. And then, you know, it's not a truly nice thing if you're expecting something in return, you know? So it's just a way to victimize yourself and a way to, I'm like, I don't know if you've ever dated someone like this or had an employee like this where some of that does nice things for you and then gets mad at you for not receiving the gifts the way they wanted you to have them. Yes, yes. Which is a way for your, like you just started this fight and made me a jerk. Do me a favor. I didn't ask for it. Then the Lord it over me. I just made you a four course meal. It's like I didn't ask you to do any of those things. Why are you, you know, and then you get mad when they don't appreciate it the way you'd want them to.

Speaker 4:          00:58:37       So codependence breeds resentment. So, but it's a tricky thing to catch and recover from because again, your story is, I'm just being nice. Um, so I was kind of in a, in a relationship like that, uh, with someone that sort of recreated my childhood circumstances. So it just felt familiar and um, uh, I, yeah, so that's the answer to that, but I can't remember the material. The bitten is five minutes from your painful experience. So I had all this rage after I got out of it. Not Rage, but just sort of like I was disrespected in a relationship and I just took like, you know, for I, I, the reason I think I'm proud of that first five minutes is because that was my sort of more, I think getting your heartbroken is really important. If you're an artist, I encourage you to get your heartbroken, get hurts, fall on your face, make mistakes, um, thaw the ice, break through the defenses and get vulnerable because I think that there's a difference between getting your heart heartbroken and getting your heart broken open.

Speaker 4:          00:59:37       And when it gets broken open, you know, you can really, that's where the meat is. That's where, that's where you write great characters. That's how you get vulnerable. And it's important because I think Comedians, we pride ourselves on how tough we are. Yeah. But you know, we're porcupines under there. It's all marshmallow. Just get to the marshmallow cause that's where the gold is. I promise if you just tell the truth and get your heartbroken as a comedian, you will have a house. That's cool. Yeah. So I think you may mean a lot of professions being tough is what's valued in comedy being weak. It's like power through Vulnera

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       ability. The um, uh, the speech that brings to mind for me as a commencement speech by a writer I really admire named Neal gay men love them. Yeah. Make good art. Cat exploded, make good on this happened, make good art. And uh, I think I'm quoting him correctly. This is paraphrased of course. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:00:31       But I think I know that knew that you liked him because on one of your podcasts you brought him up.

Speaker 2:          01:00:36       Big Fan. Yeah. A little bit of a fanboy, a yeah. A bit of Ben is like understatement of the podcast, but he, um, amazing guys who have, I met him for the first time, uh, in SF very briefly, and I'd heard his audio books. So it was extremely surreal to hear him sound so erudite and extremely British in person. And I was like, am I listening to an audio book right now? This is amazing. And uh, but the line was something along the lines. I'm saying lines a lot of, I'm on, I'm on the home, on the line, on the line theme, but he said, uh, when you start to feel extremely uncomfortable, like you're walking down the street naked, then maybe you're starting to get it right. Oh, that's so great. And when I put out, I've experienced in my own writing where I'll spend disgusting amount of time on a given a blog posts, let's say, that I think is going to kill it and they just flops or it was just crickets. And then when I have that extreme discomfort and, um, I hesitate drafting it and I hesitate publishing it. Those are almost always the pieces that do the best. So even outside of comedy and writing, I find that to be true. Um, okay, so you have to take this pain. Yeah. Did you, did you take notes on the pain as you were experiencing it or did you recall it in one of your writing sessions and put down the bone?

Speaker 4:          01:02:02       I remember actually, and this might be cheating a little bit and are not cheating, but, um, I actually remember sharing and an Al Anon meeting something that was really hurt my feelings. And I was like, and then he did this, then he did this and people started laughing and I was like, is this like, and I realized, Oh my God, this is funny because it's happened to other people. People are relating and it's resonating. And when you tell the truth about your embarrassing moments and show your shadow catharsis happens, which is what laughter is, which is people go, me too. You know? So it was basically like, I was like, the whole premise of that first five minutes was what does love mean? Because I feel like my whole life love has been a very, I think just in our culture in general, love is a very confusing, vague, manipulative word, right?

Speaker 4:          01:02:56       And, um, you know, this is why I love working with animals so much is that you only communicate through behavior, not their words. Because words can be so confusing. Words mean something different to everybody, you know? And they have no bumps, like can't get it. They have no, they can't open your doors, steal your stuff. That's true. That's true. They can't read your blog and day. This wasn't as good as the last one. Right. Just love them. They're your biggest fan. Um, and uh, and so law of I, I kept being in these difficult relationships where it was always like, but I love you but I love you. And then it was like, it would just undermine all of the bad behavior and I feel like I was, you know, the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.

Speaker 4:          01:03:33       I was like, I keep, I kept justifying being in bad relationships because of this vague amorphous thing called love, which I was like, so love means you hate you. I love you means I hate you. Basic. Like I just was. So I was like, we need to all agree on a universal definition. I think that was my sort of solution. I was like, we should, because I see so many people getting hurt and disappointed because their definitions are different. And then I sort of laid out what I think my definition of love is. And it should be very simple. I'm not going to be happy and do the bit, but it was like, I was like, my definition of love is being willing to die for someone that you yourself want to kill that. In my experience, it's kind of the deal. And uh, and if you love me, don't do these 10 things that I had been through.

Speaker 4:          01:04:19       Like if I'm in the shower with you, don't pee. It was like stuff like that. Like is that so much to ask? Like things like that. Like, and I just listed all of my grievances and I was like, it's so great to be able to, um, you know, that is what is great about comedy is every time something bad happens, I'm now conditioned to go like, oh, this is gonna be a great joke. Yeah. So every thing that sox ends up being a gift somehow like, um, when I first had money, like I grew up without any money and I, uh, got a car like seven years ago, maybe it was, I got my first car that I paid for myself. It was a Lexus hybrid and the first day I got it, I filled it up with diesel fuel and not the right thing to do. Just destroyed it. I mean it costs like six grand or something. It was awful. And I got this great joke out of it though. I got like a seven minute bit that, you know, probably paid for all the damage, you know, that. So now I'm in this place where when something bad happens I'm like, Oh God, I can use that good material. Exactly. So that organic, yeah. Is the upside of being a comedian.

Speaker 2:          01:05:23       And um, oh, what was I going, I was going to dig a little bit further into that, but maybe I can take a step back. I was looking on Wikipedia, which is, we all know he was always, always a hundred percent factual, factual, but it said genres, observational comedy, blue comedy, insult comedy. Oh. And I wasn't sure what blue comedy was, quite frankly. The other ones seemed a little more straightforward. What is blue comedy?

Speaker 4:          01:05:51       Blue comedy? Um, I mean, I take, uh, the fence to that. It's kind of, it's not a lost thing. It's true. I don't even know where it came to me because I don't tell you blue comedies thought it was like dirty cop, edgy comedy, you know, and edgy. Like Dan Carlin, Carlin, George Carlin's up, a podcaster, idolize. Oh, hardcore history. George Carlin, George Carlin. But it's tricky because it's like, what is it again? What is the definition of love? What is the definition of dirty? So for me it's like if you're talking about an doing airplane jokes, but using curse words, is that dirty? Or it's talking about sex without Cursewords dirty kind of, you know what I mean? What's dirty to you? And in our sort of puritanical society where sex is still this really taboo, uncomfortable saying. It's so interesting to me cause it's like I do talk about, I don't talk about sex.

Speaker 4:          01:06:42       Like I just talk about my personal experiences and my confusion. Cause to me sex is about power dynamics and it's about masculinity and femininity and um, and just so many primal things. And it, it fascinates me because I think we think we have so much more choice than we actually do in a lot of stuff. And it causes the most of us, the most amount of pain of any other thing in our lives. Yeah. I mean you know, being cheated on or being in love and getting heartbroken. I mean this is like, I mean every movie plot, every where every, all the money is spent on Valentine's is all about this. So to me it's like how can anything be more relevant? So the fact that I talk about sex and someone calls it blue, I'm like this is all anybody cares about. Why is this still taboo? Why Blue Blue? Oh good question. Like in terms of why is blue, cause why was usually the symbol more for sadness? Oh yeah. Blue comedy. That's a good, I don't know. I will look that up. That's an interesting ediology goal. Ideological conundrum. Ediology well, sure. The, the, the words words, uh, the study of morphological. Oh, there we go. Now you're pushing it. No, no. I said obsequious let's not forget that

Speaker 2:          01:07:56       Asian studies major. So I can pull out the linguistics word, the rules in a while. A morphological. I haven't probably ever used that in the spoken language before, so, okay. That's blue. That's blue. Uh, let's talk about insult comedies. So, uh, you've done roasts before I in rows,

Speaker 4:          01:08:17       which, which roasts, what are some risks that you've participated in Joan Rivers? I did David Hasselhoff. I did, uh, Donald Trump. And now roasts are, I mean, just if those seem like treasure troves of material. Well, it's interesting because whenever someone thinks that that is always a trap because it's too obvious. Yes. Too obvious. So Donald Trump, everyone's gonna do hair jokes. The first comment is going to do all the hair joke. So by the time I go up six, I have to have some other angle that nobody's even have to think of. Like the butterfly effect. Yes, exactly. So we start with the hair, but I went more for the, you know, Russian mail order bride, wife five to go to like a totally different angle or, you know, you're totally, I've got to go to this like weird angle. And you know, John River is, everyone's going to laugh at the same thing.

Speaker 4:          01:09:05       And, and um, and David Hasselhoff is actually kind of tricky because he's just more of a general, he's just silly, you know, like what, like what, you know, so the angle on him was tricky to get, but then there's a ton of other people on the day as to, I did that in the early, so I was a writer on the roast before I was a performer on the roast. And, um, you know, I think it's tricky because I guess I get defensive around that because maybe I have some shame because I do feel like they've gotten really mean. And the way that roast, uh, originated was actually the friars club roast, which is a bunch of comedians roasting other Comedians, Friar's Club in New York. And it was all comedians roasting other comedians. It wasn't comedians. Roasting comedians are very different than normal people there. Their brain chemistry is different. Their Migdal is different there.

Speaker 4:          01:09:53       I mean it's, I have a series of comedians should not be let out in public. They're dangerous. They're like armed and day. They're just not safe. I mean, it took me a silver tongue. It just fell adjusted. It just took me a long time to realize you can't talk to regular well adjusted people the same way you talk to comedians. Cause we were like, hey asshole, what's up? And we just make fun of each other. And that sort of, it's not healthy, but that's sort of how we show love to each other is that we rip each other and make fun of each other. And, uh, you know, and it's, it's, it's funny because actually you'll know this is that, you know, Brian Callan, which is how I know you own, which you met him on, what was it through apple Tinder, we first connected. It was, it was, it was very funny.

Speaker 4:          01:10:34       First we met on Grindr, most of his photos did not involve his face. And then we met again on Thrinder, which is Tinder for threesomes. And finally we were like, you know, not that attracted to each other, but we share a lot in common. It's just books and drink some coffee, be friends. I actually don't know. I don't recall how I first met Brian. I, yeah, this is like common issue for me. Just sort of creeps into your life in a very insidious way. Yeah. He's like a bill due or like an STD shows up. You don't know why. And you just spend the rest of your life trying to get rid of him. Um, so I remember him, you know, he, and, uh, Brendan have a podcast yet, which I think you've done right. And I remember going on the podcast and Collin and I, I was just, we were trashing each other.

Speaker 4:          01:11:24       I mean, it was like bad. I mean, and then Brendan, who's not a comedian and I'm trashing him and I know when he's like, are you guys fight it? I mean, like it does look like a lawful, and then I'm sort of treating Brendan the same way. And Brendan was like so insulted and upset and it was just, I was like, oh my God. Like, sorry. It's a completely different language. So the roasts, again initiated with Comedians, roasting Comedians, and then when it got on comedy central, all of a sudden they start bringing in like Pamela Anderson and you know, just these perfectly nice people with feelings who aren't numb to the core and you aren't sociopaths. Right? And so when you start mixing that, that's when it started getting, you start seeing people getting their feelings hurt and you know, and also again, Comedians, I actually are more sensitive than anyone. So when you start having people who aren't comedians making fun of us, it's like, oh no, you haven't earned the right to call me up. You don't have your straps. Jeff Ross can call me a whore,

Speaker 2:          01:12:19       call me more. It's like all of a sudden we have these boundaries. Well, that's, well, that's funny you mentioned that because it's like, I am. Okay. There was this piece in the New York Times, which was a, uh, sort of a, it wasn't a takedown piece because it was too funny. It was like a parody piece, uh, related to the four hour body. And the guy was like, it's like the New England, uh, what would he say? It was like the New England Journal of health or something like that. I was hijacked by the skymall catalog or whatever, and he was like, actually very funny stuff. Didn't bother me at all. But then there's someone who tries to be funny, but it's not a good writer who slams me. And I'm like, no, no, no. If you're Gunna do it, yeah. If you're gonna do it, do it. Well,

Speaker 4:          01:12:57       I always say, uh, in order for a roast joke to work, it has to be funnier than it is mean. Ah. So if it's not funnier than it is mean, it's always going to bomb. So it's like you're walking this tightrope of like, if you're going to make it a joke, at better be an a plus joke. If you make a c h joke, you get a boo. If you make an April, which is sort of what I like. Excuse me, I'm being attacked by bugs. Um, something that I loved about the roast is sort of the math of it. Cause those jokes are all math jokes. You know what I think about the adding and subtracting a word can completely change the response there. They basically tight Catskills jokes. For example, one of my favorite jokes, I'm cause I won't say my own jokes, cause that would be narcissistic and give me shame.

Speaker 4:          01:13:37       So I'll say one of my favorite, uh, Rose Comedians, Jeff the ledge, Greg Geraldo, he had a joke for ice tea once. He said ice tea. You're so old. You used your first residual check to buy your freedom, which is just a brilliant joke. Um, but it's all math, you know, it's just set up turn, you know. Those were the kind of jokes that, uh, you know, we do with the roasts where it's like a few, any other word combination would not be as funny. Yeah. You know, you change one word. Um, I remember, uh, some more, I wrote this joke that was, it's a horrible, really dark joke, but, um, I said, uh, it was a flavor flavor host. I was right around that. And it was, the joke was flave you look like what Magic Johnson should look like. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:14:23       So I wrote that joke and she delivered it in a way that it moms, she was like, you look like how Magic Johnson should be looking right now. And it's just too many words. So I, yes, I love the economy of words. You can take two words out and use a different screen laughing and pause. Break. Yeah. So that kind of stuff is still feel like Twitter is good training for that. Interesting. Yeah. I've, I've been astonished when I tried to draft something and I'm like, God damn it, you know, negative 23, oh, how do I get what I want to keep it, I want to keep it and then I trim it down and I'm like, it's so much better. Yeah. Concision is Yep. 100%. So I love that is sort of something I loved about the roast ultimately. Um, you know, I think that rose, so I think it's important to know when to to stop doing something.

Speaker 4:          01:15:12       You know, one of my favorite Steve jobs things is what I don't make is just as important as what I do make sure, right? Like what you say no to is just as has just as big of an impact on your career. So I did three of them and it felt like, you know, that was, I was getting known as the roast girl and I was getting known as this insult mean insult comic. And I'm not like that at all. I'm like the super fragile sort of scare Burson and I would have by being an airport and someone be like, Hey Kotton I'd be like Whoa, it's two o'clock on a Tuesday. Like if people just thought they could talk to me like that and it would really freak me out. It's crazy. People would say that. Words like that to me on the street, it's so wild.

Speaker 4:          01:15:49       I mean it's, it's very unusual dynamic. Obviously when you're public facing and people feel like they know you intimately and in some cases they, they might right. If they've read all your stuff, washed all your stuff, they actually probably know quite a lot about you but you can have that type of experience or like I'll have guys come up to me in the like I'll be taking a piss at a urinal and some guy like come up and like give you a slap on the back and start like kind of breathing into my, you're talking to me as if he's like my buddy from high school. Never. Yeah. Speaking with there. I did. Granted, I did respond to that for a good time call and the inside of the bathroom I was in an airport, you know, surprise me, especially in the airport. I'm thinking security, the guy must work here.

Speaker 4:          01:16:31       Isn't that a violation of some kind of TSA regulation? But uh, it is very interesting because I think, uh, you know, when it's so rewarding to be able to share the intimate details of your life with people and help people laugh at it or in your case, help them, you know, with their confidence or their business or their goals or whatever. But people laugh at me and then to sort of compromise this level of privacy. It's, it's usually okay for me, but I just don't have very thick skin. And I have this theory that the third thing someone says, a stranger says to you is always an insult. Hey, such a big fan. Love your work. You're so much bigger

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       in person. Cause the third one is always there. Honest answer. The first two is just their adulation. So I always try to just get out after the second compliment. That's really, that's really funny. Yeah. I was listening to, uh, I'm an avid consumer of, of stand up. Definitely afraid of ever doing it. That's a, that's something maybe talking about, but uh, I think it was, I was other Demitri Martin or Mitch Hedberg love I think when they're saying, you know, when like when I take photos I like to count to five because that's when people get real play one here. It's coming to the last tier three smile for what? Five, what the fuck. And then I take the photo. So fun. I'd like to meet Jay. Demetrius linear. Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:17:55       Great. He has a lot of great photo jokes. He was, he's like, I love a camera phones cause you can reminisce immediately.

Speaker 3:          01:18:03       We were so young. He has his, a lot of good word play jokes too. So it's like

Speaker 4:          01:18:08       delightful, playful joke.

Speaker 3:          01:18:10       Yeah. Like the silent, the silent G. Yeah. We use that screw up foreigners like in foreigner. I'm right there, you know. So

Speaker 4:          01:18:18       hello. It's such a, um, you know, there's a lot of different kinds of comedy. I had a sort of argument about this with someone recently. It was a kind of notion would come you so negative, you know, and it was like there's a lots of different kinds of comedy is just like, there's lots of different kinds of music and art and whatever. Um, but you know, Dimitri and, and um, Zach Galifianakis and uh, Mitch Hedberg and Steven Wright are in this sort of Ashkelon of certain, this playful tickling sort of stuff. I mean, like Dimitri, one of my favorite jokes of his, his, he's like, you know, it's like people always want to show me photos of their kids and then I show them photos of their kids and

Speaker 3:          01:18:50       think I'm weird. I mean it's just little stuff like that that's sort of

Speaker 4:          01:18:54       fantastical, surreal comedy should the economy to it. I mean, which I really like also. It's like precise Haiku comedy. Yeah. It's very fun. It's repeatable. There's something democratic about it cause you can, you can't rehearse, say one of my beds to someone that's long and convoluted and requires too much. It requires too much narrative practice. It's physical. You know, there's also a guy named Dan [inaudible] who tells the kind of jokes that you can easily suppose. Man's m. I. N. T, z. He wrote for Louis C K show on HBO. Uh, he's doing something now, but, um, he has a great show. Kiko is a, it's a little bit, you know, blue, but he goes, um, he goes, you know, it'd be really confusing if someone was performing an abortion and someone ran in and yelled, abort a horse.

Speaker 3:          01:19:41       Oh God, that is blue. It's very fun. It's obviously a joke, you know, but it's just one of those is you hear it once and you can repeat it a parties forever, you know, it's like the one, I'm not, not to make this the Dmitri Martin's show, but yeah. Uh, the, uh, the one, uh, I think this is all on the same album too, and I'm blanking on the name of the album, but he says, he says like, you know, it's along the lines of, you know, like

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       what does it, what does a Dalmatian think when he sees a cow? You're like, am I hiring? And then the cows, like he looks amazing. I like to tell the ground over here. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:20:21       it was like a part of your brain that's never activate like things where you're like, I've never thought about that. But I mean think about it. People like us and anyone who's listening to this is probably an overthinker, but we've thought of everything, you know, we've overthought everything 50 times. And so when someone puts of the visual in your mind that you've literally never entertained, it's just so like, it's like being a kid again or something. That's what I feel watching it.

Speaker 2:          01:20:42       Mitri uh, the um, the roast. Yes. Thinking Bruce, part of what makes them so different now aside from the fact that you have non comedians being like harpooned by 20 professionals is a, that it's preserved. So instead of being in a club with an expiration date, that was the end of the day. It's on youtube, comedy central forever. Good plant and a very different sort of persistence. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:21:11       Well also I see the roasts as more of a sport. Like, it's like watching boxing or football or something where you're watching someone, you know, get schooled and someone comes back and bites him back and you know, it's, I think that activates that very primal part of your brain of kick his ass. Yeah. You know, and I think I, you know, it started getting so nasty and, and I think the roasts were better. They're better when you're the underdog, you know? And people like to see a Rudy come on, you know? So I for it, but in my first roast and it was like, who's this girl? And then I, you know, came out of the gate and like knew what I was doing. And then when I started to sort of, it was like my, I had an acumen for it and people start to expect all of a sudden when people expect you to be good, I think we're down.

Speaker 4:          01:21:51       So then they think either you suck, you're like, wait a minute, you thought it was great when you never heard of me, now you've heard of me, and now you want, you know, everyone wants to build you up. So they can just tear you down. Yeah. And then I felt like, okay, right. It's good to know when to go out and, um, and I'm sure she'd be fine with me sharing this, but then the last, the Donald Trump rose, Lisa Lampanelli and I, we just cried after the roast. We were like, it was just two below the belt. It was like, yeah. You know, the Goto for me and I, again, I've been in the writer's room of the roast. I know the math of it. I know that it's like we're going to make fun of what you look like. I try to not make fun of things about people that they can't control as a general rule.

Speaker 4:          01:22:29       Yeah. Cause it just feels a little too mean. Um, with the exception of some jokes I wrote about carrot top, but come on. Um, uh, but I regret those and then I feel bad about them. Um, and that one was just a little below the belt. It was like people were calling me a slut. Like I was in a relationship at the time. It was just like, what are you doing? Like this didn't cause an argument. Like it was just, it's so salacious and incendiary that I felt like I, it was, I was so, it just hurt my feelings after awhile. And Lisa Lampanelli and I were both like, she had just lost all this weight and they used to make fun of how, you know, that she was overweight and she had lost weight and now they're making five skin. It was just like, oh, you can't win. It's whack them all. Yeah. You know? So, uh, we were like, I think it's probably good to switch. Take a break. Yes. Switch sports.

Speaker 5:          01:23:18       What, um, what would you do if you had, say this is all hypothetical, obviously eight weeks you take someone who's never done standup but has spent a little bit of time on the stage. Yeah. Let's call that person a friend of mine. I, he just wondering for myself, uh, eight weeks to get them ready to do five minutes on stage at like an open mic. Right. Uh, what would you do?

Speaker 4:          01:23:48       Uh, that's a great question. I would get them on stage the first night, the first night. Yep. First Day of eight weeks. Yep. Okay. And this entire, every night for all of the eight weeks, whether they had material or not, because the material is like 10% of it being comfortable on stage. It's all of it, you know. So I would say just get on stages. I say always say the first year and a half, two years of standup is just getting comfortable on stage here. Material doesn't matter. Like it's like, um, uh, boxing or whatever, you know. Um, but, uh, I would just say get on stage as much as possible and um, because your material and the for the first couple of years is never going to, no one's ever going to see it, you know, it's just an excuse to get up there.

Speaker 4:          01:24:30       Um, and I would also ascertain where they are in terms of their self awareness and PR and opinion. Like I would ask them 50 questions about where they're from, what makes them different. Because I think a lot of people have this dysmorphic view about what's interesting about them. So I have this girlfriend, she's a comedian. Uh, and what was the thing? Oh, uh, she goes on stage and she was talking about like smoking pot and hooking up with guys and you know, she's sort of a younger comedian and it was just sort of everyone kind of does that. And then later I found out that she was a competitive diver in college and I was like, why don't you talk about that? I have in your mind to that. And she's like, oh no, I mean it just seems boring. I'm like, no one else has that.

Speaker 4:          01:25:09       Like I'll do it if you don't do it, I'm stealing it. You know, like a lot of people, a lot of times people don't know what's interesting about them. So it takes a while. Cause I think we all, you know, are so sick of ourselves in some ways are we inflate things and deflate other things and have denial about things. Um, so tap into what's makes you, you and why. What's interesting about you also help you figure out, it took me a long time to realize that as soon as you get on stage, you need to address what the audience is already thinking. I was just going to ask

Speaker 5:          01:25:37       if you like if you grabbed the gun and shoot yourself with it before.

Speaker 4:          01:25:40       Yup. Yup. So they, uh, I don't know who says this quote that um, comedians become comedians so they can control why people laugh at them. Just so interesting. So for me, I really, I wish I could do that. I need this skill. I realized right away that people thought my last name being Cummings was funny. Yeah. And I didn't never understood. So I get onstage and I started talking and then I'd be like, oh, my last name is comics. Everyone start laughing. Like she just put the needle in the balloon. Now

Speaker 3:          01:26:06       I can move on. You know, your tweets. What was it? I wouldn't let any husband take my last name unless it's first name is Dick thought that was pretty good. Always held out as husband took her last name. I think. I was like, thinking about it. Um, you know, cause I always say like, people are like, do you wanna get married? I'm like, I just want to change my last name. You don't have to marry me, but can I just take your last name? We don't have to sign anything and my last name be verus bleed. Um, but I have, I am grateful to that last name because I think at a very young age I had to learn to defend myself against ridicule. So I, you know, had to get quick. Witted um, so how would you do an inventory for someone to figure out what those things are about them? Yeah, so you can like slay the pink elephants before they have a chance to, like I would ask,

Speaker 4:          01:26:48       right. I would, um, you know, I'm very, uh, very direct person. Like I remember seeing a, you know, there's a lot of like, um, I don't know what is the social and the politically correct thing to say. Is it little people now?

Speaker 3:          01:27:01       Is it not endorsed? I don't know what the proper term is. A little people. Okay. I think midgets, not the m word is the new n word. And we're definitely not, and not the Amara calling her calling food oriented. I, it's a little people. So a friend of mine,

Speaker 4:          01:27:22       it's a little person and he's a comedian and uh, he goes on stage and he's just like, so I was with this girl then I was like, you, your first 10 minutes is talking about being a little barbs barbicide now how do you prevent that from being much like going after Donald Trump for the hair, right? Two obvious. Like they expect you to do that. Well, first you have to, I mean it's, you know, a lot of people say standup is like sex, but like you have to be in

Speaker 3:          01:27:48       it's really malicious and very, really malicious and violence and like 10 minutes long. Um, uh, basically you have to admit it to, what am I staying? Secret to happiness is low expectations. Please four hour work week, the four minutes, um,

Speaker 4:          01:28:06       and, but you have to understand what their needs are and be able to feed and ascertain. Like I say, so much of comedy is just listening and it's a conversation. It seems like a monologue ostensibly, but it's actually a conversation so you're constantly checking in with them. I always tell a lot of comedians who in the beginning aren't doing well and I'm like, well, are you making eye contact with the people in the crowd? And there was like, no. I'm like, oh, it's so intimate. Like you have to, I mean, I literally look all of them in the eyes all the time. It's, you're constantly checking in, constantly checking in. The sound is one thing, but you also have to be checking in with them and knowing what they need from you, you know? And so for me, the first couple years I had to address the last name, Cummings in the beginning everyone was like, cool, we don't have to think about this anymore because other people did too. They just hit Cummings is her last name, comma, and then they're distracted. So you just have to take it off the table or we, can we move on here? Okay. My last name is Cummings. Now let's get to some other stuff. I've always, it's one of these things where you think it's going to get old. I'll you what it is, it's

Speaker 3:          01:29:01       Jim Gaffigan's voice that he does to imitate the crowd. Yeah, exactly. It's so empowering. That's freedom. Yeah. And just the, yeah, I just thought it was such a, it's such a, uh, such a clean, that kind of elegant way

Speaker 4:          01:29:19       the audience in on nail it. Yes. You know? Yeah. It's so great because it, it just, it takes the elephant, like you said, out of the living room. You know, another thing I did recently and just when I kind of thought, okay, enough, people know me, I don't have to. Um, so I, this is such a weird thing to say. Uh, I like get like, I mean I put a lot of, I take good care of my skin. I try at least.

Speaker 3:          01:29:40       But one of the crowd questions was, how is your, how do you get your skin so glowing? So maybe, so maybe you could explain,

Speaker 4:          01:29:47       talk about that. Um, but, but sometimes on stage it I look really shiny and I look all the time, we know that this is what you're, I mean I can't totally, but you look just like your my face cause you look good. You're just like an orb of light. Yeah but the same as me so I get really shiny and then one time I was on stage and I was like do I look really shiny? And everyone just burst out laughing because it was like the elephant in the living room. I'm like why is she wet coming from a storm? And I was like Oh my God you guys, I'm not wearing any makeup. And I put like cream like oil on before I came onstage number was like oh like it was like now we can talk about that. We can move on right now. I can pay attention to what you're saying. Totally. So it's like just sort of being able to have that kind of self awareness, which is, it's hard because it's like you want self awareness but you don't want self absorption. You want to be able to self reflect would not be a narcissist. You have to, you know, it's, it's, it's a delicate balance. I think I would also work,

Speaker 3:          01:30:39       who are some comedians who come to mind like right off the bat, I'm sure, I mean there are a lot of really good comedians out there, but just like offhand, people who are good at walking that tightrope between self aware

Speaker 4:          01:30:50       and self absorbed. Ooh, good. Um, good, good, good, great question. David. Tell, Oh yeah, David Tell I couldn't have more love for David towl. No, kind of, I feel like he's not, he doesn't penetrate, I mean too much emotionally. Like I feel like Dave's not super vulnerable, at least onstage, offstage. He is. Um, but I would say like is a great Greg Bill Burr Bill Burr Wilbur is a monster and he has this great ability to, I mean he's, you know, on stage is somewhat obsessive and neurotic and you know, he's got podcasts and he, you know, um, gets really obsessed with things, but he's able to move on real quickly and not make it about him. It's, he's not myopic, you know, he's a

Speaker 3:          01:31:40       really good at responding to the crowd too. And he'll say something and he's really, really good and he'll go, Ooh, I lose Ya. You were with me and now I feel like you're pulling it

Speaker 4:          01:31:49       when he does that because even in it, and it's such a, you know, maybe this will interest your fans that, that he is one of my favorite comedians to watch because he will almost ordain a bombing so that he can, because he's so successful now and I've seen him be on stage and just be killing and he's like, that wasn't that funny. You're laughing cause he wants, he'll like premeditated. He, he'll sort of like Holby like black people are different and people go ooh. And he'll be like, just let me, so he'll throw at something so incendiary that he loses the crowd like on purpose just so we can get them back. Which is so cool because it's like what do you do when you're that skilled is you have to keep it so you don't plateau. You have to keep creating Roy Jones jr at his peak when he would just like drop his arms and do these like rooster fighting posture is cause he's like, how do I make this interesting for myself?

Speaker 4:          01:32:37       100%. That's exactly it. You know, I, it doesn't Laird Hamilton, uh, uh, swim with a cement block. He does exercise, uh, in pools underwater with weights. Yeah. Something like Riddick where you're just like, oh, you're just bored at this point. Um, so I'll see him, he'll throw something out where he'll be like, you know, maybe the Holocaust was good for us. And then everyone's like, Ooh. And he's like, well, and then he gets a Mac. Right. You know, and it's like he'll throw something out that you think is like the point of no return. You think like his career is over and, uh, and then he gets a Mac, you know, so he's so cool, but he's not like, you know, a narcissist. He's not stuck in his own. I think one of the biggest dangers, you know, as a comedian, and I always worry about comedians who aren't friends with other comedians because we're who we check each other and keep each other sort of sane is when comedians get to sequestered they, or any big personality or someone with opinions who ends up being surrounded by staff and the Jim Carey's of the world who gets sequestered and all of a sudden they have no point of reference with reality and that kind of lose touch.

Speaker 4:          01:33:42       Um, you know, so bill is also great about, he's in the trenches is the comedy store every night. He's talking to people. I mean, he's, that's part of the reason I think is, you know, comedy song decisive. Who are some of the most underrated comedians? Great question. Um, uh, great question. Sebastian. Maniscalco that's a hell of a name. It's a hell of a name a, I'll send you his stuff. He's, um, he's just n I. S C a. L c o Sebastian is, uh, I encourage any creative people to watch him because he is all Calco. He, uh, has some Italian, uh, blood and he's almost like a Brian Regan or like a more flamboyant Jerry Seinfeld. He's completely clean. And I, this isn't, he's one of my favorite comedians. So I hope this doesn't come off pejorative, but he almost doesn't have jokes per se. Like if you were to transcribe his act, you wouldn't see jokes.

Speaker 4:          01:34:43       Huh? It's so much in his performance and essentially his sort of thing is just discussed with humanity, like whole, and I'm not going to embarrass myself by doing his act, but he'll just say like, uh, he'd be like, so, uh, anybody have the, uh, the Blue Ray? Like, and he'll just like say facts about the blue it right. His just, his point of view is so specific and authentic and he's so genuinely angry that it's just hilarious. So it's like whatever you are, be that if you're annoying, be that if you're a republican, it'd be like, whatever it is, exaggerate what you already is. As long as you're pretending to be someone you're not, and the audience knows. So stand up is the ultimate exercise and accepting exactly who you are, as ugly as it is, as long as you tell the truth they're in, because they can tell, most people can tell when you're, which is why equine therapy is actually been really helpful for me.

Speaker 5:          01:35:37       So talk to me more about the horses. What's, what's going on. So, so the metastatic

Speaker 4:          01:35:44       oh yeah, it's smashing. It's got to go. If, if any comedy nerds want to know more, um, underrated people, uh, Sebastian Maniscalco is great. Um, Gerard Carmichael is great. I think he's probably, um, you're going to be hearing his name a lot more soon. Natasha Ligero is very funny. Tig Notaro I'm sure you guys all know her by now. Um, crystal Leah, I'm a fan. Uh, you probably already know him. Um, Brian Callan is actually overrated. I would say.

Speaker 3:          01:36:15       Um, this is where retractable claws to eviscerate our friend. And you're like, I know. He's our friends. That's why I'm going to humiliate him.

Speaker 4:          01:36:28       I'm Neal Brennan cocreated, the Chappelle show with Dave Chappelle had, has now started doing stand up and it's super, um, incisive and funny, uh, commentary on race and gender that very few white people can get away with.

Speaker 5:          01:36:43       Yes. That's hard to get away. He's very hard to get away with a win. Especially if you look like me. American history. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:36:51       You're kind of asking for very unfavorable media covering American.

Speaker 5:          01:36:56       Go buy it. Well, you know, I'll take it that it must be because my skin is so luscious and well, yeah, I mean between your skin and my skin. I mean we are, we need to turn the AC on. I want to, so I will come back to the equine therapy, but before we get there, I want to come back to the eight week training program. Right. So for your friend? For my friend Jim, Sarah's, uh, I, because for instance, and I think I'm probably not the only person with this insecurity, but I don't feel like a very funny person and, and I worry about, so for instance, there are certain circumstances that literally like maybe three where I'm like, someday if I ever do stand up, this could be funny. But there are so few of them that I'm like, wow, I would be, I would just get, I'd be roadkill. We tried to go up for five minutes and actually one of them earlier before we started recording, you came out of the bathroom and you're like, I just want to,

Speaker 3:          01:37:52       I did not create the mess in there. Uh, and so, you know, my thing has been like, what do you do when you like walk into the bathroom and some like bashful person comes out and the next scurries away and then you walk in, you're like, this is a fucking disaster. But like, I'm in an airplane and somebody is behind me. I fucking clean it up. Or do I leave it? Like, I'm not going to have a conversation after it. Right, right. But I only have like two or three of those over several decades of being on the planet. Right. How do you come up with, here's the good news.

Speaker 4:          01:38:19       Yeah. She'll love is it's a muscle. Okay. So the more you work at the stronger I guess, and then you'll be like me and you'll be haunted by everything you look at. All you can think of is how to make it a joke. You know, it starts being more and more and then you're up at night and like you're having sex with someone and you're like, oh, this would be a good joke. And you're like, oh my God, can I just get a second? Anatomies yeah. So it starts becoming like pretty relentless. But yeah, it's a muscle. Like any muscle, you know, the first couple of weeks you go to the gym, you're going to be a little sore.

Speaker 3:          01:38:44       So what is the, if it's the muscle, if it's a muscle, what is the workout look like? What are potential exercise

Speaker 4:          01:38:50       to potential exercises is, um, you know, I remember like when I first started, I would like go around my house and be like, Trashcan, what's funny about a trash can? Like what's I think the best way to do it is to, which is also helps to, um, what's the word? Uh, uh, when you, um, when you, I'm making weird

Speaker 3:          01:39:07       yeah. Model you're making, you're making hand gestures. It looks like a squid called debate.

Speaker 4:          01:39:17       When you cultivate your voice, figure out what interests you. So what I would first do is figure out what pisses you off so people's limitations piss you off the airport. Bathrooms piss you off. What pisses you off? Because I always say comedy is for the most part just an obsession with injustice. So most comedians have a very deep obsession with injustice. This isn't fair. And that's what we get on stage and talk eight, unless you're Demitri Martin and Mitch Hedberg and you're sort of doing those sort of one liner, a sort of more playful, surreal jokes. Um, so what pisses you off? And you know, Louis Ck says, if you think about something more than three times a week, you have to write about it. What's, yeah, what's haunting you? What's plaguing you? What's pissing you off? What do you spend most of your time thinking about anyway? So, um, you know, you can't stand your ex boyfriend and you are ex girlfriend and she's posting photos on Facebook and anything that pisses you off

Speaker 3:          01:40:13       just cause I was on grinder grind, me and I have a boyfriend. Let's be clear. There you go. Whatever. I know you're not monogamous. That's what they say on the message boards. Schreiner um, I did some research, so it's actually, whereas

Speaker 4:          01:40:29       most, and it's interesting, I remember it, you or listen to a, one of your podcasts episodes where you were talking about negative thinking. There's positive thinking, but then the uh, I'm going to botch it and plagiarize it horribly. But the power of negative thinking to prevent or something, it's almost like common pursing the worst case scenarios to avoid them, which is so cool to me. So I always say that comedy is like a very delicate combination of positive thinking and incredibly negative thinking because you know, you take the toilet thing and then you times that times a million and you go to it's worst extreme of what's the worst possible thing that could happen, the catastrophe. And then you make it a joke. So I, you know, you mentioned Louis C K I feel like he has gotten a lot better at infusing the positive. Uh, and I, again, I'm not, this is just going from some of, uh, some of his albums, which are still very fun.

Speaker 4:          01:41:23       But then getting on say a late night show and talking about like, everything's awesome and nobody, nobody's happening the Wifi on the airplanes. Yeah. Well he's also, I mean, it's interesting because comedians are also human beings who grow and change. So, you know, a lot of people say you about Howard Stern in the 90s. He was much angrier because he was in a bad marriage and now he's in a great marriage and he's much happier, you know, so it's also, you know, I think you have to be very flexible in your standup. So my first hour, I mean I was 26 or something, so I wasn't even a person yet. But, uh, I was very like, I thought it was right about everything. And you know, in your twenties you think you know everything and you know, I was like loud and you know, um, and then my second special I had sort of life had kicked my ass a little bit and I was more humble and I was more like, I don't know anything, you know, my neck specialists sort of in and even more so all of my specials are just, so it's a different person in each one, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:42:11       So, um, you know, Louis C K I think now that he's gotten so successful and so exalted in lauded, it's like he's almost like, you know, just a different guy who was 10 years ago. Yeah. He has less anger and he's able to come from a different perspective. So I also think it's important to not become a parody of yourself and to be able to be flexible. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's why when people ask me, for instance, uh, how would you edit your first book? [inaudible] uh, if you went back to edit it. Yeah. This has come up because the 10th anniversary is coming up in about two years. And my answer is almost always, I wouldn't edit much because I wrote it when I was 29 and I was in a different place in my perspectives have shifted. Yeah. Yeah. But that book strikes a chord with a lot of people who are facing similar thanks to, I tried to rewrite it now I don't have the kind of boots on the ground experience with those issues right now to the extent that I did then. And I would fuck it up. Right, right, right, right. I would rob it of that kind of immediate relevance. Um, that's interesting. What, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:43:17       what would you do night of? So eight weeks past? Yep. Okay. All right. Got a crowd, not just your mom, not just your friend or the novice. This is for the novice you've taken from ground zero over eight weeks. But just so you know, over the eight weeks, I'm having them go up every night, whether they're bombing or not. Three spots a night, at least three spots on stage. Three times you're driving to three different things. Three different clubs. You're driving to a club, to a coffee house, to a bowling alley. When I first started for the first three years was doing bowling alleys, parking lots, uh, Sushi restaurants, just ambush a, what is that with these Audis? Probably easier to get it for you to get away with the drunk guys lie. Oh Hey, I shanked a couple times they got amazed. Um, but no, in La, I mean, and this was the time of my space.

Speaker 4:          01:44:14       So it was a time when there was all these, you know, shows at restaurants and bowling alleys and laundromats and people would just do these sorts of shows everywhere. And I would say, can I get on? And you just had to constantly hustle and you're my spacing all day to get spots and then driving around all day, all night to do them, you know, sometimes three minutes, sometimes whatever. And uh, your first minute is going to make or break you for the most part if you're doing a short set. So doing three minutes set is enough practice cause that first minute is the key because as soon as you get, it's like a first impression of anything. If you get onstage and you have power and you have status, it doesn't really matter after that. But if you go on stage apologetic and scared and codependent, yeah. Even the best materials and Obama.

Speaker 4:          01:44:55       Yeah. So I say that first minute, it's kind of what counts the most. So, um, so, uh, doing three spots a night for eight weeks and recording your sets and listening to them, uh, not only to sort of get it into your memory, but also to see what's really getting laughs. Sometimes we hear that we're bombing, we're actually getting laughs or we hear the lots are smaller. It's just important to listen to it back. You're actively later when you're not sort of in the sort of deer in the headlights. Yes. And um, and then the day of when I do an hour at night or when I do two hours a night, when I'm doing, I'm getting ready for my hour. I don't leave my hotel room and I don't talk all day, which is like, I try not to talk on the phone. I try not to just deplete too much of my energy so that I'm super excited to get on stage and talk so that I almost am like, uh, what would the metaphor be like?

Speaker 4:          01:45:42       Um, a boiling pot? No. Of Balloon? No, I'm not sure what you're going to be either of those. Depends what comes up. I mean like when you're like chomping at the bit. Yeah. You know, I kind of deprive myself. It's almost like starving yourself before meal. You know? Like I kinda like sit in my hotel room all day. I just do work. I don't talk on the phone so that I'm super amped to talk. So I would say like, don't go out to dinner first. Don't go to lunch, hang out, watch TV. Yes. Exactly. Deprive yourself. So by the time you get onstage, you're just like super connected and human connection you have all day. Yes. Craving intimacy, you know, instead of shutdown. And you've already filled your, um, quota for connection all day. And when do you know that your material is ready for three minutes set? In other words, someone that hasn't even done the, what's funny about a garbage can. Yeah. Like we're talking, it's like RF Ferris, you're on in an hour. Do I get up and do, what the fuck do I talk about? Well, here's the thing. You're already, you're already naturally funny, so you're and you're smarts, so you're going to be fine because you're going to, I mean, uh, um, pending any, uh, anxiety attacks.

Speaker 4:          01:47:02       I think I'm the only funny one. I'm not trying to be fun. Here's the thing, I feel like you are a public speaker naturally. I mean, you're very good at this. Like, I mean in front of a crowd, I mean, you're not gonna have a problem. Um, and you're going to react to the situation and be honest and self deprecate and whatever or like, um, but I think the only time you really get in trouble is when you attach yourself to a script and are flexible, right? So if you're like, go off on a thing of, Oh, you know who I am, you read my, if someone heckles you, I've read your book and now you're right. And then you're like, so I was at the supermarket today. And if you can't respond in a conversational, present way, it's like boxing. Yep. Like if someone throws some new, you got to change your combination or whatever it is. You have to be relentlessly present. And flexible and detached from your plan. So it's make a plan and then be ready to completely

Speaker 5:          01:47:52       adaptive, adaptive needed with the your essay two hours a night. Yeah. Right. Let's see. You're getting now you're getting ready. Do that. And uh, well two I guess two very related questions. So you have the two hours a night in preparation for like recording the big special yes. Is that right? Yes. Then you have like the night of recording the big special yes. What are your pregame rituals look like? Love it. Like in the two hours before each of those? Yeah. What happened?

Speaker 4:          01:48:18       So in the two hour, okay. So I am right now I'm touring to get ready for my HBO special, which I'm shooting in August. So every other weekend I'm on the road. Uh, in clubs I like to a performance, small spaces to really ascertain if things are working and seeing people's faces. Like, cause you can, in a theater you can get an applause break, but when you're up close and you see someone you can't fake laughter, you can't fake it, bottle it. Imagine if you have

Speaker 5:          01:48:43       30 people, if you have 200 people, 10 people clap really loudly, you think you're killing it. Whereas if you have 30 people in, one person clapped yet. Oh Shit.

Speaker 4:          01:48:51       Yeah, exactly. So, but if you get a theater, you get sort of this false sense of bravado and false sense of success. Whereas like when you're in a club, like people are drinking and they're eating at, you know, it's like you're up against more. So I like to practice in clubs and uh, and so when the day actually comes, I will, I have two dogs. I will send them with the dog people so that they're not in the house, um, for those two days because they'll wake me up early or the whole, you know, whatever. Um, even though they provide me with a lot of emotional support, um, just avoiding any curve balls. Um, and I'll wake up, I'll do my normal routine. I'll probably, I'll listen to the set a couple times, even though I know it inside and out, just more, because I know I'm neurotic.

Speaker 4:          01:49:34       So this is a previous performance. I'd like the hour that I'm planning on doing essentially like the script. It's like going over a script. I have it recorded and I'll go for a run, probably got it. And with it in my year, the recording is you reading the script or according as an actual performance. I got it. So I'll record all of my hours when I'm in the clubs on a voice memo on my iPhone and then I'll label them. This was good at this point. This, you know, I did this new chunk of this. I'll be really specific about which one is which. The one that I feel should be the one that's recorded. I will go for a run and listen to it in my I Pod Pad, pad phone, Samsung, sidekick, Atari, just a five phones page or pager, sky, pager. And then um, I'll kind of lie in bed. I'll take a nap, I'll eat. Uh, and that's pretty much it. Got It. And then I have to get there at four for hair and makeup and I'll meditate twice, 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes before the show, like trends and all that. You got your mantra, mantra? Yeah. Don't tell anyone. Help me. Joe Public. Oh my God, I can't believe we're sitting outside and, uh, really, um, very economical with my energy, the death.

Speaker 5:          01:50:50       And so you've got the, let's just say the warmup acts new. That's probably not, that's probably not a polite way to say it, but the opening scene, mark got the openers. You know, you're, you've got 15 minutes to go time. Yeah. What do you do in those 15 minutes?

Speaker 4:          01:51:07       That's a good question. Uh, I'm usually managing a or practicing wardrobe malfunctions. So practicing like Janet Jackson nipple exposure. Yeah. I'll walk through sort of my most extreme movements with my wardrobe, right. To make sure you know, like, you know what I mean? Uh, it's uh, what's it called? Like, um, catastrophe, a troubleshooting. Yeah. Actually, you know, um, I'll just close my eyes and meditates. Troubleshooting other residents. Catastrophe sniping. Yeah. I took what I could touch. The reason I think I like that. Um, and then sometimes something super normal because I think I'm, you know, I'm a strong believer in this. Everybody is, I'm not special cause I believe proven science, but it's very Pavlovian. So it's like all of a sudden I'm doing something I've never done before before a show, then it's gonna feel weird. So before I go on stage at the comedy store tonight, on any given night, I'm looking at Instagram, I'm on Twitter, I'm texting, so I'll do something just kind of, that I always do before I go on stage because if you put too much pressure on it, like this is a different show. Your, I'm doing the same thing I've been doing the last four months. Right, right, right. You know what I mean? And it's like, it's basically my, my work isn't done tonight. My work was done three months ago.

Speaker 5:          01:52:18       Right, right. I just have to show up. Yeah. I had, um, conversation with, uh, with, uh, Paul Levesque of residents, triple h, the professional wrestler who was on his podcast and he was telling me a story, uh, why am I blanking here? He just fought Manny Pacquiao or Floyd Mayweather Jr. Yeah. And he was saying, he was telling me a story about how he, he visited Floyd in his dressing or right before a huge fight. And he was just sitting there watching TV and he's like, oh yeah, sit down. Like, let's have a conversation. And then Paul's like, I don't want to bother

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       you. Like, I don't want you to get knocked out of the zone and blah, blah, aren't you nervous? And he's like, what good is being nervous is going to do me. It's like, if I'm not ready now,

Speaker 4:          01:52:53       yeah, hundred percent. So it's like, if I need to do some weird ritual right now, then I'm the, I big got bigger problems. Yeah. You know? So I think for me, just keeping it very simple and, um, you know, if I'm shooting a special, my mom and dad or they have to come different nights, but, um, we'll come salt, like take a picture for that or something that just feels benevolent and, and connected. And I, you know, I'm very dorky about gratitude and I'll just be grateful and I'll thank the crew and I'll talk to my director and just say thank you and like just really do whatever I have to do to go out there and just like, have a good time. I'm not taking myself seriously. I'm not stressed, I'm not in a zone. It's like I know this backwards and forwards at this point. So the only work I have to do is just be relentlessly present. And this sounds so Geeky, but I truly have to have a good time. Yeah. Um, because my work is already done. Right. You know, that's kind of the misery of standup and the joy of standup is that the, when you're actually shooting it on TV, you're just showing off at that point. There's no, you're not in the trenches. Yeah. You know, everything works. You've done it. I, anything I do on showing that I've done a hundred times. Right. And I know it works

Speaker 2:          01:53:56       well. That's part of the reason I love watching and I've seen, you know, Brian do this, but work on material. Yeah. When it's not 100%.

Speaker 4:          01:54:03       Yeah, I find that fascinating. It's pretty cool. Yeah, it's really, there is a, if you're a comedy nerd in any way, uh, Kevin Nealon does a show at the laugh factory on Tuesday nights and it's new material night. This is in loss of in Los Angeles. Yes. So, um, and I, but I think they put videos on the laugh factory website or something and it's Comedians, you know, big comedians who are only allowed to do new material and we will call each other out if I'm like, dude, I know you've been doing that joke and I know, you know, you know, cause we really try to be vulnerable and go up and do sort of fresh premises and then some of us are bombing and you know, we're really struggling and it's like being a beginner open miker again.

Speaker 2:          01:54:39       Have you seen the documentary, the comedian Jerry Seinfeld and Warnie? Yes. What is, how do you feel about [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:54:46       I love it. I love it. I love Jerry. I think his work ethic is really, um, he just kind of nailed it. I mean, you know about this more than anyone obviously, but his whole thing is just do the work. It's, yeah, there's no shortcuts. There's no, um, you know, there's a linear relationship and stand up of how much you do it and how good you are. It's super simple, very merit driven. Um, and so I like that. I like his methodical approach. I've learned a lot from him and been inspired by that. And he's also, you know, I think it's good to glamorize health cause I think in stand up especially, um, uh, drug addiction and alcoholism is so glamorized, you know, in Jerry's Kinda, he does yoga and drink smoothies and he's doesn't drink on stage. You know, he takes it very seriously, stand up as a job.

Speaker 4:          01:55:32       And I think a lot of people see it more as a hobby. Um, cause we all really just secretly want to be rock stars but aren't cool enough. Um, but you know, I think there was this generation of comedians obviously in the 70s, 80s, who were all on coke and hookers and now I think the pendulum has kind of swung, everyone's like in therapy. And Drinks Jamba juice and things like vegan. And I think that Jerry in that documentary sort of him admitting how seriously he takes it. Yeah. Like the nerd in the class who gets a straight A and all the jocks hate like, who's a loser. Like it's high school all over again. Yeah. You know, it's like he makes trying look cool. Yeah. Um, and then Arnie, you know, I think it's tricky because he just was so angry in that documentary and I, I, I worry a little bit that people were like, oh, that's how all comedians are. Right. You know? But it's a documentary and if someone thinks that that's their generalization. Yeah. Yeah. But warranty is very, very funny. And I think that that documentary, um, was a big, uh, what was it? What would it be when something is, um, uh, injury to his career? Yeah. Yeah. I think he would have been really big if it was [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          01:56:42       Yeah. That was a fascinating documentary for those who haven't seen it, but it's basically tracking. Yeah. A younger up and coming comedian with Jerry working on new material. Yes. Uh, yes. And a friend's ex girlfriend actually popped up. Yeah, I was watching it with him and he's like, wait, what is that like? No, no. She popped up. It was just her leading Jerry to the stage

Speaker 3:          01:57:03       and he's like, wait a second. Was that, it's not my girlfriend.

Speaker 5:          01:57:08       Yeah. Really bizarre shilling a twist. Let me ask, um, I don't want to chew up your entire afternoon. Uh, this is, this is really fun. So maybe we'll do round two some time, but I'd love to ask you a number one. Equine therapy. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:57:23       Well, my therapy, the horse rides you. Is that when you, how does this work? No, that's Ashley Madison. Oh, that's the how we've been through that. Catherine. The Great. Yeah. Right. So, um, okay. Actually sounded a little much. It did not come out the way I intended it to Sarah. That that's my attempt to blue comedy. And I think, you know, a successful a time, so I don't think you'd have to wait a week. You should go on tonight. You can be my warm up and he makes me angry. Horses riding women talk about it. So I, I

Speaker 4:          01:57:56       think this might interest you or interest you because, um, and I hope that I do justice to it and explain it in a educated enough way to her. It doesn't sound ridiculous, but horses are prey animals. So they are incredibly attuned to any kind of threats. I mean it's, I mean they're constantly scanning for threats, which the human brain does also. And we try to like pretend it's not, but essentially, I mean constantly they owe a horse can look at a bobcat and tell if it's hungry or not. I mean it's fight or flight one on one. You know, they can literally read faces they can read. Um, so when you are around a horse, a horse is codependent, if you will, uh, looking at you and their behavior depends on your behavior. Um, so essentially what you do in equine therapy is it's my goal was to practice being more direct and clear with my intention versus what I'm asking someone.

Speaker 4:          01:58:51       Cause you know, a lot of times, and you can't see this if you're listening to this podcast, but I'll say like, um, no, I'm fine. I'm not mad. I'm obviously mad. I mean I don't my face, I'm, I'm betraying my own face. And you know, humans tend to be manipulative and passive aggressive and say one thing and mean another thing. And I think that's something, you know, that maybe people in my field maybe do more than you know, you and what you do. You seem very like clear and effective. Great actor, pathological liar, sociopath, American psycho, American history X. Um, but I found that I was really struggling with not being with saying one thing and meaning another thing and being apologetic and not being present and not getting the results out of people that I wanted. There was a great documentary called Buck. That's about the guy.

Speaker 4:          01:59:39       Yes. It's about the guy that was the horse whisper. And essentially the whole premise of the documentary is that in order to control something, you have to give it more control. So in order to get power over someone, you have to empower them. So people bring these problem horses and they pulling them and trying to control them and the first thing he does is give them more rains and give them the opportunity to make the right decision so you can control something when you give them more control. So that really fascinated me, that documentary and the way that he was able to nonverbally communicate with horses because we waste so much time trying to verbally communicate with people. And a lot of times we just confused them. And words are so subjective and um, we talk way too much so people don't actually understand what we're saying.

Speaker 4:          02:00:24       Uh, you know, I don't know if this has ever happened to you, but I, you know, a lot of times when I'm writing a script or a TV show, I'll get notes from an executive and I'll, you know, I'm sure your editors or whatever, I'll be in a meeting for an hour and I'll walk out and I'm like, I have no idea. No idea. We spoke for an hour. I have no clue what my objective is. I don't know what the notes are. I don't know if they liked it, like we just bloviate to the point of just like be talking in circles. So, um, I went in, um, uh, with the horses, uh, a girlfriend of mine took me for my birthday. And the first thing you do is you pick a horse and there's four horses. They all various degrees of damage and backgrounds, and she tells you about each one and you choose your horse, which already says everything that she needs to know about you based on the one that you choose.

Speaker 4:          02:01:13       It's like a word shock test or something. So that's really interesting. And then the first objective is get the horses from one end to the, uh, uh, corral to the other, which is probably like half of a football field. I mean, it's big and you're like, how am I going to, hello? What's the best phone that's about phone? Um, that's, uh, Ashley Madison Customer Service. Uh, so I'm like, how do you get a heart? How do you get horses with no rain from one end to the other? Right. Right. This is crazy. Without controlling them or hitting them or, uh, you can't use treats. I can't use any of my, I can't use charm. I can't use humor. I can't use intelligence. I can't use any of the things that I rely on, on a daily basis to manipulate and beguile people. Right? And so essentially you have to use your intention so you let them know we're going to the other end.

Speaker 4:          02:02:03       You can use words if you want, as long as you're saying something and meaning it, they're going to buy it. If you're going, you know, you can't see me doing this, but if you're going like, I need you to come with me. Is that okay? If you're asked, there are no, there aren't clear. They don't trust you. You're not in charge. You don't have status. So I go and I'm, I'm leading them from one end to the other. They're following me and it's like magic. They're following me. And then halfway through I start like to see my friend, I've got to following me and they stopped and I was like, Whoa, what just happened? She, she's like, you lost your connection to them because you focused on something else. I mean, it was just this, like, it was like magic almost. It was this amazing.

Speaker 4:          02:02:38       So I just, it's a way to practice being present and connected and having a consistent intention with essentially these sort of animals that are basically a mirror to your psyche. That's very cool. It's super cool when they, when you stop focusing, they stop focusing and whenever you lie, they freeze because they don't understand why. Because they just see she's mean something, but she's saying something else and they freeze. So as soon as you're disingenuous or pretend you're not scared and you are, they just freeze and look at you like, don't get it. They're just like, grow up and you're like, oh, sorry. Let me be clear. You know, it's this really cool, uh, sort of, um, way that I think, and I'm not saying I'm one of these people, but I think that smart people who have so much therapy and we've so over therapize sometimes it's just like, keep it simple. Bread and butter. Another animal in a cage. Yeah. Yes or no. It's so primal and simple. I've almost learned so much from that than any other book or therapy I've ever done.

Speaker 5:          02:03:39       That's a for those people interested in, uh, a lot of this stuff I'm really tempted to, to experience that.

Speaker 4:          02:03:47       It's here, it's in the, the woman that I go to is out in Topanga and it's awesome. Cool. It's called the reflective horse, you know, a lot of rehab patients do equine therapy. Um,

Speaker 5:          02:03:57       while I was going, I was going to say that, uh, reflective, I think it's reflective, reflective for us, I'm taking notes, uh, is temple Grandin worked a lot with horses early on and that's how she started to realize like, wow, I'm actually very good at understanding what they need, what they're afraid of, et cetera. Um, so fast now, and you mentioned book and then you said therapy. So I'll ask you a question, which is, what book or books have you gifted to other people the most?

Speaker 4:          02:04:26       Ooh, that's a great question. I like to pretend that I read fiction and I just don't. Okay. So I went through this phase of giving people, cause I read one fiction book in the last like three years called Super Sad, true love story by Gary Shrank Art, which is phenomenal. Super Sad, true love story. Gary Sign Guard. It's super sad but very funny and I'm not super, it's, it's um, it's like a dystopian satire on the future and essentially it's like that we all have cell phones sort of embedded in our chest. And um, as soon as I see you, I can know everything about you, your cholesterol, your genetics, your dad had a stroke. Like I can know at your bank account, your credit report. Like essentially we know everything about everyone instantaneously and it's just very interesting and like could happen. Uh, and I read that because I had to, because a friend of mine who's sort of successful and has everything and had a birthday weekend and you can't get or anything.

Speaker 4:          02:05:32       So her gift, our gift to her was we all had to read the same book, which was so annoying. Don't be friends with rich celebrities. Um, it was like your homework. And I was like so annoyed and an ended up obviously being excellent. Gary Shine Guard is phenomenal. So I started giving it to everyone more as an ego, as a conglomerate, as I read fiction guys. Like I'm so every night I'm so cultured and as a pat on the back. But I don't want to mislead you into thinking I actually read fiction. I'm not that um, normal. Uh, I, you, I give the drama of the gifted child a lot, uh, to people. You know, this book has come up, I bet you just in the last week with a number of very talented, yeah, high performers. Yes. Drama, the drama of the gifted child. It's very much, yes.

Speaker 4:          02:06:23       If you're a creative person, um, if you have any kind of anxiety or discomfort or just read it, it's hard to sum up. Uh, another one I give a lot is the fantasy bond, which is incredibly dense and clinical, but it's about, uh, essentially what happens between ages one and three sort of ordained your whole life. It's kind of about attachment, um, like our attachment strategies based on how much eye contact we got as a child, how we were breastfed, how much physical contact we got, what our dynamics we walked into as a child, and uh, how we see the world according to those formative years, which is pretty fascinating stuff. Um, about, you know, I think is when you're, I think I have a lot of shame around the fact that I'm almost like an attention seeker, if that makes any sense. Like being a comedian, there's just a little bit of shame for me when it's like, why do I have this much of a compulsion to be seen and heard?

Speaker 4:          02:07:25       Like what is this? And once I got a got a handle on the fact that as a kid I wasn't seen and heard enough and I had this, I was trying to get these childhood needs met as an adult through my, once I got a handle on that understanding, it made me need it less. Right. You know, I was like, oh my God, I don't want to be famous. What am I doing? This is horrible. I'm like, you can't undo this. You know, so I feel like, you know, I, because I read this book, I took like a year off of like being on TV cause I didn't need that anymore. It wasn't like I just need to be seen as much as possible by as many people as possible. That's not unhealthy compulsion. And, and I, that backfired in some ways. So I was able to kind of take control of my self. The fantasy bond. You the fantasy Mont it's um, Firestone rubber Firestone. Maybe it's, yeah, it was recommended by, um, Mark Marin. Actually the, the, the epitome of mental health.

Speaker 3:          02:08:18       Mark is in large part responsible for me wanting to experiment with podcasting. It's so cool. It's such a great experience on his podcast. Yeah. Joe Rogan's podcast, the Nerdist podcast. I was like, oh yeah, one thing. It's really fun. Yeah. All my faves.

Speaker 4:          02:08:34       Yeah. So we were on tour together last summer and he was reading it and uh, I was sort of, I think things come in your life exactly when you need them kind of thing. Like this book, the job and the gifted child. Maybe there's something, someone obviously want the universe wants you to read this book I guess. But, uh, I was just didn't a receptive moment and he was reading it and I was like boom. And it was just the perfect time. Cool. Like, you know, I'll check it out. So I've been giving those, uh, another good one because a lot of my friends having kids, it's called the continuum concept and it's about sort of attachment parenting. Is this

Speaker 3:          02:09:07       basically like you don't, you keep the kid with you 24, seven, it's all they crawl away kind of thing.

Speaker 4:          02:09:13       Yes. And the point is, what was it called? The continuum. Continuum concept. Okay. And oddly it was recommended by my equine therapy teacher and it's about essentially the reason we, there's all sorts of chemical reasons like dopamine and oxytocin that are given off when we touch each other and especially people we love and bond with. But that if you always go to a child when they cry, they learn. If I need something, my needs will get met, I can trust that someone else will meet my needs. So attachment parenting is when your child cries, you go to them, you can't necessarily solve their problem, but they know that their voice is being heard and they feel heard. So they're more secure, they're more trusting of their environment. They don't deny their own reality as adults, essentially their expectations for the rest of their future. So

Speaker 3:          02:10:03       why did your, if you don't, let me ask you. Sure. Equine therapy instead of going to say x, I was like, oh no, no, no. Why did your the

Speaker 4:          02:10:11       equine therapy recommend that? Yeah, we um, we're talking about attachment I think, and we were talking about like, oh the horse. Like I, I didn't have trust that the horse was going to follow me or something. Like I was like kept checking in and she's like, you keep cause equine therapy is so fascinating because of what comes up the way that we, uh, relate to. It just says so much about how we try to run businesses, marriages, relationships. It's just a metaphor for everything because of the way you do anything is the way you do everything. Right. So I kept checking in and doubting that the reality that the horse was following me, I was like incredulous that it was happening. And she's like, you really question reality. You always doubt yourself and you think that your perception is wrong and that you know that the Damocles sword is going to fall.

Speaker 4:          02:10:57       You're always looking for the catastrophe. And so she was like read this book and I did to kind of get an understanding of like, oh, something must have happened. That may be constantly be like, and it's true. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop when something's going well. I'm just like looking around and said I'm enjoying the moment. I'm just waiting for the catastrophe, you know? So it was sort of about all that blue comedy really confusing to me and the expression waiting for the other shoe to drop. And I'm just like, I interesting. Well cause you know what I always think of when I think of waiting for the other shoe to drop his shoes on a phone line in a bad neighborhood. What do you think that means? Wait a second. You know, what do I think of your envisioning? That means wait.

Speaker 4:          02:11:47       Okay. I always think of bad, she was in the neighborhood when I think of waiting for the other shoe to drop. That's the vision that comes to mind. Yeah. Also, do you know what it means when shoes are hanging in a bad neighborhood? I don't know. You've seen it, right? I always thought it was just kids being dicks. But martial artist, I think I'm probably totally wrong apparently. Right. It's cause you know, like in a photo you'll see a fall in line, you'll see a pair of sneakers hanging in bad neighborhoods. Apparently it's where someone died of heroin. So you know, that's where the best heroin is. So when people see shoes hanging, thank you. I got it. Right. Ninja. I got an injury on an approved Hashtag on it. Um, and then you know, that's where you should buy heroin. Cause that's the purest stuff cause it killed someone. That's insane. Insane blue comedy.

Speaker 4:          02:12:37       That's Travis brewer. I, he brewer making a cameo. Uh, when you think of the word successful, who's the first person that comes to mind? Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs. Is that weird? I like him anyway though. So that was like on the tip of my brain brain when, okay. However, if you had, if you had to choose a second person, uh, it has to be the tip of my brain does not, I'm overthinking it. Well, I was just going to say something that is just going to open up a weird can of worms because I was Gunna say Shel Sandberg, cause I feel like she had this well rounded life and a personal life also, um, which recently imploded, um, which is not funny. Uh, but like someone who had, I think I used to define success as someone at the top of their field professionally only. And now I also view it as someone who has balanced like a good relationship with friends and family. You know, time has fun. Uh, when they're not working, they're actually not working. Um, so that's why I was thinking about her and Drew Barrymore. This is really weird, but I follow her on Instagram. She really seems to go to the beach a lot. She's got a cosmetic less, she has two kids. She seemed to have kind of nailed it. I was just like, God, it's just, that must be nice. Um, Steve Johnson, Drew Barrymore, that's you know, and Sheryl Sandberg, that's a Trifecta.

Speaker 4:          02:14:05       Motley Crue. Elon Musk is a good one. I mean I don't really know about his personal life, but he's in terms of, you know, making an impact. I think he's probably done a pretty good job.

Speaker 5:          02:14:16       Yes, you're pretty successful. He's, he's very good at betting the farm and pulling it off. Yeah. Like I mean I think you made 180 million from the sale of paypal and he took all of it and put it into three companies and had to borrow money for rent.

Speaker 4:          02:14:30       Yeah. He's like a bill burr. He keeps making himself poor so he has to get rich again. Yeah. Like how to fill bombs in comparison yet. You know, cause it's interesting cause I want to, all these comedians came to mind. Like I was thinking Richard Pryor and Louis C K and Jerry Seinfeld and I, all these comedians were coming to mind. But I think for me, because I've seen the other, what the success has cost them. Yeah. You, you know, how the sausage is made. Yes. So I don't know a lot or Steve jobs is what it costs them emotionally, family wise. So I'm a little bit naive about it. Yeah. So in job's case a lot. A Lot, I'm sure. Well, cause yeah, and it was interesting because everybody always, I think the reason I sort of latched on to him, I mean it's obviously a pretty hacky on original, uh, inspiring figure.

Speaker 4:          02:15:19       But I think when I was the boss for the first time, I think I for some reason looked up to him in a way because everyone was like, oh, he's an asshole. He's crazy. And I was like, I just, maybe everyone who's the US is crazy because no one likes their boss because they're telling them to do work, you know? And I remember people were like, oh, he was such a Dick. Like he would, you know, if something wasn't perfect, he'd make them fix it. And I'd be like, oh, what's so wrong with that? What you're supposed to do. I mean, that sounds like a great boss, you know, he sounds like a great leader, you know? And I hear all these horror stories and I think that I started getting paranoid that people thought I was difficult. And I do, you know? And I'm like, why is it difficult to say I think we can do better? Yeah. I think we can beat this joke. Like I'm not, I'm just like, I want this to be good. All of our names are on it. You're getting paid a tremendous amount of money to be here. Why am I such a jerk? You know? And I think that through the lens of people's Egos and, and feelings and stuff, it just ends up being like, oh, he's crazy. He's an asshole. You know? I'm yet to meet or know of one successful person who everyone doesn't think is crazy.

Speaker 5:          02:16:19       Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah. It's pretty much just means they're par for the course. Yeah. Generally speaking. Yeah. He's crazy. He's fucking notice a psycho. It's like, okay. Or are you just catch someone on an off day? You know what I mean? Like, I've,

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       I've met some people who are celebrities who in person every time I've seen them in interaction with other people with me, they've been great. But I'd read things about them online at some point where, you know, someone's like, oh my God, you know, I was touring with this guy and he wouldn't sign fans, autographs. He was a dick that it, I'm like, maybe just had a bad day. I like how you broke up with his girlfriend or like, who the hell knows it was in the airport. And um, you know, people were asking for pictures and I, my dad had just had a stroke and I was like, I'm just sorry I can't. And I'm sure that those people are going, she's such an asshole. Like, I'm sure they were, you know, but it's just not, you know, we just can't concern. What do you think of me is none of my business, et cetera.

Speaker 4:          02:17:07       You know, Louis C K, I don't know if you know this, it interests me. Uh, he doesn't take photos with people, but he says, I won't take a photo with you but I will talk to you for five minutes. And he says, almost everybody declined. Oh, I bet they just want the photo now. Why doesn't he do the photos? I don't know. I think it's, I don't remember. I guess, I guess maybe it's like if you're going to occupy this time, I want you to have to do some work as well. Maybe like what am I going to get out of this? Well, no, not even that, but it's just, you know, if we're going to have an exchange that's an exchange. Let's, if you want to connect, let's really connect. I think, I mean, I'm sure he has a really interesting reason why he doesn't. Um, but uh, I think because also it's like there's no, you know, I say getting your picture taken is just so weird.

Speaker 4:          02:17:54       I mean, especially on like a press line. Like, you know, an actress has have to go down a press line and just like pose, I said, I mean I've stopped kind of doing it cause I'm like, unless someone gives me a healthy inner monologue to recite while I'm doing that, I'm not going to do it. Cause what are you, you're just like, look at me and my sexy, my thin enough. Do you want to say like, it's just such unhealthy things that you're thinking what's in my head every time I read somewhere that you ride the subway. So it's like, I'm sure when he's posing with someone, it's just like you just in San Francisco, it's kind of like the Mad Max Marauder version of the subway. I like that outdoor one. And who would you ever carpet a place is filthy car? I Dunno. It's not the trolley. No anything. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 4:          02:18:38       They get along hyperloop, the hyper carpet hypercarbia load. Hypercarbia and uh, so I think that, yeah, I think he just felt like he feels like, you know, you can feel kind of violated someone just ambushing you. And, I mean, he's with his kids and he's, you know, I think when you have a family, I can only imagine if one person gets one, then all of a sudden everybody wants one and then you're going to, you know, so I think he just, you know, whatever, for whatever reason, I'm sure he has a, um, you know, dignified reason for it. But nobody ever, like, I mean to talk to Louis C K for five minutes, it could be the best five minutes of your life. And people are like, no thanks. We just want, I just wanted to Instagram, I didn't show off that I met you. This is about me.

Speaker 4:          02:19:19       It's not about you. I mean this like culture of narcissism. I remember I was at the People's choice awards, which is like a really silly award show. Um, but you know, they have seat fillers, fillers. The fillers is like, there's all the celebrities there, but then everyone else that's in the audience are like paid seat fillers who are super attractive and it's like an Indonesian political round. Yeah, absolutely. That's so funny. Yeah, no, I didn't know that. I love you and I as reference points are so different and yours are so much more impressive. Um, and uh, so they get paid 50 bucks to dress pretty and look good because they're going to be on camera, maybe in a pan shot or something. And so I'm sitting in front of, I want to say Allen's in front of me, but Ellen had gone on stage, so this is actually so, but there's all these seat fillers.

Speaker 4:          02:20:07       A Beautiful, I can't tell who the, I mean the seat fillers are more attracted than celebrities. I mean, it's like, um, and so on stage, is that what I say? Ellen and Chris Pine, who was that? You know, whatever actor, a famous actor. And I see these people holding up their cameras and I'm like looking at, we're trying to look over them and I see that they're taking selfies of themselves. And I'm like, no, the celebrities are that way. You're not the celebrity. I mean, people, there's a celebrity two feet in front of them and they're taking a picture of themselves. Yeah. I mean it's just like, you know, it was crazy. Yeah. It's a bizarre flip it around. Yeah. It's a bizarre world we live in. Yeah. Just to just a few last questions. You could put a billboard anywhere and have anything you want on the billboard texts photo.

Speaker 4:          02:20:59       What would it be? Where would it be? Like a message I would want to get out or message or it could be a photo of anything. Anything. Wow. This is a really good question. You should have a podcast. Um, if I could, well, everyone's got their things right there. Thing causes and my cause is dogs. That's, everyone's got their thing and I'm sure that, you know, when something else touches me that will be my thing. You know, and cancer touches my family or whatever. Alcoholism has touched my family, but I haven't been compelled to like get super in the trenches of, of that. But I'm a statistic that really affected me to statistics that I just sort of wish people knew was that 3 million dogs die a year in shelters and 17 million a year get bought. So it's just like the three. Shouldn't it crazy math.

Speaker 4:          02:21:58       Yeah, it should be. Don't make me do this math. Yeah. 14 a year I bought that should just be the statistic. Right. So, uh, that was something that just hearing that I was like, God, that is such a waste. That's just so much death and it's just so karmically bad for just this species. And so, um, uh, so yeah, that's something that's sort of one, I was always kind of trying to do dog rescue and I didn't really know how. And once I got that statistic, I felt kind of emboldened to be like, all right, I know exactly where my energy can go. It was very empowering to learn that. And another thing is, um, I work with this a charity called the Beagle freedom project. Um, that's bagels that are tested on in labs, um, that the tests are usually an ain and like don't do much.

Speaker 4:          02:22:37       It's just, you can say a product is tested on an animal and that it's safe. And this statistic kind of blew my mind, which is that beagles are chosen to be, um, the dog's tested on in labs because they're the most forgiving of all dog breeds. So you can hurt them a bunch of times and they'll still give you the benefit of the doubt and they'll still keep forgiving you. Heartbreaking. So once I heard that, I was like, I'm in, you're preying on the weakest, sweetest. And so I got involved in that and uh, you know, I think that if you don't have kids, you know, and if you're busy, like you and I are and you travel a lot, dogs is just a really sort of easy, rewarding sort of healthy thing and those two. So I feel like I would just put those on billboards maybe in China at the dog meat festival.

Speaker 4:          02:23:27       That's probably the location I would pick. The Yulin dog meat festival. It makes me crazy. Is there a dog be fest? Oh my God. The Yulin dog meat festival. Yeah. So, uh, this obviously means you don't follow me on Instagram. Um, which is Stop Ulan 2015 is my, a big obsession right now. But yeah, there's a dog meat festival that's going on I think right now in China, uh, where they actually kidnapped people's domesticated dogs. So you just wake up and your dogs are gone. And then there's a dog meat festival. It's, I mean, here's the thing with China, they don't treat their people that great either. I'm much less their dogs or their children. So, uh, that's a bigger issue that I'm not really qualified to talk about. But yeah. Wow. Dog me Puzzle. But whenever I tell people whenever I'm like doing, I think a lot of people want to help dogs.

Speaker 4:          02:24:12       It's just such an or animals or cats, anything too big of an issue. And like as soon as they hear that, like beagles the most that people like, how do I help? And a lot of people don't even know they're getting arrested on the goals. The goals are the most tested on dog species. They're also the most forgiving. What'd you call ms.com buy tickets. There we go. Download my stuff off. Delo myself. No, I'm using it. Actually donate. Donate just to me. I just got this to get your attention. I just wanted to capture your heart so then I could then manipulate you into buying me a vacation home.

Speaker 4:          02:24:47       Gotcha. Gotcha. That's political circle research. It's like, I'm glad you asked that question. Let me also think that like donating to animals is just my drug of choice. I guess. I don't drink, I drank, but I'm not, you know, not like to access and I know do drugs like when I give money to and I feel as good. So I just feel like a lot of people, like once they start it's, you feel good if you give 20 bucks to whatever, you know, it's like, I think everyone would be, everybody wins. What advice would you give to your 25 year old self?

Speaker 4:          02:25:29       25. Uh, there's so much advice. I would say don't wear any of what you're wearing right now, which was, which was, you know, it's funny, I dressed like a boy from the 70s until I was like 29 new vintage, new balance sneakers, bell bottoms, and a Hoodie with a backpack. You know, I was very, that was my uniform. Um, which was kind of like my shield of like, please don't see me as a sexual being. Like when I did stand up, you know, I tried to really like neutralize my, like gender, um, and uh, stop drinking diet coke, stopped drinking aspartame. I feel like I just missed the new thing of that. That was like my early twenties in college was all artificial sweeteners and crap that I feel like I'm going to be, that's why I'm drinking the stupid beet juice. Um, and I think it really compromise my productivity and my, you know, who knows what that was doing to my brain chemistry.

Speaker 4:          02:26:28       Um, and uh, I think maybe the main thing is those mistakes are actually getting you to exactly where you want to go. They're rerouting you to your dreams, you know, and they're not, I hate the word failure because I always, I always think it's just like a step in the right direction, you know? So all the things that I agonized over the jobs I didn't get. I mean I like was in bed, like crying my eyes out for like a week cause I didn't get it job as a VH one, like host of account down. I mean something that would just be so embarrassing. If you saw my Wikipedia page day, I'd be like, can we really don't talk about that? It would have been a thing that I said, please don't talk about it on the podcast. So would've been so embarrassing now, but at the time it was like I was just the holy grail.

Speaker 4:          02:27:18       I was destroyed over it. You know what? I didn't realize, oh my God. And a couple of years like I dodged a bullet, so I wished that I had kind of, I would have saved a lot of time and energy and anguish. Mistakes are taking you where you want to go. Yes, exactly. Exactly. This has been great. Where can people learn more about you? Ashley Madison Whitehouse. Dot. Porn. I literally got this call the other day. My lawyer was like, Hey, we need to buy your.porn. And I was like, are we, we changed in the game plan. Is there something I don't know down? Yeah, but dop, the dop, porn is about to come out, so you have to buy your domain. You're welcome. Thank you. Yeah, Yours Tim Ferriss. Stop Porn we routed to your blog, to your website. There you go. Uh, so the homebase is

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       where should people go?

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       Uh, well, well my tour dates and stuff are all Whitney cummings.com. And then I have Twitter, Whitney Cummings, my Instagram is Whitney a Cummings because Whitney Cummings is a 15 year old black aspiring singer who is pretty talented actually. It has a lot of followers. Thanks to me in the eyes has posted two photos. Um, but uh, yeah, Whitney a Cummings. Got It. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:28:46       And any last ask of the audience, if you could ask the audience to do one thing, what would it be?

Speaker 4:          02:28:54       Um, besides visit the website. So provocative. I'm like using birth of my brains. I never use, if I could ask the audience to do one thing, what would it be? Um, God, that's a really deep question. I have so many thoughts. Um, I mean, do you do your thing live out loud, be authentic? I don't know. Is that you ask that question. I've having heard your house, I don't ask it too often. If you could ask the audience to do one thing. Um, watch comedy. It's good for you.

Speaker 2:          02:29:34       Okay. No, I'll, I'll dig on that for a second. If somebody who's seen comedy occasionally, but it's not a connoisseur, wants to enjoy comedy more, get more out of it. If they're watching, say a Stan Oh, special, what should they pay attention to or think of to see kind of an extra layer or ask themselves anything?

Speaker 4:          02:29:56       I think that there's, I think look at what offends you. If something offends you. Watch Richard Pryor. Watch Daniel tosh watched the most incendiary comedians, Bill Burr, maybe Louis C k his monologue that he just did on SNL that there was this outcry because you talked about pedophiles or something. If something offends you, look inward, that's a sign that there's something there. What offends someone says a lot about them. Agreed. You know,

Speaker 2:          02:30:29       I think it was may west to said those were shocked easily. She'd be shocked more often.

Speaker 4:          02:30:33       I like that. I like that. I love, I have a huge poster of West in my office. Um, but uh, who a lot of people think was a man and a lot of people think she was wet. Huh. Interesting. Their original Rachel Doughlas all, is that her name? The girl who just pretended to be black? The Naacp woman? I don't know. Yeah, she was like, uh, I was on a plane yesterday. I was way too deep into, uh, the news. Um, but uh, yeah, I would say look at what offends you and it'll probably help you with some self awareness.
