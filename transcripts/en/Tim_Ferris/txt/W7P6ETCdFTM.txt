Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Quick sound test. This is transition from t to Tequila. How do you feel about that decision? I'm pretty excited and off we go

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       at this altitude I can run flat out before my hands start shaking the oils. You posted a question. I'm a cybernetic organism living this year.

Speaker 1:          00:00:34       Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where I interview some of the world's top performers, whether that be in investing, sports, entrepreneurship or otherwise film art, you name it, to extract the tools and resources and habits and routines that you can use and in this episode I have the pleasure in beautiful San Francisco to interview an icon of tech, but you do not have to be involved with tech or even understand tech to get a lot out of this conversation. Matt Mullenweg is one of my close friends. He's been named one of PC world's top 50 people on the Web Inc coms 30 under 30 and businessweek's 25 most influential people on the web. Why you might ask, has he received all of these accolades? Well, he's a young guy, but he is best known as a founding developer of wordpress, the open source software that powers more than 22% of the entire web.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       It's huge. He's also the CEO of Automattic, which is valued at more than $1 billion and has a fully distributed team of hundreds of employees around the world. However, Matt started off as a barbecue chomping Texas boy. So how did this all come together? It certainly was not the grand vision from day one at all. And Matt is an incredible human being, is a gifted musician. He is able to eat more than a hundred chicken mcnuggets and in one sitting, and we'll talk about why and how he did that and we really dig into the specifics of how he hires, what he looks for in people. We get really, really nitty gritty into his favorite books, his routines, music habits, work style. He's one of the most productive people I've ever met in my life. I think you're really gonna enjoy this episode. Be prepared to take notes, but if you want all the links and resources and everything else, of course you can find them. As always in the show notes, just go to four hour workweek.com forward slash podcast or just go to four hour workweek.com all spelled out and click on podcast and that'll take you to the show notes. So without further ado, please enjoy Matt Mullenweg.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       Matt, sir, welcome to the show had Hattie, Hattie, Hattie. So let's explain the how to howdy because there's some context missing. Of course we know each other. Where does the howdy from? Uh, I was born and raised in Texas,

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       fine state. He was a fine, greatest country in the world. And uh, you've taught me a great many things related to barbecue related to photography, so thank you for that. You got me very interested in photography and we've traveled a lot together. But for those people who don't know who you are, when, uh, when someone asks you, what do you do, how do you answer that? These days I'm probably best known for once eating 104 chicken nuggets. And one setting. Are you serious? Yeah. Wow. I did not know. How old are you need does that like last week. Now you won't forget it. Um, and then on the side I do, uh, we're going to open source publishing platform called wordpress, which power is such an amazing sites such as the four hour, everything for Tim. That's true. And others like New York Times, Wall Street Journal, um, about 23% of all websites now are on wordpress.

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       That's amazing. And how did wordpress start for people who don't know the origin story? Sure. Uh, well it's an open source project and it actually started, uh, as a fork or a derivative of an already existing open source project. So it was this thing out there called [inaudible], which um, I was using and blogging with myself and the, the crater disappeared. So the development stopped and myself and this guy in England named Mike Little picked it up and kept working on it. How old were you at the time? 19. 19. And were you self taught from, from the standpoint of programming? Yeah, I tried to take some classes in school and they were just all terrible. So I would programming, especially open source programming, like the web was the best place to learn it. And what made the class is terrible. I'm just, I'm always curious why, why did they fail?

Speaker 3:          00:04:40       Why did they not appeal to you? Well, I didn't go to a great school to start with. I was at University of Houston. I had amazing high school experience, a high school for the performing and visual arts. One of the best experiences of my life. But then I stayed in Houston. You have h was all right. But uh, the computer classes in particular, I think like 20 or 30 years ago, Microsoft basically changed the curriculums are influenced the curriculums of May these colleges. So even though this was 2002, 2003 there, the web had already happened, you know. Right. It was a thing. Yeah. But they are still teaching you like Microsoft visual basic and like you're building like buttons on Windows Apps, sons, sons, really a white knuckle stuff as I did. And so you see began working on this fork. And could you explain what open source means?

Speaker 3:          00:05:29       Sure. For people who aren't familiar with it, open source is for me the most important idea of, and it's supposed to in my lifetime, I actually, uh, so think of open source like a bill of rights for software. And I think this is incredibly important now that more and more of our lives are influenced or governed by software. It basically says that here's a four freedoms that are inalienable rights you have when you use open source software and the licenses that wordpress is under. The GPL says you have the freedom to use the software for any purpose. So that means you can make a, Matt has funny hair blog if you want or you can it or whatever you like and you can see how the software works, you can modify the software and then you can distribute those modifications to your friends. And this sounds pretty basic and trivial, but a lot of what we use it would be the equivalent of if you open the hood of your car on there was just a black box and you could be fined or go to jail for trying to modify things, tampering with it.

Speaker 3:          00:06:31       Yeah. We're trying to understand it. And let's, uh, so you, you're working on this fork. At what point does it become wordpress from the beginning actually. So with a capital w and a capital p for everyone wondering that if you want to, I don't see Mech at angry much, but if you want to really hit one of his pet peeves, it's the lowercase B, lowercase B. Actually, it's not possible to write wordpress with an uppercase w and a lower case B on wordpress as it should be, as you should. It'll auto correct it. I also feel badly for every transcendental meditation teacher and I brought up, I was like, does it bother you when your TM always turns into a trademark symbol in there? Like, oh my God, how did you know that they need their own platform? Evidently. Uh, so when did it become wordpress?

Speaker 3:          00:07:20       When was it, when was it Chris and wordpress as the name actually was one of the first things that came up with a friend in Houston named Christine had the idea for the name and um, she checked to the.org was available and I registered at that day. And that really brought it together because [inaudible] slash cafe log, if you have a slash her name, something wrong in the beginning, but, um, wordpress, I just liked it from the moment I heard it. I was like, oh, this feels like something that has a little bit of Gravitas, but still it's pretty accessible. And the focus is in the early days, which kind of distinguished us from what we're at fort from. I focused on web standards, um, cleaning up the code, making sure that what we were out putting was really tight and then installation. So it created something called the famous five minute installation.

Speaker 3:          00:08:12       Um, so the standards would be like, and I, I'm using maybe a sloppy metaphor, but making sure that the grammar and everything is standards so that it can have the widest adoption and tinkering possible. It was more at the time, the web platforms, you would build a website for Netscape and you build a website for Internet explorer and you'd use different code for both our sites. We've worked with one and not the other. I said, so web standards who create a common platform between them. Got It. And the installation ended up being the biggest thing we called it the famous five minute install, even though it was neither famous, it's famous to the two of you guys. But it became a self fulfilling prophecy, right? Because people said, oh it's, it's famous and it's only five minutes and competitive software at the time would take 30 minutes an hour to set up. And also that's how some of our contemporaries like movable type made their money in the beginning cause you could pay them to install it for you. So the economic incentive was not to make the installation easier. So we just came in with that from the beginning and it was really appealing to folks.

Speaker 4:          00:09:12       So you were right simplifying to get the, well, it's very interesting because you were open source at the time. He did not have a profit motive. Nope. And therefore you are not incentive on is to complicate the profit. There were no golden handcuffs, right, like likened to loose, which is true for a lot of industries. Professional Training for instance, uh, is very much like that. There are very few trainers are incentivized to make themselves unnecessary, right? To make themselves obsolete. So they'll have a rotating schedule and different types of mezzo cycles and so on that keep you tethered to an ongoing program of training. What's the Mezo Cycle? Well, you, you can have different types of cycling. For instance, if you were leading up to a power lifting competition or a wedding, a trainer, it could very similar. Uh, you always want to look like a power lifter, especially if you're a lady for your wedding.

Speaker 4:          00:10:03       Uh, you can, you can cycle the type of training. So you might have, let's just say arbitrarily, uh, 70% of your one rep Max and you work between 70 and 75% of your one rep Max for four to eight week period, something like that. And then you go into a new cycle, which is, uh, I'm making this up again, but like 90% of your one rep max are between 85 and 90. And, uh, so that would be that that has a place, but I feel like just to bring it back to two wordpress is that, uh, I feel like the, the, the number one priority of any good physical training trainer or nutritionist should be to enable their client with the know how and tools that make them themselves obsolete. Uh, so this complicate the profit is a, is is a real problem in a lot of industries. What actually,

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       so my favorite classes in college where the political science and philosophy ones and because you think about systems instead of necessarily just and incentives versus, uh, what works or what gets you to the next thing. So, uh, again, kind of like what you said, a personal trainer is not going to be incented to put themselves out of a job. Um, can you create a system, something you've done with, through your work where people can self enable and from the early days of wordpress, we, we'd always think, okay, well if we do x today, what does that result in tomorrow, a year from now, 10 years from now? And it was kind of silly to think about 10 years from now, but it's now

Speaker 4:          00:11:43       12 years old. So I did that longterm vision

Speaker 4:          00:11:49       develop. What were the components that helped you to develop that longterm view? Because you're a young guy. I mean, you still aren't, despite the fact that you don't have a three in front. How old are you now? 31 as of last week, I was so tired of the under 30 awards that you're getting every year. I was like, God, can this guy just turned 30 already? I feel badly about myself every year. It's award season. Huh? Here we go again. But, uh, what helped you to develop that, that longterm view besides maybe these, these political poly sign classes?

Speaker 5:          00:12:20       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:12:21       I think the, uh, political science really, really helps because any particular aspect or figure I've really loved, uh, to cities. It's actually a classic. Um, he wrote, uh, I think it was the Peloponnesia book about the Peloponnesian War and he was one of the first what we see now as historians. So he would go back and writing about this series of events. We'll kind of look at the why and what was the environment which created these things rather than saying Xyz happened, saying this is what the world was like and that caused Xyz had happened. Um, but the, the metaphor I think of the most because as simple as just like a dog chasing the car, right? Like what does the dog do if he catches the car? Right. It doesn't have a plan for it. Yeah. So I find it just as often an entrepreneurial side, people don't play for success either. Hmm. Like if we create a marketplace for plugins, right? What is the natural conclusion of that? If it's really, really successful, um, well it's really, really successful. There's not that many free plugins, right? It looks more like an APP store on Ios or android where everything's paid because that's what the incentives will be for the developers over the long term.

Speaker 5:          00:13:32       And

Speaker 4:          00:13:34       so let me ask you, this is a somewhat oblique question or unrelated seemingly, but do you, are there any hedge fund managers that you really get along with? You don't have to name them by name, but you could sir. Our investors. Okay. Who are some of your investors and we'll talk about what they've invested in tiger global.

Speaker 3:          00:13:52       So there's an amazing guy, Lee Fixel over there. He works on the private side, not the public equity side, but it's a hedge fund that end of the day, uh, insights, true ventures. I have. Some were actually, you've been blessed from the very beginning with really great investors.

Speaker 4:          00:14:06       I know of a handful of hedge fund managers very closely who were extremely good, but a lot of them are macro. They would describe themselves as sort of macro guys, uh, which, uh, I'll hope to go into another time. But the point being, they are very good at looking at sort of primary effects, secondary effects, tertiary effects and trying to, trying to predict the various butterflies effect that can then inform a trade that other people aren't thinking of or a position that other people are thinking of. A, I think you're very good at that. Um, what,

Speaker 5:          00:14:39       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:14:39       If you had to call yourself a world class at something besides eating chicken mcnuggets, what, what would you, what would you say that is?

Speaker 5:          00:14:50       It might be related that because

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       the mcnuggets now thinking of systems, um, and sort of environments and ecosystems and how things sort of cascade because the, uh, you know, running an open source project there. The, the, the joke in term is BDFL so benevolent dictator for life is technically my role within wordpress, but it's the most powerless dictatorship ever because, uh, oh, obviously you don't have an army, you don't have the ability to tax. Uh, but you don't really have a carrot or a stick. You're not paying people to do things and you're not punishing them if they don't do things. So you really earn a position where you, the things you do have control over, like let's say the website or how the code works or the license. Um, you have to think of the implications of that. And then it's really just the power of a bully pulpit, you know, once a years.

Speaker 3:          00:15:43       It's like the state of the Union speech is happening from Obama. Uh, once a year I give a state of the word speech and try to, that's at word cope at word camp. Yeah. I tried to think what are the things that have been influencing me and the things that won't happen naturally in the wordpress ecosystem that might need another push or might need to expose the community is something that they're not thinking about. So a lot of times at Word Camp San Francisco, I'll bring in speakers like yourself or other folks who aren't in the day to day wordpress, you know, hubbub, right.

Speaker 4:          00:16:14       Despite my best efforts to muck things up, I was very happy, very, very pleased that, uh, our friend Nathan was so kind at the barbecue world championships that sponsors a, do you still sponsor a team there?

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       I didn't last year as a first year. I haven't been in a couple of years. All right.

Speaker 4:          00:16:34       And Mason, who's a tremendous developer, help to build a plugin called probation, which allows me to white list someone who leaves in a good comment that has aspects of, of questionable behavior, whether it's too much cursing, maybe attacking someone else, putting in too many links, um, which is a hugely helpful features. So thank you. Listen, uh, and the, that customize that, that, that ability to customize has always appealed to me about wordpress. What are other, uh, we can look at it through a different Lens. What are some of the mistakes that would be competitors to wordpress have made that prevented their wide, wider spread adoption?

Speaker 3:          00:17:17       Hmm. Most of our, uh, most contemporary competitors, so the wix.com Squarespace, etc. They focus more on it being a service rather than it be something that's super extensible. So, for example, that feature you just described, um, we'll never be in court precedent. It will never be what in core wordpress. It's, um, you know that it's a relatively small audience isn't useful for the edge case. Yeah. And you know what to be like other people who maybe have the same prominence as your blog, it would be useful for, so there is an audience out there, but it's not the tens of millions. They use wordpress. So if you're building a service like wordpress.com or like Squarespace, one of these others, ah, because you essentially have one code base that everyone runs, you have to sort of designed for the majority or what you think the majority he's going to want or be a where with wordpress with.

Speaker 3:          00:18:14       It's sort of infinite good sensibility of themes and plugins. Uh, there can be a million Neesha's and in fact, uh, with the way plugins are distributed for people that run wordpress themselves, almost no two are alike. Right? L when you think of the theme plus the plugins at each blog, each one's its own unique, beautiful snowflake, right? So you're not trying to decide what the average Susa shoe sizes in the world and give everyone a nine, uh, well, so our competitors will say, ah, it's this checklist of features and we're going to do these 10 things wordpress does, and maybe we'll do this one better than this one better. And honestly, like a smart team of a couple of developers could probably do that in a year. Um, but to replicate the, you know, 35,000 plus plugins and themes is sort of, it's a huge moat.

Speaker 3:          00:19:01       I mean, it'd take lifetimes. and@whatpointdidyoudecidetocreateautomaticwordpress.com? Sure. So, uh, I should say what automatic is. I'm a master company where I work, um, and I became CEO last year and basically it's, they'd wait until he had a three in front of your day and they had to wait until I was 30. Um, so it was basically taking the idea that there are some services for wordpress that aren't appropriate for the open source side is this distributed nonprofit thing. And so, and also that I wanted to create a company that I wanted to work at. And so that became automatic. Um, what was the question? Uh, how did you decide to create automatic? Ah, you know, what it was, is it was spam. Okay. Tell me more. So you know, things on the web get spam. Oh yes. I'm very well aware whether it's your email, a contact form, you know, spammers will, I think I have 100,000 more than a hundred thousand spam comments in my wow.

Speaker 3:          00:20:00       Spinning. Righto. So what's been protecting you as a plugin called Akismet? Correct. So kismet is anti-spam system. And what had happened was I kept riding anti-spam plugins that were just plugins. So there was just code that would run on your blog and they would work for like an ever decreasing amount of time. So like the first one stopped spam for like a year and the second one stopped it for like six months. And then it got to the point where I'd release a new version and like the next day the spammers would work around. I was like, these, I always had like an idea of like a, I apologize to anyone Russia name Ivan, but like I like this guy in Russia, I like to download a plugin like, oh ha ha, I can work around this so easily. And um, and so I thought, Huh, like this is asymmetric warfare.

Speaker 3:          00:20:43       We're never going to beat the spammers cause they are like the bully on the playground unless we team up. Right. And so Akismet is sort of a assist pack of wolves that tear the bullies apart. Yeah, it's a pack of wow, I like that. Or maybe it's like circling the wagons, you know, it kind of protects you for, it's more like visually less violent and it's able to adapt as quickly as a spammer spammers where, um, because it's a centralized service. I built some centralized services before that were expensive to run and costing me a lot out of my own pocket. So I wanted to make it a business so it can be self sustainable. I didn't want this something sort of running on my charity or if I went away this would stop. So that's why we also need money for food and I don't need that much.

Speaker 3:          00:21:28       We'll talk more about that later. Got It. Not to interrupt. So akismet spam and that was the first part of auto of automatic and it made perfect sense because it was something that wordpress, the software couldn't do. It was something that was a service. It was something that I wanted to have a sustainable business model and I'm, so that was actually the first thing. I kind of the, I left seen it. So I moved out to San Francisco, I got a job at CNN. It was awesome. I was there for about a year and basically the weekend after I left I just hacked like the whole time and released the first version of a Kismet. What year was that roughly? I believe it was 2005 2005 and was that the period in which you were experimenting with Polyphasic Sleep? Or was it before or after that question? Um, no, I did the polyphasic sleep before then.

Speaker 3:          00:22:16       Okay. So that was a, that was when I was still in Houston. And for those people who don't know Polly physics leaves is very controversial concept of taking what would normally require, say eight hours sleeping Mano phasic meaning one block in breaking it up into multiple fragments. I wrote about this in the four hour body and men, do people get excited about that? You did positively or negatively. Uh, so what was it you were experimenting with? Was it Uber Man? Uh Huh. So it's about, what is it between two and two and a half hours, something like that in a 24 hour cycle in a 24 hour cycle. So it, the four hours on and then 2030 minutes of sleep. What happens if you miss one of those neps your wrecked. But this was probably one of the most productive periods of my life. So I wrote wordpress and that time and also something called BB press.

Speaker 3:          00:23:04       And I remember, I remember your answer, but I'm curious if, uh, if you remember what you told me, why you stop polyphasic sleep, what happened? What did I tell you? Um, you got a girlfriend. It turns out, I know girlfriends don't like that sleep cycle. No one would have predicted that the getting into the girlfriend and maybe the beginning of the girlfriend. Um, and maybe that's that. Maybe that's why Mary someday, you know, someone who also be on polyphasic sleep, but the seems like you're really tense household. She has to type, double rack and do polyphasic sleep. What? All right, you brought it up. Why are you obsessed with divorce check? Oh yeah. So Devorah is an alternative keyboard. So instead of that, I was going ASD F it's a oh EU for example. And all the letters it's f for a and m actually are in different places.

Speaker 3:          00:23:52       So it's, it would be a competitor to Qwerty. Yes. Right. And it's more efficient. So I think I was 14 or 15, I thought, well, I'm going to probably be typing the rest of my life. And so if there's a more efficient way to do it, um, I should learn that. And it took about a month. It's Kinda like learning a new instrument actually. Uh, and I just kind of went cold Turkey and learn a type of work and I've been doing it. Yeah, we're 15 years now. Gosh, I'm old. And do you still offer rewards to employees who pick up the work? It's more like public shaming and or highlighting. Um, we do a little hints like it's a, it's a dictator with a little more teeth. Uh, we'll, we'll, uh, you know, in our Christmas pack we sent out like a Devorah keyboard cover for your laptop or little a DV Xen, which is a DV z.org is actually a great website that tells you all the benefits of work even better than I have.

Speaker 3:          00:24:46       So there's things like in a, I'm making up the numbers, but in a year of typing and query, your fingers move like 18 miles and a divorce, they move like two miles. Wow. I guess almost an order of magnitude more official. I never thought of it this way, but there's the speed benefit, which uh, I'm very impressed. I was very impatient with the divorce. I did play with it for awhile and then I had to switch laptops with people and I wasn't tech savvy enough to to figure it out or not. It was in Europe I think. And I was just like having trouble with the settings and they got very frustrated. But uh, would you say there's an argument for Devorah tech being easier on your tendons and carpal tunnel and all that? I'd say that's the most, um, the biggest benefit. So I, you know, again, a type for a living and I've never had any problem.

Speaker 3:          00:25:30       What type of keyboard do you use? Uh, I just use the keyboard of my laptop mostly. Now do I? Yeah. They used to have this funky ergonomic keyboard that kept your hands, your palms, more verticals that right? Yeah. You emailed me about that the other day. What was it called? Oh, I have no idea what I'm asking. I looked it up and I told you what it was. But yeah, it was where the keys were actually sort of slanted in. Right. And um, so it's almost like you're holding joysticks. I mean in that hand position with your, with your fingers extended and it is, you know what, that keyboard is very comfortable and I like it, but honestly the, just the, I'm not really limited when I'm on my computer by the speed, I can type meaning unless I was transcribing something. Like right when you're talking, I'm limited by the space of extra dollars transcribing and or have it every now and then, um, you know, I'm really limited by speed I can think, right.

Speaker 3:          00:26:18       Which is much slower than 120 words per minute or whatever I can type and um, so really the comfort is what does it for me. It's also kind of a cool security mechanism when someone sits down at your laptop and like they can't do anything quickly, anything, but it is Devorah is built into every single modern day computer, windows and Mac. So you can just as a setting, if you go to into international keyboards and you can do it. Um, and I'd highly recommend, you know, you have a pretty hardcore of listeners, so pretty hard core habit of writing too. Um, yeah, I would check out the work, but there's also a slightly more efficient one called coal Mac that if I were starting today, I might do call Mac. How do you spell Comac? C. O. L. E m. A. K. Um, now the difference between Courtney and Devorah is like, let's call that 50% in between like Devorah can call Mac is like two or 3%. So got it. I haven't switched again, just because it's only marginal. But, um, if you're coming from Courtney, yeah. Pick one of them. Huge. Cool. All right. We will link to all that in the show notes. Uh, automatic.

Speaker 5:          00:27:16       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:27:18       Is it coincidence that automatic is spelled with an m a t t in the middle? That was a typical egotistical founder. I tried to work my name and everything and uh, should do that. I should, I could, I could, Tim is short. I could stick it in the middle of a lot of stuff. Uh, automatic itself is, it's a unique company in a lot of ways. How, how has automatic different from the average tech startup out there

Speaker 3:          00:27:49       had a lot of ways. So the first and foremost is that everything we put out, we're open source to the core. So most technology companies, the Ip of our software is one of the chief values of it, and we open source from released to the public. The vast majority of the Ip we create. So that's the first and foremost, and it's really the key to the philosophy of automatic. And the second, which is I think the future of work and the future of all companies, is that we're totally distributed. So we're now over 300 people and 37 countries and well over 200 cities. So most people work from home or in coworking spaces, wherever they are. We have a headquarters here in San Francisco, but it's only got about 20 ish people in it. And every time I've been to the headquarters, look, where's everybody? Oh wait there teach tee shirts.

Speaker 3:          00:28:35       I can get that deck. They're going to be a teacher. But we just needed a place to get mail and subpoenas. Do you get a lot of subpoenas? Ah, yeah. It's like everyone who publishes them, it's like if Bill Gates, Scott takedown notices for people using Microsoft word, like we just get everybody contacting us for everything. Every type of a disagreeable content that's published on wordpress results in some type of letter. Yup. That sounds like fun. Well, the more clueless the attorney, the more likely they're all the contact us. Right, right. And, uh, focusing on the distributed aspect, uh, how did you make that decision and how early on, I mean, what, what was the process like? Tell me the story of how you made that decision is literally from day one and it's, it was influenced by the fact that, you know, wordpress is an open source project before I created the company automatic. So the first four or five people at Automattic, we're all in different cities. Um, you know, we had Vermont's Texas, I was in San Francisco actually. The very first guy was in Blarney Ireland, Cork County, which is like the Texas. I were the blarney stone. Is it as it over the blind? This is the blarney stone. So you, uh, you climb to the top of this castle thing and you kind

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       of hang off the side and Eric kind of upside down and you kiss this stone. She's as old guy was trying to hold you and it's probably not sanitary, but yeah. Um, I was very shy before I kissed it about 10 years ago. And now you're down talking to you. Okay, well hold on. I want to talk about nervousness and boldness and shyness for a second. We are going to come back to the distributed nature of automatic. This is not, in fact the first time that I've interviewed you. Do you remember, do you remember the very first, maybe you can tell people about the very first phone call that I made to you?

Speaker 3:          00:30:19       Was that an interview?

Speaker 4:          00:30:20       No, I was saying I was, I was calling you to ask if I could interview. Yes. So Tim, this was pre for our work week, right? Yeah, it was, I think it was 2006 so it was an old school or early, early 2007 my Tim Bona Fides out of like, oh yeah, back in the day.

Speaker 3:          00:30:34       Um, and I got the I, my phone never rings and I almost never answered, but for some reason I answered this and I'm this weird guy who talked very fast, did

Speaker 4:          00:30:45       monologue for like 10 minutes. I don't know, it was actually 10 minutes. It was really bad. But this was a Timbo Tim Ferriss and he was telling me about something, I don't know, I think it was like verbal shock and awe. It was, I was trying to establish my credentials and a mutual friend, Mj Kim had had made the intro and I was worried you would hang up because I was aware, I was aware of vaguely that you did not, you weren't really a phone guy, so you're trying to get an all the words before I hung up. That's right. Which, which is not the best policy in the world. But we did end up, it worked getting know each other and I wanted that story to be told because it's easy for listeners or readers to assume that, you know, my pitches have always been great and then I was born that way. No, I've had thousands of horrible pitches. Some of them just by the luck of the day you happen to contact someone work. But it's despite your, despite your technique, not because of it. So

Speaker 3:          00:31:48       distributed from day one, what are the tools that you currently use to make that work? So open source projects mostly work like this and basically what they do is they say you use things like, well back in the day I'm going to say some old technologies and then we'll get some new technologies, IRC, which is sort of a old text chat or I am system. Um, you collaborate using distributed source control. So we use subversion is the modern day equivalent would be something like get hub. So you basically have ways that you can, we get email mailing lists, um, forms, all the things that, you know, people do even when they're in the same office. [inaudible] they, they, I am each other. You just make that the primary way you communicate and that, so that's what we did from the very beginning. I mean, what our Max started, we literally, it was bootstrapped beginning, had no money.

Speaker 3:          00:32:37       And I thought, well, why would I was in San Francisco? But why would I move all these people to the most expensive place in America, right? When we also have no money? And I'm most investors. Fact, a lot of them said, oh yeah, when you raise money, you can finally move everyone there. But you know, Donica and Ireland's was, became ready to start a family. And you know, people are different places for different reasons and it's true. The Bay area has some amazing talent, but you also have, well two, two things. You have some incredibly talented people all over the world who for whatever reason don't want to live here, even though it's a pretty cool place. Yeah. Um, you also have, you know, some of the largest, most successful companies in the world market caps of over a trillion dollars combined competing for the same 20 or 30,000 engineers in one place in one place, right?

Speaker 3:          00:33:26       So when you add up Cisco, oracle, apple, Google, just go down to the dimensional, the startups, linkedin, Facebook, Twitter. Plus all startups. Um, they're, uh, they're all fishing in this pond, which is a little bit over fished. Yeah. Um, again, not to say there's not great people, it's just that, uh, perhaps back in the day when you had to go to like one of these universities like Stanford or MIT to learn the things to create a scalable webscale startup or service. Um, it was important to be clustered there, but now you can learn all this stuff on hacker news and you can read, read it and you can, you know, learn everything you need to do to build the next wordpress from anywhere in the world and in place. You have an internet connection. So there's some super smart people all over. And so we just started to say, well, just like it's silly to discriminate on the basis of the, just say gender.

Speaker 3:          00:34:18       I've said, we're not going to hire a man or a woman. It's dumb because you're just cut out half of the possible hiring pool. So by definition, people who hire would be not as good as if you looked at 100%. We said, well, we're going to look at the 99.9% of the world that doesn't live in the San Francisco Bay area. So not only are you getting better talent because you have a larger pool to filter from. What can you do with the cost savings of not having to build out a huge infrastructure for a campus? I don't know if there's actually a cost savings because once you start flying people around and things like that, like it does add up and we give people a, an allowance for example, a $250 per month coworking allowance, they can use it at Starbucks or cafes, they can use it at a coworking space.

Speaker 3:          00:35:02       We, so we, we invest in people's a space because we want them to be productive. But I think what it really comes down to is just allowing people freedom, autonomy and something that was actually inspired when I finally read your book is some lifestyle arbitrage. Yeah. I mean you can make us San Francisco salary and live in Argentina or Alabama or wherever you want to. Cause a lot goes, it goes very, very far and that's kind of cool. And um, or like myself, like I travel most of the time. Where is the, uh, your 37 countries, what are the most heavily weighted countries were represented? Countries. Oh, an order. It's probably it's English speaking countries in order. So it's a United States is about two thirds. So again, more than majority. Ah, we love us some Canadians. I love Canadian. Um, UK, Australia. Those are kind of the top four or five. Yup. Ireland. So because we're still, although we're totally distributed, we're still speak English, right? So places where, uh, so that's like the top five and then have the other 32 countries. Um, many of them, we just have one person in them, right. We only have one person in India. We have I think three or four people in Argentina, one person in Brazil. So it just kind of ends up being whoever the coolest, most. Uh, I was going to say

Speaker 4:          00:36:29       bad, but I don't wait for a few who don't know. Matt. He never curses. He has a lot of trouble. It'd be like forcing Mr. Rogers to say fuck on the air. It would just be the most excrutiatingly painful thing to watch. So yes, there are bad, bad button bad, but engineers, Tim, now I can't send this to my mom. We can, we can bleep the f. It's all right. You know, I actually don't have a problem with cursing. I just don't do it myself. And how long has that been? Has that always been the case? No, I don't mean you're from Texas. And again, I don't let them in and get all the tech ops curse a lot, but I'm from Long Island. It's like you can't avoid it. That's half of what we say. This is actually a myth in the company that you can't curse around me or I'll get mad. But it's just not true at all. Um, I have no personal problem with it. I feel like I would've picked up on that. How long have you not been cursing? I feel like I must have read a book when I was younger,

Speaker 3:          00:37:22       like a James Bond type book or something. And I, cause I recall the sentence, I just don't remember the context and if someone's like, you know the English language has more words in it than any other language in the world. And so you can find your way to express yourself and some of these other hundreds of thousands of words

Speaker 4:          00:37:38       now obviously words like f word are so versatile you can use them in a million different ways. But the, there's a lot of other really good ones. So I tried to have all expressed myself in another way. It's always struck me and I feel like such a course unrefined sort of knuckle dragger with the amount that I curse, which is I, I enjoy being around you. And a the is something we've talked about on the podcast before with other folks is surrounding yourself with people you want to be the average of. And so I like one of the reasons I enjoy being around you is that you, you forced me to become very aware of how much I curse, which oftentimes I think it is reflective of lazy thinking just in the way that if you overuse the word interesting, like Oh, interesting. That is a garbage word. It means nothing like come up with a better word or, uh, my, my particular crutch was pretty, oh, that's pretty good. That's pretty expensive. I was pretty awesome. And I got so annoyed with it. The way that I tried to fix it, which very

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       well actually for a period of time was requiring that every time I say pretty, I add fucking after it no matter who I was with that guy that's pretty fucking expensive on it's pretty fucking pretty or whatever, which, which solved it. But, um, the, what are the current tools that you use? So you had IRC and so on, but what, what do you, what's the state of the art within automatic for managing, keeping that machine running with the distributed teams. So we actually ended up creating a tool called P two. So you can get it at [inaudible] dot com and that is a basically a replacement for email. So automatic basically sends no emails. I get all the emails I get is from people outside the company. And think of pizza too. Almost like a social cast or a Yammer or can like an internal Twitter or Facebook, but really work oriented where people can post short things, long things, blog posts and bed, youtube, rich media, mockups, images, audio, anything.

Speaker 3:          00:39:34       And it's a threaded asynchronous discussion. But because it's not email, I honestly don't know why people use email so much in companies. Because imagine that you're a company, you're a team of 10 people and you joined that team. How do you catch up with a past two years of conversations? Do you get people to forward you like all the emails they've been doing, if someone leaves, like does everything in their inbox, what does everything in their inbox disappears? And all that sort of locked in knowledge has gone. So everything in automatics public by default, all of our stats, all of our, everything, everything, everything like Saturdays, equity. Uh, so we're not buffer where we publish, you know, salaries and equity, but the, um, so just for context for people who are not in this world of tech buffer apps, actually a, an app I use every day are very useful for scheduling, but a buffer app allows you to schedule a different types of Facebook posts, Twitter posts, etc.

Speaker 3:          00:40:25       Uh, among many, many other things. But they're, they're extremely transparent, uh, in, in with their information. So they publish a formula essentially. Yeah. That how they determine their, it's like a base salary, like salary is 50 k for support plus a multiplier for experience plus a, you can get equity or more salary or things like that. So theory, the formulas, public, um, I think some of that stuff goes a little bit too far and it, it had reads as many problems as it solved. How do you draw the line or how do you decide where to draw the line?

Speaker 3:          00:40:59       It's really a judgment call. And also thinking about what is the logical conclusion of this. So how does that system work? One, we're 10,000 employees or 100,000 employees. Uh, and does it just sort of kick the can down the road? So the thing I think about the buffer system isn't, it's not bad that their salaries are public. In fact, government jobs, salaries are public and many companies have sort of stated titles and levels that have certain ranges, but then it just kind of, it kind of kicks the can down the road. That why is this guy again in spirits multiplier of 1.3 and mine 1.1 you still have the kicking the can down the road, man. Uh, it's, if it purports to solve the idea of compensation to inequity, right? Um, there's still a subjective measures that have a big impact on what the formula at the output of the formula.

Speaker 3:          00:41:53       That doesn't really help. Um, so is it what I think of is, is this going to make the company either solve a problem that we can't solve otherwise or is it going to make it better overall? And so, uh, so all of our communication being public does, and it's all searchable. It's all indexed. It's all tagged. Um, I could look you up in our system and see every meeting anyone's ever had. Wow. This guy really doesn't know how to use computers. Yeah. The going back now, you know, almost 10 years, we turned 10 this year. So that's pretty powerful to have that sort of record of everything and it's all searchable and indexed. So that I think makes sense. And we're very trusting internally. Like if we're working on an acquisition, for example, in my status updates, I do weekly, I'll put that I worked on this acquisition in theory that could leak, it could whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:42:44       But I find that when you trust people, they tend to do the right thing versus if we try to like really lock everything down, I feel like that would engender a two way loyalty. Uh, so p two a slack I really loved. Can, you know, slack has come up a lot recently for me, including for very small teams. Uh, can you explain slack it? Sure. As I pour water all over this table. That's all right. That's right. It's, it's, it's would supposedly, you know, I would assume the tree is exposed to water. That's going to be okay. So at some point, so slack is kind of, for us, it's a replacement for IRC. So imagine a, it's a real time chat platform that actually has a lot of the benefits of p two. You can embed media in it and things, but it just makes sense for, for I am, so we used Skype before, but again it didn't really scale for us.

Speaker 3:          00:43:33       So if you're the hundred and fourth 101st person to join Automattic and we use Skype for all of our messaging each other, you have to add a hundred people to your contact list and be accepted by each one of them. Um, rooms have limits for how many people they can have and just all these arbitrary things. It's not suited. And slack, you can DM anyone in the company. Uh, everything's, they also have a really great search. There is public channels. Anyone can join this private groups and it just, it's done by some of the folks behind flicker, Stuart Butterfield calendars and it's just really well done. Like it's pleasant to use. Loved the name. So it's a, yeah, it's a positive association just in the name. It's an enterprise tool, although you can use it for, I have, I'm on like four or five teams down, including some that are just groups of friends. Uh, but it's, it's really pleasant to use like it's consumer grade and I'm in consumer grade as a compliment. You mean the Ui? Like the user experience is consumer friendly and user friendly. It could compete with a Facebook or a Twitter for its usability versus where most enterprise software just,

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       and I was looked by as designed by someone who was very unhappy. And why not use p two for the IRC? Like chat. Oh, um, it's not chat. Okay. So p two is threaded. It is real time, but you wouldn't use it like a chat client. Got It. Um, where slack is a chronological, so there's no threading and yeah, it's instantaneous. It comes to your phone. It's, it's more like I am application. Got It. And would you use [inaudible] for project management type stuff as well? We do, yeah. Okay. We have bug trackers. Different teams use different things. I mean as fabricators, some use get hub, some use track, uh, we allow teams a lot of autonomy in choosing the tools there. But, um, all the communication really happens on Pto. So think PTO replacement for email, a slack or replacement for Skype, Skype. I am, and that's really between those two.

Speaker 4:          00:45:26       You can take over the world. I love it. And, uh, for those people who are not aware of, uh, who are not part of the tech world, no, no, that was a, that was a coaster that was a very metallic Scandinavian coaster that was stuck to the bottom of the glass. It's, that's the downside of these coasters. Uh, we're sitting at my place, chilling. We were going to do Tequila sipping a, I don't want to incriminate Matt, but I have to get on the road a little bit later. So I don't want to have a, I don't wanna be swimming in the Casa that are going to us, which is my favorite spectacular. But it's my favorite too. It's so good. It is good. And just to digress because this is worth digressing on. Uh, I was introduced to customs that are going to, is the first time because I ended up doing some military training with uh, some, some active guys, uh, and some deployed guys when they were back for a brief period and they would, uh, they would do a full day of shooting exercises and then they would dismantle their guns and clean their guns while slowly sipping.

Speaker 4:          00:46:29       Casa did I go in, it's like the most manly session ever and had no ammo around, very safe. And I never liked Tequila. I'd always disliked to kill him and he'd given me a horrible hangover and a Casa dog [inaudible] is not intended to be mixed with anything and it's just amazing. I think Tequila is the most underrated alcohol actually. And it's very expensive. So for people who it's something, it's for special occasions for sure. People have a bad impression of Tequila because they drink a bunch of stuff and then at end at night they do it Tequila shot. So they've mixed like 20 different alcohols or they drink things like Margaritas that are full of sugar that are like incident hangovers from me. But just like, uh, yeah, I love Casa turn on us. I was introduced to it by a friend in New York named Shanti and she was like, you have to check this out. I was like, oh, come on. Why am I going to pay it as much? I was like, wow, this to is delicious. Yeah, it's amazing actually if you drink, I believe that. So if you stick to just Tequila and it's a good Tequila, like I don Julio 1942 is also pretty good. If stick to good Tequila all night long.

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       Obviously with limits, you don't, you're not hung over in the morning. No, I agree. So if you're looking for a hangover cure guys, uh, you could test responsibly a civic tequila personal tools. I'd love to talk about some tools that you have, say on your laptop. So one of them that you introduced me to that I love is momentum. Yeah. Could you explain momentum? So momentum is an extension for chrome that when you launch a new tab, it shows you a beautiful picture. Uh, it says, you know, Hi Matt. Hi Tim. You put in your name, you, I guess you could have been, could put in my name, but I have to be creepy and it asks you a question, what is your focus for today? It has a light to do thing I don't use, but really for me it's, it shows the time and she's this beautiful picture and often like a nice little quote at the bottom, whether in the corner, just, it's kind of a clean, fun thing that when you launch a tab, because by default and chrome, I feel like before it was like your most recently or most frequently visited sites, which is distractions essential for me.

Speaker 3:          00:48:30       So I'd be launching a new tab and be like, oh, let me click this tech meme. Like, oh. And then 20 minutes later you're like, what am I doing? Not only that, but if you open a new tab, uh, I find it useful. Personally. It's, I'm, the photos are just amazing. They're so gorgeous. It bugs me that the quotes have no attribution at a new feature. If you hover over the quote, it will tell you who it's from. I feel like that should just be displayed. They removed it a little while ago. I don't know why, but now if you hover over the quoted, I'll tell you it's fine. But the photos are absolutely stunning, which catches your attention. And the reason that's important is when you, each day it'll prompt you to type an answer for what is your focus for today. And then it will display that every time you open a new tab.

Speaker 3:          00:49:11       And for me, if I open a tab to do something unimportant, trivial, or just that is a pure distraction, I'll be like, oh, oh yeah, I should really get back to that. The road, the heck is paid with lots of new tap tone down language. This is a family program, man. Uh, so what other, what other, uh, tweaks or tools do you have on your laptop you find helpful? Ah, definitely, uh, among constantly simple notes. So that's actually a company. I liked it so much. We acquired it. The company automatic bought a few years ago and it's a very simple notes app that synchronizes instantly basically across web, Ios, android, desktop. There's a great desktop client for Mac, so I pretty much live in that new additions. I started using Wunderlist. Wunderlist, I've heard a lot of good things about funder list. It's like w analyst Chad Feller works there now.

Speaker 3:          00:50:04       Oh cool. I'm good guy. Really liked it. So I just started doing that this year actually. Um, is on my computer, Spotify, you know, standard stuff. What, uh, what are some of your other most used apps on your, your smartphone? Hmm, well, obviously wordpress. Yeah, of course. Okay. I'll get the plugs out of the way in the beginning. So let's say wordpress note. Got It. Chan from messaging, I've actually become really in the telegram, telegram. So telegram.org, it is a free fast and uh, encrypted, optional, really good encryption by the way, a messaging app that's isn't, Facebook isn't, whatsapp isn't anything else and it's super good and they have a desktop client as well. I like what's that? But like I'm on my computer the majority of the day, so I need to be able to message from there. And I message only works with iPhone, other ios devices.

Speaker 3:          00:50:59       So it's pretty nice. So telegram you can use on your phone and on your laptop. Yeah. Which I love. My, I is broken. I won't, I won't pull you in for tech support, but I'll do it after he's telegraph. Um, slack, uh, something. So in terms of like making myself a better person, the row is the seven minute workout app. Uh, calm.com which I'm an investor in and kindle in a reading kindles meditation up. Now I'm not, not, that is not the meditation APP. I need to do some more dual dual end back training though. I got those. Those terrible called is a meditation mat. Yes. How often do you meditate? Not Enough. I feel like that's dodge. Is that once a month or what's not enough? Um, so where I am in this New Year is I'm trying to do it for five minutes per day.

Speaker 3:          00:51:50       That's perfect. That's just where I'm starting out. I'm actually inspired a lot by you talking and telling me about how meditation's becoming a big part of your life. Uh, I'd like to work up to where it's, you know, maybe a twice a day or media session. Um, but I've struggled a little bit even when that five minutes. So putting call on my home screen and just kind of just saying, you know, you can do anything for five minutes. There's really no excuses for not doing five minutes a day, um, can eat tonight for fitness. One of the things I did a while back was I would just try to do like, oh, it started with one. So just before I got in the shower, do one pushup. And no matter how late you're running, no matter what's going on in the world, you can't argue against doing one pushup.

Speaker 3:          00:52:29       Like, right, come on, there's no excuse. So I have to find, I just need to like get over that initial hump yet with something that's almost embarrassingly small as a goal and then that can become a habit. I think this illustrates a really important principle, which is rigging the game. So you can win. People don't like to fail. And if you set the pass, fail mark too high for an activity. For instance, a lot of people make new year's resolutions. They decide they're going to go to the gym four times a week. That's too much for someone who doesn't go to the gym at all. Yeah. And if that's the past, Phil, Mark and you go three times a week are going to feel like a failure. Whereas if you psychologically set the the hurdle at one time per week for instance, and you only have to spend 15 minutes of the gym, then you can earn bonus credits by doing what would've previously been viewed as a failure. Right? Someone should write a book on that, right? God, I can't do another

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       600 pager. We're the four hour body has another point that I think is very important, which is, uh, the layering of behaviors or sequencing and behaviors. So if someone has a 100 pounds to lose or 50 pounds to lose, I think exercise is the wrong place to start. Uh, for a whole host of reasons because of diet. Exercise is the wrong place to start. A diet is the right place to start because exercise is an additive behavior. It's something they don't currently do that they have to make time for. Whereas especially if they're overweight, they're definitely eating.

Speaker 4:          00:53:59       So they have set aside time to eat and they're just substituting in different default meals, which is very, very, very easy. Uh, met my first a slow carb follower who's lost 200 pounds recently. Wow. Yeah, that's a lot. That's a lot of pounds. That's a lot of pounds. It was a question I wanted to ask you if it's okay to, yeah, sure. I've been reading a little bit more about fasting and intermittent fasting, so yeah, there was like a couple of tweets worth of advice you would give for fasting. Yeah, definitely. All right. I think interim if you have incredible discipline. Uh, I think the intermittent fasting, uh, for instance, um, I think his name is Martin Birkin, lean gains. I think he does quite a bit here. Uh, he may or may not be a fan of my stuff. He's not a fan of a lot of people up, but that's fine.

Speaker 4:          00:54:49       I'm okay with it because even if he doesn't like me, I think he's a good resource for intermittent fasting. A lot of people who sustain intermittent fasting. And I'm not saying Martin, I'm saying a lot of other people who are figureheads in that community, uh, consume massive amounts of two things on the male side. Caffeine, they consume a lot of stimulants and uh, some of them consume anabolics like Diana Ball, which is an oral anabolic intergenic steroid that inhibits appetite significantly. Uh, so you want to, I would encourage you to test intermittent fasting and see how you feel. But I personally prefer, and I'll be writing quite a bit about this, uh, to do a, I did a seven day distilled water fast. And I think the, I think the longevity benefits known and unknown and health benefits known and unknown of doing that are, are very significant.

Speaker 4:          00:55:44       And it happens if you don't distill the water. Well, you know, that is a great question. They don't, the doctors who supervise me did not want me to be consuming any supplemental minerals or electrolytes, which was interesting because I thought it would be the opposite. And in some cases when people get very weak, they'll supplement with say bully on broth or something like that. But uh, they don't want you to be ingesting any type of supplemental minerals, vitamins, etc. And, uh, that was a tremendous experience. I actually want to do that at least once a quarter and possibly do a 14 day. I just read where like after the third day of like a water fast, you start producing more white blood cells, your body starts to say, uh, yeah, I mean that, that wouldn't surprise me at all. I'd have to look at my labs.

Speaker 4:          00:56:25       Of course I did tonight. I did your analysis every day and, and loud you way your poop. I did not weigh my poo because I got to tell you there's not much poo. When you're not eating for seven days, uh, by, uh, you, you have to be careful with the amount of water you drink because if you're not consuming any sources of salt, uh, you can, you can develop, you can overconsume water just like anything else. And there have been examples of people who've died as a result of say radio show competitions where they have competitions to see who can drink the most water. It's a terrible idea, I think it's called is things aren't ready or Cambodian new tree mia, I think it is, which is a, a, an extreme lack of sodium and other things that that interferes with your ability to conduct electricity and muscles like the heart.

Speaker 4:          00:57:10       Uh, but the intimate fasting for the, it works for a lot of people very well. But the vast majority of people I have seen who use it end up using crutches of some type like stimulants. So you trade one problem for another and in fact you can, you can also end up losing fat, not because of the intermittent fasting, but because you're consuming six cups of coffee a day. Uh, so I just don't drink coffee. What's that? I still don't drink coffee. Why not? You know, I think I have enough vices in my life. Are you an, are you an investor in a coffee company? Blue bottle coffee. So I don't drink coffee, but when I do blue bottle is the, uh, no. Okay. You don't have to answer this, but I'm curious. What are some of your other, uh, suitable for Mr. Rogers vices? What are some of the other advices? Wine, women and song, right. It's all goes back to the classics. Those are places again.

Speaker 3:          00:58:08       Um, no, I feel like probably the thing I struggle with the most is because my work and what I do is connected. Now I'm talking to people online. I'm on my computer and especially since taking over as CEO the past year, what I really had to do is unscheduled more on my life. Right. Create more space. Right. Um, read a lot more than I used to because I find that when I don't have that space where I'm just in the, I'm not going to call it flow. When a men sort of like the, the hedonistic treadmill of pings and chats and tweets and not even, not even necessarily being distracted by like Facebook or Twitter, but like even just work stuff, right? You don't take that step back that allows you to have the creative inspiration or the ideas for the next big thing or the uh, your mind works to the problem in a different way.

Speaker 3:          00:59:01       Right. The deloading phase, there's blocks of time. What have you found helpful for creating that space? Oh, another interesting thing about automatic is we have almost no meetings. Let's talk about it. And so I only have three standing meetings at automatic standing, meaning physically Staley. Oh No. Standing. Like it's always standing on a calendar. I see. So every other week. What makes those meetings worth doing? Um, so there are meetings with groups of people who are responsible for three areas. That automatic, one for all of wordpress.com and everything related there. One for jet pack and all the plugins we make. And then one we just called business, they're called a.com. Dot org.biz. So the commission, the organization and the Bids Group, um, and businesses, basically all the people who work on making money at automatic. Right. Got It. It's all the VIP guys on that team adds, so the, the, the commercial side, because to be honest, the vast majority of [inaudible] don't think about revenue at all.

Speaker 3:          01:00:10       Yeah. There's just a few of us at shoulder. The burden for everyone else. It's really a good thing. I mean, what, what do the other people primarily focus on? Um, I don't know. Comics, Tequila, what they're having for lunch. I mean, you think about the user, you think about the experience, you think about what is the thing, the hardest thing is spending the most time on the most important things just in life in general. Definitely. And especially when building products, like it's so easy. There's a term in open source called bike shedding and it's this idea, do you know what I do? But I want you to explain it. This is concept, I'm going to butcher the story, but you know, someone brings a proposal for a nuclear plant and a to a city council and it's, you know, this 200 page thing and they kind of flipped through it and um, but it's like too much for people to comprehend and then not nuclear physicist or activist anyway, so they're just kind of rubber stamp it.

Speaker 3:          01:01:08       And then the next person up wants to build a bike shed off the main road and everyone has an opinion like what color the bike shed should be. Should it accommodate tandem bicycles should, which color should it be? And so there's an amazing website called bike shed.org and a cool feature of it is that you can type in as a sub domain a color. So we type green.bike shed.org it'll give you a green background. And then the text of this original mailing list posts, which is like a BSD thing from like probably 13 or 14 years ago now. Um, that tells a story and talks about how usually proportionately the more trivial something is, the more likely it is that lots of people have opinions and feel like they can have an impact on it. That's so true. And I want to talk about also you're auditioning process,

Speaker 1:          01:02:05       but first we're going to hear a few words from the find sponsors who make this show free for all of you. So please don't skip ahead. Things we have coming up with Matt, we're just getting started. We're going to talk about his auditioning process, what he has in his carry on bag. This man travels the world all the time. We're going to talk about investing Warren buffet music, his rituals around productivity as it relates to music and on and on and on. So please don't go away and here you go. Our fine sponsors, the Tim Ferriss show is brought to you by on it. I have used on IT products for years. If you look in my kitchen in my garage, you will find Alpha brain chewable Melatonin for resetting my clock when I'm traveling. Kettle bells, battle ropes, maces steel gloves. It sounds like a torture chamber and it kind of is.

Speaker 1:          01:02:53       It's a torture chamber for self improvement and you can see all of my favorite gear at [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim. That's o, n n I t.com forward slash Tim and you can also get a discount on any supplements, food products. I like hemp force, I like Alpha brain.

And now back to our show, we've taken a potty break, which gave us a chance to upgrade our beverage since I've canceled my driving plans this evening from t to Tequila. So bear with me one moment, uh, actually met, perhaps you could elucidate enlightened us about some of your favorite music at the moment while I, while I very geisha like pour us some lovely Tequila.

Speaker 3:          01:04:15       I will be monitoring your technique. Um, yeah, I, I'm so late to the game by just discovered, uh, about say Tila Tequila because I did not just as governor, I discovered Sam Smith the opposite of Tila Tequila, um, who just, his voice is super haunting. Um, but enjoying milky chance. Lately they have a cool song called stolen Tila Tequila. Now they have a cool song called a stolen dance. What type of music is that? What would you call that? That's interesting. So they have kind of a reggae feel, but it's like a guy with a guitar and sings combined with a guy who kind of plays the laptop, like more of like a beat, almost like a DJ. Very cool. And I saw them live in San Francisco. Great show. And I'm that same I, I listened to a lot of hip hop and a lot of jazz. And you play instruments also?

Speaker 3:          01:05:06       Yeah, primarily saxophone. When did you learn to play the saxophone? Well, I started in second or third grade. Really? Yeah. So I started pretty young. My Dad Played Sax so I always want to do it. And I had gotten kicked out of piano for doing what? I don't know. They said I had no musical talent, so on to prove them wrong. What is wrong with some teachers? Believable. Cheers by the way. Cheers Andy. Uh, so the saxophone was your transition from piano and, uh, is there anything, are there any skills that you developed through the, uh, through the sacs that have had, that have translated to coding or anything else? You do? Almost everything. Um, so from how to breathe and be on stage in front of people for speaking gigs and whatnot or just anything, you know, you're in front of a group of people, um, how to interact.

Speaker 3:          01:06:08       So in jazz is all about listening and responding. You know, you're kind of co composing on the fly when you're improvising or in a quartet or something. I had to learn new things. So sometimes for different, if I played in like I'm musical theater band or something like that, like I need to double on Piccolo or flute or clarinet or another instrument. So I'd have to learn that fairly quickly. Um, and just, I would say most importantly, the concept of deliberate practice, which I know you're a big fan of, just absolutely. I remember I had a teacher once who told me like if you only practice the things ray sound good, you're never going to get better. You recap, you reach kind of a local maximum and that was a trap. I actually had fallen Eczema. I need to learn what this is just a a constrained, constrained maximum.

Speaker 3:          01:06:58       Yeah. You reached the best that you're going to get within this sort of limited sphere of limited sphere. You're not moving on to the next fear and especially back when I was young, I think I was more self conscious and so when I practice and it'd be at school or at home, I'd want to sound good for whoever might walk by or hear me or anything and that's not how you get better. You just kind of get really good at the 10 things that you're practicing. But the people who practice the best sound terrible. I think they're squawking and squeaking and doing long tones and overtones. They sound like they're, it's funny, one of the most best things you can do to sound better on saxophone is, was what's called long tones, which just playing a single note for a really long time and then go into the next note and playing that for a really long time.

Speaker 3:          01:07:44       Why does that make you better? Um, is it an endurance thing? It helps your ambition and your tone. Your what? Ombre. Sure. What does that, so the ombre shirt is basically the position and firmness of your mouth around the mouthpiece and basically that it's the, it's basically the seal around the maltreatment jokes or think of like a, a brass instrument when, you know, they have this sort of circular mouthpiece and they do like that sort of thing inside of it. Um, they use an Omniture to change the pitch. So you, the position of the math, it's also the position of your throat, the way the air is flowing, the position of your tongue inside your mouth, that determines where the air goes. It's different for different instruments, but ultimately that, and the breast support is what determines your tone. Hmm. And

Speaker 5:          01:08:32       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:08:33       You, uh, listen to a lot of music. You're an avid consumer of music. Do you still listen when you work to one track or a handful of tracks on repeat? I do. Tell it to explain this. Explain what, uh, the last thing that you, that you listened to in this way and why you do that. Um, literally today, this Sam Smith Song, uh, I'm not the only one, uh, which is actually just blogged about it. Check it. Oh, I can plug my blog man. Dot. T t does a great domain name. Thank you. Yeah. Um, where's t t Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago actually just renewed it for another three years, the wildly three years. I'm curious out. It's a really weird, you know, it was unregistered when I got it. So just luck of the draw. Yeah. I literally, well, it wasn't luck of the jar, just no one went through the, the jump you had to go through to register it as it's a pain in the ass and trying to wire money to Trinidad.

Speaker 3:          01:09:30       And I was in my, I was in like the Bank of America on third and Brandon or something, fourth and Brandon and they're like, sir, are you sure about this? I'm like, yeah, yeah, it's fine. I read on the Internet, it's fine. The internet said it's, it's okay. Someone contacted me, I'm going to send them a couple of grand and I, yeah, they were very concerned about the money I was wearing to this Trinidadian Bank. But um, yeah, the, I find that on your blog you put a video of just a youtube music video for the song, but the, um, that's just because youtube is the easiest way to share music now. Sure. The, the Nice thing about a song on repeat is that I can really enjoy it, but something about it allows my brain to background it as well. Um, I have a couple of albums that I can do the entire album on repeat, but what I can't do is something new or novel.

Speaker 3:          01:10:18       So like a Pandora or Spotify or radio distracts me because I'm like, oh, what's this? And then I'll start next day. I know I'm like on the artist's page and on their Wikipedia and like really digging into it. So I really want something I've heard sometimes, literally a thousand times before. What are some of the other songs that you've heard a thousand times? Um, I really like, uh, John Mayer's who says who says I can't, kids don't, which is kind of funny cause I don't, uh, what is another one? Um, some Connie songs like gorgeous, um, power. Yeah, there's just different, whatever it is at the moment. Um, oh, it's Kendrick Lamar is amazing. So Kendrick Lamar has a song rigor mortis. It's actually kind of upbeat, so it's a pretty intense song. And his lyrics are fast and furious. He's, in my opinion, the greatest lyricist of this generation. What was the name of it? I don't even recognize the name. I'm Lamar. Kendrick Lamar. Oh Man. Yeah. He um, ever when someone told me that a year ago who Taylor swift was, I'm really

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       out of the slipstream of pop culture. Um, yeah, Kendrick Lamar is definitely in my top five favorite rappers right now. And He, um, yeah, his music actually has a lot of jazz influence on many things he does in their song, rigor mortis samples, a jazz track and um, it's, all of these tracks are shorter. So the, um, the Sam Smith is like, I think three and a half minutes, uh, who says is like two 56 or so, um, rigor mortis is under three minutes and just put them on a loop. So I borrowed that habit. Now remember you told me about this and then I thought it was genius because uh, I, I had used different albums for different books and for those people who haven't heard this, because it does help some people a lot to write if you're writing period is best at night and you feel very isolated, which I did late at night, I generally did my best synthesis, not research, not interviewing, but synthesis from about 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM and would be a loan.

Speaker 4:          01:12:13       And it was just very hermit like, and I felt very isolated to be in the quiet and darkness about myself. So I would put in earphones, listened to music on, repeat it very often, something without vocals and pendulum for instance. And I would then watch the same movie over and over and over again. But it would just be my peripheral vision because the images of human beings would make me feel less isolated and it was very comforting. So I had, uh, the Bourne identity, the first and Shaun of the dead for the four hour work week. You wanted the bond movies too. Rail, I've seen hundreds, probably thousands of times because I would just leave it on repeat. So I might play five, six times a night if I'm really in a session. And then for the four hour chef, the funny addition was the first thing that I clicked on Amazon prime that was available on Amazon prime, which was babe.

Speaker 4:          01:13:08       So I ended up watching all the, with the pig with the pig farmer hogget it. And it's actually a really movie. Yeah, it's a brilliant movie. There's a lot hidden in that movie. There are a lot of subtle details. Just like Kung Fu panda is g as a genius that I have not seen. Oh, it's, it's fantastic. I love when they made these movies for kids, but they put cool stuff in there for adults, like Aladdin and many other movies. Yeah. Yeah. Really fantastic. So, all right, so that's the, that's the music trick. The repeat. I have a colleague who does the movie thing and like I do. Yeah. And I get the movie on mute though. Oh really? Yeah. And I listened to the music for him. He does big Lebowski and a few others. But, um, the only, the only variation I've introduced in the past few years is that I like this electronic Edm type group called the Jane Doe's. They're also friends and they do some mixes and they have some, I guess it's called trap music and rap. This is where I'm getting out of my element a little bit. But, um, I find that if I'm doing things like email where I need to be a little bit higher energy and go through a lot of things, uh, that's really good for me. I love it. Uh, auditions.

Speaker 3:          01:14:13       Tell me about auditions. What are, what are auditions, how do they work in automatic? Why auditions? So one thing that's really important when you're in a distributed company is, I mean there's no one looking over. Your shoulder is no manager walking by. There's no one even who knows whether you started work, where if you started work at all or what time he did. So you really need to hire people who are self motivated and can manage themselves to some extent. A Ton of autumn additions were formerly freelancers or Ctos at other companies or things like that because they really need a lot of ability to self direct, have self management, which is a tough skill. Like it's still something that I work on everyday of my life. So what we found, we've tried every hiring, especially when we started, you know, I was much younger and I thought, oh well we should do it like the other companies do it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:06       So we tried, you know, how many manhole covers are there in Manhattan and Mckinsey and Google Brain teaser is the brain teasers or the Google stopped doing them. I think Microsoft is most famous for him. So we did brain teasers, we did coding tests, we did a thing where you like ask a hard technical problem and have them write the code on the whiteboard. We did it where 20 people would interview the person, not literally 20, but you know, like la interview after interview and then you sort of get a consensus and not had a great correlation with how productive and great that person wasn't the company later. Um, and I also started seeing no correlation. I think because I dropped out of college, I was very entranced by people with masters or PhDs. It turns out it has no correlation with how effective they were in an organization.

Speaker 3:          01:15:53       So it we started to do is we found, I looked back to the first couple of people, I said, well, I worked with these guys before we worked together on the open source project and so how can we sort of set up a hiring system that where you actually do the work that you're going to do in the job and that's all you're judging them by. You don't care about anything else. And so we try to make the interview process as much like the actual work as possible so we don't do voice or video. It's all text chat because that's how we primarily communicate also prevents you from any subconscious bias getting romanced by whatever voice or presentation of the person might have. Yeah. Um, or maybe they have a funny accent or something like that. That doesn't matter in our company. Um, unless maybe they're a salesperson and their ability to convince you of something or have a charisma is important for their job. Um, there's really no benefit. So these in person or even voice or video interactions. So we, uh, we have a pretty good system for this. Now. We get a ton of applications. I'm actually over a thousand applications behind now.

Speaker 3:          01:16:58       Okay. How do you filter a thousand applications? Uh, so I book in the process now. So where we've evolved to is I review all the incoming applications. I do a first pass at them and I pass them on to a team if it, if they seem promising or interesting to you look for a while. I can't tell you everything.

Speaker 4:          01:17:16       Okay. When you look for or disqualify against,

Speaker 3:          01:17:21       I look for passion, attention to detail, um, drive beyond the things that they need to do. You know, and I'm totally, I'm totally down with quirky, you know, what questions do you ask to get an indication of those things? So at this point, all I'm doing is looking at emails. So literally there's no chat, no anything. So it's purely based on the Karen effort that they put into this email. And we've tried forms and things they fill out before and we've gone back to just a free form email because I want to see what kind of attachment that use and want to see how their email client is. I want to see if you can tell they've copy and pasted things because different texts, different font sizes, right? So all of those are indicators and not any one of them he's displaying textbooks. Any one of those would not be a Yay or nay, but the combination, you get a pretty good sense.

Speaker 3:          01:18:09       And then I pass it onto a team. The team has, for example, for engineering, they have a system where everyone again looks at it, they kind of rate it, uh, they choose a certain number of people would make it the next stage, which is like a very simple code test, takes about half an hour. Sometimes it's called a fizzbuzz test and programming. And just what does that mean? It just a basic super basic thing that anyone was, does it stand for something that, yeah. So you, you move some variables around that, our fears and buzz and your range of different ways or you repeat them or you sorta array or something like that. But it got it a basic thing that anyone can figure out and that's filters out a surprising number of people even who make it through these first few screens, simple coding tests, and then they screw that up. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:18:56       Okay. All right. Fair enough. I had this application for this managing editor position and I was astonished at how people would go through 75% of the application. This is a woof woof form. They'd get to a question that asked, let's say, you know how you would get the rock to be on the podcast, what would your process look like? And they would say, now on second thought, I'm not interested in this job. And then they would go to the bottom and still hit submit. Wow. I was very puzzled by that. Yeah. There's a lot of odd behavior and jot out a job application, so I don't know if you know, but I'm hiring a new executive assistant, personal assistant, and I referenced you're managing editor, hiring post. Ah, I, I blocked, quoted the section where you say why it's terrible to work with you. Yeah. I think it's important. I've tried to not disguise that, but I haven't been super explicit about it in the past. And I, if I just need someone who finds that Shackleton expedition type description appealing as opposed to off pudding, you know, someone who wants a perfectionist, someone who wants to see someone who wants a person like me to edit the hell out of their work. Yeah. And uh, so I found it very important, but so you have

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       them go through a simple coding test. I liked that, by the way. I went to Antarctica last month in the South Pole and so I've been reading the Shackleton, I think it's the endurance book. Yeah. It's such a fascinating story. So fascinating. Yeah. The, for those people who don't know the classified ad read something like seeking men for dangerous journey, return, uncertain glory, glory upon success. Something on hate, low pay. Hey, harsh conditions. I had a friend who jokes, she should make that her a Okcupid, right? The Tinder description. Probably get a lot of responses. Uh, the, the code test and then what happens? We'll do a trial project. So basically we don't actually, we're not trying to get code out of people or anything like that. We just do something that looks like the actual work and we're not just looking at the code they produce, but how they communicate, how they commit.

Speaker 3:          01:21:02       And that's a paid project. Yeah. So we put everyone on just a flat rate, $25 per hour contract. Um, and from it, most people who apply how jobs are ready. So it's often a nights and weekends thing, right. As long as the expectations are set, that doesn't matter. If you could only work one hour a week, that's okay. Just let us know. Um, some people will actually take vacation to do it, so they'll take time off from their job and you know, kind of go at it full time. Um, if you're applying for happiness engineer position, you'll answer tickets or do live chats. So, um, we try to replicate the real position as much as possible. And then if they make it through all of this, um, they get sent back to me for a final chat and that we'll do on slack. Now. He used to do it on Skype and I just um, go back and forth to them usually like three or four hours actually.

Speaker 3:          01:21:45       But because you're typing so it takes a little longer. And for that I try to determine a cultural fit, um, really get to know the person because I have a, afterwards I like, let's say we're hiring engineer, before I send the offer letter, I decided what team they go on. So kinda like the, that's the thing where you put on a hat in Harry Potter and it decides which, oh, I don't know. I know you're talking about it decides which school you're going to. Yeah. So by yeah, right. By talking to them, I'm partly determining like which team will they fit best with? Because the other 300 people in the company I've done this with and so I know what their strengths and weaknesses are over their personalities are, what time zones there. And so really putting a lot of variables into deciding where someone goes.

Speaker 3:          01:22:28       Are there any simple questions that give you a particular amount of depth into someone's personality? Yeah, I'm, I'm constantly iterating the question list and I'm happy to show it to you after the vodcasts. But, um, every interview is different. I'm just almost every single one. I try out something new or very it. Or what is your spirit animal? Um, what is your spirit animal? I mean [inaudible] you know, it doesn't matter. And you know, some questions I retire and it's totally different and it's not like a preset script or anything. Like sometimes things go one direction and then just go with it. Um, but at the end of it, if decide to make an offer, we talk about compensation and then I send out the letter. What percentage of people fall out in that last chat with you? Falling out in the last chat is pretty rare.

Speaker 3:          01:23:18       Especially now that the systems before it are so good. So the hiring teams have gotten quite, quite good at automatic. It's tough because hiring is not something that you get good at. And T we've done at five or 10 times and you've seen people work out and not workout. So it's really just something that you need experience. So I, I tell people like when they go in this new role, my, you know, in the beginning here and make some mistakes and that's okay, we'll plan for that. Um, but then you learn from that and your triangle it. Do you have an opinion of top grading? Do you know anything about top grading? I find references completely useless. So yeah, including when you go outside, what they give you as references and you try to contact people. It just, I haven't found any, it's takes a ton of time and I haven't found any sort of correlation with the ultimate quality of the person.

Speaker 3:          01:24:06       So I heard about top grading and tried it for a few months, wasn't worth it. It didn't work very well. I have an article I can, we can go to the show notes and Harvard Harvard Business Review where I wrote a kind of five or 10 pages on this. So that's the process. I would love to include that at the, I actually have that printed out because of an old man and highlighted. Cool. Which is a weird thing I do. Sometimes I'll print something out, take notes, highlight, and then rescan it back into Evernote to be OCR. Cool. Yeah. Which uh, which I like a lot cause I think better tactically. Is that a real word? I think so. Uh, uh, what is the book that you have given as a gift most often besides the year without pants, which you can feel free to mention? Oh yeah, there is a book about automatic and wordpress.com called the hero without pants written by a great orthoscopic.

Speaker 3:          01:24:55       And um, it tells a story about how it work. Uh, I give a lot of different books as gifts because everyone's different. So there's one by and apologize now because I can't pronounce anything cause I just read, I don't actually talk that lunch while you were pronouncing crayons is crowns earlier, which round, which I thought was amazing. I was like, crowns, what are crowns? They eat? I was like, oh, crayons. Maybe it's a southern thing. I don't know. But, um, now for example, I've given a few times a book called how Proust can change your life by Elaine. Did baton field guide to getting lost by Rebecca Solnit is one I've given. That's cool. What does that about? Uh, I don't know if I can summarize that one. Actually getting lost. Yeah. Um, there's Rebecca Solnit. Why doesn't she look? Oh, actually she is, that's what she's written. She writes for New York or a little bit everything. Um, the effective executive. That's great. Well that's Peter Drucker read anything by Peter Drucker. So good. His goal. So good. So I recommend that a lot in the company, uh, words that work by Frank Luntz. I did. I read that on your recommendation. Oh, did you like it? I did, yeah. How would you describe that? Let's say former

Speaker 3:          01:26:05       or Carl or has current, yeah, he's like the, the linguistic head of the Republican party,

Speaker 4:          01:26:10       right. So inheritance tax, death tax, or controlling the labels of conversation and understanding of what language works well for certain purposes.

Speaker 3:          01:26:19       Really fascinating. So, and depending on how, if someone likes that book, I liked that book, then I might point them to George Lake off like he has a great seminal work from the 70s called woman fire and dangerous things or just other books about framing and language. Um, so there's, you know, there's a book for every purpose and I find myself finding new ones. So for example, last year I just started reading fiction again. I hadn't read fiction for about 15 years. I did the same thing. What did and any favorites so far y'all? I didn't read fiction for probably 15 to 20 years and is one called the hard boiled wonderland at the end of the universe. Work Hubby. Yeah, I really liked the quirky one and he has a lot of jazz references and things. I like the majors. I have not read. It was a, it was a really good one and I'm working through a few different ones now. Like Shanti Rom and the untethered soul. I've just been trying to carve out more time for reading. The kindle is the device that even if I don't use it for a month or two, I'll still keep in my pack and just because it's aspirational. But when I can get in a good flow, I'll read a little bit every day, sometimes first thing in the morning. And that's, uh, just my whole life is better.

Speaker 4:          01:27:27       Well, you're the one who convinced me to get a kindle. I don't know if you remember, we've gone, we've got a number of trips together. Thelma and Louise Style and attended WordCamps in Greece and Turkey and uh, well Vietnam was a trip for room to read, which is a great organization. But I remember in Greece had this backpack full of 14 books and I was just popping my, you know, my, my discs in my spine lugging this damn thing around. And you had your tiny little kindle touch and you're like, how's that working out for you? It's like, it's terrible. Although what you would do when we were waiting, because you would actually lift it like a weights. That's true. That's true. I use my backpack. Uh, I have a, I have a hemp backpack. That's reinforced that I can use for exercises and swings and stuff. I remember Kevin Rose once when we were in, we went to China on a trip for tea tasting and I would wake up in the morning and I would do exercises. It was so hot there. I would do exercises with this backpack in my, you know, tidy whities like expos, you underwear. Kevin took a video of me doing upright rows in my underwear, which uh, I had to confiscate and delete, thankfully, although I don't think it would do anything bad to my reputation because I don't have one to protect at this point.

Speaker 3:          01:28:41       I think if you looked at a side by side, you have the backpack full of book muscles and I have the kindle muscle.

Speaker 4:          01:28:49       That's true. Although to your credit, uh, you, you did get into a physical fitness and kettle bells and so on. How's that a, has that, has that continued or is that, is that paused the moment

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       it has continued pretty well. Look, can you look leaner than the usual? I shouldn't say the usual. That's not fair. Then puffy mat, and there's a puffy Tim too, but I haven't seen you puffy in quite a while. So the thing that I started doing just most recently, this most recent summer was running and it's kind of randomly like I was in Italy. It was really pretty. I thought, now let me try going for a run. And it killed me. Like I barely made it like half a mile before I had a walk. And then it just kind of started building it. I think my next one was like a month later I get, it wasn't like I was instantly attached, but this, um, there's a guy in the company, he calls himself the crazy running guy and he let him, who's this joy Joe Boyd sting and he actually, or boats, boat boats then, sorry, sorry, job.

Speaker 3:          01:29:47       Um, he started doing this thing where he'd land at the airport and then run to the word camp from the airport. So 20, 30 for our grand meetup in Utah, he ran from Salt Lake City to park city. It was I think 50 or 60 miles. That's insane. And so, uh, at our grand meetup this year, which was in park city, he ran little running workshops every morning. And so I went out with him and he was like, Hey, don't focus on speed. Tried to do 180 strides per minute. So smaller steps, even if you're on slower focus on your heart rate, like all these sort of different things. And it completely transformed me where before I had my legs would always be really sore, like my whole body would her and after I ran, even though I loved it, like I was just in too much pain, I just slowed down and then start being able to go much further.

Speaker 3:          01:30:30       There's really interesting guy named Doctor Romanov. I don't know if you've ever come across the stage. He, he founded a method of running called the pose method and talks a lot about the forward lean and using gravity to assist your money is your money. You could use gravity. If I could figure that out then I Mesic gravity do assist you're running as opposed to heel striking and pushing. And, uh, there are some really fascinating videos of him running on ice, for instance, by using that forward lean. Very, very cool stuff. So you might enjoy, I started with the vibrams. Yeah, I switched to just some super thin trail running shoes, but I still run more on the front or middle of my foot. Yeah, you have to be careful with the minimalist shoes. You can really, if you get too aggressive in the beginning, particularly since the, it's not just the impact on the soft tissues of the foot and the connective tissues.

Speaker 3:          01:31:24       Most people who have walked with an elevated, he'll even an inch for a long period of time, have a chronically shortened Achilles tendon. So suddenly when you stand flat footed and you're leaning forward on top of that to run, you can cause Achilles tendon tendinitis or tendinosis, which is really painful. Really bad. Yeah, I've done that before. And it's true. Like for awhile, my right Achilles was kind of sore, but I had a friend, we were training up for a half marathon together and he ended up really injuring his feet, which is tough because he's a fireman. So is that my best friend in Houston, Renee? So the, um, he ended up, you gotta be careful with this. So I know you're not a huge fan of running

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       and that's high impact and it's a, it's not that I'm, it's not that I'm not a fan, it's that, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:32:09       I choose my exercise based on my objectives and thus far I have not found running to stack up favorably compared to other things. I could say that. Yeah. And I think that it running is much easier to justify as a moving meditation. Uh, and certainly it's fantastic for travel, but that's why I have my bag that I can use as a weight. Also. Uh, I would like to get better at running, do the Lyme disease and everything that I've dealt with. I have partial tears in both acs, both elbows and both hips. So I'm going to have to work up to any type of impact. So I'll start with, I'll start with, uh, some of the calisthenics I'm doing now and then graduate to a low impact jumping rope oh yeah. To, to really condition the lower legs in particular. And then, um, I'm doing long walks, also his way wave of, of conditioning the feet.

Speaker 4:          01:33:02       So I'll do two to three hour walks very routinely and make phone calls, batch my phone calls my I love when I'm in a new city and I can do a run. It's a great way to see a city. Oh definitely. Because you're at just the right speed. I did one in Washington DC we could tear ago and he's just so cool. I felt like I was on an episode of House, a car. It's like I'm going back to Washington monuments and like the Lincoln memorial and like running around the mall. It was so cool. That's what Bruce Lee used to do. You just traveled with his running shoes and when he first landed he would go for an orientation run. Nice. So one of the first things I do in lieu of the jog or running is a bike tours. So I'll do sort of cruiser bike tours in any new city that I want to get acquainted with. Uh, I would love to ask a couple of questions that came in through Twitter specifically. Uh, I am at t Ferriss. Two R's, two s's. You are at photo p h o t o m. A t. T also upon, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:33:59       Remember you used, Oh, I never noticed that. Wow. You just realize that. I just noticed that you are, I forgot you're the pun master. And in Japanese they call those. Oh yeah. IGETC Yoga, which is dad jokes Yad gags. And you do puns all the time. You have as long as I've known you. Okay. I should have known. All right. Photo Mat. That makes perfect sense. So we've covered some of these, uh, Joe Pella Koski acts, asked about how you, uh, acquired developers. We are, we already talked about that. Uh, this is from Andy Von A. Would you still bootstrap versus taking angel money, seed money, a software tool like wordpress if you were starting over in 2015, why or why not? That's an interesting question. I'm not sure if he thinks we're totally bootstrapped or that we've raised money. So the, I'll say what we did and what I would do again. Um, we bootstrapped

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       for the first few months and then I raised about a million dollars. This was automatic. This is automatic. Yeah. Wordpress is a whole separate nd. Um, so for automatically raises about a million dollars in 2006 and that was in hindsight, we didn't need it, but I'm glad we did it because I felt responsible for these other lives. You know, the other people who were sort of betting on joining this company that was run by like a 20 year old. And um, so I want to have some certain, I want to have some money in the bank that said even if things went to zero, we all have a job for at least a year. So that's why we raised that first money 2008 we had an acquisition offer for north of $200 million, even though we were just, I think 18 people at the time. And so use that to turn into a round and did about 12 million a primary capital there.

Speaker 3:          01:35:47       And then we didn't raise money again until last year, 2014. So I was pretty anti raising money. As you can imagine for the six years that we didn't do it. How much should you, is it public health she raised last year or is 160 million? That's a, that's a big number. It is the valuation public. Uh, it was over $1 billion. Yeah. It's also big number, even bigger number. Uh, if you were, if you were starting over again developing wordpress, would you make a for profit entity like wordpress.com or automatic sooner? Um, so it wasn't a matter of nonprofit and for profit, it was just a matter of not even thinking about it. Loose amalgamation of random people working together and then a for profit that came later. Nonprofits, I'm not as much of a fan of his, I used to be, wordpress does have a wordpress foundation. Just the rules around them are mostly designed to prevent people from cheating on their taxes, which we don't care about.

Speaker 3:          01:36:39       And they restrict what you can meet. Yes. Meaning we paid taxes to the cows go home. Right? So those rules to prevent abuse end up constricting the good and organization. Can do a lot of ways. So I don't think I would start another nonprofit in terms of raising money when things, it became very clear to me once I became CEO is the opportunity costs of being as lean and sort of break managing the company to break even as we were, we can do big acquisitions. We couldn't invest in infrastructure, we couldn't do a lot of things that make a lot of sense. Now. Like for example, since we raise money, we're building at a 11 data centers worldwide. So for worldwide he's is a wordpress. It's going to start getting a lot faster because we'll be closer to you physically. Um, I was [inaudible] that we would have considered before and we're doing now, so.

Speaker 3:          01:37:30       Got It. I would, you know, if you can set expectations correctly with investors and raise money on terms that allow you to stay true to your principles and remain in control of the things that you want to be in control of. I think it can be, you know, I would highly recommend it. Um, but there's shared expectations are really important. So I think that would be an expectation that's important to you. Um, an expectation that we're not going to IPO this year, next year or the year after that. Like it's not a priority of ours. Got It. Just time, just agreeing on the timeline and example for us would be, um, that we don't monetize step back. So, you know, can you explain for people what jetpack is? Oh, sure. So jet pack is a plugin for wordpress, so it gives you all the best of the cloud services, a wordpress.com things that like resize and optimize your images for whatever client is visiting, whether on mobile or desktop, um, things that auto posts your blog post to Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest path everywhere.

Speaker 3:          01:38:30       Um, stats, you know, this is all the things built into jetpack. Um, that for us is really about getting more users of wordpress. It's not about charging for some of those features. And now jetpack has huge amounts of usage. It reaches a very influential audience and investor looking at the company might say, Ah, if he's Charles like a little bit of money for this jet pack thing, you'd make hundreds of millions of dollars, but we need to be on the same page that that's not something that we're planning on. And so let's do it. You have the optional, the same. It's always good to have an option, but for me, the thing that's been messaged as being super transparent and super upfront, and I think it's true of relationships of anything. Like if you can set your expectations with your investors, that's what they appreciate and um, it, you invest in a lot of things.

Speaker 3:          01:39:14       I invested a lot of things at automatic. Yeah. I haven't Jummah which I'm honored to be. It's been really fantastically fun so far. There's an asymmetry to what you do because you will hear maybe hundreds of pitches for every company that you have invested in. So I find the smartest guys in the world, when you get to the very top echelon, they have perfect bs detectors. Yeah. It's much better to say, I don't know. Then they try to make up an answer to something you don't actually know. So we'll just kind of refreshing actually that just honesty and transparency is actually, even when you're raising at north of $1 billion is the best policy. Yeah. Such a fascinating landscape. This is a question from Chris Saka ask Matt if he will take you shopping for a bad ass suit. I guess I should say a bad butts.

Speaker 3:          01:40:02       Who? It's funny cause I actually say bad ass. I just didn't because you did this whole setup so I was trying to set expectations if you, I mean you have some pretty good suits. I've seen. I do, I have some suits but um, I like suits because it removes all the decision making. I don't like matching. I don't like picking out outfits that will match, which is why I like suits. It's either tee shirt and jeans or suit. I do very little in between. If you're going to go for a suit, Tom Ford, Tom Ford, the way to go. They're pretty amazing. Any particular soup now? No. Go into the store. They'll set you up and your body types different to mine. They'll, they'll find something that makes you look great, but they, they, they're cut as much younger and much slimmer, a much, um, more shaped in a way.

Speaker 3:          01:40:51       I love Catone or Loro Piana or like different folks, but they tend to be made for older men to be honest. So I lived their materials, but I ended up tailoring them and re cutting them. How did you get into clothing and fashion? Because it wasn't always this way? Um, I have no idea. It might've been the influence of my good friend Ome on MOLEC and know he, he appreciates the finer things in life and I think that for who created giggle and for people who don't know, yeah, go home. He's a journalist now VC at true ventures. Um, and one of my best friends, one of the first users of wordpress too. I think that of course in anything, like if we're talking about Tequilas, if we're talking about class, where if we're talking about microphones, like there is as a spectrum and you can go deep on any topic.

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       And I find it fascinating, you know, when he meets someone, that's one thing I always keep in mind, like everyone is interesting if you're ever bored in a conversation, the problems with you and not with the other person because 100% agreed. That's what any good journalists will tell you also. Yeah, it's just all about figuring out what someone's really into, what they're passionate about, and then when you find those passions, it's just, I find it fascinating that like go deep on chicken raising or whatever it is. So on purchases, what is the last hundred dollars or less purchase that you made that had a very positive impact on your life are the first thing that comes to mind is quite embarrassing.

Speaker 3:          01:42:19       The gimp suit. No, I'm just kidding. I used to make so much fun of like Marin moms who were a Lulu Lemon all day, but since I started running and working out more, she's out. Lulu lemon is freaking awesome, like really great stuff. Now it's kind of expensive. Like it's definitely what this, it's like shopping at whole foods where you walk out in the check and I'm like Whoa, how did that happen? About like two tee shirts and some sweatpants. But um, super high quality. I love how the tax tear out so there's no tags allow. The shorts are reversible and I found especially as a travel constantly some of these sort of long sleeve material shorts will be super sharp, super soft, super warm. I can run them, I can sleep in them, I can do whatever the, speaking of packing, I will link to this in the show notes, but you recently put up a post about what you have in your carry on bag and that is a genius carry on bag.

Speaker 3:          01:43:11       I shouldn't say that. Maybe since I haven't seen the article yet, but based on previous experience, you're very methodical. What's the one thing people can do one or two things with carry on luggage that will make the biggest difference in your opinion? It's supposed to about my backpack. So it's about the things that, I mean, I brought my backpack here, I carry my backpack almost constantly. Um, especially being what type of backpack is up ads that is a very Indiana Jones. I thank you. It's, it's from a company called hard graft and linked to it in the most, um, it's leather. They, it's, it's a little pricey but it's really good. I'll keep that for the next decade. Um, so because I can work from anywhere, I have to work from everywhere. That's the downside. Yes. And you never know when an emergency he's going to pop up or anything.

Speaker 3:          01:43:56       So I tend to have within sort of a 10 to 15 minute radius, um, the tools I need to be productive anyplace in the world, including if I'm an Antarctica, that might be a satellite phone. If I'm in a different country, maybe that's a local Myfi card or, um, and so I'm just constantly bringing things in and out. I was hesitant to, to do a post about it. You asked me to do a post about this years ago. I did. And I kept putting it off because it kept changing. So every time I'd start I'd like to take a picture of my bag and then it would change. By the time I wanted to email. You still use, I think it's cold. Oh, this is, I have one right here. This is since I am packing. Uh, well this is gritted technology by cocoon. You still use this?

Speaker 3:          01:44:38       Oh Wow. Yeah. I use a big grid it, but this is a company called cocoon for you people who can't see with clairvoyance. What we're looking at. It is a, it's basically a sheet. Mine is about five inches by 10 inches. Uh, mine's eight by 10 I think. Yeah, your zip by 10 and it's a perpendicular straps of elastic that you can stick cables into iPhones, into batteries, into chapstick into as opposed to just having a big mess of stuff in 15 pockets. I find my stuff always falls out. Like I just pulled it out and it was like half empty. So things are constantly falling out of it. I don't know if the way I walk or whatever, but I always put it back in. So the key for me, I used to lose things all the time. In fact, at one point I would lose my keys so much.

Speaker 3:          01:45:27       Um, I've, I still have an old car so it has a different door, key and ignition key. So I made literally 15 copies of my Dorky and I wrote photo mat on it and then I gave it to all my friends. And even like some random people I meet, like instead of a business card, I just give them a key to my car with the idea of being, you have as when I lost my keys. So one would have the ability or when I locked my keys in the car, we need to teach you how to had a, had a Jimmy your door. We need to get you, we need to get you some, uh, some locksmith keys. I'm not sure if that's legal. So, uh, with it within the boundaries of legality in your state or jurisdiction. Uh, but yeah, so I find that now I have places where everything goes.

Speaker 3:          01:46:12       So my mouse for example, always goes in the right front pocket of my backpack. And if any time something's not that, like I keep a bowl by my front door. The is always going there. You said that it was a bowl, a bowl right by the front door. Um, anytime something's not in that place and I see it, it's a bug. So I try to put it in that place as soon as possible because otherwise I know I'll forget. And then you know, I'm coming over, I have a meeting, I spend 10 minutes looking for my wallet because I just stuck it someplace. It's in the fridge or something, you know, I'm always losing something. Actually I lost one of our initial investment checks. It's a check for $400,000. That's not good to lose. It was a investor, Phil Black, who is actually still on the board today and he wrote a paper check, like the kind that you would use the grocery store or like from normal things.

Speaker 3:          01:46:58       As a foreigner, as most money I've ever seen in my life. I was like, I was 20 years old. I was like, what is this? I expect it to be a check, like a publisher's clearing the you have a table, you could surf Lego, right, like a floating carpet from Aladdin down to the bank. So we raised, luckily the other investors wired their money because, and this place, this check and I was thinking, oh my goodness, like what do I do with this situation? Like cause obviously like he could stop the check but then he's just and trusted me with 400,000 and I've lost it. Like what's the most irresponsible thing you can do? So like do I tell him, do I not tell him? Is he going to notice at some point and months pass, literally months pass. He doesn't say anything. I don't say anything because you didn't want to ask him.

Speaker 3:          01:47:37       I didn't ask him and I'm going back to Houston for Thanksgiving and I opened the book I'm reading and I'd use it as a bookmark and it kind of fill out the book on the plane. I was like, oh, oh my goodness. It's quite a fine. That's better than $20 at the pants you just washed. And uh, so first thing I did when I landed, I went to the Bank of America also. I expected it to be like when you hit Jackpot on like a slot machine, like you've deposited 400 grand checked like bell should go off. Like they should like give you a gospel of champagne or something. But total non just dishonor events at this local branch of Bank of America. I just was like, oh, here we go. Like okay, goodbye. It's the most anti climatic thing ever. But besides here you have people behind you.

Speaker 3:          01:48:20       I didn't, I told them like a year later and he was like, oh man. Yeah, he just hadn't looked. So speaking of big numbers, how the hell did you end up beating 140 or whatever? Chicken mcnuggets why did that happen? 104 hundred and four. I don't remember how long ago. It was probably about 10 years ago at this point. 11 years ago. But the Superbowl was in Houston, Texas. And, um, you know, I lived like a mile from the reliant stadium where they were doing the super bowl. And so I was watching and as for the super bowl, all the Mcdonald's did a special where he get 20 big nuggets for like $4 and I was super broke at the time. And so it was like, man, I'm just going to stock up on these at the way you might get like cans or you know, things or ramen or like cans of Campbell's, which I would do when they went on sale.

Speaker 3:          01:49:10       I always buy a bunch of them. So I just like got a bunch of mcnuggets and then I was just stuck. I love me nuggets and I the kind of like sweet talk the person. So they gave me lots of extra that sweet and sour sauce and the Mcdonald's sweet and sour sauce is not like sweet and sour sauce anywhere else in the world. Like all sweet and sour sauce is red. And for some reason there's this brown, I don't know why you might been genetically engineered to be as addictive as possible. I don't know. It's so good. So I just start popping them. And next thing I knew it was 104 so it wasn't even a better or anything. You just rampaged through 104 while watching the super bowl. That's it. Was this, it was the Superbowl where Janet Jackson had the wardrobe malfunction. Yeah, the

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       breast explosion. Sorry, I missed that. How was, it was a gratifying, I was watching it with my family and there was like this moment of silence afterwards were like, what just happened? I was completely mortified and I think I had a laptop and the Internet and Wifi I had the time. So I was like, I put like what just happened? Like I'm going to go on the Internet and see. And it turns out like what happened happened. Like there was a wardrobe

Speaker 3:          01:50:15       function and I'm a good friend of mine was in the audience about 15 feet away from her. And you know, there's all the theories that it was planned.

Speaker 4:          01:50:23       Yeah. And she said she was so pissed off, like looked so angry. She has, it was not abs. Absolutely not planned. I could've, yeah, I would have bet that it was planned to. This reminds me you're shocking moment with your, you're mortified little bit with your parents. When I went to the movies with my entire family, uh, and I was sitting next to my brother and my parents were sitting on the other side of my brother. We went to see the girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which I had read. My brother had one credit and those of you who've read the book or seen the movie will know there's one particularly just mortifying seeing a minute or two beforehand. I was like, oh yeah, excuse me. I have to go get to go to the bathroom. When I came back and my brother's like, you fucker, you knew exactly what was going to happen, didn't you?

Speaker 4:          01:51:10       And I was like, Yep. Yeah, I did. Sorry about that. My identical story was titanic, which as much as much tamer, but I just for some reason went to see titanic with my mom and I was like, oh, I think it's about to happen that sees the car. Seeing the car scene are there where he's drawing hers. And I was like, I'm just going to leave for a few minutes and I cope. It's over by the time I get back. Uh, to switch gears a little bit, when you think of the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind and why?

Speaker 5:          01:51:35       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:51:37       It's funny because he's getting totally panned in the press right now, but I think of Jeff basis.

Speaker 5:          01:51:42       Why'd you phases?

Speaker 4:          01:51:44       Well, why didn't you getting pin? This is how I get informed.

Speaker 3:          01:51:47       Ah, the fire phone was a complete flop. They went down hundreds of millions of dollars of inventory. Obviously it didn't sell well. Um, and articles have come out since then saying how like he micromanage the whole process and things like that. Um, I'm actually gonna do a blog post about this. One of my favorite business books is called the halo effect and it talks about the case study they use is Cisco and sort of the 98 to 2002 time period. How, and sort of when they were on the rise and one of the most valuable companies in the world, high stock. And when Saint John Chambers is genius, they acquire companies, they don't have to invent everything. They can, you know, acquire dozens of companies and integrate them and the competitors just can't compete. And then once they started crashing again, nothing changed about the business. But the stock goes down the same. Sometimes the same writers were saying, Oh, it's a mishmash of infighting. They have all this like technology that doesn't integrate and they can't invent things so they have to acquire it. So Lou, the same strategy is viewed in a totally different realm. And this is halo effect as

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       a case study going on right now with Amazon. So we're a few years ago, everyone said how Amazon makes these big bets. They're willing to lose money for years and years and something like the kindle and just ruthlessly iterate over and over Amazon web services, they go into places where no one says they should go. Um, the fire phone flopped. And everyone's saying, Ah, these idiots, you know, this, the attention to detail becomes micromanaging, you know that everything. But ultimately what I admire in the longterm as Jeff Bezos has convictions around things and he's going to be wrong sometimes I don't expect them to be perfect, but I do expect him in my idolize mine to continue making those big bets and he's probably not taking it for risk if he doesn't super mess it up every couple of years. Oh, I totally agree. And just the story of basis. I haven't read the everything store.

Speaker 4:          01:53:32       I would like to, I don't know if you have excellent book. Yeah. Uh, but uh, sounds like a good time to buy Amazon. This is not investment advice. Consult your regulatory attorney and professional wealth advisor, but it's when those types of sort of capricious judgements are made based on a one off event, especially in the, well sometimes this macro related, sometimes it's just a single launch related. God, it's so funny how quick, how quickly people are deterred. All though I will tell you most of the time I don't believe the words as they're written on the page. I think they're just journalists with a tough job, which sometimes I think borders on unethical, which is having to churn out a lot of content and tenuously on an unreasonable schedule and to come up with insights that are with rare exception, very, very difficult to produce on demand as Aha moments once a day or five times a day or 12 times a day.

Speaker 4:          01:54:33       So they end up regurgitating or rewording things they've written before and the people with the most knowledge about a given topic don't necessarily have any incentive to write about it. Absolutely not. So do you buy and sell individual stocks? I don't right now. My personality, my intestinal fortitude is not well suited to public stocks. Uh, I don't like having the option on a daily basis to buy and sell. Yeah. I like doing a ton of due diligence, investing in, for instance, a startup and then betting on a seven to nine, seven to nine year growth curve or longer or longer. Now automatics coming up on 10 yeah. And I'm not, I'm not overly, that doesn't, that doesn't concern me. It actually consoles me because it forces me to do more homework on the front end. I agree. Um, I use wealth front and also an investor in, but or both an investor and Melbourne's, I get individual stocks, like if I like maker bought and sold to a company called Stratasys.

Speaker 4:          01:55:34       So I ended up with a bunch of Stratasys doc and it was really knowing to have like this minute, the minute number that moves. Like that's the one thing I wouldn't look forward to it being a public company is, oh, raising money is hard as well because basically saying something, your life's work, this is what it's worth, right? They're quantifying it. I can't imagine what it's like with the minute, the minute vagaries of the market. Public markets. I'm so, I'm so continually impressed by people like nuts and Talib or many of the hedge fund guys out there who are develop a hypothesis about a particular way to approach a short, a short sale or short position. So they're looking at the subprime mortgage crisis and they're trying to bet on that happening or the sovereign debt issues in Europe for instance. And their ability to just bleed for extended periods of time with these option positions and function as normal human beings and be okay with losing money every, all losing money every day and having people tell you you're an idiot.

Speaker 4:          01:56:43       Yeah. Uh, where you, I just, I can't fathom actually handling that well personally. So oddly enough, the binary nature of startups suits my psychology well because it, it's applying a constraint and removing decisions than I might otherwise botch emotionally. So I can be very highly rational on the front end and make a specific type of investment that precludes me from making stupid emotional decisions. And emotionally you want to buy high and sell low at that? Oh, definitely. If it's dropping, I got like I get out of it. So if it's rising and like, oh, it's great, I'm going to buy some more. Are there any particular books on investing or books that you've read that have helped you think about investing? My, he said that the man, uh, [inaudible] you're the one who introduced me to the Black Swan actually I was in Greece. I don't recommend that to everyone.

Speaker 4:          01:57:38       So I love the Black Swan. I love it. Uh, fooled by randomness. Antifragility his latest one. I love his book of Aphorisms. I kids writing has been super influential on me both in, in and of itself and also in the works that he's pointed me towards because he makes a ton of sometimes annoyingly so references to other things. Yeah. But I came introduced me to emerge a echo and other really fantastic author. So, um, he's great. And then, you know, reading Warren Buffett's letters. I was leading a Warren Buffett friend Fan. I wish I were a big Warren Buffett friend. I am a big Warren Buffett Fan. Uh, and I know that name is, is bandied about a lot by of course millions of investors, but the annual letters, getting it straight from the horse's mouth as opposed to the second or third hand interpretations is just phenomenal. It is something I can say. You asked about what we look for for candidates hiring, um, clarity of writing. I think clarity of writing indicates clarity of thinking. Writing is honestly one of the hardest things they do everyday at various. You've written a couple now I've tried to write

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       a book. I can't, I haven't been able to do it. It's a very masochistic process. I would not want to inflict on, on anyone unduly. But I love reading about writers in the process of writing like bird by bird and Lamont or on writing. Well, I Williams enzyme, um, there Ernest Hemingway and writing, which I think I got from this podcast actually. Yeah, that's a funny one because when you can rent well you can think well. And so when I find obviously in Warren Buffet's letters, the thinking is so clear. And so that's something I look for in these sort of random emails we get our cover letters or resumes is a well written. If someone's a great writer, they tend to be a great programmer or efficient or something else. So, um, again, it's not everything, but it's a strong indicator. So just a few more questions.

Speaker 3:          01:59:26       Uh, the first is from wow. Valora Thor, that is a fantastic name, sir. What role will wordpress spelled correctly play in online content outside of the browser example, given mobile apps, Apis, et cetera. In the near future. It's inside baseball, but a very good question. So there's been basically two waves and WordPress's history. Uh, we started to just blogging Lily's just a blog and you'd have the rest of your website doing something else. Then you'd plug the blog in your wordpress, we'd spend it to be a CMS. It was the second wave of wordpress and then it started powering your entire site. So, and that's been really the past five or six years where we become almost like the dial tone of the web. Like if you're starting a website, he started with wordpress and then you plug other things into wordpress, whether that's ecommerce management, CRM, whatever it is, it's a plugin for wordpress.

Speaker 3:          02:00:19       This third wave that we're going through right now is word press as an application platform. So people are using the primitives and the things afforded by WordPress's infrastructure, the things that we wrote to write a blog and CMS to write other things. The primitives are the elements of the infrastructure that we're used to create those things in the first place. Yeah. So think of a primitive as a basic building block. Got It. So like a social primitive one that Kevin Rosen invented was like this embeddable button that lets you vote on things, right? The dig it button, which is now the like button, the tweet button, et cetera. Um, that's a primitive semis. So we have primitives around user authentication, around content types, around caching, around URLs, around lots of things that if you're building something from scratch, you got to do all this stuff, right?

Speaker 3:          02:01:04       So if you can start with wordpress, it's saves you months. Um, not for everything, not for everyone. But if you know, wordpress, it, you know, you start, um, I'm gonna ask you [inaudible] 80 miles per hour because I like asking silly questions. Uh, as a, as a nun, non programmer, how does, uh, and I know it differs significantly, but how does that differ from, say, ruby on rails, whoever be in real estate and they similar, it's people using wordpress as a framework. It's a framework which does a lot, has a lot more things built out than like a ruby might. Um, so think of it as the thing that wordpress does built. If what you want to build looks like that. So not a game, not a chat application, not something like that. If it looks like content, we've already managed more content than anyone else in the world at this point. I'm using our data structures using our APIs. It's probably the best way to go about it. What are some of the big companies or publications that use your platform? It's pretty much all of them at this point. Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, um, international papers, uh, new media. So Giga Ohm, tech crunch, recode, all the tech blogs basically. Um, years mean it's really the technique, very flattered.

Speaker 3:          02:02:24       But I try it, if you look at tech meme, like we'll typically power 50 to 70% of all the sites that are in tech meme on a given day. Um, tech meme. For those people who don't know, would you say it's fair to say it's a roundup of tech news from around the web? It's one of my vices. We talked about vices earlier. So t e c h m e m e.com. It's um, it's algorithmic and human. It's the best tech newspaper in the world like it, and it just links you to places. So almost like a drudge report, but it's so much better. Um, you go to the primary sources. So what sometimes might be not even news, like a tech crunch or verge, but the actual person like you or me, real interested, they'll link to the originals as well, which is really nice. What if you had to point a 20 year old entrepreneur who's looking to start a company, let's just say it's tech for the time being, what two or three books or resources would you give to them or suggest to them?

Speaker 3:          02:03:24       I'm going to repeat with the effective executive or anything from Peter Drucker. He actually has one, I think it's called the art of entrepreneurship. It's got entrepreneurship in the title. Super good. Again, these are old now and like from the seventies or eighties though, but they're so good. He's just one of the clearest thinkers about all these things about management, about entrepreneurship. When I was getting started, I actually really loved the art of the start by Guy Kawasaki. Aggregate it since then. Yeah, no, it, it stands up pretty well there, but I'm really inspired me. I think she read the four hour work week. Just I'm going to plug you go and a recent one, like a brand new one. Um, I'll say two brand new ones. I'm sorry you asked for three to give. You can keep going. You can go. Um, the hard things about hard things by Ben Horowitz.

Speaker 3:          02:04:08       Pretty good. Entertaining more than anything. Like I read that book, I was like, I would never work for this guy but I'm entertaining and some good lessons. And then Peter teals zero to 101 I thought was excellent. It's to one is great and people should definitely, if they find that interesting and they are going into tech, I think try to read the original classmates as well. Yeah. By Blake masters I believe. Exactly. They're really just tremendous. All of these guys. I mean don't take them as Gospel, like disagree with them, uh, interpreted in your own way. Um, if some people who are admire quite a bit like saying Marc Andreessen, uh, when we first pitched him, the whole meeting was about how distributed companies were a terrible idea. And he was like, well, what do you know that every other tech company that's been big in history doesn't the Facebooks, the googles, the Microsofts to everything.

Speaker 3:          02:04:59       And so why should you do something different? Um, and it turns out it was a good meeting. I thought it was terrible. Me I thought was the worst meeting of my like entire career. And I thought that's his style is he challenges you and sees how you spot. But um, you know, sometimes going against the orthodoxy, doing the things that other people can't do. I think of it like business judo. What can we do that now Google makes tens or hundreds of billions of dollars more than us? What can we do that we can't do? Well, they're set up best to work in the office culture and where's it at best to work in an office culture so we can get the smartest people in the world who sometimes leave Google cause they want to live in Salt Lake City or Adelaide, Australia or someplace else for whatever reason, it doesn't matter. But, um, they're just as good as anyone inside the mountain view offices, but they just don't happen to be in mountain view. It's like the, it makes me think of the book, the starfish and the spider. And, uh, particularly with the open source component, right. Open sources. I'm going to the open source. Wordpress isn't going to die. Uh, even if even if automatic were to cease operations. Uh,

Speaker 3:          02:06:04       well even to this day, we compete with people 10 times their size and 10 or a hundred times a capitalization. Uh, in 2014, one of our competitors, Squarespace spent north of $45 million on advertising. They did Superbowl advertiser, didn't they? Yeah, they're going to do more this year. That's expensive. But they had to. Yep. You know, that's the only way they can get customers. Where because we have this community because we have these, uh, hundreds of thousands of developers all over the world because we have, um, the sort of intrinsic, I think, goodness of the software. We don't have to spend advertising in 2014 we spent about a million dollars on advertising and that was mostly events. And you do love events. I love your events too. They're very well done. Thank you. Uh, okay. Two more questions. If you were sent to desert island and you could bring one album fest, a lot of book questions, I'm trying to come up with something else. One album, one album and two other items that were non survival related, what would they be? The album's really tough. There are some really perfect albums out there. Like I think Radiohead's okay. Computer. It's like just a perfect album and it works as an alum. The individual songs don't work as well or like, uh, uh, frank ocean's mix tape, alternate out. I like that. Some of these that are just so good. Kendrick Lamars, good kid. Matt City, you got check checkout chick, Kendrick Lamar. I know you're not as in as the hippity hop. Oh that's not true. If it's break beats are danceable and

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       I like the lyrics. I'm all for it like Eric B and Rakim and that. Ill How old are you? 67. I'm just giving you a hard time but this is a new guys that are super close. There are some good guys. I what I don't like is the homogenates we have a lot of the beat structure that has been sort of commoditized for top 40. That stuff makes me insane. But if it's, if it has some unique

Speaker 3:          02:08:00       flavor rhythms yeah. All for it. Yeah. You like Kendrick Lamar. Um, so probably one of those albums and if I have to pick one, I'll pick a jasmine, uh, Sonny Rollins saxophone colossus. I could listen to that album the rest of my life and learn something new every day. Uh, in terms of other nonessential items that aren't books, I'm not going to say a kindle or an encyclopedia or something. Know a 50 millimeter, 1.4 Prime Lens. Okay. Is the Lens I would take to a deserted islands and I burned easily, so probably a umbrella.

Speaker 4:          02:08:33       You and I bond over that. I thought I was the only human who didn't tell him, but alas, Hark. Matt Mullenweg. Uh, last question. If you could give your 20 year old self a piece of advice, one piece of advice, what would it be? Slow down. Slow down. Why

Speaker 3:          02:08:56       we talked about it with running earlier, like slow down to go further. Um, I think a lot of the mistakes in my youth where mistakes have ambition, not mistakes of sloth, sloth and um, I think building foundations, building things that last for the long term. Obviously some of that's happened, but, um, some of it I think I rushed through education. I definitely kind of squandered, you know, even when I was in high school, like they put great books in front of us, like the great Gatsby or subsidies or something, and they said it is I dug into, but like others like Fitzgerald, I just can't do the bare minimum to pass the class or pass the test when now I would kill for the luxury to just like really sit down with one of his books and dive into it and discuss it. Um, and so just slowing down whether that's meditating, whether that's taking time for yourself, away from screens, whether that's really focusing in on who you're talking to or who you're with. But as I've aged,

Speaker 4:          02:09:59       I know it sounds ridiculous. Yes. It's interesting because I had a lot of living in dog years though. I mean the amount of experience that you can press into each years. Unbelievable. Well,

Speaker 3:          02:10:10       I have a lot of, I had a lot of success at a young age was intimidating because you sometimes think, am I ever going to top this or did I peak at 20 or 21 when I was doing polyphasic sleep? And writing these new things and everything since then, some downhill. Um, you wonder about impact on the world. But ultimately it's funny that now what I more about is a lot narrower. It's like the people who you love and the people that love you and you don't always choose either of those, right. It's not as, he can't help you fall in love with life would be so much easier if you could. That's true. And do you don't always choose who falls in love with you and, but there's responsibility on both. And really focusing on those people I found has contributed more to my happiness and I want to say anything else. I think that's a great place to end. Matt, where can people learn more about you?
