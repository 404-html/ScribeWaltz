Speaker 3:          00:04:29       Welcome to the show. Thank you for having me, Tim. I have been looking forward to this for quite a while because every time we talk and we've known each other for years, I come away with notes upon notes of things that I want to test or try. So I'm hoping and expecting sternly, like an angry,

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       yeah, that's a lot of pressure. This as we will have this,

Speaker 3:          00:04:52       but for people who don't have uh, too much context, you were number 30 at Facebook. Uh, you are number four employee. It meant which sold to intuit for a hundred plus million dollars. And you've created multiple products now that have earned seven figures. Uh, what else should people know perhaps as background or what would you like to tell them about as context? I thought that was pretty good man. I was like, wow, whoever that guy is, he sounds pretty good. Hire that man. Speech writers. I mean, you know, the,

Speaker 4:          00:05:19       the only other thing is, is like I came out like a lot of people who are listening, you know, I came out of Berkeley or whatever college you come out to and I worked at a corporate job at Intel sitting in a cubicle. Um, and then, you know, I didn't really use it, networking or any of that kind of stuff to kind of eventually go to these kind of cool companies and be able to create my own businesses that give me the freedom to do a lot of things I want to do.

Speaker 3:          00:05:38       And you are in Austin, Texas, is that right? Yes sir. Where did you grow up?

Speaker 4:          00:05:43       I grew up in bay area, about a mile and a half from the apple headquarters.

Speaker 3:          00:05:47       So near Cupertino somewhere. Yeah. You know, the question of why there has been a mass exodus, it would seem from cities like New York City and San Francisco to Austin is one I've never really heard. Uh, you answer. So maybe I can just ask you, why is Austin becomes such a hotbed and why did you choose to move to Austin? Yeah, I mean, I actually interned

Speaker 4:          00:06:09       like in 2000, about 10 years ago and I came out here and, uh, I never heard of the place. I didn't even know. I mean, in Texas now it's, you know, because the Internet, people know that there's a, there's places inside of Texas they have like photos. Uh, but I never knew what Austin was about. And I came here and I had sex with this person and then I got drunk and it was like, like, what's that book, Lord of the flies where it's like the young kids take over in high wind.

Speaker 3:          00:06:31       Yes. It's basically like that. But we have a city.

Speaker 4:          00:06:37       So I came here and I was like, how come no one else is here? You know, you're paying half as much as the bay area for housing. We actually see grass, a lot of grass around us. Um, you got a lot of Tacos, which is what I'm known for and it's like one of the capitals that Tacos in the nation and it's kind of like, um, you know, it's like what the barrier was probably like 10 years before now. It's just like you're packed and you're paying the same prices. Uh, and I think also fundamentally there's a few key things for you. But fundamentally I just, I didn't want to also just be around startups talking about their funding a all day long. And so Austin provided a lifestyle from me where it was more affordable, really attractive women, a really good outside life. Like when I leave the office, I have a good lifestyle. It just really fit that fit, that balance. And that's why I think it's, you know, it's one of the fastest growing cities in the nation right now.

Speaker 3:          00:07:22       Yeah. It's one of my favorite cities. I almost moved there after college actually. It was between, uh, Austin NSF and I didn't make it to the final round of interviews for trilogy software. So that made the decision for me. So I was came very close. I could have forked another way and ended up in Austin.

Speaker 4:          00:07:38       Did you get like flown out and like first class in the limo experience with trilogy?

Speaker 3:          00:07:42       I don't think I made it that far. I think, I think they recognized a terrible potential employee very quickly and decided that, uh, I would be more trouble than I was worth, which is probably accurate. Uh, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:07:55       you know what's funny about that? Like I got a job offer, well, I applied, I've applied for Google twice and I've been rejected twice and I'm like, is Google really good or am I that bad? Or is it just like, I meant to kind of run my own thing. And I remember what I did my interview with Google, I couldn't remember how to do division

Speaker 3:          00:08:13       that makes it hard to get a job at Google. I imagined, I was like, dude, I gotta use my calc. I gotta use my phone. Do you mind? He's like, okay, it's not, you're not gonna get the job done. So like if you don't, if you can't do 12 times 12 no, I'm sorry I have some bad news and lets you run it. You know, for our cafeteria jobs.

Speaker 4:          00:08:29       Occasional good. It was the division man anyways, so awesome. I mean coming back to it, it was just more of a, after being the barrier around engineers and all that stuff. My life, I wanted something a little more affordable women and outside and just kind of like a slower lifestyle. I would say for younger people I would actually recommend going to these busier cities. Cause you're surrounding yourself with like

Speaker 3:          00:08:45       hungry, hungry people better or what age would you say that is? I'm saying up until 30 I would say like

Speaker 4:          00:08:51       a really populated city personally. And that's what I did because you're around, people are hustling and it's really inspiring and it's motivating and there's a meetup every day and we, you know, we have that in Austin, but it's nowhere near the level of the bay area or New York. And so I'd say if you're going to you, I would want to be around that and get connections to that and experience that. Cause you're, I mean, if you look at Austin, like how many big companies have come out of Austin? Tim, like name too,

Speaker 5:          00:09:12       Dell and blank. I'm sure there are others. You could, okay. So [inaudible] was actually really good fuels. What'd she say? I said Willie Nelson biofuels.

Speaker 4:          00:09:23       The Willie Nelson Dude. I mean, I was going to say it like a, we'd joke, but like name, name to that came out of the bay area. I mean, you could go on for days,

Speaker 5:          00:09:29       right? Yeah. So, and that's a different special. Yeah. And You have a density in SF that you don't have an Austin, namely, I guess what I mean by that is you have the peninsula and the bay area, but just within San Francisco you have, let's just call it 700,000 people, very densely packed in. So getting to events, meeting New People, uh, bumping into the icons are billionaires you want to meet is as easy as going to a handful of different coffee shops. Whereas in Austin, in my experience having gone to south by southwest, so many times it's more spread out much like Los Angeles or those types of serendipitous moments are a little harder to engineer. I mean

Speaker 4:          00:10:06       the funniest one from me, I was walking in San Francisco a few years ago and I'm talking about paypal with my friend Boris and then I'm like, oh my God. Literally the Guy Walking in front of us was Peter Teal and I was like, Peter, we had a question about paypal. Could you mind if I ask you,

Speaker 5:          00:10:20       is the cofounder of paypal for people wondering who's in the first money into Facebook? And another actually another guest on the podcast as well. Uh, the, the place I'd like to go next and I think maybe working backwards make sense to you. I'd love to experiment with just frontloading this episode with a lot of tools and tactics that people can play with, uh, as soon as they listen to this episode. What are some of the tools, whether they're apps or otherwise, that you are really into at the moment or that you find extremely useful? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:54       So I'll give you my top things that I use in, I think everyone should literally use right now and go do these things. Number one, and this is, it's not even an APP or anything, it's speeding up your mouse pad. It's the number one productivity hack cause you're on your computer almost all the day. Go to your settings, speed up your mouse, but double what you're at. It takes a few minutes to get used to, but you realize like holy crap, everything starts at the top. So speed up your mousepad, everything will get faster. I really love that one. I, because anytime I'm on a, someone's slower, I'm like, wow, it's so slow. What's wrong? Is Your computer broken? So you're just going to system preferences and then

Speaker 5:          00:11:28       keyboard. And then when the mouse track pad, actually it's one of those three.

Speaker 4:          00:11:32       Yeah. Trackpad yeah. You Click on track pad and then you go to your tracking speed and move it to the, basically almost the fastest. And then your keyboard is, or the way that you get around computer to significantly faster. Got It. Uh, let me just go through a list of things that I love. Other things on the computer. Alfred APP, if you're not using Alfred App, it's free. And basically instead of having to even move your mouse, you can just hit a launch bar and then type in whatever app you want and it'll automatically loaded. So if I wanted to open Firefox, I can just hit command space for our type of hit enter and it's loaded instead of me having to move my mouse anywhere on the screen. Is that uh, I've, I've heard of Alfred before I use, uh, I guess it's spotlight, uh, just built into the [inaudible] waste lower man.

Speaker 4:          00:12:15       It's just a lot slower. It's way slower. And with Alfred App you can do contacts. I can do math with it sometimes when I need help a lot of the times. Okay. Got It. When I have to do this division. So Alfred APP is an awesome one, especially for getting around your Mac. Don't know if they have a PC version yet, but who uses PC? Um, I don't know. Do you feel bad when they have like when people are using hotmail or PC? I'm like Rosa everything. Okay. Is there, okay, let me go. I'm going to go more because I didn't know what I want to give the meaty stuff we um, I use, so let's get into apps like web and other things for this is one is a kill or one, it's a chrome extension called Facebook newsfeed eradicator. Hmm. And this one is amazing and I used to work at Facebook and I know all of us, you, you have this like weird thing where you're so used to going phase where you just type in Ffa and your, your hand, you can't even control it.

Speaker 4:          00:12:59       And so we install the Facebook newsfeed eradicator. You'd go to Facebook and it blocks your news feed and then you get there. And I do it. I'd probably do 10 times a day. I go to Facebook and I get there and there's nothing there. And I'm like, well, I guess there's nothing for me to do today. Everyone's asleep. And I go back to my work. Um, because I think people are looking for so many different productivity hacks. I just try to focus on the big ones that are really helpful in that one is huge cause I go Facebook, nothing's happening. Go back to my day and get the things done I want to get done. Um, I use schedule once. Yeah, great program me to love [inaudible] you use that too? I do. Yeah. It was introduced to me by Andrew Warner of Mixergy who's done thousands of interviews and I as soon as he booked me using that.

Speaker 4:          00:13:38       So I was the one who is speaking. You do that. You make Tim Ferris on that. I don't blame him though. If you said Oh it's so nice and it's, it prevents so much confusion. Do you want to just explain how sure. So good. The reason I like it, they have a $99 a year plan. Make sure you find that one, cause they have all these different options, but you can get in there and get the $99 a year. When I believe, and the nicest thing about it is it's such an annoying thing. So like if me and him wanted to meet, I'd be like, Tim, are you free next Tuesday at four? You would have to come back and say, no, how about Wednesday? And Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. With schedule once it connects automatically to your calendar, when you send it to someone, you could set your preferences.

Speaker 4:          00:14:12       So like I am very specific preferences. Like I don't do meetings on Thursday, I don't do meetings before 10:00 AM. Uh, I don't do meetings during lunchtime. I don't have anything after five. And I only do meetings for 15 minutes because I really, if it's longer than that, like we need to figure out why it's going so long. And then basically I send that to you and say, hey Tim, let's talk for that kind of period. And then it makes it really easy for you to just compare that to your scheduled, choose the time and it auto goes into my calendar and we're done. Yeah. And, and one of the other benefits, uh, that I noticed, number one, the first thing someone will see when they click the link to grab a time is it'll say, set your time zone total in. That avoids all of the confusion. Like, oh, sorry, I thought it was 4:00 PM CST

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       and not PSD. And then you have to book it again. It avoids all of that and it sends reminders to people. Um, I've been using it for instance, if I'm doing, let's just say recording, and I don't typically do this, but if I'm, if I were recording five podcasts in a day or I had some type of batching like that, I would block out an entire day in say one hour increments or two hour increments and then have everybody just pick the time that is remaining and available because it also happens if you're emailing separate people competing for a certain day, let's just say you'll, you'll book one person than the other person will walk at the same time and it's just a huge headache. So this thing saves just dozens of hours of headache. Totally, totally worth it. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:15:34       other ones? Yeah, no, go for it. Uh, other ones, followup.cc. Uh, this is my, one of my secret weapons. Uh, I basically can never forget anything. It's like I call it my Jewish mother and my inbox because my mom never forgets anything. She writes everything down. Um, and so it followups you see does is like if I'm emailing Tim, which you know, we do from time to time, I'll email him and in my bcc I'll put when I want to remind, remember it. So what it does is that I'll put like oneDay@followupcc.cc and in a day it will email me back and say, hey, here's the email that you sent in the reminder about it. So you can do this for, people would be like, hey, I'll check in with you in two months or I'll follow up with, you know, even for things you want to do as a to do, like, let me do this in two months.

Speaker 4:          00:16:13       So let me check this email in a week. You can either afford it or BCC it and it'll automatically remind you. And I've just found that it basically helps me never forget anything because sometimes you just keep it in your inbox. And I personally don't want anything in my inbox if I can and the subs would move out anything or remember anything that I want. So I highly recommend that. Yeah. Automating followups. Super. I was just so nice. I mean, and there's two email tracking tools for open to stuff like that. I just wouldn't follow up. Kind of the lightest weight, easiest for me to use. Other tools that I've been using, a lot of using perch.ceo is totally free. Uh, for everyone who is doing, I know a lot of your people are starting either starting or running their own businesses. Perch provides free, um, people to people like a Webcam.

Speaker 4:          00:16:51       So we have four people that work remote and it's kind of weird cause they were like, what the hell are these guys doing in the office? And we're wondering what they're doing sometimes. And so [inaudible] gives you the chance if you have two iPads or two phones, uh, to see each other. And so it helps for communication. And also just like being a part of a team versus like a random remote person. Very cool. Yeah, I hadn't heard of that one. I really liked that one. Um, I like my fitness, so I'll go to a few on the phone and web. They're, they're kind of mixed. I use my fitness pal.com almost. Well, I use it every day. Um, and I use it because if you really want to lose weight or gain weight, which were, I mean, you know, we can talk about a bit. I've gained 40 pounds in the past four months and now I'm losing 40 pounds in the next five months or six months. The hub,

Speaker 3:          00:17:30       just, just so people understand what's going on here. Oh, how much, how much of this 40 would you say is muscle versus fat? Well, I don't know the exact, I didn't, I probably should have been more. If you had to estimate how much of that is muscle? Probably like half and half maybe. I don't know the exact number. I think it's a bit more, honestly, so just, we'll come back to this guys. But Noah sent me a of himself.

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       I hadn't seen him in about six months and could not recognize the eye. Um, now granted you're hitting a bicep pose in the gym. No, you are. I'm kidding. But it was a shot from the gym and I was just like, what the hell? It was a naked selfie dude. Come on since Tuesday. Naked Selfie Tuesdays. That's kind of our routine. Uh, so we'll come back to that. But what you can talk about, what do you ever use? Myfitnesspal?

Speaker 4:          00:18:12       So I use my fitness pal and I track every single thing I eat and it, and it's not so much that I want to be OCD and obsessive about like, Oh, I have to check everything and I want to count everything. But it gives me, if you really want to accomplish something, and this is a tool that if you want to lose five pounds, it'll say like, eat this amount of calories and this much macros, and in four weeks you'll hit five pounds. And so it's like, well, why wouldn't I do that? And it just makes me more accountable to help me hit the objectives of what I want to hit. And so it's like, am I under my macros and the amounts I wanna be hitting today or not? And it just makes my life so much simpler to be able to figure that out. And over time you kind of even know, you start knowing what your, you know much more about the food that you're actually putting your mouth about. Like how much protein a chicken has versus a steak versus like, um, you know, like a quest bar, which is one of my favorite protein bars.

Speaker 5:          00:18:53       Doug, definitely. And uh, for those people wondering what macros are a, that's just referring to the macro nutrients. So the, the what percentage of the food you're eating calories you're eating are coming from fat, protein or carbohydrates generally. And then when people refer to micronutrients, those would be, say the trace minerals and so on and so forth. Vitamins. There we go. And I'm actually experimenting with some, some somewhat unusual macros right now, which are about 80% fat calories, 15% protein and 5% or less carbohydrates, typically less than 30 grams a day just to optimize for brain function as opposed to body function, which is working pretty well. Uh, what have you noticed about that? Uh, I've noticed that when I hit, and I'm using a device called the precision xtra with x Tra for tracking ketones, uh, at at a very precise level that you would hope since it's called the precision Xtra.

Speaker 5:          00:19:46       Uh, it gives you a readout in millimolar. So instead of peeing on a Keto sticks, these things you can buy at Walgreens or wherever to indicate if you're in Ketosis or not, you can get a concentration. So I'll prick my finger and check in and they'll say, oh, you're at 0.7 millimeters or 1.5 millimeters and four, my optimal mental performance. I've just noticed that I perform best at between say 1.1 and uh, let's just call it 1.7 millimoles. And My, my belief up to this point, because I hadn't had a good tool that was a nice quest Burp, uh, up to this point has been the deeper the Ketosis, the better my brain will perform because the brain likes ketones. But for me that doesn't appear to be the case. So I've been able to get super specific and sort of use my, the food I put in my mouth, like a sniper shot for mental performance, which is awesome. Um, so that's been the primary benefit. And along with that, I've noticed for instance, all of my morning fatigue for say the first half hour of the day is completely gone. I mean 100% gone. I wake up and I'm ready to go, which is has never been the case when I'm carved dependent. So That's interesting.

Speaker 4:          00:20:57       It's funny, I was thinking, I think a lot about, I mean, I think we don't think about how much we, how much sleep affects us and we all know sleep more and it's better. Um, I actually used to work in bed sheets at Macy's. Um, so

Speaker 5:          00:21:09       wait, now you worked in bed sheets, like you were selling bed sheets or you'd wrap yourself up like Casper, Casper the ghost?

Speaker 4:          00:21:15       No, I sold bedsheets. The old woman, uh, on commission. How old were you? How old were you when he did that? That was in high school. All right. And uh, so I learned a lot about like bedding and we also worked in a towels. But one of the things I was gonna suggest is like we're were talking about apps and tools. I think a lot people don't think about their physical tools. So, uh, I've tried to optimize my bed. Um, I think I've done a pretty good job. So the, the company that I use a coming on Amazon now, the one that I just tried actually a week ago that I'm going to be upgraded into is called Tuft and needle. It's a lot like these kind of hipster guys out in Arizona. Really Nice. And they have like the super comfortable mattress. And then I found there's a guy literally like in the Middle Midwest isn't, he looks like your, your uncle. And He created a thing called my pillow. We heard of this.

Speaker 5:          00:21:58       No I haven't. I've heard of Tuft and needle though. That one, that name has come up a couple of times a month friends. So I have to take a look at those guys.

Speaker 4:          00:22:04       Yeah, I can put you in touch with them. I went and slept on it and laid on it like a few days ago. It was great. And then, and I'm going to upgrade to that. They have a, and then I use a pillow called my pillow, which is like try phoned. I don't even know what he does, but it's really good because what I realized is like the more that I'm comfortable in bed, I just feel better. Absolutely. And I wake up feeling pretty, I'm good every morning and I use a company called parachute for the bedding. And so those are the kind of the combination that I've been using. And I'm like, damn, I'm feeling really good when I wake up in the morning from all that stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:22:33       And what, uh, what does the, just to, to come back to two things or a few things. The nightly rituals, what does, what does, what does the last say, two hours of your days typically look like? And when do you go to bed? When do you wake up, et Cetera?

Speaker 4:          00:22:48       The, my night varies a bit more. Um, but what I do at night is I try to put myself to sleep by reading. I noticed I'd try to watch shows or anything like that and then I just get stimulated. So I'll go to bed and I, you know, I won't always have to read a business book, which my brother had always kind of gave me crap about. Like there's other things besides nonfiction. And so I've been reading like Jack reacher books. Like, I don't know if anyone has common, you know, suggestions for books that are fiction that are good. Like the Martian was probably one of the best ones.

Speaker 5:          00:23:14       Is that, that's a graphic novels.

Speaker 4:          00:23:16       Uh, it's, it's movie Tom Cruise is in, which is all surprisingly good last year. Got It. But I'll read, I'll basically just try to read and that helps me go to sleep versus stimulating me. Uh, like I would watch shows like big love, which wasn't that good. Um, or now I'm watching daredevil, but basically I realized like if I wash this off in bed, I don't go to sleep. So now I just do books and said, and I've been doing that for a little while. Um, so like the Martian was an amazing fiction book. It's probably one of the best in the past year or two

Speaker 5:          00:23:40       that the, the whole story of the Martian, I think, what's his name? Andrew wire or weird or something like the whole story of how that was, uh, I guess self published or very, very small to start with and just developed a massive cult following. Then the audio book was a huge, huge blockbuster hit and it's taken off and I think it's now being developed into a movie or maybe the movies or going out and I love that type of story. It's just like 50 shades of grey. Everyone turned it down. Um, and it just became a viral sensation on its own, which then led to it becoming a blockbuster, like the book, go the fuck to sleep. The children's book that was leaked as a pdf among people in the publishing world became this huge buzz item and then became a bestseller. Uh, that's awesome. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. What time do you typically go to bed and when have you found you performed best or how, how do you perform best in terms of going to bed and waking up?

Speaker 4:          00:24:39       What are the two? One thing I do is I don't keep a phone in my room. I think that's a common thing. We wake up and we have a phone right in our room and we just get all stimulated by that. So I keep my phone in a separate room, hallways, um, going to see various, I think when I'm excited, like I remember that Guy Steve Have Lena from like five to 10 years ago. We had really good content. He was very like strict about wake up at this time and don't wake up this time. So I've changed my routines in the past year and it's helped me where one, I sleep in darkness now, so I don't sleep with natural light and I don't really use an alarm. And I noticed I wake up a little later now, but when I wake up, I don't need coffee and I feel more refreshed and that's just what's worked for me. So I wake, I think now I used to waking up at seven 30 and I'd have to go to like do my old man p. I don't know if you know, do you do that at all?

Speaker 5:          00:25:21       Oh, well I am a bit of a water hug, so I usually wake up also in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, which I, yeah, I've had my prostate checked. Um, love the experience just getting up. But no, I, I, you know, I've checked out all that stuff. I just drink too much water. So yeah, I get up and I do the old man p once or twice probably.

Speaker 4:          00:25:42       Yeah. So I just found I slept better, so I moved my bed to darken it and Tucker Max, our mutual friend does that as well. Um, and then when I wake up, I try not to just go get overly stimulated with like my phone and everything already happening. And so my morning routine and then I actually find that the days I'm not having coffee the morning I'm like, oh, I slept better when I've been sitting in darkness that's been happening. Um, and then I tried to stay away from my phone for the first hour of my morning. So it's from the first hour making, ideally the same breakfast every morning. And I generally will rotate that every three months. And so like now my breakfast is, is one cup of egg whites, two eggs, uh, with 2% cheese. And so I'll have that in the morning for breakfast and then I'll read for the next 30 minutes.

Speaker 5:          00:26:19       And you just scramble all that up together?

Speaker 4:          00:26:22       Yeah, I actually did what you recommended one of your early youtube days where microwave it. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. The three minutes low carb breakfast. Yeah it was out. I was like, damn, you can microwave eggs now? Like micro everything. Um, no but I've actually found like, you know, it's relaxing and I liked that I'm eating the same thing so I don't have to think about it. Cause sometimes actually when you have to think about dinner or lunch or breakfast, it's kind of tiring. Yeah. It's like I was telling me to do and you have to process all this extra energy that I don't really want to. And so then I tried to create a routine where it's like breakfast first thing and then it's a reading a book. Whatever I'm interested in at that time.

Speaker 5:          00:26:55       The, I'd love to dig a bit on the books because I know you've read a lot. Uh, and you've mentioned books to me before, like uh, well there, there are many, but uh, I think one of them I found very helpful and I've recommended to my startups, which is a who, and maybe maybe you could explain a or introduced that book and some of the others that you found very helpful, uh, for, for business and just for designing your own style of business.

Speaker 4:          00:27:22       Sure. The one thing I wrote before, I forget, Tim, one thing I've noticed, there's two kinds. There's many attributes, but I always think it's interesting to try to understand like what are the fundamentals of successful people like you and other people that it's like, oh, what are they doing that regular people aren't? And the two things I've noticed is one, I haven't really met any super successful people that don't read.

Speaker 5:          00:27:42       I don't know if you've noticed that. It's very, it's very unusual. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:27:44       I've never met like, oh yeah, I don't really read anything. I don't really do anything. And the second thing is this is one that everyone can do today. And I do it every day. I even do it in hotels, which, and it's not something perverted. Um, I know that's what you got.

Speaker 5:          00:27:57       It's not exclusively something for perverted. Yeah. Let's be clear. They, uh, I make my bed everyday.

Speaker 4:          00:28:02       I don't know if everyone else does that, but I've always noticed is just like a great way to get my wind in the morning. Um, and some other people, I think I've mentioned that, but that's like, I do those things like, you know, I make sure I'm reading every day and I make sure I make my bed. Those are kind of like two wins in the morning that always, I'm like, Nah, it's pretty good day. So do the book.

Speaker 5:          00:28:17       Not to interrupt, but I wanted to actually re enforce that for people because I never made my bed. And then two things happened. Uh, I saw a commencement speech by a war hero, uh, who, you know, just a highly, highly decorated veteran who'd also come back to civilian life and just done incredibly well in the private sector. And he said, you can't always change everything in the world you want to change, but start with making your bed in the morning. And I was like, what? Huh? But it stuck with me. And then I met a monk, I think his name is Dundee punny. I might be messing up the pronunciation. In any case, he said, if you want to have a feeling of sort of calm control over things, and I'm paraphrasing here, start with making your bed in the morning so that when you come back to it, it's not complete chaos and you feel like things are in disarray. And I was like, wow, that sounds kind of silly, but whatever. I'll try it for a week. And it's been just a, it's had a huge psychic impact. That's an incredible psychological Roi. So I do that every morning as well.

Speaker 4:          00:29:22       Yeah, I mean it's funny, I was talking with my team about similar kind of like what are the things that you can do today and you don't need anybody else and you could, you know, make yourself feel better and get better. I would say success. Um, and, and two things that I've noticed is, one, this is kind of a tangential, but it's organized your dollar bills. I don't know if you do that.

Speaker 5:          00:29:38       Uh, I'm not sure. You mean like by denomination?

Speaker 4:          00:29:41       Bye. I do. By nomination, I do it in the same order. So they're all front facing and my wallet. And so I think it's a Susie Orman things she said 10 years ago or so, but I've done it and I just think it's like a respectful thing for your money and it kind of makes you like, okay, money's good. Uh, and the other thing is that with the bed thing and things in my life in general, I don't know who told me this, but it's hard for me to let it go, which is like, just do it now. And so if you see something that's broken or if it's on the floor, if you have a dish, just like, just get it over with. And I try to, I like, for some reason I can't let that go. We're not, there's things like that. It just helps me get that kind of stuff done and it's relieving. Yeah. So I do that. That's done on, do you have mantras like that or anything? Mentally

Speaker 5:          00:30:17       I do. Well, I do, uh, or reminders that are just soundbites that I've picked up over time. One of them that I thought was really profound in a lot of ways was advice I got from this, uh, this mother. I mean, I was, I stayed with a, a, an older couple and their family in Panama at one point and the, they were real power couple, I mean the, the, the wife had done a ton when she was focused on career. Husband was a huge player and had bought and sold some of the biggest companies in central and South America. And they were both really, really, uh, content and accomplished. And those two don't always go together. They're actually pretty rare. And, uh, what she said to me was, you should make sure you always have, uh, an incredible bed and, and at least one incredible pair of shoes because if you're not in one, you're going to be on the other.

Speaker 5:          00:31:11       And I was like, Huh. And so I started, I had always bought kind of the cheapest shoes to get around. And I was like, Eh, it doesn't matter. I kind of, I viewed my shoes like a car almost as, which is how I view cars. I'm like, I don't need a Ferrari or some fancy cars. Just getting me from point a to point B. Like give me the crappiest thing, the cheapest thing that'll, that'll do the job. And I viewed my shoes in the same way and I didn't realize how many physical problems I'd created until I actually invested in, started investing in better shoes. You don't need a lot. I mean, you've got kicked off one pair of, it's like one pair of very good walking shoes and, um, and you know, I tend to prefer these days, uh, not necessarily the five fingers or anything like that because I don't think those are great walking shoes.

Speaker 5:          00:31:54       Uh, it, because the human foot is not designed to walk on concrete or asphalt. Uh, but rather what you would call it, zero drop shoes. So shoes that don't have an elevated heal, but do have some protection for the bottom of the foot. And, uh, you can spend say 20 to 40 bucks on a good pair of Chuck Taylor's or, uh, vans that, and I have a black pair of vans, for instance, that can double as dress shoes. Nobody notices. I had people compliment me on the shoes when I'm at like a business dinner and like, oh, this a great shoes. What? I heard that and I say vans and they just, they're astonished. So that a tip, you know, having I high quality bed and uh, and high quality bedding and then at least one pair of high quality shoes is, it's something that's

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       stuck with me.

Speaker 4:          00:32:41       I think that's so wanted. You know, one thing you were saying, I thought it was cool. It's like when you tell stories, it's so much easier to remember. So when like two weeks I'd be like, yeah, Tim was like in the jungle in Panama with like some guru and they told him about she was in a bed. And it's so much easier for me to remember that versus you just be like, yeah, I have a bed and better shoes.

Speaker 3:          00:32:57       Oh yeah, it won't, it won't stick. Right. And the only reason, the only reason I've remembered that is because the context is unique. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:33:05       But what we remember, it's, it's funny, there's this music artist, and I'll talk about the book, who, but this is music arctic named stitches. I don't know if you've ever heard of him. He's kind of like off the grid. He's Florida based, but the guy is insane. Like he talks about doing drugs. He does it, doesn't talk about it. He does drugs on stage. Like he's got stitches tattooed all over his face. And uh, it's very extreme. And you know, maybe it's a fad. Maybe it's for now, but it makes me think about marketing and business and being remembered. And you kind of made me realize like you don't get remembered in the middle.

Speaker 3:          00:33:34       No, you don't. You don't get remembered in the middle and you need to, that's why I recommend a look. It's not a perfect book, but it is a very helpful book. At least for me, the 22 immutable laws of marketing, the old version, not, don't get the, like for Internet one, that's like AOL era. Uh, get the old one, which is like airlines and imported beer and all of these case studies. Uh, but it really points out that if you want positioning, whether that's for a product for a stay a point you're trying to persuade people to accept or negotiation, you have to, uh, it's not enough just to be better. You have to be different because no one will have a chance to realize you're better if you don't have their attention first. Uh, and uh, since it, just thinking if positioning in that way is basically better as necessary but not sufficient I think is super critical.

Speaker 4:          00:34:32       It's funny though, cause we're were like trained as, as like a, I think humans to follow orders and raise her hands and stay in line. And I always try to encourage people and myself included to break a rule. And so I'm like, you're not every day, but I'm like, okay, can I run this light? Which not obviously I'm trying to run lights and help people, but it's like, all right, well it says do not enter this way, but maybe I should just enter it or you know, one thing I've recommended people is like the coffee challenge. Yeah. I was going to say you're the coffee challenge

Speaker 3:          00:34:58       because when we, uh, when we were filming the Tim Ferriss experiment together, you actually forced our student to go do this, which I thought was fantastic. Uh, and uh, so maybe you could explain that to people because certainly, uh, the, the Jason Bourne style going the wrong way down a one way, uh, is probably not what I would suggest people to do. But, uh, the coffee challenge is something I would suggest everyone do. So maybe you can explain that.

Speaker 4:          00:35:22       Yeah. Um, well, it's funny. I, so I'll tell the story of my brother. Uh, so I told my brother to do the coffee challenge and he's like, I'm a doctor, I'm the man, I could do anything. And uh, so we went to like some random place in Arizona where he lives. And so the coffee challenge is you have to go up to the counter and you order coffee and if you don't drink coffee, water, tea, if you don't drink tea or water, I don't care. And then you just ask for 10% off. And everyone listening, I know you're listening right now. In your ears, you're like, oh, that's stupid. No, it's stupid, Tim. I'm going to pause this podcast, whatever, uh, because it's so easy. I've been doing sales 20 years. And uh, I told my brother to do it and he's like, are you kidding me?

Speaker 4:          00:35:58       I could do it. I'll do it in a minute. So it was on his birthday last year and he goes up to the guy and he pauses cause he's scared and I filmed in the whole thing and I was like, he's like, uh, could, could get up to percent off. And they're like, uh, why? He's like, because, and they, I do believe they ended up giving it to him. And the coffee challenge sounds kind of silly, but the whole point is, you know, to of business and in life and to even, you know, being on, not necessarily the extremes, but you have to ask for things and you have to put yourself out there. And that's the hard part. And for anyone who hasn't done the coffee challenge, once you go do it, you'll learn a ton about yourself. Nothing that you could read in a book or that you can even do just hearing.

Speaker 4:          00:36:35       So next time today you're at a place where you're buying something Astrid, 10% off. Tell him Tim sentia don't do that. No essential, I'll take it. It's fine. Tell him to come to me and see what you learn about yourself because you realize it's harder than it is. But once you get over it, and that we did this for, there are monthly one k product where it's like, hey, go figure out that asking for money and asking for things isn't as hard as it seems. And the now you can start asking for things that you're like, well now I want you to buy something, a minor service or a product that you know, I really believe in versus just, you know, asking for a discount, which is more of a practice.

Speaker 3:          00:37:07       Yeah. And I think there, there are a couple of things that are important to underscore there. The first is a lot of the limitations we feel we have are completely self imposed and a, and if you look at say the coffee challenge or comfort exercise, like one from the four hour work week, which was going into a coffee shop. And I would suggest probably doing these two and two different coffee shops, uh, just go in and lay down on the floor for like five seconds and don't say anything and then just get back up like nothing happened. And, uh, the worst case scenario is so trivial. You know what I mean? It's so true. It's just a little bit of discomfort, but it goes to show you how many rules we follow that may not be serving our best interest. Right? And, and those that, the coffee shop roles are just easy to break.

Speaker 3:          00:37:58       So it's a safe experimental lab. But, uh, you know, when people are like, well, I can do this or I can do that. And I remember asking Matt Mullenweg the lead developer of wordpress, who's now the CEO of Automattic, which is $1 billion plus company. Uh, I asked him a question at one point and I was like, well, is it this or is this, and his, uh, his answer was, that's a false dichotomy. Meaning you're asking me to choose between, between two things that are not mutually exclusive or there are other options, right? Like what is, see, what does the c option, what does the D option? And it's, it's a, there's an expression, and I'm paraphrasing here to quote actually from Thomas Edison who said, you

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       know, when you've examined all the options, just remember Colin you haven't. And it's like, Huh, interesting. And I mean, for, for example, with the Tim Ferriss experiment with the TV show, uh, when the division at Turner went out of business and everything got shut down, everything got shelved. Uh, almost everybody basically said like, that's game over. All right, let's all move on with our lives. We had a good time and that's it. You can't get the TV show out, you can't get the TV show back or anything like that. And it took a year of looking at, you know, what if I did this absurd thing, what if I took this absurd approach? Like how do I craft a deal when it's, even if I were to get the show back for Turner, it's a, it's a rounding error on pocket change for them. They're, they're just, there's not really incentive.

Speaker 5:          00:39:21       So like how do you figure out the deal structuring and so on and eventually found a way to do it. But it took a lot of poking and prodding and kind of rolling out hypothetical. It's like taking a piece of paper. Okay. So I'm just going to freehand write and flow for like 10 minutes and just like, what are the most absurd things I could do to possibly get these things back and not judge, right? You're going to throw out really stupid things. Probably some illegal things, probably some dangerous things. Uh, probably some completely self destructive things. And then you look through it and you're like, okay, now this is interesting. And I heard a quote from, or a story from a comedian, one standup guy and he said, uh, how did he put it? He said, writing well or generating good ideas is like orchestrating a room full of people in a firearm. Urgency. He's like, when if there's a fire, you can't have everyone rush for the exit at once. Um, and then because they'll get blocked in the door, but you have to let each one out at a time and then you can organize it afterwards. You can like group them into whatever you stupid mediocre and good ideas after the fact. And so just doing that type of freehand idea generation, um, for solutions I find to be, to be super helpful. But I know I'm, I know we've bass around a little bit but,

Speaker 4:          00:40:34       but it was just talking about the whole book. But you know what's funny to him? Cause like, uh, I mean obviously, I mean you are a little more known on the Internet and you know, we've done some things that people will be like, well, you're Tim Ferris. Right? And that's actually what I hear a lot. And so it, it's like, well, you're Tim, so it's easier for you. And I don't, I don't think they have, I don't know. I think a lot of people don't have the realization that like everyone has an opportunity.

Speaker 5:          00:40:54       Yeah, I know. It definitely, and I had, I mean, for instance, I had something I was doing online recently and, uh, this guy responded on Twitter and he said, well, it's easy for you. You're Tim Ferriss and you have a blog with a million plus people. And this other guy, um, um, well known blogger Darren, Darren rose or remedy roused r or w s e pro blogger, uh, who's very, very, um, savvy content guy with a huge audience. He said, we all start at the same place, zero readers, you know, and it's a psych rather than, rather than dismissing a, dismissing other people as achieved things that are unattainable, recognize, like they, they started kind of like naked and alone in the world without any skills. Those are, they had to develop that. And, uh, you know, you and I have a lot of the same challenges even still today, I assume. I know we've had some pretty deep conversations about challenges we've had that everybody else has. And it's like, you don't get rid of those problems. You just kind of trade up, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:41:56       that's do preach. I'm like, Ooh, this sermon was good right there. I'm like nodding. I'm like, yeah, tip. I mean one thing, you know, especially cause I, you know, started a few businesses and uh, what I, what I think most people don't realize is that every major company, Facebook, Dell, Microsoft, Google, all of it started with like one dude or two dudes are two women with no customers. Yup. They all started the same size as everyone else. So you know, it start there, get that one customer and build up. And that's how you get to become the size of those companies are, you know, have a large side or whatever it is that each person wants to accomplish.

Speaker 5:          00:42:28       Yeah, absolutely. I mean, Amazon in the early days, I mean, their, their desks were, I think they were just doors from cheap wooden doors from home depot across two file cabinets. Like those were their desks. You know when it was,

Speaker 4:          00:42:42       you know what to think about. Tim especially like with you. So I met you before you're even a first booking on. I always think it's the funniest thing. I email you, I got an email intro to you and I've got an auto responder that's like, Hey, I'm surfing in Costa Rica and I'm like, who the fuck is Tim Ferris? I know an autoresponder surfing in Costa Rica. They will be back in two weeks. I'm like, all right, I don't really want to meet this guy. Um, but I think what separates out a lot of the winners versus losers is that it's not only that you got the book out there, but you've been doing it consistently for 10 years. Same with Zuckerberg at Facebook is that it's easy to be, to get a hit for a week or a month or two months, but do it for you. Zach has made decisions for 10 years. You've done your stuff for 10 years, like as soon what I've been doing for five years, like you know those things like, I mean you don't have soon as now a seven figure business, but I mean $12,000 in myself the first year. Yeah, right. And that it's like, well no, you're making good money now. But it's like, yeah, it starts small and then you've got to keep going. You've got to persist with it.

Speaker 5:          00:43:34       No, definitely. And you have to choose the good teachers. And for me, because I was on my own so much and probably for you books were a lot of those teachers

Speaker 4:          00:43:42       for me. I love how you brought it back. And everyone here, that right there, that's an interviewer. All right, so we're going to do the WHO books. So let me just look. Do you mind if I just rattle them off and then people just go by him,

Speaker 5:          00:43:53       rattle them off and then I might ask you to dig into some.

Speaker 4:          00:43:56       All right, so here are the books. So I went through, I have a, I can give you the list for everyone about every book I've read. I can't like every book and movie I've read. Um, and I'm just gonna give you like the seven inch one, the business related and personal that I think are just super, super helpful. Um, my favorite one in the past year has been a centralism. Yup. Um, and it's basically just the whole book literally is just like say no to everything. That's not important. So I learned that at Facebook. That book was a great reminder of it. And even like with our main product, tsunami.com like we have one goal, which is to hit a certain revenue target. And every decision we do is either does it help towards that or not? And we no to everything else. Um, the WHO book that in, feel free to interrupt me.

Speaker 4:          00:44:36       I'm sure you will. I don't know. Do I? We've, uh, we've known each other long enough. I'll, I'll jump in if need be. Perfect. The whole book is, there's a longer book called topgrading, uh, which I wouldn't read because it's like, it's sick. It's really thick. The Hook is like a condensed version of it. And I learned it at meant where the founder was using it. And so who basically helps you create a framework for thinking about who you want to hire, the questions you want to ask and then how do you filter, find them and then get down to make sure you have the right person. Matt interview was great cause he makes people audition for the jobs and I liked that. But I also use who, which you know, helps you have some really basic questions that you could standardize so that you can compare people who, who has some really solid chapters that lay out exactly the series of questions that you can ask at different points in the process.

Speaker 4:          00:45:24       It's really solid. What I'll do, Tim, is I'll email you after this. I'll email you my, I'm so weird. I write book reports on every book I read. Awesome. And so I'll email you the book report on who. So for the people that, you know, it's funny cause I think if you read it you'll get more out of it cause you'll, you have to keep reading the same message. Most books are one page, but you repeat it enough times, you remember it. Um, and so yeah, I'll, I'll send you the book report afterwards so that people can uh, cool. Get the condensed version. I'll add, I'll add all sorts of goodies in the, in the show notes of my two other, my favorite sales business book of all time, which is one of the underground ones. And I think you might know Amanda Holmes, but it's from her father and it's called the ultimate sales machine.

Speaker 4:          00:46:01       And this book is just like, it's like an underground, I had it on my shelf for six months. It was the one that you kind of skip over. Like I have a books on my shelf now and I skipped over him. I'm like that. I get to that one later. And I finally got it for an airplane and I get on the airplane and I opened the first page and I'm on the introduction and I'm like, all right, rabbit ear, that page, next page, rabbit here, next page, rabbit here. Like the whole book was folded over and I finished it on that airplane ride and it's one of these books that not enough people talk about, but everyone who reads it is always like, oh, I'm really glad I read that one. You must fold your pages like Origami best you guys is because I usually hear dot.

Speaker 4:          00:46:32       I usually hear dog year, but rabbit here I kinda like, yeah, I've actually been trying to carry a pen when I read certain business books because I just find it easier to come back to the specific sections I want to write in my book reports. Um, other things, an old school book that if you're looking to do service type business, million dollar consulting is great for how to raise your prices and how to actually start your own service or consulting based business. I really liked that. Um, right now I'm really thinking a lot more about sales, especially with Zumiez, we're growing that product. Uh, so I read two books recently that were really strong on sales ones, the sales acceleration formula, and that is more around SAS based selling, but it could still be good for, you know, how to find the right as a surface, like a, the the sumo of meetings or the dropboxes of the world. Wow. You've lumped me with Dropbox. Thanks Bro. No problem. Hey man, the tsunami, the googles. Um, so it's basically like how to find like filter through people on Linkedin, how to ask the specific texts or how to ask for a referral. Um, you don't ask for, you don't email someone asking to hire them. You asked, emailed them, asked to refer someone else and that's generally a good way to get to know them and possibly get a referral.

Speaker 3:          00:47:35       Well, it's like raising money. People say if you want, if you want money, ask for advice. If you want advice, ask for money. Oh Man. Actually No. One thing that I think Shane, you know Shane Snow? I do. Yeah. Oh yeah, he's been on your side. If he wrote a, he did a bunch of experimentation with soylent when it first came out and then wrote the first kind of review of two weeks of being on it on my blog, which caused all sorts of viral storms. But uh, yeah, yeah, I do know Shane.

Speaker 4:          00:47:59       I love Shane and everyone should check out his book smart cuts. It's actually, it's a really good book too, but that wasn't even the point. Shane told me one of the great ways you can get a mentor or meet anyone you want to meet is just interview them. So that's something actually for me, there's companies I really respect, like Taco Deli, it's a look, it's my favorite Taco in the world. Um, and then Austin. And so I basically, you know, you reach out to people like, Hey, I just want to promote you to my audience. And even if you have a small audience and what Tim, me and you can actually, I think we're going to possibly later show people how to get their own audience live right up in the show. Oh yeah. Well, I don't, won't be live, it'll be recorded. And you can do it instantly when you listen to it on your phone.

Speaker 4:          00:48:32       And so shame was basically like, yeah, interview people and then there's a chance for you to meet and connect and it's the best way to get ahold of someone versus normally you ask an email and be like, hey, can we just hold something? Um, a few other books that I'm really, I really enjoyed spin selling really shifted my mindset about how you are going to be approaching customers and really thinking about like the formula which is like, you know, situation, problem, implication and then like natural solution or need solution. And it basically helps you really transition people to be like, Hey, what problem do you have? And think about if you're really helping them and say, well, if you're going to need this help, you should probably use our solution. It's a great way. It's the iPhone. So think of yourself as an advocate, which is like, hey, you have, what's your situation? All right, what problem do you have? All right, well how would the, if we can solve it, how would that make your life better? Oh, well, guess what? We actually have that solution for that problem that we just solved for you. That you sound like you was what really important for you.

Speaker 3:          00:49:20       Yeah, no, absolutely. And this applies in more places than people might realize. So for instance, I had someone asked me recently, why do you think people take action when they read your stuff? Like it seems like there's a high conversion rate compared to most books. Like people actually take action. And I was like, well, I'm not sure if that's true, but, uh, I hope it's true. And if it is true, I think it's because in each of my chapters, let's just say in the four hour body, I basically take that spin selling approach of establishing the problem first and combine it with the sort of story arc of like the writer's journey or Joseph Campbell's stuff and tie it into an aerator that people can remember. So it's, uh, the, these types of mental frameworks apply to more contexts and areas than I think people might realize.

Speaker 4:          00:50:07       I mean, it applies to everything. I mean, I don't think people realize that like the two most important things I've, I mean I don't have to most important to very important things or copywriting and selling. And I think those are that in personal finance or three of the probably most undervalued or under recognized things that people should spend more time learning.

Speaker 3:          00:50:20       What have you read that has helped you most with copywriting?

Speaker 4:          00:50:24       Number one thing. And it's completely free as the Gary Halbert letters. Yeah. So my good level and if you know my good buddy, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. We can get, I never like copywriting course and Neville got me into him in his car. His writing is just so fluid. Um, and obviously it's practice, which I always hate because when you hear a cliche things like they like, oh, I know it's practice, but I want tips. And so the Gary Halbert letters, he wrote these things called the Boron letters were to his son while he was in jail. And uh, they're just phenomenal copywriting pieces about how to sell and how to think about things. And we can link to that. Those are totally free and great. Um, there's the other stuff, like Ogilvy on advertising is a really good book.

Speaker 5:          00:51:01       It's so, uh, it's, it's so often recommended but so few people actually read it. It's a really good book.

Speaker 4:          00:51:08       You know what? I did it and I like literally saying this is not a joke for you or your audience. Like I w I in college, I in college, obviously that's a great sentence. In College I was in, I was in English as a second language. What Dude? I'm American. I was born in San Jose, California. My parents speak English, so I'm just try to give you an idea of how bad of a writer I was and maybe still am. Yeah. Are you serious? Yeah. Dude, I was an English as a second language. It was me and a bunch of people who can speak English. You took ESL courses? Yeah. Well I didn't want to be like crash the course or was it, was it recommended? Was a requirement of cal because I wasn't, my English was so low. I wish it was like a joke. I'd be like, oh, well, yeah, I can speaking. It's like, dude, I, I'm from America.

Speaker 5:          00:51:54       You know, that's, it's funny you mentioned that because I remember looking at Toefl, the test of English as a foreign language and people generally don't actually understand the mechanics of their native language very well. But you forget that and you think you're like, oh, I'm a native speaker. Of course I know English. And then you look at the test and they're like, what is the difference between anything in something? And you're like, uh, I would totally fail TOEFL if I had to take TOEFL to get into anything. Uh, absolutely would probably flunk out.

Speaker 4:          00:52:23       Yeah. No, so that's serious. So I'd take your Harvard helped and actually no one thing that's not a book, but really probably changed the game for me writing wise, besides riding a lot, uh, was getting an editor and that's it. Cause I would write something and I'd be like, this sounds great. I can't believe how good it. And then I would show it to Neville or Anton at the [inaudible] team and they'd be like, this is garbage. And I'm like, no, it's good. And then once they would start reading it, um, and give me the feedback, it changed and I'm like, okay, now I'm getting wide. It's not as entertaining or how I can improve things like photos and bold and how it shifts around my sentence, grammar and structure.

Speaker 5:          00:52:54       How would you suggest people implement that for themselves? If they're asking someone to, to proofread something, uh, what do you, what are the instructions that you give

Speaker 4:          00:53:03       on or what type of person are you looking for? Wa working backwards. I'm looking for someone who I like their writing and also I'll tell you what I did last year, which was really helpful. I created an inner circle and it basically, it was people that I really enjoyed their writing and I said, hey, I'm going to create a small group of people. I think there was about five of us and anytime we're putting on an article, let's send it to the group and you can leave comments in the Google doc. Everyone can just leave a comment. So it doesn't change the writing, but it can give you feedback about that type of writing. And it also, when you finally finished article, those people would help promote it, which is a whole nother marketing tactic.

Speaker 5:          00:53:35       So do those people, then you would upload a new doc to Sam shared folder and then just invite those people via email or how do you guys

Speaker 4:          00:53:42       exactly, well, so if you created a Google doc, so I would go to Google docs, create a file, just any file. I would share it with them. So I'd share it with you and then on that file and you can have it be just comment only. And so they would go in and leave a bunch of comments. I would go fix it and be like, wow, that was actually a lot better. And then subsequently my writing even get stronger and I would do it for them when they had their articles.

Speaker 5:          00:54:00       Got It. Got It. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:54:01       Cause like I dunno for you, like I'm, I'm still, you know. Okay. dork.com my personal blog, you know, it's 100,000 subscribers. It gets decent metric. I'm still scared of my writing because it's just like, cause you know, and that's why I like having an editor because I'm like, there's probably tons of grammar that's going to get ripped on and know it represents me and I want to look good. Um, so having the editor and like peers be able to edit my things, especially with like with Google docs, I know a lot of people use like Hemingway or, uh, what does it draft?

Speaker 5:          00:54:26       Yeah. Draft I've used, it's pretty sweet. Um, draft I like, I haven't used Hemingway, like the name despite the guy's a somewhat unfortunate end.

Speaker 4:          00:54:34       But those are two ones for like group editing. I mean, so for writing. Yeah. Those are the stuff. And then the two ones I would say coming back to like selling stuff, um, spin selling. I just mentioned sales acceleration formula we talked about. And then I'd say lastly, there's a book called small giants. Uh, okay.

Speaker 5:          00:54:49       Which are all giants is a great book. Uh, it does, I'll let you describe it. It had a huge impact on me though when I read it. What was the impact of five, seven, eight years ago? Well, I in I assume we're talking about the same book, it's a bull, Berlin, Berlin Willingham. Uh, it just, I think the sub, what is the subtitle? Something like companies that choose to be the best, not the biggest or something like that, but the, uh, the idea that size or growth does not have to be the measure of success if you're an entrepreneur and she's a very conceptually uncommon thing to hear. Uh, and I just loved, that's one of the books that kind of put the finishing touches on convincing me that, you know, selling, trying to find price insensitive people to sell to, uh, is just a complete game changer or making something that is so good and so over delivers it. You can charge a premium price. Um, those, those are a few of the things that I took away from that. What about you?

Speaker 4:          00:55:52       That's very long. I mean, I think a few people that are listening that are not in silicon valley, I don't think they understand like how, I don't know. I don't know exactly. Not as fair, but it's just like everything is about if you're a billion dollar company and if you're going viral and if you're a lot of funding and if you're not here and nobody in you're nothing and everything is pointless. And it was really refreshing to hear these, you know, pretty, you know, substantial companies like a Clif bar or I think there's a beer company in San Francisco, uh, that we're doing great things in big companies, but just doing it in their own way and it's, you know, it's very empowering. Realize like, yeah, you can do your own thing and it can be big and you don't have to compromise on those things. Like my favorite Taco shop here, it's been, they've been around since 1999 and they have five shops. But our common notion is that you have to go viral, not viral, but you have to scale. So 10 shops in 20 shops and they're going at a pace that's comfortable for them. They don't have to be Starbucks, you know, and they're just doing their Taco Deli thing. And that's why I respect him and, and you know, I get, I talk about them so much.

Speaker 5:          00:56:48       Yeah. Uh, it's, it's, it can be a really profound, I think, awakening for people when they start to, when they sit down and really try to assess what, what would add value to their lives and more joy and excitement. And that's, that's very rarely money for the sake of money because the money you, you exchange for an experience or, uh, interacting with certain types of people or any number of things. And there are other ways to get those things besides scaling a company, making a, making a bunch of money that you can trade for those things. I mean, for instance, you mentioned the Taco shop. Uh, you could look at other examples like Jiro from Jiro dreams of Sushi and his like 12 seater, a three star Sushi restaurant in Tokyo. He has no desire to scale that. You know what I mean? In fact, it's kind of antithetical to his entire personality and a mission for sort of perfecting his craft.

Speaker 5:          00:57:48       Right. And you know, one of the examples of from small giants, uh, there was an Auntie to Franco example, but then there was another example which I thought was so awesomely niche and so just fantastic, which was a, and I thought, I'm pretty sure I'm getting the book right. It was a leather pants and a specifically the person who made leather pants for like Sheryl crow and they became a huge, the famous cause she has nice legs and asked, but also the pants were really cool and you know, for, I think Aerosmith and so on. But it one of these examples where they're, uh, they're like this guy I bought a hunting rifle from, he makes 20 rifles a year and they're customized. They're just incredible. And he'd done me a bunch of favors and I wanted one of his guns. But it was also just to say thank you.

Speaker 5:          00:58:29       And they have no desire to scale and how that, how dramatically that improves their quality of life and ability to ability to optimize other facets of their life when you remove that as the sole objective. Anyway, I just, uh, I'm really glad you brought that book up cause I actually have it on my bookshelf literally in my living room positioned in a way that anytime I sit down on my couch I can see it face out right next to a handful of other books like a Zorba, the Greek and the magic of thinking big and a few others have you to read a Richard Simon's book. Oh surely. You must be joking. Mr Feinman there. Have you talked about in the show? I don't think I have, but it's, that is actually another one of the like half dozen books that's up on my shelf. I mean why, why don't you talk about that book for a second? Because it's one of my favorite books of all time.

Speaker 4:          00:59:24       It's one of these books and I have it. So if you ever meet me in person, I'll give you my, I have an extra copy cause it's just that amazing. Um, this is a guy who won the Nobel prize. I believe he helped create the atomic bomb.

Speaker 5:          00:59:34       Yup. Yeah. He worked at Los Alamos, also helped identify the o ring that caused the challenger disaster

Speaker 4:          00:59:41       and just the amount of stuff that he's done, you're like, okay, this guy has got to be weird and he's just so greatly weird. Any talks like a human and just like all of all these extremes. I think the biggest thing that I took away from the book is just this curiosity to life and experiences where he would just start like, oh, well, you know, one day I just thought drinking wasn't fun, so I stopped drinking and he walked out of a bar and never drink again. Or do you want it to pick up? I think was a bongo drums.

Speaker 5:          01:00:02       Yeah, Bongo drums. Uh, he also wanted to learn how to pick up linen, so he would go into bars. Uh, just didn't give a shit what other people thought too, which was amazingly refreshing. Uh, he decided he wanted to learn how to, uh, safe crack to open safes. And so he would prank people in Los almost where they were building the atomic bomb. So he would, you'd take out confidential papers and like put them on the desk of somebody who wanted to freak out. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:00:32       So I, the, the final book and what I love most about it just makes you curious about the world. I was mentioning briefly, like my brother's kid is touching grass for the first time and I just look at grasping that grasp, whatever. And this kid is like touching grass and feeling it and experiencing it and it makes you kind of just appreciate all the things that are going around in life, in the world. I'm like, oh, that's really great. And uh, and I think that book just inspired me with that and that's why, you know, highly recommended.

Speaker 5:          01:00:52       It's a, it's a must read. And also the fact that when he was on his last, you know, on his last legs, towards the end of his life, he was still doing things that he, that challenged his belief systems or his skill. So he learned how to paint very late in his life as a scientist who is super die hard engineer who really felt like the Romance Romanticizing of, uh, say people who would argue that, you know, the scientist, uh, takes the magic out of something like a flower because they deconstruct it in scientific terms. And his argument was that's entirely the opposite. We can appreciate so much more that you can't see and uh, but felt compelled to sort of trade best practices with a friend of his who is a well known painter and, uh, become a white belt again and suck at painting. And I don't know if this was in his book, I think there's a, there's actually a, an interview with Richard Fineman.

Speaker 5:          01:01:52       Uh, I'll, I'll link to this in the show notes@fourhourworkweek.com forward slash podcast. But, um, there's a youtube video then I'll link to call it the pleasure of finding things out. And I think in that might be somewhere else. They talk, he would go to strip clubs to paint as like an old dude. And, uh, just really was, was not affected by public pressure. And that's something I admire so much as in times when I feel defensive, like I have to protect something that I've created or anything like that. Uh, the fact that he was willing to seemingly throw it all away by doing things that would negatively impact his reputation when in the end they never did. Nobody cared because they're too busy thinking about themselves.

Speaker 4:          01:02:39       Exactly. And to add to that team, I think you're, you're running the money. One thing that I started doing as a giver, I'm like, well I know I try to notice like when I'm feeling really good or like what happened that made me feel really good. And I was noticing that reading and like studying and learning like reading findings book made me feel really good. But I noticed as we get older you just like you scheduled day run all the work stuff you're doing. And so on Tuesdays from 10 to 12, I scheduled nothing but learning. So every Tuesday it's on repeat and that's one of the main tactics I put things on repeat on the calendar. So 10 to 12 every Tuesday. And my friend level, uh, got me into learning from youtube videos and I'm like youtube videos. And so I go on youtube videos and I bookmark specific people. So finding the videos are amazing and an Elon Musk's videos are just as phenomenal. And I was like, wow, you can learn from youtube. I never really thought of intentionally going to find things to listen to and watch.

Speaker 5:          01:03:27       What, how did you choose that time? On Tuesday?

Speaker 4:          01:03:31       Uh, Monday I do team meetings and so I would, you know, I kind of almost would be tempted to do it all day, but Monday is kind of like my organization day. Um, I can give you, if you can talk about afterwards, I do a specific thing that really helps me on my Mondays. Uh, so Tuesdays, like the next day that I'm available to start thinking about things because most of your good stuff doesn't come when you're doing it comes when you're thinking. Um, and then I'm starting to incorporate on my Thursdays trying to do like a fun activity like disc golf. So on Thursday afternoons and Thursday mornings tend to 12 I'll try to go out and just be like play disc golf or go for a bike ride or something where I just have time. That's my mind is like a little more free.

Speaker 5:          01:04:05       What uh, do you have your activities clustered by day? Like what do you do? For instance, you said team meetings on Mondays. Is there a certain focus on Tuesdays aside from the studying Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Like do you, do you break things out and categorize them that way?

Speaker 4:          01:04:22       I don't bash, the way I look at my week is on Monday mornings I basically have three categories that matter to me, which is like work, workout in personal, and then I labeled three things for each one and work out. I put four because I work out four days a week. So I have three things for work, for things on workout in, three things for personal. And then I put those in my calendar during the week about when I want to batch those tasks. Like I want to do my work things this time during these days. And then I leave the rest of the calendar open and I think market, I learned that from Mark Andreessen where he's like certain things are gonna be more important to certain days. I'm not going to try to lock it out for something else. And so then I just focused on a three s a commit to doing@theweekandtheneverymondayireviewmycalendarwithmyfriendadamfrommybodytutor.com and so we share what we said we're going to do [inaudible] body

Speaker 5:          01:05:06       tutor.

Speaker 4:          01:05:07       Yeah. Have you heard of my body tutor.com no.

Speaker 5:          01:05:09       Dyi T. U. T. O. R.

Speaker 4:          01:05:12       I mean if we can talk about, I'm having to stay long and talk health and fitness but he basically has helped me get abs and now he's helping me book up to 200 and he's helping me to get big back down too bulky, ripped, bulky and ripped at like one 75 and I've been working with him for about little over four years and he's one of my best friends. What are some of the, I'm sorry, go ahead. Well I was going to say, so that's what I, how I organize my week. We're on Mondays. I email him a review of the previous week using followup.cc because it reminds me, and I think if you don't review what you've done, it's hard to know how you're progressing. And then I come into what I want to do this upcoming week. And so everyone should get an accountability buddy. Um, cause it's so Adam emails me, I'm like, Yo, what, why didn't you do this last week? Or how come every week you're doing the same crappy thing that's not doing anything you should think differently about it. Um, so I think for a side, products are fulltime businesses. I still do it with him and I've been doing this with him for a few years now.

Speaker 3:          01:06:01       Very cool. I want to, I want to, to pick a little bit at some of the tips you have for people who might want to gain muscular size. Uh, I'll, I'll, before I get to that, I want to add a few other resources. So you mentioned my body tutor, which is great. I hadn't heard of it. So that's definitely going to go in the back of my mind on the list. A couple of others that people might like for finding accountability partners would be a coach. Dot me, coach. Dot Emmy. Uh, it used to be lift, uh, the Oh really? Yeah. And I advise those guys so I've, I've had fun running experiments with them. The other is there are two others actually a stick.com as t I C K k.com where you can put money on the line that you can lose if you don't hit certain milestones, which is very incentivizing for people as a consequence.

Speaker 3:          01:06:46       And then a one that is very strictly a money related, which is dietbet.com so if you want to lose weight, uh, you can, you can put together a betting pool basically and, uh, and, and make that work, uh, for gaining muscular size. This is, I, I as you would imagine, get a lot of questions about this, but what were the biggest, uh, if you had to give someone advice, say guy, who is your size before you started bulking up for gaining 40 pounds in 40 funds in six to 12 months. And let's just say most of that should be muscle. What, what would be the advice if they're like, I have never been able to gain weight men, I think I'm doing everything that I could possibly do. What, what are your tips? Well I would start with the foundation so I wouldn't actually even recommend this to most people because it is

Speaker 4:          01:07:36       how'd you go once you hit that goal to come back down cause you get comfortable eating like Nachos and you get comfortable with eating, like drinking beer and you know, obviously some people do clean books, but I did a mix of it. So what I would actually recommend is get a foundation of being able to eat healthy consistently and maintaining or losing your weight. Probably maintaining for at least, I would say six months to a year. I've been doing a consistent diet for two years before I even tried to book. Hmm. So I don't think if you, unless you're ready to be able, unless you have the mental capacity to be able to control it, I wouldn't recommend it because it's very easy to let kind of get lost with it. Uh, and that's why my fitness pal and Adam were so helpful because for two years I was eating very consistently and losing weight and getting the body I wanted.

Speaker 4:          01:08:14       The one thing, it was fascinating, Tim, was until I started doing my fitness pal. Um, I was going to the gym like three or four days a week, but I was thinking tiny and I'm like, what's The f what the F is going on? Uh, and it's because I wasn't eating enough protein and say, fuck frick. I don't know. Like I was on Pat Flynn's podcast and he's just like, he's like, I had to edit half of your interview. And so, you know, the, and I've been watching big love the Mormon TV show. So I'm just like all about it anyways. So basically for a long time I wasn't eating enough protein and that's why I wasn't getting bigger. And so that's what made me a little more curious about it. So number one, I would say try doing, just maintaining or losing for a year so that you're comfortable with it.

Speaker 4:          01:08:55       The big things with gaining weight. So I went from one 60 to 200 and a few months. Uh, so number one, I would say plan your calorie intake, how much you actually need to be having each day. Because otherwise, besides that you're blind. You're just like, well, I should have this many and you really don't know. So if you want to hit a certain way, just work backwards from how many calories you need to be eating every day to get that amount. Um, I'd say the big things for me were one, I had a buddy who was doing it at the same time and that was a game changer because he's doing it and he's gaining weight and I'm like, well fuck, I have to do it too. And it was just much more helpful to have someone supporting me and my, one of my best friends, John Ross was locally and we're both gaining.

Speaker 4:          01:09:30       Uh, secondly, I did use weight gainer, which I don't know if there's debate, I haven't looked at the tons of science, but it does help you gain weight and get the mass that you want. It does go away a little bit cause of creatine involve law, which I'm not going to get into because I don't know it super well. Uh, but that really significantly help me anyway. And, and ultimately you kind of have to look at like, all right, you get tired of eating, you get it to a point of like, I am sick of eating, so what is the cheapest way to get as many calories and as much protein in my body to help you gain this weight? Uh, so in the morning it was like, how can I do protein shakes, a quest, bar, egg, wall heights, eggs, whatever I could take and basically doubling everything I was already currently doing.

Speaker 4:          01:10:07       So whatever you think you're eating, eat double. But basically it at some point where you have to figure out, and what I started doing, it was like, what is the protein ratio is a food and just eating the highest protein to highest like calorie food, uh, to really put on as much weight as possible. Yeah, it's the, the working out isn't the hard part. It's the eating by far. And you plot and you plateau, man. I hit like one 70, plateaued, won 80 plateaued, one 90 plateaued. And you know, it's funny as a, the last night I wanted to hit it by March 1st to 200 pounds. And this is, you know, I hit, why was that like one 97 and a and my girlfriend, I was like, and I was, it was like 12. It was not tall. It was like 10 30. And I'm like, Oh, I'm not going to hit it. And she's like, you need to stop being a bitch and start putting some food in your mouth. And, uh, you know, and I've ate and drank and ate and then at, you know, before midnight I was uh, you know, like Cinderella, I hit my 200. There's one other thing that was really helpful to him that aisle and I think, I don't know what tool you use. I use we things scale.

Speaker 5:          01:11:05       Yeah. With things. Yeah, the automatic um, sort of a, I guess it's Wifi or Bluetooth enabled scale that automatically creates graphs for you. So I

Speaker 3:          01:11:13       use what I do is I have a wee thing scale and I take my, and you can embed your weight chart online. So I embedded it online and I shared it with Adam and he would check in with me every day to be like, you're skinny, you're fat, you're fat, you're doing well, why aren't you getting more weight and so forth. Um, and it's very counter cause most people want to lose weight. And so when you're trying to gain weight, and especially me, I'm like the guy you never want to before I would say I'm the guy you never want to eat with because I'd be like egg whites. Can you separate the cheese particles? Uh, can you put no, but it's like, I'm like, God, do you want any of the food that they're serving you?

Speaker 3:          01:11:50       And so it was a shift in me but having Adam and then I have a Facebook like workout group where I was posting my weight and you know, I think the more people that you have to care about you and that are checking in on you, uh, on a regular basis, the more it was easier for me to help accomplish that. Yeah. The more you get people invested in your progress and that could be a Facebook group that you create or just promising to put Facebook status updates, uh, once a week for instance. And making that commitment publicly is extremely helpful. A couple of points I'd like to underscore. The first is the fact that leaning out first we'll help you bulk faster. There are a bunch of biochemical reasons for this and um, and, and sort of a biochemical but also a neuroscience related reasons just in terms of regulation of Leptin and Ghrelin, Ghrelin and all of these things where if you lean out, even for two to four weeks, doesn't have to be that long.

Speaker 3:          01:12:45       But certainly getting to the point where let's just say hypothetically, you choose the slow carb diet from, for our body. You're already at say 14% body fat. You drop two to 4% in a four to eight weeks, then you will have developed a probably a very good degree of insulin sensitivity. And insulin is an anabolic hormone. That's why bodybuilders sometimes inject insulin, uh, competitive bodybuilders, which I would never recommend because you can kill yourself. What does that do for them? It allows them to store more calories, ingested in muscle tissue, uh, and elsewhere. But it's a very, very, very dangerous thing to do. Uh, and, uh, you, you can mimic that a little bit with say, low doses of Alpha lipoic acid and there are other things that act as insulinoma medics as they would call them. Um, but if you lean out, like if I really, really want to get big for whatever reason I haven't done in the ages because it's just such a slog.

Speaker 3:          01:13:47       I mean, you feel like a Kobe beef cow just being fattened for slaughter. I mean it's really, it's so, it's still laborious. Oh my God. Like I didn't want to eat. You can get to it. Like at first you're like, at first it's hard to do. You're like, oh, I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have egg yolk. Even, I know fat is good and all that stuff. But then you have egg yolks and then it's like six egg yolks and then you're like, fuck eggs. Yeah, well exactly. But you do have your kind of supersize me moment where you're like, amazing. Yeah, baby. And then a week later you're just like, can I stop? Please? I want to tap out please. I'm on the eating on the training. Um, I'd be curious to what your biggest mistakes were that you'd been making from a training perspective.

Speaker 4:          01:14:27       Totally. I mean, the number one thing, the number, number one, number one thing was I wasn't eating enough in the beginning. So even like last year when I wanted to start getting like bigger muscles, uh, I just was eating so little food. I'm like, well, I'm supposed to eat live like egg whites and these things and you know, and I don't like don't try to get bigger. You should, you need to eat more food and you stop being a bitch. And so I started eating the egg yolks and Tucker Max always giving me shit for it too. It's like, dude, you got to stop being a bitch. And I guess that's maybe a common theme. Uh, and so you do that and you realize like bigger dogs need more food. So if you want to be bigger, you need to put more in. Yeah. So that was number one. And then I started just doing heavier sets and less reps.

Speaker 3:          01:15:06       What would a, so what were you doing and what did you change it to?

Speaker 4:          01:15:10       So I, there's actually a few different programs. There's a guy named the online coach and he does a thing called the shoal program. It's like something hypertrophy.

Speaker 3:          01:15:20       I don't know what he stole like s c h o l l s H, u l

Speaker 4:          01:15:24       as he has a program that I was following and I can, I can send that to you afterwards. So I followed his program and a lot of what his arguments like super heavier weights, five sets and then I would focus on core movements. So I break my thing out into four days a week. And so the biggest mistake, cause I was doing super heavy, super high reps with a lighter weights for a long time and now I just wanted to get bigger and bulkier. And it's funny cause when you saw me you're like, Holy Shit, you're huge. And it's like one, I ate a ton more and I and I monitored it and then I lifted a ton of heavier, uh, versus the lighter weights, which in my opinion just kind of give me more of the definition.

Speaker 3:          01:15:58       Yeah. Or just make you more injury prone depending on how you do it. Certainly. I mean there are a lot of folks who do sort of high rep high velocity, which is just asking for all sorts of issues. Um, and now is the the shool program, the online fitness coach, was it a sort of five sets of five reps type of situation with exactly what limits. Okay. So it's very similar. Then there's a, there's a book that's become very popular among engineers, oddly enough in silicon valley called starting strength by Mark Rippetoe. Rippetoe knows his stuff. He's, he's, he has some very pragmatic approaches to this stuff and he actually has a second book and probably more but one that I have really enjoyed, which is, is a lot denser and probably not the right one to read first, but called a pragmatic programming I think it is.

Speaker 3:          01:16:47       And it's all about lots of medium term and long term planning of training and how to cycle it and so on. But I think that's biting off more. Which one should we start with a starting strength? Starting strength. Yeah. Starting starting strength or for for simplicity sake. I think a lot of the protocols that Pavel Tsatsouline, some people say his name Todd Celine, but it's possible who really popularized kettle bells in the United States. Some of his programs are just amazing. So there's, there's one called, uh, if you search easy strength and Pablos fame, a lot will pop up. A very simple, and, um, my, my podcast interview with him went really deep into a bunch of his approaches for strength and endurance and flexibility with Pablo knows his stuff. Um, also a great example of making, finding the minimum effective dose that produces the largest disproportionate output or outcome. Uh, yeah, five sets of five is hard to go wrong with.

Speaker 4:          01:17:46       Yeah. I mean, two of the things that, you know, the two of the things I would say would really help me during that whole process, especially for anyone trying to be in fitness. Um, if you know, it's one, as much as we want, like less input, more output, which I think you've done very well because you figure out like, how do I get maximum thing for, for less. Part of it is consistency, which I'm not gonna spend a ton of timeline cause you don't, you have to go. That's the point. Like in my calendar, if you looked at my calendar today, Tim, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, there's gym in there automatically. I don't even get to choose. It's just there at a certain time and I do it every week. Um, so consistency has been big. And then secondly, this is kind of more of a hack one that it's not really a hack, which is something that really motivates me. Uh, I follow fitness people on Instagram. Uh, yeah, a lot of people use Instagram for all their friends that they, you know, post stupid photos. And I don't really follow any friends. Uh, all I follow, I follow his wrappers and fitness people.

Speaker 3:          01:18:33       What is your Instagram? Uh, Noah Kagan. Got It.

Speaker 4:          01:18:36       But I follow like this online coach Guy, he posts great workout videos. They post things like there's, um, I'll pull up some different people that I recommend, but now he has this great. Um, and what's awesome about it is that they just post all the different workouts, what they eat, motivation. And so during the day when I'm on the toilet or I'm kind of feeling lazy, I go on my Instagram and I see that their bodies are ripped.

Speaker 3:          01:18:56       And what was your recommendation? We're going to come back to looking at ripped bodies while sitting on the toilet.

Speaker 4:          01:19:02       Well the two things I was going to recommend is number one, if you're in, it's dropping out and I'm not sure it's going to on today, but I basically went and upgraded our routers like an asis rt, eight six dine net Dasher, but basically like focus on the things that are the highest levels of the funnel. And I noticed my router is the first thing that my internet comes in that affects all of my work. And so we went in and I don't know, this is like a 200 $300 router. So if you're at home and you're working on your internet matters, like go in and invest in that because that's at the top of the funnel and optimize the things where you get the biggest results downwards.

Speaker 3:          01:19:30       Definitely. So you said two things, what would, what's the other one? I don't know. The router, the router and then Instagram. We'll, we'll, let's, let's come back to Instagram. So looking at rip people, uh, I wanted to, uh, have, I thought I was maybe a Weirdo on my own, but, so I actually do the exact same thing. I'm trying to get better at gymnastics and more bodyweight calisthenic type movements. Ooh. So all, almost all of people I follow on Instagram and I'm just Tim. Tim Ferriss with two r's and two s's on Instagram are, uh, like gymnastic bodies or maybe gymnastics bodies, uh, is incredible. There are a couple of very impressive par core athletes and acrobats, including a friend of mine named Travis brewer who competes on American Ninja Warrior and was actually one of my park or teachers for the Tim Ferriss experiment when I like destroyed my entire body.

Speaker 3:          01:20:22       Uh, but in a really fantastic coach and just incredible, crazy athlete. Um, and I'll do the same thing when I am feeling rushed or inclined to skip training for whatever reason. I will go on Instagram and check those folks out. Very cool. And there's like, do you follow calisthenic kings are, uh, there are a number of them. There's like callous then knows I think is a Greek Greek guy. There are a bunch of them. I mean, there's so many, of course they're are only maybe six to 10. There's a guy, I want to say his name is Trevor Blackwell. I'm also following some Olympic weight lifters or guys who do a Olympic lifts, uh, who are beasts just because that's another thing that I'm kind of focused on at the moment. Uh, but, uh, that's a, that's a much longer story. Uh, let's, let's, let's flip gears a little bit and talk about some of your business rules or guidelines. Uh, and I know you've, you've mentioned before, I think the four one, one a and I was hoping you could elaborate on that and maybe talk about some of your other guidelines or rules that you have.

Speaker 4:          01:21:28       Yemen, uh, so come back to some of the business things that have worked really well. I mean, what I've learned, I'm noticing my brothers, you know, starting his own business. Um, and you know, Neville as I've mentioned earlier, is trying to get certain things organizing. I've realized that like simple rules are actually the easiest way for you to be successful. Uh, and so the four one one is specifically for Appsumo and you could, you know, apply to yourself, but we basically were like, how many deals do we need to do a month to be successful? And then we can just follow that rule. So for Appsumo, it's four one one, which is just like four deals a month, one free deal, one promotion of an internal product every month. And as long as we do that, we're successful and that's for us. But for yourselves listening, how can you create simple rules? Like once a week I have to do a blog post once a week I have to make a sales call and do the one, one, one thing, which every week you do with that one activity. And I've just noticed the more that we have simple rules, it just makes it a lot easier for us to be accomplishing those things and we check in on them. And so it just makes it life a lot easier and a lot more effective and likely that there'll be accomplished.

Speaker 3:          01:22:25       Do you use a Google spreadsheet or project management stuff like a base camp? We're in a sauna or Trello or whatever. How do you actually keep on top of that stuff with your team so that it doesn't just get written down on a piece of paper and lost along the way?

Speaker 4:          01:22:42       So I'll call it, I call it the Susan Sue formula, uh, or the angry Asian mother formula. Anyone who you're talking to. So Susan sue is this five foot, nothing Asian checkers, like one of the most bad chicks you'll ever meet. And so she came and ran sales for us for about a year or two years ago. And what she did, and you know, they do it, we do it on the sales team, is that they check in every morning and every evening. And so Susan's would be like, what are three things you're going to get done today? And if noonday, what three things did you get done? And that was, it's definitely a lot of work. But I've been doing that with like Neville is trying to grow his email list and every morning, um, he's, you know, he's going to be like a sure thing I'm going to do at the end of the night.

Speaker 4:          01:23:18       He checks in with me. He's like, here's what I got done today and here's my progress. And so what we do, what I recommend for most people though is I do a once a week check in with everybody personally. And I find that to be the most helpful. If you want to be Susan Su level, do a daily in the morning and evening. And that's insanely effective because it's like, here's what I'm going to do. Here's what I got done. And you get that stuff moving forward for sure. Um, for me on Appsumo at a higher level, I check in every week. Uh, generally I just check in on person and we have a dashboard that we check in every day.

Speaker 3:          01:23:50       Is the dashboard in Google apps or what does the text, and for that,

Speaker 4:          01:23:55       the dashboard, you're going to be pretty smart. It's literally something we made. It's just one number. So I'll tell you, for tsunami, our goal is to make a million dollar revenue business this year. So that's our goal for the business. And so we have a target of how much money you need to make a month, which is $83,000. And then we know how, so the, that, that website is literally just what is our revenue against that. It's literally one number. And if you ask anybody in our company, like actually I'm kind of curious to ask him, uh, I don't know, walk into the interview, but if I have, I'll ask him my chief chat right now. Uh, what is our team goal for the year? And this is something I learned from Zuckerberg in terms of how to get things organized. I don't try to organize everything.

Speaker 4:          01:24:35       I try to focus on what's my number one goal. And that's what Zuck did, which is the number one goal for him was growth. And I think, I don't know if I mentioned the story to you before, but I went to Zuck trying to get him to make money every telling the story. No, no, I'd love to hear it. I went to and I was like, dude, Facebook needs to be real business one day. Uh, let's make some money. Don't you want to like stay in the business and make a lot of money for so that we can, you know, be a company one day and really profit. And he's like, no, does that help us grow? I'm like, no, no, I won't it this girl, but it'll help us make money and make, you know, make a business. He's like, does it help us grow?

Speaker 4:          01:25:05       You know? And so what he did that I've applied at my businesses and that's all I ever do now, is that I pick one's very specific goal and I check on it and a regular basis. So as an example, let me just break down the sumo me one. Our goal is $1 million a year. I have a spreadsheet that breaks out how much money that is each month. And then we have our dashboard that shows it every day about how we're progressing towards it. And on a every month on the first of the month, I just check how we did against what I projected that we need to be doing to hit our goal. And so everyone is focused around that one goal and nothing else.

Speaker 3:          01:25:37       So I, I love this and this is, this is something that when I'm say interviewing people and trying to obviously pick up lots of things that I can use myself. I mean this is not just for publication. I like talking to people like you. So I can pick up new book, recommendations, tools, approaches, and this is very consistent. Uh, when you look at the very top, top, top performers where for instance, uh, we mentioned teal earlier

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       and, uh, who is not only a billionaire, but he's done it several times over in different ways. I mean, that's very, very hard to do. And he was a famous, uh, it, it, it turns out, and this could be apocryphal, I don't know if it's, if it's totally true, but I think it is that at paypal he gave every person one top objective and it was a measurable objective. And if they came to him for like an office hours type of meeting or pull them aside to ask him a question about like, why don't we do this? Or Hey, I need some help with such and such, he would ask them, how does this contribute to your number one priority x? And like how is it driving the numbers forward? And if it was not related, he wouldn't talk to them about it.

Speaker 4:          01:26:48       That's exactly right. I mean, that's what we do at up soon. I just, uh, for, for the Sumito comm product, I asked our team, I just, clothes aren't team chat. You know, what's our goal for the year? And it will, the guy was joking me to put, you know, 100,000 monthly recurring potatoes. Uh, his nickname is potato. So that's what he calls money. Um, but everyone on the team knows everyone is aligned and for have similar. In the past it was like last year was a billion people seeing sumo me.com and we've got to, we hit a bit like a year before it was $1 million a month in one k.com which we did for those half a million email subscribers. And the point is not that well no it gets everything done. It's just I don't do anything else.

Speaker 5:          01:27:24       And that comes back to the essentialism, a book that you were mentioning earlier, which really kind of drives that point home.

Speaker 4:          01:27:30       Yeah, I mean and obviously you have your high level thing and you break it down. So like I was telling you, I'm struggling right now with, we have two customers, we have small, medium business, self serve and then we have enterprise. And so I have to come back and look at art, which helps us accomplish our goal better. And you know, that's what I have to go and spend time solving to then say, all right, well what will help us go faster and easier to hit that number one goal? And then focus just on that and then kind of keep going through that process. Like right now I get interview requests probably like every two days, every three to hey, come talk to my interview. And I'm like, well, this helped me get to my goal faster than doing another activity and it won't, so I don't do it. And that's specifically like this. And I'm like, yeah, okay, Tim, you know, Tim, a few people have heard of Tim Ferriss and a lot of people will check this out. So it will be significant to worth my time to help me really accomplish my goal. Uh, and everyone on the team is aligned with that.

Speaker 5:          01:28:15       So speaking of goals, I think a lot of people have goals. They're like, you know, yeah. That Noah Guy, he's been talking about building an email list. Yeah, I know he's helping devil, I should really do that. And they have the should do that. And that's as far as it goes, right? Maybe they take a note, maybe they put it into their notes in their iPhone, whatever. And that's where it lives forever and it never gets implemented. So you mentioned earlier that, uh, you would do a demo or basically give people something they can do now to, to pump the ball down if the then down the field a little bit and make some, some progress. And I think you mentioned email subscribers, uh, if I'm right, correct me if I'm wrong, but w what is that exercise?

Speaker 4:          01:28:57       Oh Man. So as soon we.com is free tools to get to grow your website. So how to get a bigger email list, how to get more shares and, and just for people who are listening, I use that on my blog. And it's not because I do love you, but it's not because I love you. Oh, Timothy. Um, so here's what we're going to do. Like, I think one of the things that people love about you and what I respect about you is that you're about getting shit done. Like, you know, for our work is how do I get things done? How do I do less work to get more, even more things done? Uh, and you know, you want to understand the elements of those things and you're very curious and very specific about that. Um, so, you know, I'd love for you to listen to notes, but anybody who does what I had to teach them to do the highest result person, we're going to do a giveaway.

Speaker 4:          01:29:37       I'm going to pay for it where I will fly you to hang out with me and our office and put you up in a room. I'm not around it. Know that sounds a little creepy. Uh, and I will, you know, you can work with us on any project you have for a day. We'll get you Taco Deli for the person who actually takes action because I know for you that's really important to him. And I want, I don't want you to just listen to this interview and not do shit. I want you to listen to the interview, take action, and make your life better. That's what makes this worth it for me. And, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:30:02       just so people have a context here, what is the deadline for doing this?

Speaker 4:          01:30:07       Well, I'm going to give you things that you can do in real time. So I will say a week from when this goes public because you should be able to do those things within that day and right now as you're listening. So I would say if you're weak, that's already long enough. Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:30:20       got it. So I'll just say for guys and obviously a void where prohibited, blah, blah, blah, you can't be mandatory. You need to be over 18 years of age. You can't be a whatever. You could take over the prices, right? Man, blah, blah, blah, blah, Blah and uh, no, no purchase necessary, all that shit. And none at all. There's actually, it's totally free. And what I want to teach people is how to start a business or how to share your message with the world. Instantly if even if you don't have anything cool right now and the, and so the person who does the most, you're going to fly them to Austin and show them a good time and uh, perhaps free cuddles,

Speaker 4:          01:30:52       always cuddle this dude bro. Hugs, Bro. Hugs. Well, so here's, let me just start with like, you know, we did this monthly one k product, uh, when they, when Kate icon to show people how to start a business and you know, 5,000 plus people and I've been able to help a lot. Um, and a lot of people are like, why do I start? And I think the two things I want to say is either if you want to start a business or if you just wanna get your message out there started now so that whenever you want to do in the future, I know Tim, I actually read when I was studying all you your popular interviews to figure out what stuff you're out into. We want to hear. And you would actually said, hey, I wish I had an email as sooner so that as you have books or things you want to promote or get out there, you can have direct communication with your audience. So I want to specifically show how anyone listening right now can get a hundred people on an email list for free so that when they have a message, they can get it out instantly.

Speaker 3:          01:31:36       Yeah, let's go. Let's rock and roll.

Speaker 4:          01:31:38       All right. So whoever gets the most of their email list within the week from when this goes live, I will fly you out and pay for food, pay for hotel, and help you with whatever business stuff you want to be helped with. So, all right. So here's what we're gonna do. You have a phone, you listen to this podcast. Is that how most people listen to the podcast in?

Speaker 3:          01:31:51       I think a lot of people are listening on their phones. Maybe not exclusively, but on whatever device. But let's, let's just say you have a phone handy. Sure. All right. So if you're on your phone,

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       I'm speaking right into the microphone. Come back to your phone or if you're on your computer, come back to the computer and hang out the, all right. So I want you to grab your phone and here's what we're gonna do. The, I want you to get a hundred subscribers and I'll just say it again cause I think it's important. If you want a hundred subscribers, it's so that if you ever want to start a business or if you ever want to promote something or share your message, even start it now so you can do it whenever you're ready. Instead of waiting until later and not doing anything which will pop, it will piss me off. So if you want to get a hundred subscribers, here's what I want you to do. Choose any topic you're interested in, like Tim, let's actually, we'll do it. I'll do it live right now as well. What's a, what's a topic that you're interested in, Tim? Like something recently that you've been thinking about or reading or curious about?

Speaker 5:          01:32:39       Interested in the ketogenic diet, which is like the,

Speaker 4:          01:32:42       Oh, the Kido thing. Yeah. I'm interested in that. I'm, I'm really digging deep in that right now. Okay. So would you want to start a new newsletter?

Speaker 5:          01:32:51       Uh, I am trouble. I probably have my hands full.

Speaker 4:          01:32:54       You're a little busy. All right. Yeah, I will do the Kido topic newsletter. I will get a hundred people right now on it so that I can share that message with other people. And then maybe I can say that Tim likes the Quito died. So choose a topic that you're curious about, interested in. You want to talk about the certain people. Here's what I want you to do. Tim, do you have your phone on you?

Speaker 5:          01:33:10       Uh, I have my phone off because I didn't want it to interfere with what we are doing here.

Speaker 4:          01:33:17       Okay. Attention to me, so that's good. All right, well for whoever's listening, here's what we're going to do. I'm going to take a photo of myself. So take a photo of yourself now. I want you to go to your social networks

Speaker 5:          01:33:27       and I'll, I'll post all this stuff on a, in the blog post to also, which I'll get people in Finland, but continue to,

Speaker 4:          01:33:32       and here's what people are going to say. Well no one Tim have followers or fuck, who cares about followers? Even if you have 100 people, don't worry about that. It doesn't matter if you have 10 a hundred or five, take a photo of yourself. Now I want you to post it on your social sites, Facebook and Google, Facebook and Twitter. So right and don't even, you don't have to sign up for service. No, we don't have an email list. I guess. What's an email list? Provider? Gmail. That's a great way to start your newsletter so that you know I just to give you a context like absolutely as a high seven figure business and 90% plus just come from an email list. So just to give you context about, oh you actually can just be email is kin create large businesses. So posting your social, I'm starting a newsletter and then attach your photo.

Speaker 4:          01:34:15       You're going to see my photo on Noah Kagan and then say email me and then put your email. So I'm going to do mine about Kido cause I'm curious about Quito. Email me Noah or I'll put Quito at, okay. dork.com and this will go to my inbox and now I will get a list of people who will be curious about Kido. So it didn't cost me any money. It took me about two seconds. So if you're on your phone, take a photo of yourself, go to your Twitter, and then I'm going to go to my Facebook and just post it socially and starting a newsletter about Kito Kito at, okay. dork.com and so I just tweeted that and now people are going to start emailing me about Kido. And so that's one tick tactic. So we're going to do with two more, uh, and then you will actually probably have a, if not more people interested in what you want to talk about.

Speaker 4:          01:34:59       So if you want to sell them something or if you just want to put out information. One thing I've noticed him is that one tactic that I do is in my, okay, dork.com newsletter. I have an auto reply. When people join that say, what's one thing I can help you with? And then they tell me their questions and that's actually businesses. People say, Hey, no, I want help with this. And basically you just look for the pattern of what the constant questions people keep asking you and you say, hey, email this. I'm going to create a book about this. It's 10 bucks. You pay me via paypal and I go make it and this is what I've taught 5,000 people in. And they do it and they get businesses. The Problem Tim, is people are like, it can't be that easy because they're looking for some magic bullet or some golden trick or something more complicated, but it's not. It starts with one customer and helping one person. And this is the way you can actually start it while you're listening to the podcasts instead of waiting to eventually start your business. Definitely.

Speaker 5:          01:35:46       No, I stay, I and I've seen, uh, you know, there are people out there like Neil Patel has done some very similar stuff, right? I mean he's, he, he's, he's been like, pay me this and then I will add you to this email list. It's so simple and makes a ton of money. I mean, there are, it doesn't have to be complicated. In fact, if it is really complicated, it probably not the right answer. So you said there were a couple of other things that people should yes.

Speaker 4:          01:36:10       So you posted it, I posted them on Twitter and then posted on your Facebook and have people emailing you to subscribe. That's number one. And they just email you don't need, you don't need any software, you don't need to sign up for MailChimp, which is free, but that's complicated. Just keep it really simple. Secondly, go to your email signature. So Tim, for you on your settings, on your phone. So if you have an iPhone goes, I don't even know what android who uses android. Um, but on iPhone go to settings, male and scroll to the bottom to your signature on your signature to say, reply to me if you want the latest tips on Kido. And so if you already have a mailing list, make sure you update your signature on all your accounts on a regular basis. So unlike my personal one, it says, come eat tacos with me and people click it all the time and then it's like, oh, you should join my newsletter.

Speaker 4:          01:36:56       Basically what I try to recommend people as you're starting businesses is keep it as simple as possible. Don't spend as much money as possible and importantly, leverage the assets you already have available. When most people, Tim don't realize is that they have at least 50 to 200 people minimum on linkedin. That could be potential customers, but they think, oh, I've got to do like a Facebook ad, which is going to cost you money and I want to discourage that. And so I'm trying to say, how do you already have assets? Do you already have a church group? Do you already have a Facebook group? Do you already have, uh, your colleagues that you can use Azure customers to join your newsletter and eventually make a business out of it? Cause you could say, Hey, I'm creating something. You should buy it. And guess what? Now you have access to these people via your newsletter. Is this, is this connecting? Yeah. I can't sell it because I'm talking to myself a little bit. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:37:37       no, no, no. This, this all makes sense. And I want to give a, just a quick text suggestion for people who might be like, oh my God, but I don't have, you know, let's just say your name is, uh, whatever. Bob Jones. So I don't have a Bob jones.com domain. I don't, I can't, I don't know how to create a kito@bobjones.com

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       email address. Uh, a workaround for that, which a lot of people don't. It's so simple and I couldn't believe how useful that says when you figure it out. If your email addresses, let's just say bobJones@gmaildotcomifyoucreatebobjonesplusanythingyourightatgmail.com your email, we'll still get delivered. So you could, you could put, Hey, I'm on Twitter, you can say I'm starting a Kito newsletter. Email me at, uh, Bob Jones plus symbol kido@gmail.com if you want to join people email that. And it allows, it then allows you to search by that email and sort. Uh, and you don't have to set up anything new. You're just using a plus sign and some kind of identifier before the ad symbol. Um, super, super useful. And Expedia, Expedia, you can also do for this is if you're signing up for a new service or anything, a newsletter you can put plus and then some identifier.

Speaker 3:          01:38:53       So it's like if I sign up for, you know, but whatever, super, super, uh, you know, underoos heroes.com and, uh, I'm like, you know, I wonder if these guys are going to spam me and I want to know if they do or if they sell my information or anything like that. I want to be able to automatically send it to trash without giving them my real email address. Right? So bobJones@gmail.com that's valuable information. I don't want to be getting shit from all sorts of people potentially if they leak my information. So I'll, I'll, I'll put Bob Jones plus you know under is@gmail.com and that way I know if my information has been leaked and I can, I can just junk that email address and have it all go to spam for instance. So that exactly that plus approach, it's super helpful.

Speaker 4:          01:39:42       I don't think enough people know that one. The other thing I would add to that as do the plus filter and do that and then in your settings create uh, filters. Do you create this? So I would, I would do for all these people in Gmail is, I don't know these other services and most people use Gmail, but in labs of GML and your settings lab turn on canned responses and enable it. Then what you do is create a filter. So whenever, and you can do this in a search box really easily. So I said Kido at, okay, dork.com or I could do my email address, which is Noah Kagan plus quito@gmail.com which is what Tim was suggesting to you. And so what you do is you searched to at, you know Quito at, okay, dork.com and I've already got Tim, I already got a two people emailing me for the newsletter.

Speaker 3:          01:40:25       That's fantastic.

Speaker 4:          01:40:26       And so what you do here is you click the little down Arrow and you click filter messages like these and you create a filter like this or it now it says, you know, create a filter with this search. And what I would do here is I have a canned response that, look, I know you're going to create any software, so send a canned response and the camera's sponsor would be, when I create that's like, Hey, what are you interested into learning about Kido? And they would just tell me what I should be creating for them and possibly even selling them in the future.

Speaker 3:          01:40:52       Definitely. And, and I want to point out just a couple of things. Well, actually before I do that, are there any other steps or recommendations and then I have just a couple of observations that I think might be helpful for people who might find this intimidating? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:41:08       What I want you to do is if you have a phone, you can do this right now. If you're listening as podcasts, you don't have to go anywhere else, you don't have to pay for anything and you could start your business instantly, which I've never seen anyone do before, but you can do with the technology we have available for free. So number one posted on your social posted on Facebook and Twitter. I put a photo cause it's a little more a parent. Maybe you want to put a little more text and just give them the email address to email you to join on your signature. I wrote this Tim, which I think you'll appreciate. It says for all my signature on my phone it says reply to me with a hell yes if you want the latest Kido News. I like it. I like, and I've actually used it in some of our sales collateral and it works really well because we were like, Oh hell yes.

Speaker 4:          01:41:43       Sure. And so now I'm going to, I do it for sales, but you can put in your signature and now that's done. So in every 50 emails I send every day on average, I now have probably about two to five of them being like, oh yeah, cool. Hell yes. I'm like, what do you tell yessing about? Um, but set up your filter and they get the reply and then now you have the questions to be answering. The last thing I would say that is really cool. It's go to your team. Do you have favorites on your phone? Yeah. Yeah. I'm actually really curious. That's fascinating. Who's on your favorites? Man? My phone is off, so I'm not sure. No. You know who's on your phone? Act like that? Who's are your favorites? No, no, I'm not sure. Honestly, I'd have to look at it. I know I'm not, I don't talk to you that often, but uh, like all my favorites.

Speaker 4:          01:42:21       This is just like my brother and my girlfriend. A few other people. I like my coworkers. Um, go to your favorites cause it's the easiest one not to have to think about and just click on their names and then text them. Hey Man, can I send you information about Kido? It's cool. Died information. What I want to go back to that point that was critical and I thought most people are probably ignores it. Just go to the people that already like you. If they won't even buy from your industry, from you, it's only gonna get harder. It will not be easier. And what I want to do is you, you know, you took your assets, you used it, you had set up some passive things like your signature and texting people that are your favorites. And if they don't know someone, then you ask for a referral. And men, do you know any person that's like a fatty or anyone who's like crazy into health that might be interested in Quito News? And this is just basic, obviously we can get more fancy and complicated, but this is the way that it starts. This is how you get that first customer. That's how you start the Facebook or Google or Amazon or Microsoft.

Speaker 3:          01:43:12       No, I didn't. Then I started interject this one to say to people, a few things. Number one is keep in mind you can always abandoned the project. I think a lot of people were like, wow, but I don't know how to run a newsletter. I don't really want to commit to another part time job. Oh my God. Like what happens if blah, what happens if this, what happens that it's like, look, you can always just send an email to these people would be like, hey, had a huge fire pop up. The kido newsletter's going to have to wait. Sorry guys might have more newsletter and then you're done. You don't have, it's not a major life commitment that you're not going to be that you're not getting married to the newsletter. A and like an Irish Catholic family. I mean it's like you, you have options here and it happened to

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       me, him to happened to me six months ago. I started an events business to show people how to start an events business where I sold tickets and then I made events. And then I was like, I kind of don't want to keep doing events cause I'm trying to run appsumo and sumo me. And so I just refunded the difference to people and it, you know, it's very straight forward all always with integrity and just letting people know their expectations.

Speaker 5:          01:44:09       And just, just to actually add another example. So I've done this many, many times and sometimes things don't work out or you don't like it and you quit. So I tried to make a membership site, a very inexpensive membership site as an experiment ages ago for $10 a month or something like that. And it turned out that I just, at least at the time, didn't like managing it and the technology wasn't great. So the experience wasn't perfect. And I was like, you know, just don't want to do this anymore. It's too much psychic drain. It's not worth the trouble. So I refunded everybody and there were, there were several, several hundred people probably refunded everybody, everything that they'd spent. And just shut the thing down. And uh, you all, you almost always have that option. But there are other things like the podcast, I was like, you know what, I'm not sure if I'm going to like this internally.

Speaker 5:          01:44:54       I'm going to commit to doing six episodes as an experiment and then I'll reassess it and I might ditch it and they'll just be like my mini series of podcasts and it worked out. So I kept on doing it. Um, the, um, so to bring it back to the competition then for those people who are listening, they're like, yes. Hell yes. I want to compete. Uh, guys, you can find the blog post for this episode@fourhourworkweek.com, forward slash podcast all spelled out. And in the comments you have to leave your results and you have to leave your results. Uh, just to make it easier for everyone on my side to manage, you're going to have to put Hashtag Noah at the top of your comment. And if you can't follow that set of instructions, we're not going to look at your comments. So do that. Hashtag Noah at the top of the comment and a what should they include in their comment? Noah?

Speaker 4:          01:45:46       Yes. So two things. There's going to be there. There's definitely people on your audience. Your audience is awesome. Like I've met a lot of people that, and they're all over the world. I'm, they're like, yeah, I love Tim and, and how my life has changed it. So I know that there's already people who are kicking ass and running successful businesses. You're like, well Noah, I already have a successful business. I'm in Australia. It was a great Australian and is that pretty good? That was going to Australian like kangaroo, British accent. Um, so I'm looking more for the people who are taking actions. So if you already have them was take action on really significantly growing that on the seven days. I'm looking for people who have the biggest results either from zero to a hundred or from a thousand to 100,000. And so what I really want to see is what have you done to really grow your mailing list in the next seven days from when you've listened to this?

Speaker 4:          01:46:29       And for the people, just to remind you, if you, if you don't have a mentalist or if you don't have a business or if you have a business, this is the best way to communicate with your customers whenever you want to sell them something. Or even if you just want to share your message with the world, you have direct access to something that, how often do you check your email? I know how often I check mine. Uh, it's, it's a lot, especially coming on the toilet, you know, like oh email, it's toilet time. Uh, that an Instagram. The second thing that I wanted to mention to him. So number one, Hashtag Noah your comment and show me what you've done in this week and we'll full expenses flight anywhere in the world hotel and you get to work with us for a day. The second thing is if you already have an email list, I was talking with Tim about it. We've put together on our side like a free, no upsell, cross sell down. So free course for you guys. So go check it out. If you have an email list already that it's email [inaudible] dot com slash Tim and that's fully free. There's nothing to sell their, I'm sorry. If you want to give you money, you're welcome to, but not with this. Uh, and that will be it's 10 experts that'll show you how to grow your mailing list on more advanced tactics if you already have one.

Speaker 3:          01:47:29       Very cool, and I will put this in the blog post as well, guys, but uh, which we'll have show notes and links and all sorts of other things that we talked about in this episode. But, uh, just to recap, so in the comment, if you're going to do this, Hashtag Noah your results and what you did, quantify it whenever possible, and then I want you to end with the most important lesson that you learned in doing this exercise. Um, so that the comments themselves because become very useful resource for everybody. Um, good stuff. And I'm just want to see people take action and they do and then get results because you can do it from your phone. There's no excuse. Yeah, no, there's no excuse. Uh, so let's, let's do this. No, I am a, I actually, you're, you're making me think of all the things I want to do now and I know you're running a company, but we have to, we're going to go do a flotation.

Speaker 3:          01:48:19       I'm taking my girlfriend first surprise flotation evidence, a flotation tank. I have done flotation tank. Actually. I was introduced or finally pushed to try it by Joe Rogan. Uh, and you're talking about like a deprivation tank basically. Exactly, Yep. Have you done it before? I have done it before. Um, actually is our first date, which I don't recommend, but I've done it many times. First date is a very, that's an intensive kind of creepy silence of the lambs first getting in a box naked in someone's house. It's not the idea. You have flotation tank at your house. No, no. I went in Austin a few years ago. There was not a, there wasn't, there wasn't public ones. So that a private one in some ways, his house. So I was like, I swear this is legit. I'm not just trying to get you naked. I just need to get into Xbox naked and I'm gonna close the door on you and I'll tell you on that experience, I was actually really scared because it was my first time so I had a panic attack.

Speaker 3:          01:49:08       Wow, that's, yes, no good. But subsequently I've gone to like larger ones that are like super clean and legit. And I do it like once a month. My, I, I generally bounce between that and Chinese massages like the reflexology, cause they're only 35 bucks and it's like the secret. What's the secret white people don't know. So I don't want all you guys going to do this now, but reflexology massages or 35 bucks or Chinese massage, there's no happy endings and it's the most affordable, effective massage I've ever found. Yeah. I need to, I need to get all my reflexology action. I use something called a rad roller are Rad. It's like two lacrosse balls melted together to roll out my feet each day. Uh Oh. So these kind of like just nugget sized recommendations I think are really fun. So let, if you wouldn't mind

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       just in a sort of wrap up, I'll ask you a couple of rapid fire questions. You don't have to answer super, super, uh, concisely, but just to the extent possible, we'll, we'll try to do short questions and short answers and we'll do a couple of, hey, could you speak shortly? Not Long, just do it. I'm like, yes, I'll do it. Less words. I use my ESL skills. Uh, when you think of the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind and why? Evan Williams. So for those people that he is the co founder of Twitter, blogger medium, uh, all, all around baller, why, why is that? So, you know, I think it's easy to do a business once and be successful. I think when you can do it multiple times, you're a bad ass. Um, and I don't know, success is very relative to how you define it, but if it's money or if it's whatever it is you want it to be.

Speaker 4:          01:50:40       Um, I think from like a business creation and making society better, Evan is very interesting communication and he didn't, you know, it's pretty big that you did blogger. I think most people do blogger and tap out. You're like, you know, I'm, I'm pretty, it's like you on Musk. He did one thing, you know, he's already sold the company and then he did paypal and then he did another one. It's like him and everyone's just like, holy Moly, you don't just do it once. You do it many times. Um, because easy to hit a home run once, but to do, do it consistently. Just I think the consistency of it and dedication is, was really impressive to me about that. No, I agree. And what's also impressive and really inspiring about that is generally speaking, the guys who have that type of consistency or gals and do it repeatedly, are doing it for reasons other than the money because they already have more money than God and some of these cases.

Speaker 4:          01:51:26       And it's really about the mission. And I think that's partially why some of them like Ev, you know, I've spent time with as, and he's, uh, he comes across as a happy guy. You know what I mean? It's a, and that's not what does surprise you. It's incredibly surprising because the, the, the type a personalities that I usually run into who have made hundreds of millions or billions of dollars are so driven that they have trouble appreciating anything that they have. And I don't feel like that's the case with f. Um, so all the more impressive to me that he's able to maintain that type of perspective. Uh, okay. Do you have any favorite movies or documentaries? Uh, yes. So my fair movie immediately is commando. It's a horrible Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. So easing, oh my God, it's, it's great. I just, I don't know. I was a kid. I watched it over and over on Beta tapes, which you younguns probably don't know about.

Speaker 4:          01:52:17       Um, I love con, uh, two other ones I think are just really well done. It's count of Monte Cristo. I haven't seen that. Oh, it's just such good revenge. If you just want to get revenge, like you have an ex girlfriend or something, you watch this guy and like I need to be like him. Um, and then there's a recent documentary called the jinx. Oh, I haven't seen that. Oh Dude, you're going to blow your mind. What is, which one I don't think everyone wants you to do and no one wants you to do. But this guy blows people's minds with his gun and he gets away with it. Huh? It's a, it's a documentary on Robert Frost, which you probably, you've heard his name or seen his name somewhere, but they just like, they get you and the ending is just insane. Don't, all right. If you ever watch the jinx, go watch the jinx and thank me later. Awesome. I'll throw out another one for people who like documentaries, King of King of Kong,

Speaker 3:          01:53:03       uh, or man on wire. You can look at those two and then, and then choose one to suit your tastes. Uh, what advice would you give to how old are, you know, no, 33, dude, I'm like dead in the Internet zone. I'm like, I'm old. I'm dinosaur. Yeah, you are a dinosaur. What advice would you give to your 25 year old self?

Speaker 4:          01:53:25       Uh, and I say my first five

Speaker 3:          01:53:27       I've been asking, I've been telling people 20 but we're fucking, everybody's a fucking idiot. It's 20. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:53:32       I was going to say condoms morning after pill condoms now. Um, you know, I'd say that the number one thing that I, and here's the thing, I think a lot of these things people can hear and then they just discard. So let me just tell you how to do it. So get a mentor, but you're like, oh, I don't know how to get a mentor. Here's what you should do. Email the person that you respect the most that's done the thing you want to do that you know right now. Like get up, have your phone and text them and email and be like, hey, I think you're the really best person I know in the space. Like can I meet with you on a regular basis? And if they are like a person who's too busy for you, ask them who they'd recommend. Like, who do you learn from locally or Internet lead or wherever that I could just talk to on a regular basis.

Speaker 4:          01:54:07       And I really wish I would have been more active in securing that. And you don't have to go try to get Peter Teal or Tim Ferriss or no king cause we don't want to help you. It's like we want to have like we don't, we're busy doing things that we want to help at scale. It's hard. Exactly. Okay. Thank you. To see that's where we have Tim, I'll use the ugly word, ugly ass word in that capacity. But, and so it's not that I don't want to help people, it's just like I don't have the capacity to help as many people as I'd like. And so when I was 25, I think I would have spent more time finding someone that's done the things I want and helping them and having active, uh, meetings with them to be like, Hey, you've already done where I want to go.

Speaker 4:          01:54:41       Why don't I just learn it from you instead of wasting all the time that I had to do. Um, number two, at 25 hours a week I'd worked for free. So I would go help that person. So email your friend, be like, Yo, can I meet with you? I'll help you with whatever you want. And if they don't, if they're not busy, ask who they'd recommend. Uh, and then third, I really just kind of look at your phone or your Internet browsing or in your home and look at the products or services that I was using at today right now and go work for those companies. Hmm. So yeah, when I was 25 and I did do this and I'm really happy to this, but I was like, I just like Facebook. I'm going to go try to work there. I just love personal finances. I did a personal finance workshop this morning with my team because I just love talking about money. Um, and so I went and worked at mint. So go and try to surround yourself or put yourself in places doing the work that you really want to be doing. Yeah. And he's just way to do that. It's just look at what you're already enjoying. And then go like, think about if you could do that all day.

Speaker 3:          01:55:32       Absolutely. And some other related, uh, bits, I just actually heard this yesterday from someone, uh, older gent actually who's, uh, he's not above asking for

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       mentorship. And um, I usually discourage people from using the word mentor or mentorship because it's just, it screams unpaid fulltime job. So if you're going to pitch, people don't use that wording, but I think the work for free piece is huge. And when he said he got one of the biggest names in Silicon Valley to mentor him effectively, although he didn't call it that because he said it pretty much the same thing, he emailed this guy out of the blue and said, I really respect what you've done with a, B and, c, I've read everything about it. Um, here are things I've done. If you have something that might be sort of credible, if not, that's fine. And then he said, I know you're working on a book. Uh, I would love to ask you some very specific questions for every hour that you spend with me. I will spend four hours proofreading your book or helping you with the book pro Bono. And that's how he got the first meeting. And then the guy agreed to meet with him on an ongoing basis for, uh, more than a year and never took him up on the proofreading offer even though that was sort of the sugar that that made the pill go down. Um, so that, that's a really important point. And Charlie Hoehn has some good writing on this. H O h n on, on working for free. Really? 100%, uh, a book. Oh no, go for it.

Speaker 4:          01:57:01       No, no, no. He's a bookworm assessment. Proof of proof graduate is just epic for younger people starting out or anyone or anyone who's starting over or trying to reinvent themselves. Really. Other thing too, I think you said, which is super trade, I just want to highlight it for everyone listening is don't email people. Be like, Hey, I'll help you with anything. Because I'm like, well, now I have to think about what to do and you're going to be a shitty free labor person. Yeah. Like that's the worst because you're getting like 10, how many animals do you like roughly how many miles you get to do like, Hey, I want to work with you. Can I hang out with you can have coffee with you from people you don't know?

Speaker 5:          01:57:28       Uh, at least a hundred a day. Uh, the Holy Shit to my team. Or B, if they manage to somehow, you know, spam a hundred emails and get one. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:57:37       Exactly. And so, you know, it's interesting to think about like, how do you, how does the person stand out to actually get ahold of him? And so here's how you do it. You won, someone told me this yesterday, I loved it. It was called the swipe. The one thumb rule, which is your email should be able to be one thumbed on the phone. Yeah. Yeah. Which I thought was pretty good. I thought that was a good way of looking at the one thumb rule. The second thing is don't tell Tim, you can study Tim all day. All of your stuff is public. Most of it that you're working on or thinking about ghosts, study Tim. And do the work, then send it to Tim. There's a guy, brian@videofruit.com and Brian does this for a lot of people. Are He emails you? And he's like, Hey, I made this video for you and to this marketing role for you. Hey, I did this document for you here. I just sent it to you. I'm not expecting shit. And then you're like, well damn, this is really good. What else can you do?

Speaker 5:          01:58:20       Yup, Yup.

Speaker 4:          01:58:22       Milling Timberlake who tune, we should just like, can I help you? I'll be a free intern just so they can learn to pick your brain.

Speaker 5:          01:58:26       Yeah. And I don't, uh, I don't reply to any of those and that it, number one, because they don't have the capacity. And I think for a lot of tasks like that that are, and don't make no mistake, that's a task that I have to, I have to do that instead of something else. Um, piece of advice that I got from someone. Um, but I'm blanking on who said this to me, but they said, and it was so I was like, wow, okay. That is great. And it, it's, it, it's, it sort of comes back to your point about doing your homework and they said, if someone hasn't done their homework to determine if something is a fit, I don't have the time to explain to them why it isn't a fit. And I was like, isn't that good? And I like that. And I was like, Oh man, that is a, that is a gem.

Speaker 5:          01:59:13       And uh, so that when I have ended up, uh, doing, uh, for instance, ending up working with Charlie or whatever his number one, they did something of value that was highly specific in indicated they'd done a lot of homework. Uh, that was very helpful and they didn't expect anything in return, but they did such good work that I was like, like you said, I was like, Huh, wow. What else can this guy do a, or you know, maybe maybe someone's like, hey, here's a, you know, uh, uh, this is not an example. Please. I don't need a thousand of these sent to me guys. But like, here's a summary of podcast x. And I thought this would be useful for you to use as a pdf, uh, as my logo all over it. Yeah. Well, but if they're like, hey, if you want me to do a few more of these, like I have some dead time between now and Blah, um, let me know.

Speaker 5:          02:00:00       But if, if I don't hear back from you, no problem. Right. And I think another Pr, another mistake a lot of people make is they buy, and I, and I've been guilty of this in the past, you know, and I look back at some of my behavior when I was just getting started and I cringe because it was in retrospect, I'm like, no, fucking wonder. I didn't get any responses. Uh, if, if you send emails like any of what we've described today and you don't get a response, don't take it personally. And that's easy advice to say. But I would take it one step further. And the way you don't take it personally is assume that the people who don't respond to have excellent reasons for not responding. Right. And I'm like, maybe someone in their family is sick. Maybe they're trying to take care of their kids.

Speaker 5:          02:00:40       I'm in trouble at school, maybe fill in the blank. Just assume they have a good reason for not responding. And um, there's another expression, God, I wish I could remember who told me this, but you know, don't attribute to malice that would, that, that which can be explained by incompetence. But I would modify that and I would say don't, don't attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence and competence or just buisiness. Right? So just because someone doesn't get back to you right away or just because someone sends you a short email and misses something, uh, don't immediately assume that it's because they're trying to fuck with you or because they don't respect you. I see so many people get wound up and they're like, oh my God, so disrespectful. I'm like, oh, so blah. And they shoot themselves in the foot and I've been guilty of that myself. I think that I'm pretty quick to anger and very impatient. So it's taken a lot of effort to try to sand down the rough edges. But, uh, another lap, just one last tip, uh, is, uh, for finding mentors. A great way to do that is to volunteer for local business organizations that host

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       events. That's what I did when I moved to Silicon Valley. So you can volunteer at events where they have local icons or business leaders coming to speak, and you get to interact with those people. And if, if you're volunteering somewhere, by the way, it does not give you license to do a shitty job. And most people think that's true. So you can stand out just by doing twice what you're asked to do as a volunteer. And that's how you get to know people. Like I did, I got to know Jack Canfield to cocreate a chicken soup for the soul. And then many years later introduced me to the guy who became my agent who sold the four hour workweek. Uh, that was pretty cool. Yeah. All right. So to know, next question, uh, what is the purchase that you've made in the last say six months for $100 or less, that has had the greatest impact on your life purchase in the last six months? The episode?

Speaker 4:          02:02:27       I would say one, I purchased it around that time, but it's my nutribullet.

Speaker 3:          02:02:32       I don't know what that is. It's the magic bullets, bigger brother. The magic bullet, which is not a sexual device. It's a blend.

Speaker 4:          02:02:40       I guess it could be in some weird ways, but the nutri bullet is basically like, I like smoothies, I like my protein shakes, I like blending up things. Um, but it's always a pain in the ass to clean. Right? And this you could just blend, drink out and wash out and there's no cleaning. And every time I get this is like the gift I give to most people. I'm like, do, if you don't have any to triple that in your kitchen, like you're missing out. And it's just really effective for like blending anything and getting it up. Like I have a Vitamix, which is like a $500 blender. And I just don't even use it anymore. It's a lot of cleanup for that thing. Yeah. Well yeah, it's like I have to get a cleaning lady to assist me to clean up thing. Uh, and the neutral that you can do, you know, in 20 seconds or less. And it's just been a really effective and it's one of those things that like if you don't have it, I just buy it for people because that's what I know they need.

Speaker 3:          02:03:20       Very cool. Well action packed. I love how many things we were able to cover and uh, yeah, I would love to hear what people think and also the competition people can check out. So go to four hour work week.com forward slash podcast to check that out. Uh, one more thing I'm going to mention for folks is that you and I both were on an episode of the Tim Ferriss experiment and coached someone through launching their business and went through a lot of, of information that we weren't able to couple cover in this episode, like creating call scripts and tons of challenges like the coffee challenge and so on. So that's, I think people would enjoy checking out, but where can people learn more about, you know, uh, find you online, et cetera.

Speaker 4:          02:04:02       Yup. A number one thing for my personal stuff is going to be an, okay, dork.com okay. Dr K. Dot. Com and business related. If you know, for the tools and every, a lot of the main things I was talking about, it's going to be@sumome.com. That's a lot of the businesses that we've been building in recommending for most people.

Speaker 3:          02:04:18       Awesome. Uh, anything, any parting advice or thoughts that you'd like to give to folks?

Speaker 4:          02:04:24       I would, I would two other things, cause I looked at I, and this is kind of a thing, like I think there's a, there's a ratio of how much you invest in something to how much you get out. So if you're sending emails to people like Tim or a customer or anybody you want and you're sending a quick email, you're probably not getting a response because you're not investing that much. So I invested in researching shows and comments to see what is gonna make this the most popular episode ever. And that's what I wanted to be with a number of comments. So make sure you go comment. Uh, even if you don't do the challenge. Well, two other things that a lot of people were asking about. Um, you know, we didn't morning ritual, but you guys asked me what do I listen to while working out?

Speaker 4:          02:04:58       And I want to share some of my favorite rap artists. Yeah, yeah, let's do it. Your audience. So if they want to get, they want to get pumped up. I listened to a lot of like hardcore rap and I get mixed tapes from datpiff.com. How do you spell that? Dat I f F. Dot Com. Hmm. Uh, so I can't, I'll shit send it off soon. I'll send you my Spotify playlist too for my workouts. Um, but the guys I listened to a lot lately, or like Travis Scott and Wally's new album, those two have been going really strong. So if you're going to go work out and go check out a Travis Scott and Wallay, how do you spell Wallay? A w. A. L. E. Y. La. [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:05:34       Do you have any music you listened to that you're embarrassed to admit you listen to?

Speaker 4:          02:05:39       Mostly Emo, which is just going to be like promise ring. It's like kind of crying and crying and stuff. It's like, oh, I'm a little bitch. I'm a little bitch. Um, the, so that's number one. I listened to a promise ring. Um, a lot of their stuff is good. The other thing Tim, would, you guys talked about alcohol and people seem to like alcohol recommendations. So, uh, if you're a Tequila Fan, Casa Amigos is affordable and delicious. Hmm. And it's a George Clooney's Tequila and it's phenomenal. I drink the Rep Rosado. Uh, if you're a little more expensive, which is the best for the price, it's called Klossy has Zul and that's $100 a bottle or 89, and it's a porcelain white bottle. And it's insane. If you'd like to, Kayla, is that what you order when you walk into a bar? You would just, uh, it's normally $20 a shot, so it depends on my mood. I'm like $20 a shot. I have the bottle at home. I could wait. I'll just get a soda water. Uh, and or if a, if you're a whiskey fan about coneys single malt, anything by balconies, it's a number one whiskey in the world and it's a Texas whiskey.

Speaker 1:          02:06:42       Bocconi is B. A? L? C. O. N. Yes. Yes sir. Awesome. All right, well we will have some Tequila and Tacos in Austin said, God, that sounds awesome.
