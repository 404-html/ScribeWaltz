Speaker 2:          00:02:09       I've used 99 designs for years for all sorts of graphic design needs, whether you need a logo, website, book cover, anything else. 99 designs was created to make great designs accessible to everyone and to make the process of getting designs much, much easier. So when I first started out, for instance, testing, prototype covers and getting prototype covers for the four hour body, I want the contest drop. That is one option. This is a great solution. If you're looking for fast affordable design work and the ability to choose from dozens of options risk-free. Let's say you need something late night, quick turnaround while people in other time zones, other countries can also help you solve that problem.

Speaker 2:          00:02:57       And I'll give you one example. When I wanted to create the cover for my audio book, the Tao of Seneca, this was a very important project to me. I decided to use their one to one project service. And with this service you can invite a specific designer to your project, agree on a price, and then work together until you're satisfied and they allow you to iterate. And provide feedback and all of this stuff and I haven't shared it yet, but we also got some incredibly good, really some of the best illustrations I've ever seen from using this one-to-one project service with a handful of different designers and illustrators.

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       Again, that's 99 designs.com forward slash Tim little boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. That is Molly chewing a bully stick, otherwise known as bold, fizzle in the background, but you're not here for that. You were here for what we do every episode that is deconstruct world class performers, whether they are from the worlds of business, sports, entertainment, chess or otherwise, to tease out the habits, routines, philosophies, beliefs, etc. That you can apply to your own life. And this time around we have someone by popular request who is perhaps all of those categories wrapped into one. Adam Robinson. Adam first appeared on this podcast in the becoming the best version of you episode, which was number two 10 so episode number 210 alongside Josh Waitzkin, who is best known for chest Jujitsu investing and Rameet Seti, best known for personal finance and entrepreneurship.

Speaker 2:          00:04:39       So we had this round table, how do you end your year? All sorts of great stuff came up, so I encourage you to listen to that as well. But this is a dedicated episode full of Adams stories and life lessons. He came out to San Francisco to spend time with me. I wanted to learn from him and that is how it came to be. Adam Robinson has made a lifelong study of outflanking and outsmarting the competition. He has a rated chess master who was awarded a lifetime by the United States Chess Federation. And as a teenager he was personally mentored by Bobby Fischer in the 18 months leading up to his winning the world championship. Bobby Fischer is considered by many to be the best chess player who has ever lived. Then in his first career, Adam developed a revolutionary approach to taking standardized tests as one of the two original cofounders of the Princeton Review, his paradigm breaking, or as they say in publishing category killing test prep book, the sat, subtitle, cracking the system is the only test prep book ever do with become a New York Times bestseller.

Speaker 2:          00:05:36       Then after selling his interest in the Princeton Review, Adam turned his attention in the early nineties to the then emerging field of artificial intelligence developing a program. They could analyze texts and provide human like commentary is a Jack of all trades, master of many. He was later invited to join a well known quant fund. Uh, we can get into that another but well known quant fund to develop statistical trading models. And since he's established himself as an independent global macro advisor to the chief investment officers, have a select group of the world's most successful hedge funds and family offices. So in other words, he is brought in to give advice to billionaires and mega billionaires and beyond in his spare time. For instance, he's also become pen pals with Warren Buffet and we dig into lots that he's learned from Warren. This is a wide ranging conversation with a lot of takeaways. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed recording it. So without further ado, please enjoy my conversation with Adam Robinson. Adam. Good. Sarah, welcome back to the show. Thanks for having me, Tim. And we are sitting here and constant Ferris on this comfortable couch in viewing distance of my lovely dog, Molly. And we could start just about anywhere we have a thousand topics we could explore it. And I thought we'd start with an anecdote that made an impression on me and I'd like to explore it a little bit. Could you talk about Warren Buffett and his day planner

Speaker 3:          00:07:03       please? Huh. So, uh, we were having dinner, 10 of us with, uh, with Warren and he held up with the, with great dramatic affect his day planner for the year. And he said, time is the most precious thing I have. He said, I'm going to show you how precious it is. I'm going to show you my day planner. And He, so it's a little two inch by three inch little booklet that you get at any stationery store for the year. And he held it up for all of us and he rift through it and every page was empty and that was his day planner for the year. So, so it's, it's really important to, to warn that his time is his most valuable asset. And what does he do with all that empty space? He reads all day, everyday, all day, every day. Reads, thinks and hunts for his next acquisition. And so that's, that's what he does with his time.

Speaker 2:          00:08:09       Does he think of himself as an investor or an acquirer of businesses at this point in time? How do you think he, he

Speaker 3:          00:08:17       thinks of himself, you know, everyone calls him the world's greatest investor and he's certainly the world's greatest something. But I think he's, he's is actually the world's greatest builder of businesses and acquire of businesses. And so that's what he does. He acquires a business, intends to hold it forever. Let's, let's talk about talking about investing but take us a slightly different tack. We were chatting over Thai food a little bit about a book called, and I'm Mike at titles slightly wrong, but I believe it is a, you can be a stock market genius. It's something along those lines by Joel Greenblatt. Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       And that, that book had in him made an impression on me and had an impact on me when I was pretty young. I think I was a little too young for it. Uh, when I was around 16 or 17 and uh, directly proceeded my first stock purchase f ever, which was Pixar. And uh, when I, when I met Joel many, many, many years later, this is probably just a few years ago, he said that in some respects people should read his books in the, the reverse order of their publication because the stock market genius book really covers a lot of what some people might consider event based investment or, or training. And I was wondering if you had any thoughts you brought up and I said, hey, let's, let's talk about it in the conversation when we're recording. You mentioned, yes you are familiar with, with Joel and then also you brought up Lynch Peter Lynch. And so I'd love to just hear you expand on what you're going to say, but I, I cut you off during dinner cause I wanted to save it for this.

Speaker 3:          00:09:57       Right. So, so Peter Lynch one up on Wall Street and, and uh, and Joel Greenblatt, both brilliant investors, both investing geniuses and, and uh, my, my only concern about about empowering individual investors is that when you invest as an individual, you are entering the, the fiercest Gladys tutorial arena ever invented. And uh, you're competing with highly incentivized participants around the world, uh, who are out for your lunch and going to eat it if you're, if, if you don't have an edge. So I just want to be sure that individual investors, when they choose to do that, realize that it's, again, a gladiatorial pit and a, and you need an edge when you invest.

Speaker 2:          00:10:48       So what is your take on then say a lynch or a Greenblatt in, in that capacity? And I don't know if it was [inaudible] who could have been elsewhere when there's a discussion about the edges, the types of edges you could have and one would be informational advantage. One could be a analytical advantage. Another could be say perhaps a behavioral advantage. And reading a lot about buffet, it seems like at least one of his advantages, behavioral, he's very unemotionally it seems like affected by market movements. Absolutely. Uh, and can divorce himself emotionally from these temporary ups and downs. Um, but, uh, do you have any particular observations related to Peter or Joel is relates to advantages, edges or otherwise?

Speaker 3:          00:11:37       You know, it's, it's so funny and before we go any further, you know, I, cause we, this is so much more intimate than a conversation than we had at the 92nd street y in front of a thousand people. And, uh, this is almost a like park or jumping, um, but a conversational version of that where you leap from topic to topic, not knowing where you're going. Um, so the edge, Warren Buffet, one of my favorite quotes of Warren Buffet is, um, if you're in a poker game for 30 minutes and you don't know who the Patsy is, you're the patsy. And so you need an edge, but you need to know that you have an edge over the market. And in terms of information since, uh, 2000, uh, the, a sec published a regulation FD fair disclosure. So in a sense, everyone has access to the same information at the same time.

Speaker 3:          00:12:30       So information edges are very, very difficult, especially with modern technology and, and, uh, um, uh, other resources. So information edges are tough, behavioral edges are really important. And you said buffet, he's completely unemotional. So yes, when everyone is panicking, uh, is when he gets greedy. In fact, Buffett said a buffet articulated in one sentence, the, uh, the secret to investing. And uh, and that's, uh, he said that we, meaning he and Charlie Munger are fearful when others are greedy and we are greedy only when others are fearful. And so the secret to investing in, in, uh, public securities is knowing when to be afraid. And knowing when to be greedy. So what I'd like to do in this, in this American Ninja Warrior course of conversational park core is maybe, maybe take a step back really far back and did discuss a few of the experiences of your childhood because I was not aware that you had spent, was it two years, two and a half years and a half years, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:13:42       In the hospital. When you were, when you were a kid, could you describe why that was the case? What happened? Sure, sure. Well, it was a Blythedale children's hospital, which was started in, in um, wow, I think in the forties by Eleanor Roosevelt. And uh, it was for children with longterm congenital illnesses and I had a bone disease. And uh, back then, uh, the only way to cure it to was to put you in a bed and wait for the disease to kind of run its course. And so, um, I don't know if you remember Forrest Gump. I did the beginning. He had those leg braces. So between the ages of four and six and a half, I was wearing those leg braces in a bed in the children's hospital. Yeah. So what was, what was your childhood like? Ah, when, where did you grow up? It's, so I grew up, I was born in New York, uh, and then was put in the hospital. And then when I got out we moved to, um, to Chicago, to Evanston, Illinois, which sort of Northwestern is. So if you've seen any of the movies, like Ferris Bueller's day off for home alone was raw, filmed, and within a mile of where I grew up. So that was, that

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       was the where, what would you in debt if you were to paint, because we talked a little bit about in the last episode, Princeton Review. Yeah. And we talked about that chapter of your life in part, but what were some of the formative influences in your life up to say, end of high school influences or events, anything like that. You know, being in the hospital

Speaker 3:          00:15:15       for two and a half years as you're growing up, you, you get divorced from your body in a hospital bed and, and you, you get divorced from the world. The world is something out there that you can't touch and you can't participate in and you, but you observe it and you think about it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:32       And, um,

Speaker 3:          00:15:33       I guess one of the format of influences was, was a meeting Bobby Fischer, um, was my hero.

Speaker 2:          00:15:39       How did you meet Bobby Fischer? And for those people who don't know who Bobby Fischer is, how would you encapsulate? Ah,

Speaker 3:          00:15:45       Fisher is said by some to be the greatest chess player of all time. And I met him right before he won the world championship and knew him right through the world championship. And then sadly afterwards he began to lose his mind, uh, to, to paranoia and died in 2007, uh, sad. Um, but I knew him at the height of his powers right before he won the world championship. And, uh, it's funny. Hi, I met him. He, um, freshman year when I was in high school, uh, somebody beat me in a game of chess in homeroom, beat me in like five most, like I knew how the pieces moved, but that was the extent of my knowledge and this self frustrated me. I thought, okay, I'm going to challenge them a game the next day. And he beat me again. In fact, he beat me every day that week. So I resolved that.

Speaker 3:          00:16:35       Um, I would study this game, uh, and just in order to beat this kid by the end of the year, that was my sole goal. And uh, cause I was really into swimming at the time, you know, something four or five hours a day, six, seven days a week. And chess was really much a sideline for me. But I got into the game and, and I, I decided to go to the library, actually a bookstore and get a chest book. And the only book that they had was a book called my 60 memorable games by Bobby Fischer. And at the time, this was four years before he would win the world championship. So I played over these games every night there's 60 games and I realized, but wait a second, he's played hundreds of games. So I went to the library. This is pre Internet for those of you millennials who don't know what a library is.

Speaker 3:          00:17:24       And uh, and I, I got one, it was the slow version of the Internet. Yeah. This lowers and or the Internet. Yes. When you actually had to look up things yourself. And um, I went through 20 years of back issues of chess magazines, laboriously every chest magazine that I could find in the world and went through page by page. And if I found a fissure game, I would write it down. So I compiled my own notebook of 700 of his games that he had played and I played over these games for two, three years and I knew them by heart. When you say played over, yes. Does that mean you would set up a board or did you do this in your head and you would go move by, move through both players? Exactly. Decisions. Exactly. If you do it on a board, not a board.

Speaker 3:          00:18:08       Yes. Um, some people could do it in their heads. I mean, you'd like Magnus Carlsen World Champ, uh, or Josh Waitzkin, our buddy, uh, they can do it in their head. I had to use a board. And, um, so, so I remember it was, um, my, I was 16 years old with my mother on Easter Sunday and a visiting her in New York and we were walking up sixth avenue towards Central Park, beautiful April Day. And I'm across the street across sixth avenue, right in front of Macy's. I saw Bobby Fischer. So imagine this was my hero. Right. And again, this was a year and a half before he would win the world championship. And again, for those of you don't know that it would be like spotting bigfoot or, I mean he was, or JD Salinger Baga sure. Right. Right. Back in the day. And um, so I said, mom, I, I know I, I said I would spend today with you, but that's, that's Bobby Fisher over the, I'll see you later.

Speaker 3:          00:19:10       So I had to cross traffic. I ran up to him and I, I said that Mr. Fisher, Mr. Fisher in 1962 when you were playing with Shefsky and the US championship, you know, cause I had years of, of questions for him and I knew all his games by heart and he just, and he was, by the way, he was a notorious reckless, he had maybe two friends in the entire world. And uh, and he just looked at me kind of bemused because I knew his games so well and he said, well, I dunno, we're going, I'm going to lunch. You want to join me? And I said, sure. Of course. Like right. And that was the beginning of a friendship that lasted two and a half years. It actually stretched beyond that, but after the world championship. But I, I fell out of touch with them for about a dozen years because he fell off the map, the map where it doesn't yours.

Speaker 3:          00:20:00       So you met him, you, how old were you at the time? He said 16 he was 28. 16 yeah. What was that first? What was that first lunch like if, I mean fantastic. I mean, imagine you're meeting your hero that no one gets to talk to. And here he is, I'm inviting you to lunch. I mean a fantastic, and uh, I wish I realized at the time how, how lucky I was and uh, but I wasn't thinking about that. I was only thinking about him and his chess games and, and uh, I remember talking with him and people don't know. I mean, I think of chess players as um, you know, uh, intellectual nerds and very, uh, I'm not athletic, but he was built like a, an Olympic athlete. He was six, three, um, um, an eight, literally two meals over lunch, like two simultaneous meals, two simultaneous meals.

Speaker 3:          00:20:53       He just demolished. Uh, again, um, uh, and when I say an Olympic athlete, I don't mean like a power lifter. He was, uh, like a, like a, an American football player I just for, but very lean and um, had incredible, uh, energy when we walked down the street. Again, I'm five, eight, he's six, four, he towered over me and walk with these huge strides. I mean you have incredible power, you know, and the amazing thing about Fisher was that, and I don't think this has ever been done in the history before, he was entirely self taught. He learned the game at the age of six and then decided to take on the Russians for whom chess was their national sport. It was proof of their superiority during the height of the Cold War and single handedly beat them at their own game. He had no coaches, no nothing, um, and did it all on his own.

Speaker 3:          00:21:46       And a remarkable, remarkable guy. We all, we, we, I remember debating Motown songs with him. Um, we were at a diner, um, and we had, we had dollars between us, but we had no coins and they just have these little juke boxes at each dining table that you put in a quarter and you have three songs. We had a quarter between us. And so we were debating which three songs we were going to choose. He loved Motown and so did I. So, uh, I can't remember which songs we picked, but I remember doing that with him. How did that first lunch turn into an ongoing relationship? And maybe a better question to be to what happened at in the last half or quarter of that meal that led to a second meeting. You can tackle it either way. I'm just so curious because people have these opportunities, these golden opportunities, right?

Speaker 3:          00:22:44       And then they're not able to capitalize on them or it's a flash in the pan. They have a great single story, but that turned into an ongoing relationship. Why, why? Because I was totally focused on him and that it never occurred to me when I first approached him that he would say, get lost kid. Um, I just had questions and, and he was my hero and it was entirely innocent and, and, and I'd done my homework. I knew his games better than he did. So I remember talking about games and we played hundreds of games of speech chess. And so imagine playing pickup basketball and you're a very good basketball player, but you're playing with, you know, Coby Bryant or more or, or curry, right? I mean, what one of the grades? And, um, and I remember I would play his moves against him because I knew all of his games by heart and then he would correct me.

Speaker 3:          00:23:39       Like he would say, I'd say, Oh, I don't understand why he played that because you said black is better in your book. And he said, I did. I said, yeah you did. And he said, oh, I was wrong. It's better and crushed me. Um, and so it was a, I think it was just because I knew it was games so well I'd done my homework. And, and I think the lesson for, for everyone is, is it if you've done your homework to, to, to be focused on the other person, um, and not your fears and reservations and, and uh, and uh, yeah. So in terms of continuing the relationship focused on them in the sense of being curious about them as opposed to worrying what they're thinking about you. Exactly. Totally focused on them. And, um, it's interesting cause he would then reflect it back on me.

Speaker 3:          00:24:32       So the next year when he was preparing for the Spassky match, am I got to spend two weeks with them Spassky these world championships for the world championship right now you'd think if there was any time that he wanted to be alone, it was like preparing for the oil change it. But I, he invited me to spend two weeks of them at a, at gross singers and of gross singers at the time was a resort in the Catskills. And uh, Muhammad Ali used to train there and uh, so they invited Fisher to train for the Spassky match and I got to spend a week with him, uh, sorry, two weeks with him at a, they're all alone and watched him prepare for the Spassky match, which was really fascinating. So he, he play over games studying and then he would turn to me and say, well, what would you do here?

Speaker 3:          00:25:19       And I said, and when you say play over games, and I apologize because I wouldn't consider myself a chess player, but sure, sure. That means that he's sitting in front of a board by himself. He's sitting over a board by himself. Well with me, I'm sitting next to him, uh, or rather across the table from him and he's got a full chessboard and a book of Spassky his games. It was a red book, like 600 games. And just as I did with Fischer's games, he had a little red book of Spassky these Games and he just played over these over and over. And it was really fascinating and I don't think people realized Fisher conducted the longest con in sports history, a long con. And, and uh, if you're not sure what a long con is, I mean, I know you know Tim but, but uh, for, for listeners along con is a, is a, is a, um, is when a confidence man sets you up and the payoff is years away, not like later that day.

Speaker 3:          00:26:20       And so official when he was growing up, played always pawn to king for his, his first move, and, and, and had a very limited opening repertoire in terms of, in football terms. He had a very limited playbook and he always played the same opening moves and he defied the Russians and defied the world to beat him by essentially, he's giving, here's my playbook, these are my opening moves. Do your best. And so from the age of 12 till the age of 29 when he, right, so this is 17 years, he played exactly the same opening moves. And what was curious for me was that when I was with him about a month before the two, sorry, two months before the match began, I noticed he was playing, studying games outside is opening repertoire. And I, I asked him, I said, Bobby, what are you like, why are sending those games?

Speaker 3:          00:27:18       And he just kind of smiled. Cryptically um, and uh, he said, I dunno, we'll see. And, and sure enough against Spassky. Now mind you, Spassky was supported by the Russian chess machine, right? Dozens of the world's top players were all Russian. Uh, who were supplying Spassky with analysis of all of fishers, old games, but then he played an entirely new opening repertoire. He set them up for 17 years. He said, these are the moves I'm going to play. So imagine it'd be like a, a box or always backed by leading with his right hand and then all of a sudden he's leading with his left and they didn't know what to do. They were totally flummoxed, dread pirate Roberts and the princess bride. Oh, that I'm not lefthanded yeah. Out of those. That's exactly right. The princess bride. I a cane. If we're talking about her yesterday and what, what are some of the other things that you observed about Fisher or learned from Fisher?

Speaker 3:          00:28:21       Does anything come to mind? He was very childlike. Um, very simple. Um, in his analysis of, of the Games, you know, Oliver Wendell Holmes, one of my favorite quotes is he said, I wouldn't give anything for the simplicity on this side of complexity, but I'd give my life for the simplicity on the far side of complexity. And Fisher was the simplicity on the far side of complexity. It was the informed simplicity, not the uninformed yes, like Picasso. You know, it's funny, I always dismissed Picasso is a painter. Not that I'm an art expert. Um, but it's only when you, when you see his paintings as a, as a 16 year old and he's painting like Rembrandt. So when he went over and, and Eh, as an adult and started painting like a child, it was an informed simplicity. It was a choice. Um, and Fisher was like that.

Speaker 3:          00:29:16       In what other ways did the childlike nature manifests itself? Isn't Doozy, ASM? Um, always he was enthusiastic about everything, uh, in the way that he explained things. Like, um, I remember once we were looking at a position on the board and he had, again, he was six [inaudible] four. He was a normous and he, he, he, he, he's trying to teach me a lesson about the position of chess pieces on the board. And he held his hand over a few pieces and he said, if, if your pieces can move outside of your hand, they're too far apart. They're not well coordinated. Like it was a physical, an intuitive, mm. Uh, encapsulation of a very profound principle, um, that, uh, the, the illustrated again physically with his hand, your pieces move outside your hand. Uh, the, the too far apart. They can't coordinate and you're like, do you mean your size? Pancake my little head. Right, exactly. Um, yeah cause he's hand privately is half the board. Um, yeah. So, so, um, so that, that's how genius manifests itself. Uh, as, as, as a child like simplicity.

Speaker 2:          00:30:33       What are other, if there are other essences of genius in your mind because you, you and we talked about this a bit in the first episode and I'm sure we'll touch on this in a few different ways in this conversation, but you have been successful in many different worlds and you've met many people who are geniuses in different domains. So s aside from this,

Speaker 3:          00:30:57       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:30:58       Childlike simplicity that is on the other side of complexity. What are other essences of

Speaker 3:          00:31:04       genius in your mind? I think the American psychologist Maslow said, if your only tool is a hammer, you view every problem is a nail. And I would flip that and say that if you're, the geniuses have very limited tool sets. They have a hammer and they're geniuses in looking for nails, right? That's their genius, right? They have a very limited skill set. Um, but they, they master it and apply it incredibly well. You know, I'm reminded, uh, of the, of the movie karate kid, right? Or is wax on, wax off, um, you know, uh, uh, sand a floor. Right? And then he had that crane kicky move. Yeah. And he won the California State Championship on the base of those three. And I'm goofing here on, on, on, on, on, um, on the karate kid. But, but I think it illustrates a, a, a profound point to, to master a few skills. Well and, and then look for domains when you can apply those skills and stay out of everything else. Warren Buffett does the same thing with [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:32:20       I was going to ask you, and, uh, then, then I want to come back to you, but in the case of say a buffet, what are his wax on wax off, crane kick, etc. What is his, what are his primary, uh, superpowers and how much are they neat versus

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       developed or acquired? Maybe there's a better way to put it. Right. Well, you know, the, one of the great partnerships of all time was, was, uh, Charlie monger and, and, and uh, and Warren Buffet and, um, and, and, and the two of them spend all their time just reading and just looking. And I, and by the way, other great ambassadors like Sam's, I'll do the same thing. They spent all their time on the prowl, the prowl for ideas or prowl for businesses. Are they reading primarily filings? Are they reading far ranging books on different subjects, on everything, on everything? You just don't know where you're going to get your next idea. Not so much filings I'm in. They would look, read those two, of course. Um, but read far and wide because you just don't know where you're going to get your next investment idea. And, um, I think that's one of their superpowers.

Speaker 3:          00:33:34       And, uh, and the other is a longterm focus with the buffet and Munger. So, um, when everyone is panicking say, and in, in, uh, 2007 when the world seems to be imploding, they're eagerly looking for, for values. Um, so they invest for the long haul and they don't get distracted by vicissitudes, economic or, or otherwise. Um, you mentioned, so I'm going to go back to you in the library. Sure. All right. You're going through hundreds of games and taking notes. Yeah. On the Bobby or going through years back, he was a magazines sure. And taking down all the Fisher Games. Yeah, I would imagine. It's all I did. Right. So I'm not, I'm imagining there were not many kids in your class or your school who did this. So the question is, what do you think your core strengths are and what are some of the core strengths you've developed that you didn't have at, at a young age, right, or weaknesses that you have have overcome?

Speaker 3:          00:34:48       Well, I always look for, and we talked about this at the 92nd street y for things that don't make sense. I look for patterns. Um, I look for, for quirks, even in my own mind. Uh, I remember, let's see how old I was, nine years old and I was listening to Ms. Callahan, who is my teacher and I was in love with her and she was using, she, she, she, she was talking about something again, I was just totally in love with her and I don't, I forgot what she was talking about, but she, she's spoken and I realized, she spoke the word of and I realized, Oh, I don't know how to spell that word. Now what was fascinating is, I mean I had learned how to read when I was five and in the hospital. Um, but I was stunned that I didn't know how to spell a two letter word.

Speaker 3:          00:35:40       And so I spent the rest of the day trying to spell the word of, and this is the way it did it. My job is nine years old. I said, okay. I knew the first letter was a vowel. So on a sheet of paper I wrote a e, I, O, u. And then I wrote why cause sometimes wise. And then I wrote all the consonants, right, B, c, d and so on. And I spent the rest of the day going through every possible pattern, like a B, and it's an APP is that of okay, that's not, and then a c and a d. And I went through every single permutation trying to find the word of, and um, I never found it because of his is not a, uh, it's not, it's not phonetic stuff. Another gay phonetic, a tough language that way. Yes. I didn't realize that at the age of nine.

Speaker 3:          00:36:26       Yeah. But I think that was one of my core strengths, uh, looking for patterns and things that don't make sense and being amused by my own mind and failings. And, um, but I, I can I interject for a second? For sure. You can. Why do you, whenever you win, why didn't you ask how to spell it as opposed to going through that exercise? Because I, I wanted to, because the real question was why I couldn't spell it. Not, not what is the answer, what is the answer? And it's such an important thing, you know. Thank you for bringing that up because the questions you ask about the world determine the success you, you, you get in the world. And one of my favorite questions is Tony Robbins. Uh, what would you do if you knew you couldn't fail? And, and so the questions we ask are, are, are key.

Speaker 3:          00:37:17       So I wasn't interested in the answer how to, how to spell the word of, I mean, I, I knew that was trivial. I knew it was a two letter word, but what wasn't trivial is that I couldn't spell it. Why do you think that is? Because that's an odd, that is, it strikes me as very unusual that you would have learned to read, but then four years, three, four years later would have this word that sticks out as something that you couldn't spell away. It was just one. It was one second. I knew it was the way you can forget somebody's, you know, the name of vernacular in a movie or something. Like, I knew it was a momentary glitch, but I was, I was fascinated by it. And, and looking back on it, I was, I'm fascinated that the age of nine, I, I, I was very systematic.

Speaker 3:          00:37:59       I had two columns and spent the rest of the day ignoring Ms. Callahan and the rest of the class since I spent most of my time daydreaming anyway. And she would just let me trying to figure out how to spell the word of very systematically and that, and I thought that was a good use of my time. You mentioned questions and uh, love to ask you because I think they're related. You can, you can place this at any time. We're going to jump around chronologically because that's our core. That's park court. Never know what, what's, what, uh, obstacles coming up next. Yeah. Decision making. What

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       is your decision making process for choosing opportunities or your criteria or how do you think about choosing opportunities or more so than finding when you have a number of different opportunities, a number of different paths you could go down. What is your decision making process or your selection process?

Speaker 3:          00:38:59       The problem is I'm so intellectually curious that I really have to be careful cause it's, it's going down a rabbit hole. Um, I'm going to have to limit the things that I allow myself to be interested in. And, uh, I think I choose the one that's the most fun. And, and, and I guess my life is like par Corp Right. Just jumping in and, and, and, and knowing that Joel, be resourceful than and land on your feet and then be able to jump from there too. So, um, I look also for, for for areas that we touched on this, the ball bearings principle, right. For opportunities with things that people haven't explored before and uh, or they've explored the death and they, they're no longer interested. And so I tried to look for things with, uh, with fresh eyes. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:39:52       And for the ball bearing spokes we could go into it, but we, we spent quite a bit of time on it. And in the first episode of that, I'm so you guys can explore that there.

Speaker 3:          00:39:59       I'd like to talk about post Fisher. Where'd you go to college? I went to Wharton Undergrad and then I got a lot of great Oxford. Hmm. And how did you choose Oxford? And then, then, then we're going to talk about apples. Ah, Oh yes, yes. Apples. I Granny Smith apples. Okay. I chose Oxford. My, I, you know, my, my father died when I was 19 and I was pretty lost and I could have finished Wharton in, in, in two years. Um, um, two and a half years anyway, cause it's, it takes six or seven courses a term. And, uh, cause I, I found everything really interesting. And you were only required to take four, take six or seven. And, um, my father died and I, I didn't know what to do and I, I wanted to get away and I don't speak any foreign language fluently enough to, to go to a country other than like, say England. So I chose Oxford and I thought law would be an interesting way to beguile. Um, a couple of years, two, three years. So, uh, was kind of a default actually. And, and while I was there, I spent most of my time taking dance classes in London. Um, hip hop dancing in London. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I, I only, I was the, not the most conscientious law student at Oxford. Um, but, uh, but anyways, so that's what I did. Yeah. If

Speaker 2:          00:41:31       you don't mind me asking, we don't have to get into it if you don't want, but how did your, how did your dad pass?

Speaker 3:          00:41:35       I, he took his life and he suffered from depression as I did. And, uh, uh, you know, I remember the last thing he said to me before, before he did, so, um, he said, uh, you know, I'll always remember that you did everything on your own. And I didn't realize that he was using past tense then. Right. He said, I'll always remember that you did everything on your own. This was the law. And then two years, two hours later, he was, you know, the police called and said he was dead. And, um, I, um, and he did me a disservice because for, and we'll get to this later in our par core, uh, excursions. But, uh, you know, for, for decades, I th I did do everything on my own and it's only this last year that I realized the importance of the other with a capital t, capital o that magic is, is unleashed in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:42:35       Only when you're, uh, a circuit is, is, is, is opened when you're, when you're connecting with someone else. And that's where the magic and the miracles occur. And, uh, I wish I had known that earlier. Why don't you think you explored that earlier? I wasn't aware of it. You mean the other, yeah, the magic that occurs. Um, cause I was always in my own world, right? I mean, I was an introvert. Um, in high school, I didn't discover this till later. There were people that had never seen me speak. People that were around me every day for four years had never seen me speak. And, um, and then, and yet I was so animated with Fisher, right. And running up to him. Um, so I lived in my own world and, um, and I, the world of ideas. So I'm an aware of other people and of course we all are. Um, um, but I was an introvert to, to an other worldly extreme. And, um, and then only this year have I realized and been excited, really excited. I'm um, by engaging other people and you know, and we should revisit those three rules of success that we talked about it at the 92nd street y um, cause they're all about other people.

Speaker 2:          00:43:58       We can talk about them now if you'd like or we can come back to it. Um, do you have a preference? Nope. Nope. You're the, uh, I'm the, I'm the conductor here. Yes. You're the ringmaster. All right, we're going to come, we'll come back to that after the, the tragedy with your father involving your father, you head to Oxford, you're taking dance lessons extensible. You're there for law. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, this is, this is the left turn yet again, but how do we talked about this a bit last night and night. I just remember saying what, so how

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       do, how do apples enter the scene? Oh yeah. You mean my, my nutritional odyssey. You Nutritional Odyssey. And why, why did it, why did it become what it was? Yeah. So, so I arrive at Oxford and, and I had prepaid for room and board and, um, you know, it's a cliche to say, again, this is back then. Actually the food you can get in England now is fantastic. Um, but back then when I was a student, it was a cliche to say English food was, was awful. Um, but then English institutional food was, it was inedible. And I, and I couldn't afford, I could only afford to eat a one meal a day and a out I, you know, pay in a restaurant and a cause I'd already paid for room and board and I refuse to eat the food. So I used to go to this, uh, the only restaurant that I could afford in Oxford was a vegetarian restaurant.

Speaker 3:          00:45:28       And I started eating vegetarian food. And I, and I realized as the days went on that, that there were three food groups. Um, there were foods that made me feel really good. Um, foods that were neutral and foods that made me feel bad, and the foods that made me feel good. The Granny Smith, apples, carrots, raisins. Oh, I remember what the fourth word, cabbage, cabbage, cabbage. And um, the, the neutral foods were vegetables, green vegetables, red vegetables, um, but not white, like rice or corn. Anything, any grains were negatives. Uh, meet was a, became a negative. Uh, and dairy products were negative. And, uh, so my whole life I'd been training for five hours a day, swimming, plus weight lifting. And then at Oxford I do nothing except eat granny Smith apples basically. Um, how did the negative effect you? Oh, Oh, if I had, oh, I love, for example, milk with my coffee, and if I had so much as a teaspoon of milk in my coffee, I'd get a sore throat.

Speaker 3:          00:46:42       I'd get instantly congested. Um, I'd get tired. Um, and so I just weeded all those things out so that by the end of the year, I was basically a fruitarian. I think Steven jobs for a while was a fruitarian. And, uh, and so as I, and I was a board to be around cause people would say let's go out for lunch and I'd, I'd, I'd have like a salad or fruit cop. The Mr had special please. Yeah. It's exactly the Mister Ed special. And so I come back and I had lost 20 pounds and it puts it in perspective for people. I mean you are not Bobby Fischer. Right? So at the time before you lost the 20 pounds, what was, what was, what were your dimensions like? I was a one 35 pretty solid muscle. Um, cause I've been an athlete my whole life and I'm at five, eight said if I ever yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       So then you, you lost 20 pounds. Yeah. Yeah. And, but I wasn't aware that I was that skinny. Um, cause your, I guess your body get mid shifts with it, but I just wasn't hungry. Like a meal for the for the day might be a pound of apples or two pounds of apples, maybe some carrots really Mister Ed. Right. And then I just wasn't hungry and some days I would need it all. And, uh, anyway, so I come back, uh, uh, to, uh, to New York where I was living at the time. Uh, my mother was living and, um, I go to my brother's health club cause I decide I should get back in shape. I hadn't trained for a year. Right. And imagine you Tim Ferriss, not training for a year. Right. And, um, so I, I, I remember the first machine I sat on was this Nautilus, a shoulder press.

Speaker 3:          00:48:18       And I, I set it for five plates, like 50 pounds. And because I didn't want to Overdo it and my arms shot up, they were weightless. And then, and then I asked my brother, who was standing next to me, I said, man, you just blow it a couple of plates and then make a 70 also shut up. And I said, okay, Matthew loaded a couple more cars. I need a little weight that's too light. So he does so and, and then I, I, I pressed like 20 times and said, yeah, that's about right. And, um, he comes around to the front of the, of the machine and he said, okay, I'm not going to do anything. I just wanted to come back around to the cause, the plates, the setting, we're behind you right where I said it. And he'd set it on the very lowest setting.

Speaker 3:          00:48:57       Um, like the full stack, like the football players. Right. Um, and every machine was like that. I could max out on all the machines easily, um, with no effort. So odd. It's so odd because I had, you know, lost all this weight, hadn't, hadn't trained for, for over a year. And even at that when I was at it's peak condition, I wasn't able to do that prior to the dietary odyssey that I went on. And, um, had to explain that to yourself. Well, I, I actually then started doing research, like I discovered for example, that primitive man ate only fruit. They've done, they, they did a molar studies. They have, um, they found of skeletons and things and um, primitive man that if you ate to vegetables, there were fibers, scratches on the, on the molars. And there were none. So they concluded that primitive man had basically eaten mostly fruit. Um, and uh, so I don't know. I think that was just, you know what, now that I think about it, Tim, it's exactly what you do. Um, you endlessly experiment to find the optimal combination of whatever to Max out your performance on whatever dimension. And that's what I did unwittingly. And, uh, you know, I weeded out the foods that made me feel bad and focused on the foods that made me feel good. And that's what I did. So

Speaker 2:          00:50:31       I was at, I was a Tim Ferriss acolyte there before you were around. Have you, and I'm guessing you probably not replicated the, the, the Granny Smith experiment I'm very curious at, and I'm not recommending folks by the way, that you go out and do the, the apple only diet. But we were joking last night about how there are at least two foods that I've experienced during certain training periods. It seemed to have an odd performance enhancing effect. That one. So this is a long story, guys. I'm not going to get into this too much, but for whatever reason, tart apples. Yeah. And lentils for me also, uh, which, which many people don't respond well to, but, uh, very, very odd

Speaker 3:          00:51:15       and well, you know, it's not an an an, you know, and again, neither of us is advocating, you know, that you start consuming granny Smith apples, um, exclusively, but certainly you should pay attention to your body's responses to any food. And, and again, I, I had a taxonomy of three food groups. Those that made me feel good, those that were neutral and those best avoided and, and, uh, and all of us should do that. Um, not just with our foods, with everything in our lives. Right. Um, um, optimize our functioning and that's what you're all about

Speaker 2:          00:51:50       it, it isn't a lot of ways. Now these days though, you do consume your coffee with milk. Sure. So then I think this is how the io came, powder came up. So have you, have you, did you gradually reintroduce these foods, including negatives that you wanted to include or, sure.

Speaker 3:          00:52:06       I mean the, I was a board a be with, because people would invite me out to a Japanese restaurant and I'd say, oh, I really can't eat anything on the menu. Do you have apples to apples? Uh, um, and, uh, so, so it, it took me a couple of years actually to get back to normal eating. And so right now I eat healthily. Um, but I eat some negatives. So, you know, I, I try to limit dairy products, but, uh, but I love, I love milk in my coffee, so what the hell, you know? Um, I know it's not optimal for my body, but, but I enjoy it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:47       Was it, it was maybe Elizabeth Taylor, I want to say. He said,

Speaker 3:          00:52:51       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:52:52       something along the lines of the problem with people who don't have vices is that you can be pretty sure they very annoying virtues. Y'All need a few vices here and there. Let's, let's go back to the three rules for success.

Speaker 3:          00:53:07       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:53:08       can you, I'll let you take it from here. The mic is yours.

Speaker 3:          00:53:11       Well, you know, and uh, just by way of, of, uh, of, of background, it began when you asked me how you, you mark the end of a year. And I said, I, I reflect on the lessons I learned the the past year and I make a conscious effort to apply them in the coming new year. Cause you asked me this, what a month ago, right? And it's right, right back in December. And, uh, and so I thought you asked me what did I learn in, in 2016? And I said, I learned three things and, and I, I learned the importance of fun, enthusiasm, and delight in everything you do. Absolutely everything. Um, and first and foremost, um, fun, enthusiasm and delight. And we'll come back to that. The second is connecting with everyone you encounter on however fleeting a basis. And you've been with me and you see, I do that Uber drivers, uh, maitre ds, everybody, you name it, I, right.

Speaker 3:          00:54:17       I'm, I put that into action. You really connect with the person, um, in however fleeting that connection is, but you, you make an effort to make a connection. Um, and, uh, and the third is to lean into each moment and each encounter and everyone you meet expecting magic or miracles. And, and those were the three things I learned. And the interesting thing about all of them is that none of them have anything to do with me. It's all about the other person, right? And when I say fun, delight and enthusiasm, it's to create fun, to lighten and enthusiasm for the other person. Um, and that, that goes for if you're going to a meeting, um, and you want us with a venture capitalist because you're looking for funding for your startup, or you're going on a date, uh, or you're, you're, you're, you're going on a job interview.

Speaker 3:          00:55:15       Forget the fact that it's an interview. You're going to delight the other person. That's what you're there for first and foremost, and to make connection. And if you do, if that's your focus as opposed to getting the job or getting the funding, then you get magic and miracles. But that should be your primary focus. And, uh, and what it does is it, it gives you infinite power because you want nothing. And you're offering everything all I want. I mean, that's what I, in this moment now with you sitting as sitting in front of you on your couch, um, is to, is to connect with you and to delight you. So it's, I'm playing a game I can't lose and I'm in total control and I don't want anything. And, uh, so, uh, that's such a revelation for me and I wish I had known that earlier. How did, how did that, I'd be curious to hear how that revolution came about. So you mentioned depression earlier, which I definitely want to talk about. And I've certainly

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       talked and written about my own battles with extended, uh, depression and some very severe episodes over the years. And uh, you mentioned Tony Robbins earlier. So Tony Robbins, I remember underscored something for me maybe a year and a half ago, which was effectively suffering is an excessive focus on yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:56:46       There you go. Yourself. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:56:48       That was a lesson that I underlined and highlighted and revisited many times since he imparted that to me because it seemed like the best medicine for fixing myself was to stop focusing on myself in the, in many respects.

Speaker 3:          00:57:03       Absolutely. I, and I, I've taught Tony Robbins one of the greats, right. Um, however, with respect to depression, one of the insidious things, um, Nah, insidious isn't the right word. One of the sinister things about depression is that it, it's a,

Speaker 4:          00:57:24       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:57:25       it works by getting a vice grip on your thinking, so you're incapable of thinking outside of yourself. Um, that and really the, the worst aspect of depression between the ages of, Oh golly, 14 and say 30. There wasn't a day. I, I didn't wrestle with the hamlet question to be or not to be. Um, and, uh, the worst thing about, and some days for example, um, I remember a period,

Speaker 4:          00:58:01       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:58:02       for a couple of months I didn't leave my apartment. I had the, the blinds drawn. Um, I would order in from, from a deli. Um, and the, the, the worst aspect of, of depression is that you, you come to despise yourself and you, you, you believe that only now in depression. Are you thinking clearly? Yes. And that before you were delusional, yes. This is [inaudible] and you hate yourself for you. You hate yourself for being diluted, and that nobody understands. Now. Now I am thinking clearly now nothing matters. And, and, uh, and that's, that's really the devil at work. That's why I say sinister. Um, because depression traps your thinking and it hijacks your thinking like a virus and, um, and you despise yourself. You despise yourself for being diluted previously. And a lot of people in their lives despising themselves. What took you out of that pattern? You mentioned, uh, I'm blanking on the exact ages, but you said something like 14 to 30 years.

Speaker 3:          00:59:18       Sure. And then, and then episodically. Okay. After that point, um, I mean, between 14 and 30, it was, it was unrelenting. Um, it was a siege of me against my, my depression. Um, and then it was episodic. And then I'm not sure. It just, I don't know if it was biochemical. Um, but it just lifted. And how, if you don't mind me asking him when, when it lifted, how old were you when I say lifted it again? It would get, could come back. Sure. Um, but I haven't, for example, now I haven't had an episode of depression and probably a decade. That's a long story, long stretch. And I, I think it's a biochemical shift cause depression also, as you know, and the word depression reflects not just the mental state, but the physical state. Your energy level is low. And I think, you know, and to go back to Tony Robbins, you know, one of the great things about Tony Robins is he's high energy and you think about all like Richard Branson and Elon Musk and you, Tim high energy and, and, and one way to, to, to, uh, escape from slipping into depression is to, is to be ever vigilant about keeping your energy level high and to notice the biochemical markers that precede depression.

Speaker 3:          01:00:54       So you can, uh, headed off at the pass before you, you slip into it. Because once you slip into it, I mean, yeah, you're no very difficult. You're essentially, you're going to go down that slope for a while and then it's going to take, you know, days, a weeks or months to come out of it. What are some of the, I guess not red flags, but orange flags for yourself? The biochemical markers that would tell you check engine light. Okay. Something, something's going in the wrong direction. Certain seasonal things like in the winter and people suffer from seasonal affective disorder. I think it's really just noticing your energy levels day to day. For me personally, that was the marker for me. And each individual will have markers that will be, if you suffer from depression. And by the way, neither of us has giving medical advice. Of course we're not the thing we're invested in advice or advice of any kind, um, informational purposes, only informational purposes only. But, uh, but, but all of us should become aware of, and again this is a, a Ferris principle, a Ferris first principle or axiom is, is to, is to be aware of what works and what doesn't work and and keep experimenting and, and, and doing more of what works and less of what doesn't work and uh, and, and eventually you, you, you optimize and become a very high functioning individual.

Speaker 2:          01:02:23       So I'm going to come back to depression. I'm going to shift gears a little bit. I'm going to come back to because it, my interactions with you, I know that your brain works very well in this conversational format. Sure, sure. So I'm going to allow the question on depression, which is going to be 10 years ago when you seem to click out of that, sure. Condition, what things correlated, where there other things, new people in your life, new behaviors, dietary changes, whatever it might be. We don't have to hit it right now, but I'm going to let that we've added as a parenthesis, we'll come back to it. We'll come back to it because I know that that will be working on the back burner in your head, things that work. And to provide some, some context for folks. So you were very kind to come out and visit me in San Francisco and a, you brought a lot of ideas with you and I remember this was after at the 92 why Josh agreed that you were one of the best gift givers in the world and the gift said would take you some time to prepare and then they were ideas for me and you came out to share them.

Speaker 2:          01:03:21       And we've been spending a lot of time together. Yeah. You have also been writing a book and uh, you've been taking a lot of bats. And I remember asking, do you always take baths when you are working on some type of creative product, uh, project? And he said, well, are you familiar with the three bs of creativity? I said, no, I'm not. So speaking of things that, that work, can you describe the three bs of creativity or this is the three bs of creativity.

Speaker 3:          01:03:50       Uh, you know, creativity is getting in touch with your unconscious and, and, uh, you know, you, you, you consciously pose a question to your mind and you allow your unconscious too to percolate on it. And, and Josh are bestie. It's written extensively about this. And, and, and, and few people in the world do it better than he does. Um, but the three B's are bed, bath and a boss and a, and buses a is a, is a metaphor for traveling. So when you want to, when you have a problem that you're, you've, your, your conscious mind has thoroughly exhausted, then you give it over to your unconscious and, uh, so you go to sleep, right? That's bad. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:04:42       for me, which could be a long overnight sleep or

Speaker 3:          01:04:45       it could be an APP, right? It could be a nap. Um, you want to get to the dream state, um, a bath, which you could do at any point also. Um, or you switch location bosses. Again, a metaphor just for alliterative per purposes. Um, [inaudible] you switch your, your location and, um, and, and that allows your, your unconscious mind to, uh, to address the problem. And that again, that's where the magic occurs. Your unconscious, we in, in, in Western civilization over the last few thousand years, we've, we've deified logic and rationality. Um, and the irrational intuitive mind has gotten, uh, you know, short the short end of the stick and we dismiss it. But that's actually our intuitive mind and our unconscious mind. I would say our primitive mind in that sense is far more advanced and far more powerful than, than the advances we've made in logic and deductive thinking, which is, um, you know, our unconscious mind is like a supercomputer, uh, compared to the trivial apparatus of, uh, of our logical mind.

Speaker 2:          01:06:01       I've been, this is something I've been thinking about a lot in the last three years. Uh, and some of it relates to psychedelic research, we'll call it. Ah, but ah, that's there two episodes on that for people interested. Uh, so Martine Planko, Martin Polanco and uh, Dan Angle and James Fadiman if you want to look those up, we're not going to dig too deep there right now, but I've tried in the last three years to really pay more attention to and sensitize myself to these tiny perturbations. Is that a real word? And uh, my, my visceral response to things and to really hone what I had trained myself to ignore for so long. And you were talking last night and also today about being detached from your physical body after the, the hospital experience and so on, and only sort of reintegrating those sensory inputs and really relishing them and paying attention to them recently. And for me, I've been doing the same thing in the last three years instead of powering ahead and ignoring all these physical cues and what you might call intuition, which has gotten a bum rap for very understandable reasons. I think it's abused and misapplied and a lot of places, but I've been paying attention, trying to pay more attention to this, what we might call primitive but certainly evolved. Yes. Instinctual reflexive response to things. Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          01:07:29       And you know, the, the thing is that actually I'll share a fascinating experience. Um, I was at a chess tournament 20 years ago and I'm, I'm a rated master, very, very strong. And I was playing another rated master to big tournament. The world opened in Philadelphia, this is like 20 years ago. And, um, and I had had a strong opening advantage against this opponent. And if you're unfamiliar with the game of chess, it would be imagine a wrestling match where, where you haven't pinned the upon it yet, but you've, he's having a hard time moving and, and, and if it goes on much longer, you are going to pin him. So my opponent was squirming and cause I had opening advantage and then I blundered I lost a piece. Actually I lost what's known as the exchange, a rook for a night. Um, and uh, which is, I lost one of my stronger pieces for one of his weaker pieces.

Speaker 3:          01:08:30       So he had an edge and he was really happy and I knew I'm going to lose the game. I mean I was really pissed with myself cause I blundered I wasn't paying attention. And as I'm staring at the board, and again, I'm just really pissed with myself, I hear a voice, somebody whispers from behind and says, uh, you can wait in this position. Just like that. And I spun around cause it Chester tournaments, you're not allowed to give advice, give advice. And there was no one there. And I, I thought, oh, well that's odd. I was like, sure. Someone had just whispered in my ear and, you know, just to jump ahead, it was my unconscious mind that was tapping me on the shoulder. And, uh, but it manifested itself as a voice and a really distinct, so I, I, um, if you can imagine I'm looking at the chess board and I don't want the opponent to see that, uh, that I have any hope or anything.

Speaker 3:          01:09:28       So I'm doing my best woody Allen Imitation, you know, like, ah, I'm going to lose this. And, but meanwhile, I'm studying the board really closely and I see an incredible combination, like the kind of combination that Magnus Carlson would, it would have been pleased with himself if he had seen. And, um, and I won the game. And, uh, I lost every game after that in the, in the, in the, um, in the tournament because I wasn't interested in the games anymore. I wanted to hear the voice that spoke to me. And, uh, and the thing is that your unconscious mind, um, the muses, the gods, the universe, um, are all whispering to you all the time. And, and, and you need to close out your conscious mind. Find ways to shut it down to hear those voices because they're whispering all the time and, um, and, and you need to hear, hear them and heat them.

Speaker 3:          01:10:25       Um, so, uh, like you, I, uh, had been actively looking for ways to, to hear those voices because they're there all the time. And, uh, I think for myself, at least, I prided myself on not being distracted by some of those things, uh, meaning emotional insights that we're not tapping me on the shoulder, probably punching me in the shoulder or many years. And I remember at one point, this is probably two thousand four thousand five, I was agonizing over this contract. It was a, uh, it was going to be a longterm business deal. And I had a number of issues, a number of issues with it as well as the parties involved.

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       And I created these huge pro and con lists. And I remember at one point, agonizing over this for weeks and it was just consuming my thoughts 24, seven. And my girlfriend at the time asked me, she goes, do you even trust this guy? And I looked at her and I go, not really. And she goes, then don't do the deal. And I was like, good advice. Right? And of course if I had, I immediately knew the answer and I was trying to override it with some type of hyper rational, logical apparatus and it would have been self defeating in retrospect. I absolutely should not have done the deal. And I'm glad that I didn't.

Speaker 3:          01:11:54       Right. So, so, so three things jump to mind. Um, so first you had a choice there, right? You didn't have to do the deal, but because you want it to do the deal, you were looking for ways to rationalize what your unconscious mind was telling you. Right? Your unconscious mind was saying don't do the deal. Um, and uh, in the same way that a, so you don't have to take every deal. And that's one of theW to jump back to Warren Buffet. That's one of his advantages is any, he's written extensively about this, that uh, it's like the market is a pitcher and an everyday it's going to pitch lots of balls to you and you don't have to swing. But you know, once we got any of them that day, you just wait for a fat pitch and then you swing for it. Um, so, so one of the, one of the dangers when you really want something, whether it's a relationship or a business deal, your conscious mind will rationalize and will shut down your unconscious mind, which is screaming at this point. Don't do it. Walk away whenever things seem a little strange or a little off, that's your unconscious mind telling you they're really strange. And really off and walk away cause you always have a choice. Again, whether it's a relationship or a business deal, just walk away.

Speaker 2:          01:13:20       Okay. Uh, in a minute I'm going to come back to the clicking out of repeated episodes of depression. Then ask what might have correlated or correspondence. Sure. Even if it's not causal, I'm just curious, but I'm going to give you a taste of things to come. This is a new exercise. I'm going to be, Hey, wait, wait, where's, where's? Oh, there she is. I was looking for Molly. She's asleep. Oh yeah. No. Mollys mollys resting and typical pose, which is half of her body on dog bed head on the extremely hard floor.

Speaker 3:          01:13:53       You know, for those who you don't know that Molly is, if I have ever met a sweeter, better behaved, more beautiful dog in my life, I don't recall. And, and uh, so I was hoping she would come on over and sit in my lap while, by the way, she's 60 pounds. Isn't that like an easy sit in the lap? But, but, um, she's, maybe she'll grace us a little later with her, with her, with her presence, with her, with her joy.

Speaker 2:          01:14:22       She's, she's, she is being a good intro interview dog. She's, she's figured out that this is, this is usually a sideline gig. Okay. But, uh, I'm going to pull out a random question. Allah, the Tao Te Ching, which is one of Joshua's favorite books. So in the spirit of Josh, who was a, in a, in absentia here at the moment, just going to pick a random question. If I don't like any of these more Parker, let's jump. Let's do it. What are you, okay, here we go. This is just pulled out of a, a selection of questions. What are you most daring about?

Speaker 3:          01:15:01       Wow. Oh boy. That, that, that, that, that, uh, I got to think about that. What am I most during about? Well, I'll tell you something. Um, 2017 is a year about being daring about everything. I don't know that there's a most daring, I'm daring about everything I'm doing about the future.

Speaker 2:          01:15:20       Do you view yourself as a risk taker?

Speaker 3:          01:15:24       You know, it's funny. Let's reframe risk. I would love that. Yeah. Which is why I throw it out there. Sure. Of course. Um, uh, so there are two ways to, to, to, to live life and one is, is in the pursuit of gain or to avoid loss. And those are the two options. I think if there's another, I think it's pretty binary. Yup. Um, and, uh, you know, nature has, has evolved us as a species to be risk averse, um, to avoid taking chances and, and not to lose

Speaker 2:          01:16:02       and to overreact to perceive threats, right. Because the penalty for overreaction to perceived threats is less than underreacting

Speaker 3:          01:16:10       right. Mc. And to go back to Fisher, the great thing about Fisher was he wasn't afraid to lose. He wanted to win. And if it meant he was going to lose a game, so be it because he wanted to win and, and he was willing to lose in order to win. And, um, you know, I, I play a game now with myself, with the world, um, that I can't lose. So there's no risk. It goes back to those three things, connecting with people, which I can do. And I think I do pretty well. Um, creating fun and delight and approaching each person with enthusiasm, um, which again, I'm in total control of. Um, and leaning into each moment expecting magic. I'm in control of all three. So what's the risk? I mean I have nothing to lose and, and um, I'm in, it's a game that, uh, yeah, it's game you can't lose.

Speaker 3:          01:17:12       So what's the risk? The simultaneously, you made an astute observation earlier, which we don't necessarily have to get into the weeds on, but I do think it's a, it's a good observation. And it came up, we were having Thai food and I mentioned a book that I enjoyed a great deal. Uh, but when I read it about, I'm guessing now maybe seven or eight years ago, called more money than God by, I think his name is Sebastian Mallaby. I'm not sure to get it. Yeah. But which I thought it was a very intelligent overview of the origins of the hedge fund and some of the, the characters and styles in the, in the hedge fund world. Yeah, I know. Wow. But you observed that many hedge funds do not in fact hedge hedge. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:18:01       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:18:01       Right. Um, so, so yes. So hedge funds, the concept of a hedge fund was originated in 1948, however many years ago. That is, uh, um, I'm not gonna interrupt the flow of the magic of the moment. Try to calculate that. That's okay. We'll go with 40 or 52. Wait, I'm going to do it right now. If need to at 16. It's 68 years ago. Oh, no. 69, because this is 2017 and I'm so the notion of hedge funds was invented 69 years ago and um, okay. But yeah, most, most funds do not truly hedge. And by hedge, that means taking a position, say buying apple stock or selling gold or whatever it is, and then simultaneously executing another transaction that will protect you if you're wrong about the first. Um, um, so yeah, most hedge funds don't hedge. Um, even though they think they are, that there are various strategies like being long and short, but um, yeah, they, they're hedge funds in, in name only. Uh, not, not in fact.

Speaker 1:          01:19:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:19:23       Let me grab another, another question. Open up another card. We just called this the park or debt. This the stack. Yeah. The conversation. Right. We have the rapid fire questions, many of which we hit the last episodes. We're not going to, uh, we're not going to beat those to death, but, okay. Uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna pick a new one. Oh, come on. Come on. I'm not afraid. This question, I, I'm not this, this is ridiculous. This is a presumptive question. I didn't away. I didn't, I didn't write this. Why is it suspicious when your lover starts talking baby talk. That's ludicrous. I actually have Chris, let me pick it. Let me pick a different one.

Speaker 3:          01:20:03       When have you lost your way? Oh, well, I, I think I lost my way years ago. I think I only found my way this last year. Um, and again, it was, it was getting out of myself and realizing it's all about the other person. Um, you know, by way of metaphor to create an electric circuit, you need to, you, you can't do it alone. Right? And when you, when you're charged with another person, um, you, you, you, you open up a cosmic circuit. I don't, it's very hard to explain. Um, but I've seen it in real time and, and, uh, you, you create magic. And, um, so I'm, I'm on the hunt for it all the time. I'm, I'm, I'm, um, I'm on the hunt for magic.

Speaker 2:          01:21:05       So let's, let's talk about that hunt for s for a second or a, a potentially related tangent. Sure. At some point over the last two days, you said, let's talk about stoicism and then you mentioned, uh, you mentioned hedonism. And so I'm going to let you run with that and you got what you were requested. I was hoping for Molly's right next to me.

Speaker 3:          01:21:31       Um, so, so stoicism, which is an enlightened philosophy, but at the same time that stoicism all Molly, yeah, you can't see this, but I'm getting, I'm getting links from Molly here. Sweet dog. Um, um, hedonism in modern culture has, uh, the pursuit of pleasure, physical pleasure, but in fact, it was a, it was a profound Greek philosophy that originated simultaneously roughly three 50 BC, uh, with, uh, with stoicism. And it was the pursuit of pleasure, but for them, the highest pleasure was a spiritual pleasure and intellectual pleasure. And for me, the highest pleasure is, is creating delight for the other person. Um, so, so I'm a, I'm a hedonist about creating delight and magic for others. Um, and, um, so to go back, I, I'm forgetting what the question is now.

Speaker 2:          01:22:33       It wasn't really a question, it was more of a statement that I wanted you to come at them. Maybe you're a, you know, with soap, pathetically hedonistic, stoic, well, maybe yes, but like I admire the story yo x,

Speaker 3:          01:22:42       but for me, the stoics are stoics are impassive, impassive, meaning not feeling and to, to greet a success and failure with indifference. And, and, and I disagree. I believe life should be celebrated. Um, and the stoics, for me, and again, they're enlightened or alias and Seneca, these are

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       such wise people. Um, but, but for me, there's something lacking in, in, in stoicism because it's a, to go back to our, our earlier choice, it's playing not to lose as opposed to playing to win. And we are physical creatures on this plane to delight. Um, and I think that's what life is all about, creating delight for others. And in doing so, you have the light for yourself. Um, and um, which is why I joked on stage and you know, Jassa greed, you know, I said, I'm, I'm the world's best gift giver and I, I came here bearing gifts for you. And, uh, I'm really, really excited because, uh, my pen Pal Warren Buffet, I'm, I'm, uh, I'm creating a gift for him. He keeps encouraging me to write, uh, cause he sends the stuff I write, he sends it on to his friends. And, um, and so I'm, I'm writing a book, um, that I started right after our podcast, a parable and I'm, I'm, I'm rushing to finish it because, uh, I'm going to see them on the 19th, um, in a couple of weeks. So I have a week to finish this bloody thing. And give it to him as a present. Um, and I, I'm, I'm really excited about the book. Um, I get such delight giving away presence. Uh, and people don't realize I'm totally selfish because I'm the one relishing and enjoying it. Whatever pleasure they get, nowhere close to what I'm getting out of it.

Speaker 2:          01:24:44       And I think that also, whether it's hedonism or stoicism, that those are in fact large umbrellas under which there are many different species and a derivative types of stoicism or hedonism, sex almost. Right? Right. Yeah. So if you look at say stoicism, there are those who would, who might talk about the practice of stoic joy, which is joy, but a joy that is not in tandem with a commensurate emotional overreaction to negative events. But I've always, for instance, one of the things that I've always thought, well, you know, if I, if I'm say 80% s stoic, let's just say for, for the sake of thought exercise, if I were 80% stoke, what would the other 20% B and with Seneca did, which is actually what's in, in a way what Charles Darwin did with, um, to, to effectively hater proof or critic proof. Uh, his, his writing was to insert his position of his staunch as opponents.

Speaker 2:          01:25:57       Yes. In a, not only plausible, but almost complimentary way in his own work. So Seneca knowingness as a incredible order and also just, uh, w what do we need to color red or addition or a debater? And so on. Took a, he was his letters in his letters to Luke Ileus when of his students who he knew was a fan of Epicurus. He would take choice tidbits of Epicurus of the epicurean school and insert them into his own letters, the moral letters to Lucilius and, uh, and the, the epicureans and a lot of ways we're viewed as being the opposite. The stoics, they were, they were happy to tend their gardens and they focused on the little pleasures. And I'm simplifying it here, but I always thought, well, he did such a good job of embedding those, that I would probably be at least 10% epicurean. And then the last 10%, maybe that's, maybe that's a some type of, some type of a sympathetic hedonist or at least maybe that's the aspiration. Yeah. Uh, are there any particular, you've, you're a very widely read human being. Are there any particular philosophers who draw your attention or who you wish people would pay more attention to or, I realize this is a lot of commas. Uh, if you had to prescribe, say, high school seniors to become familiar with one or more philosophers, do any, any names or even schools come to mind? Oh Gee.

Speaker 5:          01:27:33       Um, could just be thinkers. It doesn't have to be philosophers. Right. Well, I mean, I mentioned this, you asked a similar question at the 92nd street y and I, I'm going to start just to buy myself a little time as I, as I, I searched my memory for philosophers that I would broadly recommend is Rumi, the poet Rumi. And the wonderful thing about Rumi as a poet, and he was also a philosopher, is, um, as he gets you in touch with the magical and the mysterious and, and I think we need to be in touch with that, all of us in everyday life. Um, and so I would say that, um, the, I would read Plato, um, because Plato in the dialogues would, would create an, an an interlocutor, a, he would start arguing against himself. Um, and again, in, in philosophical discourse and in your own reasoning, you have to place yourself in the position of the other.

Speaker 5:          01:28:42       And if there was one theme today, and certainly in my life in 2016 and moving forward in my life is the importance of the other. And, and what is he or she thinking, uh, or what does he or she want as opposed to what I want or what I think. And, um, and by the way, you have to do this in chess. Um, you know, you're, you're playing against an opponent who also has plans in fact plans diametrically opposed to yours. Um, and so you, it's well to take the other person, uh, in mind and, and, and what they're planning.

Speaker 2:          01:29:23       We're going to jump back to that bookmark that I sat a while ago, the depressive ongoing depressive period, intermittent episodes. And then about a decade ago or so, lifting, uh, lifting. Did anything correspond to that? Well, there any things you introduced or,

Speaker 5:          01:29:42       I think there was at that point in my life, so this is 20 2007 I, I just made an abrupt decision to

Speaker 1:          01:29:51       okay.

Speaker 5:          01:29:52       To move away from everything in the past, um, that I had made many mistakes. Gosh, I've made so many mistakes in my life, but, but to, to, to, to re to go back to first principles and fundamentals and, and, uh, and by the way, I turned my back on, on, on, on, on a couple of successful careers and, and decided to embark on, on a new one and to set myself up as a advisor to two major hedge funds. And, uh, um, so I, I think it was a decision, a break from the past and in it and a conscious one. And I think that was, that was the marker only

Speaker 2:          01:30:40       on a, let's just say you, you decide that on a macro level to break from the, yeah. The past and many things in the past. Let's say you do that after dinner one day you go to bed. How was your next day different? Are you separating yourself from contact with certain people? Are you identifying when old thought patterns come up and stopping and trying to replace them? What, what is, what is the difference?

Speaker 5:          01:31:07       Well, you know, what the differences are you, we talked about it when, when, when we were walking Molly earlier. So, um, again, you're listening, so you, you the, the, the, the, the, the, the audience. You just, uh, you have to imagine this. We're walking Molly on, on the streets of San Francisco and, uh, in, uh, in, in a wonderful Selvin Canyon and Clave, uh, that, that I've never known about and where anyway, uh, Tim resides. And so we're walking Molly and, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:31:46       yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:31:46       Molly, when we're walking on the left side of the street, you always want Molly away from the traffic. And so we're walking along and, and on, on the left side, Molly is okay, but when we switched to the other side of the street, Molly has to be on your right side, which is again, away from the traffic. And, and Molly, again, this is by way of metaphor you said that Molly is, is more, it's a little more awkward for her. So she's got to be a little more conscious and, and thoughtful about what she does when we're walking on the right side of the street. And when I made a conscious break to end, uh, I mean I ended a relationship and I ended a business and sided start a new and, um, you become conscious, you know, I think too much of our lives aren't automatic pilot and, and so like Molly walking on the right side of the street just, uh, it's, it's a little different for her, so she becomes conscious of everything she does. And I think,

Speaker 4:          01:32:52       okay,

Speaker 5:          01:32:53       that's really important to, to be, to live consciously and mindfully. And one way to do that is to get yourself out of, um, old ways of being, um, take a, a new path to work. Um, I'm not saying you should be dramatic and an end, everything is, I didn't start a new, but, um, you can, uh, you can make little choices and again, to live mindfully and consciously. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:33:26       yeah, so that, that's uh, the, the decision you made and you've pointed out some very cool word origins or, uh, I should say word components at the very least. No, his mic up, mix up etymology and entomology, but I'm pretty sure the etymology, we're not talking about if we're eating Paleo for instance, what would we, what would a new replacement for companion be if companion, which if you were to look at this, let's just say since I don't speak Latin Spanish combined with bread, with bread, breaking bread with someone else, you know, what would the paleo equivalent of that be or matrix the fact that if you look at Matriarch or matrimony, uh, there, there's a mother component, mother related, uh, the, the decision you made. And uh, I might be making this up, but I don't think I am making it up. Incision decision to cut away.

Speaker 2:          01:34:20       Yes. A cutting away to decide is to cut, to cut away incision. Correct. So the cutting away of relationship business, all of these things, if, well, I shouldn't, I shouldn't project, but for myself to do something like that, it's very often something I know I need to do. It's something that on many levels I want to do, but I put it off for a very, very long time. I get close and then I, sure, then I flinch and then I go back to my easier, automatic way of doing things or the devil that I know, the comforts that I'm afraid to replace because of the unknown.

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       What led you to get to the point and was there a certain conversation, a certain journaling exercise, was there? What led you to finally make the Drager and make the break? I, I think you just realize that, um,

Speaker 1:          01:35:15       okay.

Speaker 5:          01:35:17       For me, I mean, it's different for each person. You just, whether you're being authentic and, and I realized I wasn't being authentic and I had to make a break and, and, and, um, and start a new life. And, and, um, and so I think authenticity is a big thing. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:35:39       it's hard to be authentic and, and, uh, but it's, and their challenges and, and, and, uh, I was going to say risks, but I, again, to go back, I don't know that there are risks if you play a game and the game is all about creating fun and a light for everyone around you. And, uh, you know, this reminds me of a joke. Um, so, uh, I don't know if you've heard this one. So guy walks into a bar and a, by the way, this is a profound philosophical point that I'll make, but it'll only become clear once I tell you the joke. So, um, this guy walks into a bar and, um, and uh, it goes into the bar tender and orders a drink. And the bartender looks at me, goes, I, I haven't seen you in the bar before. Yeah. Uh, and the bar, the, the, the, the customer says, well, no, I'm, I just came to town.

Speaker 5:          01:36:35       And the bartender goes, oh, whoa, what brings you town and what do you do? And he says, I'm a gambler. And the bartender says, really? And, uh, and, and he says, yeah, I, uh, I'm a Gambler, a professional gamblers, what I do for a living. And the bartender goes, really? You can make a living at that? And he says, uh, yeah, I never lose. And the bartender goes, oh, Kimmy, a break. And the the gambler guy, or the customer says, yeah, no, I've never, I don't lose. And, um, so, uh, the bartender goes, okay, uh, give me an example. Let that make me a bet. And so, uh, the customer says, uh, to the, the bartender, look, I'm warning you, I'm a, I'm a professional gambler. I just warn you that I never lose. Are you sure you want to do this? And the bartender goes, absolutely. And he says, okay, uh, I'll bet you $50. Hold on. I gotta make sure I get this bet right. I bet you $50 that I can, um, bite my left eye.

Speaker 5:          01:37:42       And the bartender rolls his eyes and slams down 50 bucks, then it goes, you're on, you're on. And um, so, uh, the, uh, the, the, uh, the gambler guy out his left eye and bites it in his mouth and, and, and pops it back in and the bartender is furious, but the gambler guy says, I, I warned you and scoops up the money. And, um, and, and the, and the, uh, have you heard this one before? Oh, okay. So, um, again, the path is really funny and then I'll make the philosophical point about life. And, um, so, uh, the bartender goes, okay, give me another chance. And, and the gamma guy says, look, I, I'm a professional. I just warn you, I just took $50. Are you sure you want to do this? And the bartender goes, yeah, give me another chance. And the, and the gambler guy says, okay, I'll bet you another $50 that I can bite my other eye.

Speaker 5:          01:38:43       And the bartender goes, wait a second. Okay, I missed the fact that that one I was glass, but there's no way that you're blind. I know you don't have to glass eyes. Okay, you're bros down 50 box. And by the way, other patrons are now circling around watching what's going on and egging the bartender on. And um, so the gambler guy takes out his dentures and, and gently bites his eye, the other eye with the, with his dentures. And the bartender is steaming now because he's lost two bats. He's furious. And, uh, the gamma guy says, I want you. And Anyway, the Gambler guy throughout the evening is getting drunk. He's buying drinks for everybody. He goes to the back of the bar. Um, and then he comes back to the bartender and says, look, I'm going to make it up to you. I'll make another bet.

Speaker 5:          01:39:36       And now the whole premise of the whole bar is around him. And, um, and so he says, I'll bet you $500 that I can stand on this bar right here on the bar. Uh, stand up on one leg and you see that vodka bottle behind you. I can pee into that bottle and not a drop of PE will go anywhere else. But that bottle and the parts in the course, there is no way that that's going to have any, a puts down 500 bucks. And so as the gambler guy, so the gambler guy, and by the way, he's pretty drunk at this point. He can barely stand up. He gets up at the top of the bar, um, uh, uh, pulls it out and pees everywhere. But the bod cabal pees all over the bartender and the bartender is laughing his head off and, and so is everyone else, right?

Speaker 5:          01:40:24       And, uh, and the, uh, the guy, the Gamba guy gets a, you know, it does this, finish this business and gets down off the bar and, and the, and the bartender triumphantly grabs the, the 500 bucks, uh, from the, the Gamma Guy. And he says, ah, Ha, I, uh, I, uh, thought she never lose. And the Gamma Guy says, uh, I didn't. He said, what do you mean I just took $500 from you? And he said, uh, the Gamer guy says, yeah, but you see that table, those guys back there, those costs guys, I bet them $2,000 that I could stand up on this Barn, pee all over you. And not only would you not object, you'd be laughing when I did it. And, and so, so, so the interesting thing there, tie, we'll talk about a hedged bet, right? The, as we were talking about hedge funds earlier, is that the power off is a, there's a huge payoff.

Speaker 5:          01:41:14       He lost. Okay. The 500. But there was a much bigger payoff. And in life, if your focus is on the other person and delighting the other person, again, whether it's a job interview or a relationship, a date, or you're looking to get funding for your startup or pee all over him and give him $500, right? But the payout, the universe pays you back on the back end. And, and, and that's a faith. So that's, that's the gospel that I preach is the gospel of the other. And, and focus on the other and exclusively, and you'll get tremendous delight yourself and, and, uh, and the universe has a way of throwing you, uh, uh, extra. Uh, okay. So much more than you could think. And I'll give you an example of magic. And I said before the, the, the, uh, it's something I stop me if I said this, the nice secretary.

Speaker 5:          01:42:17       Why did I talk about getting a present for Warren Buffet and then, and then, uh, the, the gallery. Okay. So, so I, I, uh, I create, uh, a Christmas present for Warren Buffet. I want to send it to him. Right. And my pen pal. And, uh, and so I created a framed pack of Beeman's gum, which used to sell as a child. And so it took me the Beeman's gum for those of you who don't know, Eh, um, the company that made Beeman's gum went out of business about a decade ago. And, uh, and Warren Buffet when he was a child, used to sell it and, and I tracked down on the Internet a candy collector and, and asked him if he had a pack of Beeman's gum from like 50 years ago, like, like an old ancient pack. And he said, I might in my warehouse in Montana. And sure enough, he found it and I said, I'll pay any price for it.

Speaker 5:          01:43:21       I bought it. And then I had a calligrapher right. From small beginnings. Anyway, I had a framed pack of gum that I was going to send a Warren Buffett for Christmas. So this is December 20 20th or so. And I'm in, I'm in the gallery and in Tribeca and the gallery owner. See Your City New York City. Yes. I'm sorry. And, um, the gallery owner says, do you like the frame? It just been framed. And I said, Oh, this is so beautiful. He's just going to love this. [inaudible] she doesn't know who I am and doesn't know who this is going to. It doesn't say for anybody. And um, and I said, oh, how am I going to get this to Nebraska? And she said, what do you mean? I said, well, if I send it FedEx, I don't care how many times I bubble wrap at the gum will fall off the frame.

Speaker 5:          01:44:10       Like it'll fall off the backing. That's shadow box shadow box. Right. And I thought, oh, it's going to, it has to be couriered. And I said, how am I going to get it there? And she said, oh, I'll take care of that. And I said, oh, great. You know, a delivery service. And she said, uh, that'll liver presently. She said, yeah, I'll take care of it. I said, well, what delivery service? Cause I'd like to know, just for future reference. She said, Oh, I'm sorry, I don't think I'll deliver this personally. I said, what? I squinted at her. I said, what? She said, yeah, I'll take care of this free of charge. I said, excuse me, this is Nebraska, right? It's not like going to some fun location, like with respect to those of you who are from Nebraska, I mean to get all kinds of hate mail. Um, but for the winter it's the winner. It's the winter. Right, right, right, right. Why would you want to be going to Nebraska? And um, she said, she looked at me and she said, I'll do it for free. I can see how important this is to you.

Speaker 5:          01:45:15       And I, I was so stunned and I just looked at her young woman, maybe 28, 29. And I said, um, I said, you know, I can't let you do that. That's the best gift anyone's ever given me. And I'm the world's best gift giver. And here I was like, I like, like ya'll one up. I got one up. And I said, uh, I said, oh my gosh, I'm really this kind of thing I would've said. And I said, I can't let you do that. I, I'll pay for you to do it. I'm not going to ruin the magic cause there was some impulse in you that wanted to do that, to offer that to me and I'm going to have to, I'll, I'll pay for the trip. So thank you. And, and that's an example of the magic. She didn't know who it was going to, uh, didn't know who I was.

Speaker 5:          01:46:04       She just knew it was important to me and in the, in the, because I was so focused on getting this present to someone that I cared about and she could see that she was swept into the magic. And that's an example of the magic that happens when you're just focused on someone else instead of yourself and a boy. I was humbled by that. I mean, wow, I'm really went up in the, in the present giving department. Um, so the magic of focusing on the other, on the other, yeah. Yeah. Well I think you're a master of, and I didn't know the pre, let's say we met, when did we first meet? I'm not sure if it was 2014,

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       1514. I think [inaudible] 14 through Jackson. I didn't know the Adam pre 2014 but you strike me as an expert in what, another podcast guest I, Gabrielle Reece, Gabby Reese. Sure. Going first. She said go first. Yeah. I asked her if she, if she had any parting request for the audience, she should go first. Meaning smile first, make eye contact first to say hi first. You're very good at that. And I think that's part of, uh, eliciting the potential magic of, of that situation. Absolutely. When you're really

Speaker 5:          01:47:29       the secret to everything to creating in the world, whether it's creating a relationship or creating a business, I don't care what it is, is you have a vision of what's possible.

Speaker 1:          01:47:46       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:47:47       And you

Speaker 5:          01:47:51       convey that vision to the potential partner, whether it's a business or a romantic partner of what's possible. And, and you get them excited about it and you get other people excited about it if it's a business and so on. And, um, and so yeah, it's about having visions, positive visions of what's possible. Um, you know, and this is 2017 and I'm, I think the world is in a very perilous place right now, but I'm very excited for the world because, because this is a fulcrum moment and by fulcrum moment, I mean a moment when you can achieve great results, maximally leveraging whatever resources you've got, like now is the time to act. Um, and we get fulcrum moments in our lives as individuals and as countries and as a planet. And this is a fulcrum year. Um, and we all sense it, um, that great changes, positive or negative. We gotta be careful, um, and, and, and to, to seize the fulcrum moment. Now is the time to press hard. Um, and I think the world's got to do that, um, with, with positive visions and excite. Again, it's all about the other, excite everyone with a positive vision and we can create magic in the world or not. And then we're in trouble. Um, I'm really excited about 2017 for myself and for the world. Um, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:49:38       before we wrap up, I think we might, we might have a date with a Russian bath. In Our Future. But, uh, before we close the conversation, do you have any parting requests for the audience? Questions for the audience, suggestions for the audience, anything you'd like them to take with them?

Speaker 5:          01:49:58       Well, that was a big one, that this is a fulcrum a year. I'm telling you, just intuitively, I know for myself and I'm sure as a, as you the listener reflect on your life and, and there are great opportunities. The world is such tremendous beauty and possibility. It's so exciting right now. And, and, and yet everyone's focused on the negative and, and instead focus on the other and, and positive and creating magic, uh, lean into each moment and each encounter creating magic. And, um, and by the way, that's a great editing principle. Like when you're, you're in an, you're about to argue with a cab driver or, or, or with your spouse or with your best friend or whatever, ask yourself is what you're going to say. Create the light and the other person or magic. And if not, don't say it. Um, and

Speaker 2:          01:50:58       well, I saw you do that last night with a, uh, with a hostess. At a restaurant when the restaurant was fully booked up. It's raining outside. We walk in and, uh, and in fact it wasn't we, it was just the two of us walked in because we had, we had another party with us waiting in the Uber because we didn't think it'd be possible potentially to get a table. Right. And I don't remember the exact wording that you used, but you walked up and to brand. I remember rolling at her. Yeah. And, uh, and you just walked into the exchange opening first, second, expecting us to get a table. Right. And Lo and behold, she said, I feel like your chances are very good after, you know, 30 seconds of Adam turning on the charm. And then I called call their whole Party in. And a few short minutes later, after some, a little bit of, uh, of, of me drinking wine and all of us drinking sparkling water, we got, uh, arguably the best table in the house. It was the best table in what's the most stable now.

Speaker 5:          01:52:02       Yeah. And, uh, because,

Speaker 4:          01:52:06       okay.

Speaker 5:          01:52:06       I just couldn't, I really, I, I still remember, um, which just about creating some fun for her and she realized we were fun people and fun energy and damn straight. She was going to give us a table. Shizam yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:52:21       Adam. Uh, I always love our conversations and many more head conversational park war. Exactly right. She'll park where, which is my favorite kind of park cord because I can't damage my knees. And uh, is there any where you would like people to learn more about you online or elsewhere, website, anything else that you'd like to mention? Well, they can always get in touch with through my website, Robinson global strategies. There's a contact form there and they want to talk about global strategy or, or magic. Um, they can always drop me a line and, and uh, and I'll respond. All right, well on that note, I think this is a great place to, to temporarily table this ongoing conversation that we have.
