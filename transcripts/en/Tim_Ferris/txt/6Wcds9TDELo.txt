Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. No else, you posting a question? I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic. You might remember four sigmatic for their mushroom coffee, which was created by those clever finished founders, and when I first mentioned that coffee on this podcast, the product sold out in less than a week at lights you up like a Christmas tree, which can be really useful. However, recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum and new product and that is their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep. As you guys may know, longtime listeners, at least I struggled with insomnia for decades. I have a largely fixed that, but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy, still isn't easy very often, and I found Reishi, which I've been fascinated by for a few years now, has been very, very effective and calming their old formula. However, four sigmatic old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners, all sweeteners for a host of reasons, and I then just ping them and asked, hey guys, I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested, but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it, if too much of a headache, don't worry.

Speaker 2:          00:01:31       And they are always game for experimentation. And so they created a special custom version without the Stevia, without sweeteners. Now it is part of my nightly routine. Their ratio elixir comes in single serving packets, which are perfect for travel and in fact I'm about to leave the country right now and I have a packet in front of me that's just going to sit in the end of my carry on bag. You only need hot water and it mixes very, very easily. Here's some recommended copy that they put in the read, so I'm going to read it and then I'll give you my take quote. A warning for those in the experimental mindset ratio is strong and bitter in parentheses, like any great medicine. So if the bitterness is too much, I recommend trying it with honey end or nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

Speaker 2:          00:02:16       So I'm going to say no, you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter. And maybe you should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing ins. When they say Boone, I'm sure cool. Which means you're not able to eat bitterness. Bitter is in many cases and indication of things that help liver detoxification and so on. Not saying that's the case here, but I've tested this ratio lecture on family members, on friends. Everybody has liked it. It's a little bit earthy. It's not that hard. So I would just say suck it up and no, don't put in honey or milk or any of that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea. It's delicious I think. Right? If you like [inaudible], that kind of stuff, that type of tea, you're going to dig it. So just try it. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       Back to then my read. If you'd like to naturally improve your sleep, both onset end quality, I think naturally you might just enjoy this.

Speaker 2:          00:04:20       This episode is brought to you by helix sleep. Last year, I committed to making sleep a top priority, trying to fix onset insomnia or continuing to fix that depth of sleep, quality of sleep. I tracked a lot. I tested a lot and I revisited really everything from the daily routine to the surfaces. I slept on playing with the chilly pad, whatever, and when I moved to Austin I got all new beds, including mattresses from Helix, working with the world's leading sleep experts. Certainly some of them. He looks sleep developed mattresses personalized to your preferences and sleep style to make sure that you can have the best sleep possible without costing thousands upon thousands of dollars. He looks sleep has recently added a new layer to customize sleep with the helix pillow. The all new pillows are fully adjustable so you can achieve perfect comfort regardless of sleep position or body type, or if you're a shifty type like me, I move around quite a bit when I sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:05:16       Just take their simple two to three minute sleep quiz to get started and that will help ensure that they can build a mattress or pillow that you will love the mattress, whatever this be spoke, mattresses that you arrive at a, we'll get to you within a week and the shipping is completely free. You can try the mattress for 100 nights and if you're not completely happy, they'll pick it up and offer a full refund. I tested that refund policy because I test all of these sponsors and kick the tires a lot. We tested it and they came through and making sure that we got ultimately the right mattress for my body. Type to personalize your sleep experience, visit Helix, sleep.com forward slash Tim and you'll receive up to $125 your mattress order that's helix sleep, h, e l I x sleep.com forward slash Tim for up to $125 off your order.

Speaker 2:          00:06:09       Why? Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. [inaudible], my beautiful little [inaudible] this show, as some of you may know, is about deconstructing world class performers, teasing out the habits, routines, life lessons, thought processes, frameworks, and so on from people in many different industries, many different areas of expertise that you can hopefully apply to your own lives. And my guest today is Steve Jurvetson who really has his hand in many, many different worlds. You can say hello to him on Twitter at DFJ. Steve, he is a venture capitalists, but a lot more than that focused on founder led mission driven companies at the cutting edge of disruptive technology. Now you might think to yourself, well that's what I might hear many venture capitalists say, but he was recommended to me by a past guest as a guest, Matt Mullenweg who I trust very implicitly.

Speaker 2:          00:07:07       And uh, to give you an idea of the street cred, he has been the founding venture capital investor in for public companies and many rapidly growing companies like planet Memphis, meats, mythic and Nirvana and e r. V. Nirvana. He also led investments in startups that were later collectively acquired for $12 billion. Probably much more at this point. Before cofounding the firm, DFJ draper Fisher, Jurvetson Steve was a r and d engineer at Hewlett Packard, worked in product marketing at apple and next many, many stories about his mentors there and then spent a short stint in management consulting at Bain. He completed his electrical engineering degree at Stanford and two and a half years. Think about that for a second. Graduating number one in his class and went on to earn all sorts of degrees, MSW, NBA, et cetera. In 2016 President Barack Obama appointed Steve as a presidential ambassador for global entrepreneurship.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       Steve was also chosen as one of tech's best venture investors and quote by Forbes and as the venture capitalist of the Europe by Deloitte. Steve, we'll be launching a brand new venture fund sometime later this year and you can read about it@future.ventures, so not future.com but future.ventures. That's how you would spell it out. Not surprisingly, he will be focusing on passionate founders who are on a mission to make the world a better place with a penchant for unique ideas and disruptive technologies. And disruptive may be an overused term, but Steve really understands what that means and we dig into some very, very, very specific examples that might make your mind explode. So without further ado, please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with Steve Jurvetson. Steve, welcome to the show.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       Thank you. Come here. I am looking here at all my notes when you were kind enough to send links to various resources, interviews, discussions, and I have to tell you I feel a little overwhelmed because usually I have someone on the shell. It's like, all right, we have person a and they're really good at rock climbing. I think we'll start with rock climbing and in this case we're not even going to cover 10% of the notes that I have in front of me and they've already been winnowed down. But there is, I think one story that I came upon that I'd love for you to describe for people just as a starting point and it's a quote and then you can give the background from Professor David Deutsch out of Oxford. And it begins with, and please correct me if I'm wrong, the only way this computer can be as powerful as it is dot, dot, dot.

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       What does this quote? Sure. Um, and I may be paraphrasing cause it's, uh, stuff you wrote back in 2002, 2001 at least I read the book fabric or valid in 2002 and he's talking about the power of quantum mechanics and the potential for quantum computers. And in so doing, he and Richard Fineman both realized that a quantum computer to be fundamentally unlike anything we have in this world today. Uh, and the way that quote roughly ends is that the only way to explain the power of these computers is to invoke the notion that it is sort of engaging the resources across parallel universes. That if you just use the resources of one university, now there's so much you can do. But in this case, you actually are in the most poetic sense, harnessing almost refractive echoes across apparel universities to do computation in a fundamentally different way.

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       And that usually bends the mind of most scientists, even physicists to the point of breaking or looking the other way. And the common response to this is, I don't understand one bit of that and it had me captivated. So I want to jump into a number of areas that I know nothing about or very little about, even though I might use the words occasionally as people who spent a lot of time in silicon valley are, are want to do, but for people who don't have the background, I want to highlight a few things about you or actually one, just as we're delving into some of the science. Sure. So your background or a lot of your background is engineering. So electrical engineering, I tried doing bachelor's and master's and started a phd and you were able to do so much of that partially because you finished your Undergrad in two and a half years.

Speaker 3:          00:11:20       That's right. Okay. The point I wanted to make with that, and we're gonna come back to that because I don't know how that even happens, uh, is that you have technical literacy, but also learning like a child. Right? So can you walk us through one of the terms I was hoping to understand for myself and that is quantum computing. What is a quantum computer, right? Uh, a quantum computer is a device. It's usually something that is either cooled down to almost absolute zero or has some other phenomenon that it takes advantage of that is at the edge of what is the known universe. Meaning when you cool something to zero, behavior of materials changes dramatically if you have a superconductor. The way it works is dramatically different from normal conductors. And so what people have found is that rather than look at quantum mechanics as something that is spooky and bizarre the way a Albert Einstein even described it, this spooky action at a distance, this ability to entangle things to have them to have their fates intermingled can be not just used for things like really unbreakable cryptography and data transmission.

Speaker 3:          00:12:22       It could also be used in a very bizarre way to build a computer. And this computer, it looks something like a row of let's say rings that are either magnetically in one direction or the other. You can think of it in a traditional computer, it's a one or a zero, but actually it can be everything in between simultaneously. Much like when you dive into how an Adam actually works, there isn't an electron any given point. It's a cloud. It's a probability function around the Adam. Well, that cloud is something we're not used to in the real world. We're used to the statistical aggregation of many items and it's like there's a table. It's hard. I can't put my hand through the table. It's not sometimes here and sometimes over there, but the farther down you look, the closer and closer to, let's say the atomic scale, you notice the behavior of physics becomes quantum physics and rather than being something spooky, you can actually harness this to compute in a very peculiar way, in a way that in a very, in a very simple level, you could say it's as if all of your memory bank and the computer was a one and a zero simultaneously.

Speaker 3:          00:13:16       So you instantly jump or tunnel to the answer. You're looking forward to particular problem. So rather than exhaustively searching millions or billions or trillions of possibilities to find, let's say the key that unlocks it digital lock, you just jump to the answer.

Speaker 3:          00:13:31       That's a seemingly science fiction. But these, these computers do exist. Yes. Um, and even within scientific communities, there's some backbiting that says, well wait, do they really exist as this one? An example is that just a fast analog computer? So it is at the edge of a what people believe is possible. And uh, I think we actually need literally at this period of history where these computers are starting to come out. I've been on the board of directors of one for Gosh over 15 years now. So I was a little early and thinking when this was ready for prime time. It's now at the point where, for example, Google says that their quantum computer that they bought from a company called D wave outperforms, they're entitled to entire data center on certain computational tasks and that are important to what they do. And other tasks that are meant to really show how fast is it.

Speaker 3:          00:14:16       They found 100 million fold speed up over the best computer they could buy from anyone else. How big is such a quantum computer? They're almost all about the same size. Not because the computer is big, but because the cooling apparatus and the shielding from me that it flux is high. So thinking about a refrigerator size, slightly bigger like two refrigerators, the actual computer is just done a little silicon ship that's as small as any other silicon chip. It's just cool to literally 500 times colder than the most remote part of outer space. I mean like a few Milli Kelvin above absolute zero, which is really cool too to put the speed for power in perspective. Uh, could you please describe a graph that I've seen you present, which I believe might start with, is it 2002 right. And it looks like it, it progresses up to the right almost out of a 45 degree angle.

Speaker 3:          00:15:06       Now that the angle is, is that important? I mean it depends on what's on the axes, but uh, could you describe what these different, what these points are points represent? It's something I have affectionately called roses law with a sort of homage to Moore's law. Um, because Moore's law is actually named by carver mead. It wasn't Gordon Moore himself who labeled his law Moore's law and nor did nor did Jordy rose, the founder of D-Wave. But when I was first speaking with him in 2002 having just read David Deutsch, his book, he had produced a single cubit, they're called cubits for like quantum bits. So I'll just use the acronym cubit. He had manufactured one of these untested and characterized it and had sent to the manufacturing facility. It was the cubit, the entire computer. And think of it as a buy loosen algae, like a memory array.

Speaker 3:          00:15:47       It would be like a one bit memory ray. Got It. That's a really powerful memory rate. So when you go from one to two u s you're now able to explore all possibilities of two to the second power of, so for memory states, if you have three cubits, you could simultaneously explored eight possible memory states if you have four 16 and so forth. Right? It's a doubling. So as you add a single cubit, you've roughly, even by with some hand waving, doubled the power of your computer roughly speaking on the order of a two to the end phenomenon. So if you were to add one new cubit every year, which he just stayed it. So coming to like where this graph come from, he just stayed in 2002 I think we're going to double the number of cubits and a functional quantum computer every year in perpetuity.

Speaker 3:          00:16:24       And so I had to ask is that just because Gordon Moore said something that sounds kind of similar and we had a conversation, I don't remember being particularly persuaded other than it's a semiconductor process. It takes roughly a year. Did that just the prior generation? Yeah, we should. We should. Why shouldn't we be able to do this? And sure enough, that's helpful today. Right? So that's been 16 years of doublings. The way the graph gets interesting though is as with Moore's law, it comes out of nowhere. Like, so Moore's law, you get to actually trace back hundreds of years, arguably that our capacity to compute as a species has been doubling roughly every year since we started to compute, since we had any kind of advocates. I mean like it's kind of weird how this has been growing and the semiconductor industry is just the modern version of that on a quantum computer.

Speaker 3:          00:17:04       That doubling starts to reach thresholds where you can do things that you couldn't do with any computer on earth. So on this graph he was, if you look forward and here's where there's been a little bit of a time delay by the way, just to full disclosure, where the power something's computers, there has been a bit of overhead, there's been a bit of, you know, set up and read out times. There's been a bit of noise and other things that have made the power of it not, it's still scales like the original curve, like that 45 degree angle. You're painting in people's minds. But the power that that represents is, you know, imagine you have to go like a little, maybe two or four times bigger to hit some of these thresholds, but unless something falls off the rails, we will soon and like the next couple of years have computers that can outperform any computer on earth.

Speaker 3:          00:17:43       Then you give it another couple of years and it would outperform all computers that could ever be built on earth, even if you use entire matter of the earth to build them. And then this is where David Deutsch started to run this thought process out, give it another couple of years. He would outperform all computers that could possibly be built if you use the entire matter of the universe as at your disposal to build in the best possible computer. Any human could ever design. And you gave it the length of the university and time to work on a problem. It's still couldn't solve these problems and the quantum cuter could. And in due course like in less than an hour, like that's when if your head hasn't already drilled out of your ears, it just really explodes like pulp and what there's places where nature gives you a peak into its wonders, right? And as a scientist or engineer, we get these in almost any field of exploration, whether it's innerspace of quantum physics or outer space and the frontiers of the unknown.

Speaker 3:          00:18:32       And here's one of those examples that just opens your eyes to how little we know in that you'll sometimes see this may be an experiment. Um, I give an example of one that David Deutsch also likes that some people might remember from your high school physics. If you have two slits, um, two very narrow slits and you shine light through them, you get this diffraction pattern on a screen, on the falling on the wrong side of the table. And that's always been something we learned at the bulk statistical physics of a lot of photons, a lot of lights going and interfering with each other. It was interference patterns. Well, it's fascinating is if you send single photons at a time, they will shoot through and if you just tally up to statistics, they'll end up creating a distribution pattern just as if it were many photons interacting.

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       So the whole explanation, the wave theory of light is that waves interact with each other, and that's what creates this pattern is ripple pattern on the other side. But there's no interaction when you're single and single photon at a time. It's not interacting with anything other than its sister photon in a parallel universe. Right. And David Joyce, she was like, well, that's obviously the explanation that makes all of this work other than it bends people's minds. And so the two schools of thought are, that's the answer, or I don't want to talk about it. What is David's background? Is He, oh, he's a physicist, but yeah. Yeah. Just to make sure. Yes, absolutely. No, he knows a lot way more than me because he's not a charlatan. Yeah. How do you even make sense of that? I mean in terms of considering the implications because this isn't, we're not talking about thousands of years away potentially, and this is in the relatively near term future.

Speaker 3:          00:20:02       What are the implications of that? So the key to answering that question as well, what are these computers good for? Right. And either good news or bad news depending on your point of view is they're very hard to program, at least historically speaking is a years would go by between major advances in the software, if you will, the algorithms that one can run on a quantum computer and do anything useful. Right. There was something called shores algorithm that came out a few years back that said, hey, you can actually factor integers, meaning break the number 15 into its prime factors. Three times five is 15 so if I give you 15 tell me what the prime factors are. You know, if the number is small, we can kind of work our way randomly threw it through either exhaustive search or some heuristic, but we don't really have a mathematical way to get the answer.

Speaker 3:          00:20:40       And the quantum computer now can just give you the answer, which it turns out would break most of cryptography. Um, any of these mathematically symmetries are at the core of public key crypto. So that's kind of worrisome. Um, when it's useful for beyond something that spooks should be interested in is we literally also in a renaissance of software discovery. So things are that it really seems to be coming to the top of near term opportunities or quantum chemistry and um, deep learning or machine learning, both of which are very interesting. Quantum chemistry is quite simply predicting accurately what a small molecule will do. It turns out if you use a normal computer and you try to solve shortens great Schrodinger's equations and do like the what's called the bottoms up ab initio model, like what does a water molecule do, what does aspirin do, how does it behave?

Speaker 3:          00:21:23       You can't actually model this. It just computation that grinds to a halt. A quantum computer could do this almost on a one to one mapping. So the quantum computer about the same complexity as h two o and all of its electrons is about the size of computer. You'd need the model it perfectly like when does it freeze? How this whatever, what's phase transitions, all these weird properties of water that we take for granted that really don't come from the physics, right? We learned this in chemistry, but you don't learn in physics. And because of the math it's computationally to complex. Um, more interesting to me personally. I mean, by the way, I first invested in quantum computing for quantum chemistry. That was the reason I got excited about this is what we'd be able to design drugs more quickly. Figure out, let's give an example.

Speaker 3:          00:21:59       Let's say you have some new, uh, h one n one virus and you're trying to figure out how can I design a molecule that would dock to this virus at a particular place that like if I could only attach they're chemically, I could kill it. Well, that's very hard to do. Very easy to state, very hard to solve. So you can test a drug, but you can't have an issue of just design it out of scratch. And that's what these hopefully we'll be able to do soon rapidly accelerate drug design. The other area that has enormously wide applicability is in deep learning and we can talk more about that field later. But generally speaking, building little brains that can learn something very quickly and like let's say it's pattern recognition or image recognition for any number of applications, um, and do that much better. So that's why perhaps it's not surprising. Google's been the primary customer of quantum computers for the last 10 years cause they use deep learning everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:22:49       So we're going to, I'm sure get to deep learning. I shouldn't be so confident. Well like 75 pages on it comes back to 75 pages of notes. Sure. I'll do my best to come back to deep learning folks. I'm not yet a deep learner by clearly with all the notes are neural networks. That's the same thing basically. All right, so this is, you want to come back to that. Great. All right. So I'll, I'll put this anonymous on my mysterious pad here, but question that is tangentially related, but since you mentioned entanglement, this is something that's become very interesting to me as a non physicist. Of course, my ability to dig into it as is limited, but I heard, I believe it was radio lab, I could be making that up, but an episode of radio lab where they talked about the, some of the experimental design and the results of using lasers to impact, uh, entangled. Suppose it'd be Adam's, does that sound right? Uh, or, um, I'm not sure. There may be. They can

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       create what's called the booze Isand Einstein condensate with lasers in a sense, trapping light and making it stop or doing really bizarre things. So they were looking at entanglement across, not just distances within a room, but I didn't know, I think they sent it on a loop at cern or at 60, 70, 80 miles, which, right. And so I started wondering myself again as like a professional amateur is not terribly good at any one thing. It's was like, well, wait a second. If, if, if you were to ask David Deutsch, she might just laugh this off as a ridiculous question, but if the Big Bang theory or if the big bang happened, as many people imagine it to have happened or, or think of too to have happened, is it possible that everything that we can see, hear, feel, touch is entangled? Like is, is there the possibility that everything is entangled anyway?

Speaker 3:          00:24:31       That's a question that I think about, but I've never asked a physicist. I'm not sure. Not, not in the, well my gut is not in the powerful way that the quantum theory takes advantage of it, but there is the possibility of, well first off, let me just, for those who don't know the experiment referring to, they sent two entangled photons down sort of opposing fiber optic rings and then when they were far apart from each other, like miles apart from each other, they would observe one and notice that the other resolve that state instantaneously at the same time. So in other words that there's this notion of quantum indeterminacy that you don't know whether it's a one or a zero or somewhere routine until you look at it, the moment you look at it, it changes the state. It's this really both strange and and provocatively provocative notion of the quantum physics.

Speaker 3:          00:25:15       And literally if you look at one of them over let's say on left field, you know, miles away, it'll instantaneously resolve the other one as well as if they were a single unit. And in fact you can't have, like you can't imagine information passing between them because it's faster than the speed of light that this is like it's at the exact same moment that these things resolve. Oh, I'm coming, I'm going to get out of my depth on the takeaway. I think the main takeaway that fascinated me, and maybe the hopefully every listener is we are just beginning to scratch the surface of understanding what these phenomenon are about and taking advantage of them in any useful way. Right. So usually quantum physicists literally for, you know, since the beginning of the field have been more theoretical than experimental, more a bit more theoretical than useful.

Speaker 3:          00:25:59       You know, it might you say, and I think the potential crashing of this onto business shores is potentially upon us where, uh, again, when we talk about it, let's say the power of deep learning, if you could build an artificial intelligence broadly defined of any kind is simple one that plays games or a simple one that recognizes cancer in, you know, pathology slides or recognizes, uh, anything in an x ray in medical imaging sense. If you can do that better than anyone else on earth, that's a business opportunity. And that capability might start to lend itself to those who have the cutting edge of computation. And in the past, anyone could buy a computer and catch up with, you know, someone who has another computer. It was a commodity, right? I just, we'll just go buy some more computers myself. But what if the practitioners of this sort of field are so esoteric, limited that there's only a handful of companies that know how to do powerful computing.

Speaker 3:          00:26:48       That's kind of a worrisome feature, potentially. Not to dedicate too much time to worry some futures, but what, what do you see as the most likely existential or greatest existential risks to humans, animals, people, things on this planet? Oh, I think it'd be very different for humans, animals and things. Let's talk about that. Yeah. Because I think there's all kinds of things we can do to hurt ourselves that nature won't have any problem with. And all these like March right along the cockroaches will still be out there, uh, for many years. Um, since my cockroach audience is still very small, we'll go with humans. They're incredible creatures. They're going how they're going to laugh through a lot. So, um, I worry about the way in which cultural evolution is, while it's progressing, it's not progressing fast enough and we as a society are going through more rapid and gut wrenching change of various sorts that we may or may not be prepared to handle.

Speaker 3:          00:27:43       So, for example, we may be in the midst, I would argue, have a ever accelerating rich poor gap that politicians and policymakers just don't have their head around and could lead to a future of abundance is Peter Diamandis writes about where everything's great because physical things are so inexpensive that even the poorest of the poor can live like kings of just a few years prior. Um, but I think the cultural, um, in a sense set up for this is not necessarily right, which is we don't have a lot of people thinking about it. Whether it's, you know, how will, let's say 10 years from now, 20 years now we provide for basic human needs globally. Is it going to be normal capitalism in a democracy? Is that going to work just fine for everyone or will it be some that are horribly left behind? And I think, um, social unrest is something that worries me more and more, I guess in, in a succinct way.

Speaker 3:          00:28:33       Um, there are other things I've been involved with a nonprofit looking for, you know, astroid defense. That's an existential threat of another kind that's easily addressed. I mean for you know, less than $400 million, you could take that one off the table. So hopefully that will happen. Um, pandemic flu or bioterrorism, pause for a second. So take it off the table by Oh, so somehow destroying the nose. It key is just detecting them long before they hit her. It's so unlike the movies Armageddon or deep impact, you don't want to wait until final approach to try and do anything about it seems like a good breaking it apart. It turns a bolt until shotgun shell like it's way too late. What you want to do, and it's actually, this is what's so interesting is for the first time ever we can put satellites up that had these infrared sensors that can detect these objects at great distances and track them and we have enough computational power to from a couple of them, a lot from three observation points, model out the inbody problem of what will the next hundred years of this object's orbit look like and will it hit earth at any point in the next hundred years?

Speaker 3:          00:29:28       So that that is a computationally complex thing we can do today. So putting up one of those satellites in a near Venus orbit, looking out to capture all the threads to earth we could do today with less budget than some museums have. Right. And the key then is when you see something that will hit earth, let's say 50 years from now or 30 years from now, you just bump it. All you have to do is like give it the slightest little Delta v today and all of its orbits around the Sun. By the time it eventually intersects with earth, it's in a totally different place and we can computationally no, yeah he was rear ended by a tiny bit or hit it head on by a tiny bit and then you're done. Right. Problem solved. Wow. But you need time on your side that it takes years for that tiny nudge to accumulate enough distance delta that you miss something as big as earth.

Speaker 3:          00:30:09       So interrupted. I think your segue to bioterrorism, bioterrorism worried me a lot post nine 11 cause I realized looking into it and from investments I'd made that it's increasingly becoming the case that a small number of people in fact individual with let's say a college education in this field could build weapons of mass destruction. It used to take armies, it used to take, you know, despots and fascist leaders of countries and resources of countries to wield a weapon of mass destruction to build going to the CRISPR gene editing, things like that. Yeah, exactly. So, you know, synthesizing smallpox, you know, weaponizing it, doing something like in injecting the interleukin four gene, which makes it incredibly deadly in, in mouse pox. Pox viruses affect all organisms that get to a certain concentration level and the planet. So aunts, dear, anything that live in dense areas, chickenpox develop a unique pox virus for that thing.

Speaker 3:          00:30:56       It's kind of nature's way of telling you there's way too many of you people on this planet than the um, they can be bio engineered like crazy. And this worried me because when I spoke to people in various government agencies who spend their time modeling and doing red team simulations of bioterrorism outbreaks, there only answer at the time was, well, we hope they wouldn't do this. I just kind of like a leap of faith that this is such a horrible thing to wield that that people would stop short. And at the time I, they gave me no comfort and as time passes, I'm actually think there is an element of truth to that. That's not the kind of thing that typical terrorist cell can get someone fired up about it. There is a weird thing, even within the worst, if whatever we put in quote marks, worst parts of societal, uh, troublemakers, if you will, on the planet where this isn't a place they tend to go, right?

Speaker 3:          00:31:40       Flying a plane in a building is more natural vector of getting attention for your mission and getting someone to volunteer for the duty than saying, oh, I'm going to go kill a bunch of innocent people. You know, with, with a contagious agent, it's kind of weird cross product of a threat. How did you convince yourself of that? Why am I worried about it too? Okay. Yeah. It's on my top three list of worries. Yeah. What are the others? Um, let's see. Let's see. The inequality slash unrest. Um, bioterrorism. Oh shoot. What is my other one? Uh, well, climate change of course. Oh my God. Climate Change. She said the thing about climate change that worries me is the things I didn't know. I'll give one example. Last week I learned of a new thing that I really didn't learn to worry about until last week, which is of all places out of NASA ames, the former director was telling me they'd been doing these interesting studies trying to figure out how can we induce hibernation and mammals, which for interstellar travel would be great.

Speaker 3:          00:32:28       You know, then the movies, the human, somehow I'll go into hibernation mode, right? And then all in all the movies we see, and then we're doing studies with rats and they could actually get rats to hibernate for two days at a time by exposing to the hydrogen sulfide. And that immediately led me to ask, well, wait, why is that adaptive? I owed, we have this sort of latent pathway that really doesn't seem useful for anything that puts rats to sleep for two days at a time and they would die if it was longer than that and it turned out back. One of the major extinction events, and I'll try to be more concise here than I might otherwise be. If there was a major volcanic, we have plenty of numbers. It led to major climate change and the polar ice caps melted a greenhouse gas greenhouse effect in the palm of the ice caps melting.

Speaker 3:          00:33:06       Wasn't that sea level levels Rose Rose that just affects Bangladesh, Miami and Yup, but it doesn't take out humanity if sea levels rise, the thing that could take out humanity is it's the ocean current start, stop going and part of that was driven by a freshwater or melt off the pulse. So potentially long before the polls are completely gone or perhaps completely unrelated, the temperature change. If the ocean stops circulating, you get this complete dead zones where there's organisms depend on the circulation of nutrients to survive and basically purple and brown bacteria took over and they are these hydrogen sulfide is, you'd have these waves usually coupled up to two days at a time of just literally lethal gasses sweeping across the landscape that the survivors learn how to hibernate through. It's an a long winded way. The thing that both was both interesting, like maybe here's a hint of how we can induce hibernation and mammals like humans, but also a reminder that we've had climate change many times in this planet.

Speaker 3:          00:34:00       And really bad things can happen that have nothing to do with carbon or methane or all the things we're focused on. Uh, it could be the hydrogen sulfide gas that kills us, which is the rotten smell of eggs. You know, you'll, you'll see, you know, it's nasty stuff on the social and recipes and just because I know there are many people out listening who will be wondering this, what do you see as the preventative steps, if any, that can be taken to mitigate that risk? Yeah. So first I was looking at it like, well, does it feel like it's self correcting? Is it self rectifying? Is there something that's a natural governing feedback loop, a negative feedback loop that says, well, the rich get richer. Is there something that naturally makes that not continue further? And unfortunately there's a lot of positive feedback loops, not in the, uh, not in the sort of normative sense, but in just a regulatory sense of it just there's a runaway thing, right?

Speaker 3:          00:34:50       Like runaway climate change and that is you can get, um, well, first off in is every business becomes an information business over time. Like when, what I mean by that is if the basis of competition, why is company a winning over company B? Is it the way they process information? Is it a software layer to their business that I think is rippling through every part of industry, whether it's the aerospace industry, the automotive industry, agriculture, right? It's not, oh, he worked harder. He was an artisan in his field. That's why he's a better farmer. Or She, it's, oh no, he's got better genes, scripts from Monsanto or whoever. And the basis of competition. Agriculture's moved to information tech as every industry goes that way, those industries will start to look more like where do you see Google and Facebook a winner take all kind of dynamic where eat between firms, you have very few winners and within firms you have very few winners, so at every fractal scale it's kind of like a winner take all.

Speaker 3:          00:35:39       There's a few people within these firms that Garner most of the wealth and there's few companies that Garner most of the wealth in each industry. Now that's perhaps so that trend is somewhat negative in that technology takes over more and more. It didn't innovates more and more of the economy. It subsumes or eats the world, if you will, that I think it'll be a side effect. One other side effect that's negative is people sometimes reject maternity when they can't keep up. Like you sometimes subscribe to a different belief system, not science and math is the progress of vector of humanity. It's like, I'm going to reject science, I'm going to reject math. And there's entire countries that are taking this stance, which is scary because they'll fall farther, farther behind perhaps with an inability to catch up to maternity when and if they choose to.

Speaker 3:          00:36:18       So that worries me. The only current quote, negative feedback loop thing that prevents welcoming from completely crazy is that luckily, and I think maybe understandably, um, the wealthiest tech entrepreneurs tend not to live like rock stars and you know, are rap stars in, in La. They tend to give back in a simple explanation for me, having seen many of these people before they made billions of dollars and after is that if you've made goings at dollars and let's say under five years, you don't tend to ascribe that to your incredible hard work and superior intelligence, right? It is a farce, right? To hold onto the belief that I am better than others. That's why I'm a billionaire. And so they give back like in droves. I like incredible acts of philanthropy. And so right now the philanthropy, um, governor is the one thing I see that's at least a positive that says, well, maybe this actually will allow people like gates and others to take on multi year quests, like eradicating malaria or polio, now polio and next malaria in a way that governments can't even take on, right?

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       You have projects that exceed the budget of the GDP of nations. You have projects that exceed the lifespan of any politician. And luckily this is what these people are choosing to do rather than just show off. Right? Uh, and so I'm really happy about that. Um, and I'm trying to live my life that way as well. So the question of going forward is there's a lot of debates about basic income, universal basic income and experiments that are trying to get funded to see if it works the way people think it might. Um, I think there could be all kinds of experiments in almost corporate health plans writ large. So right now most companies in the more than a thousand employees, we'll manage the health plan of care in place. It's cheaper than going to a third party, like I will actually pay for your healthcare because let me paying some third party, you know, they're just making money off that and I've got enough critical mass with a thousand employees.

Speaker 3:          00:37:59       Does that make sense? Well, imagine food, shelter, clothing and healthcare are all equally cheap. Meaning everything costs a dollar a pound in the world. That's a physical thing. That's, that's where we're heading in the end point was all physical things should be the same cost bag of potatoes, dollar, pound, bag of chips, dollar pound. Why Heart? Because, um, and, and then what you'll pay for is the software, the intellectual property, the thing that that in certain places could lock up the mail. Maybe that Ferrari costs more because it's the design, not the materials, but it's just manufacturing methods are all converging. Whether you think of it as additive manufacturing or just traditional manufacturing, that stuff is not the rare commodity you pay for intellectual content like entertainment and software. It's like that's what all feature Connie's will based on in physical stuff's all at the same.

Speaker 3:          00:38:39       What are the means of manufacturer? Well, we're going to grow things. I think increasingly in the future I think we're going to grow, uh, with algae and other things, chemicals like so we think much sheer, you know, metric tons of stuff, you know, liquid chemicals is a big part of it and we get all, almost all that 90 plus percent from oil today and the petrochemical economy, it's all going to shift to renewables. And so that sort of manufacturing stuff like the stuff that goes into plastics, which is more and more of the physical world that we're in. Um, obviously metals will still come from, you know, no, unfortunately metal sources, but, um, I think we'll shift to carbon and other kinds of materials increasingly for structural stuff. Um, this is potentially in the, the nanotech slash carbon economy of the future that, you know, building things out of carbon nanotube like structures and meshes is just a much lighter materials, uh, sort of effective and efficient way of doing things.

Speaker 3:          00:39:29       So we can look to nature. And how does a spider silk thread outperform on almost any other modern material and like white, there are startups that are building synthetic silk. Now with these old nano machines that reproduce the, what the spinner, it doesn't a spider so across it, but just coming back to just this inequality point, uh, in, in the corporate path potentially there. Um, or it could be like a peace corps equivalent that says if you work for x number of years, you get healthcare in theory for a longer period of time. Right? In, why couldn't that start to subsume the way some companies already provide lunch for free? Why couldn't in a sense, basic food, shelter, clothing and healthcare, the provided for free and the health care part, by the way right now is a huge part of the economy. But it shouldn't be right?

Speaker 3:          00:40:12       I think we're also, and this is something I want to invest in, um, we're going to find a way to make the information search of health free so we don't have to pay for the diagnosis. And I can't imagine a future where knowing what I need to do to make myself healthy, it would be something I'd pay for it. The actual doing, if it involves surgery, maybe the pills, they should all be in dollar a pound and the physical thing and that future. I think we'll be incredibly enabling for changing society to a stable and we don't fear for the health of your children or their ability to live. Then you could have almost like a renaissance where you pursue the things that are meaningful to you, whether it's poetry or science or what have you. Meaningful work online. People do this all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:40:50       We spend a ridiculous amount of our time on things that aren't paid right, but are meaningful to us. And that I think increasingly is what the world will look like in the future. And meaningful work and contributions, not a job in the traditional sense. If the pills are dollar pound is the, how do you maintain the ability to develop and innovate those drugs? Is it just because the computational power become so inexpensive that you have then, uh, competitors to the current incumbents who of course, hi incentivize to protect. Exactly. It's the long run has because you, you, you can imagine any, any current phase or even long term, whether you call it transition phase or just this is how the new ones come to market as you have to reward of course, that effort in to the extent that effort is still as expensive as it is today, you would, you need to recoup it.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       Right? And that would be in the hills real property questions, sort of the, it's almost again, like the software of it. The, the generic manufacturers know how to make the drug. It's, but for law around intellectual property that it costs more. So the physical manufacturing is still gonna be a dollar found. And now the question is, is it priced as such? And so in my model of, of this, you'd start with the generics and um, and have this massive distribution channel. Like, if you want to reach a billion people, you know, you can sign on to this platform for the, you know, the poorest of the poor and reach a billion people, had some sort of reasonable costs position for a generic. But I think the cost of discovery will also come down back to the computation and the one quantum chemistry side so that it doesn't need to take so long and be so expensive.

Speaker 3:          00:42:12       And right now you have an FDA regulatory system that's a bit archaic in that regard where they aren't quite set up yet and they're trying to transition, but they're slow at this into a world where you have personalized medicine in a world where my medicine is different than yours and therefore the clinical trial concept really changes. Right. So we've been talking mostly, uh, current, Rsa Present and future tense. I want to go back to that two and a half years. Oh, sure. Undergrad. How does, how does such a thing happen? Well, I mean, how's that possible? It's interesting. I took it as a challenge when I started at college. I was going to Stanford and I realized it was expensive and my folks are immigrants from Estonia and I kind of found it difficult and we were middle class people at the time. So I didn't get financial aid and I was looking at this, I'm like, you know, this costs a lot.

Speaker 3:          00:43:00       I just felt guilt. So I looked at the various rules for graduation and it felt like a simple system of equations like this plus that equal to this was like, I actually boil it down to, oh I see. They're just trying to get four years of tuition Nadia, so what, where can I explore the corner cases? And so I came in with the maximum number AP credits. So it actually goes back to my high school saint Mark's in Dallas. That incredibly well prepared me for college. So I took the maximum number of AP units that I could. But of course universities limit, not surprisingly, how much of that applies. I also took a couple of summer classes that I could transfer in from another school. They'd have a certain number you could do. I Max that out one summer. While I was doing summer jobs at hps, it took a night classes.

Speaker 3:          00:43:39       But most of all I got learned a trick from the Grad students. This is the key answer actually. Um, by the time you get to be a Grad student, you realize that you're limited to something like nine units a quarter. And that's kind of limiting the, if you take five minute classes, well shoot, you know, you're taking class in half. So what they realized is you can sign up for a class for less units than it's listed, just not more. So the check sum on the computer algorithm was not, did you say it's a five unit class and it's or say at six and it's the only five. It's you know, is it that or or less. So you can just say it's a even a zero unit class or one you use and make it whatever you want. So you aren't taking more than 20 minutes a quarter.

Speaker 3:          00:44:12       So you meet that algorithm yet you've got all the prerequisite classes you needed for the next one. He had to look, you have to map this out early on, right? You have to start freshman year to make this work. Oh. And I had to get a physics teacher to let me take a class and a teacher sort of against the prerequisites and look, I really can do this. Let me, let me try to take your class a year earlier than I should so that I could get the prereq chain going. So there's all these simultaneous equations you have to solve. But the signing up for more classes with the key, there was like one winter quarter when I took the Quillon of eight classes where you'd normally take a load of four, um, that made that possible. So when did it, if it did, when did the budgeting stop being a concern because you then went on to continue your schooling, right?

Speaker 3:          00:44:54       It'll flip completely total mode shift. When I started my master's program and I became a research assistant and cause I paid for school. Uh, so the moms that HP at HP, I started a master's in which engineering? Right? So it's Phil at Stanford and I see that was a research assistant professor, Hennessy, who went, who went on to do amazing things there and was an entrepreneur himself. Um, at one point. And, uh, and I shifted gears. I didn't want to leave school. I mean like going through two and half years. The problem is like, wow, I kind of missed out on a lot of the social life and like living. Um, and so I basically at that point stretched down and try to stay as long as I could. Got a balloon payment. It's Kinda funny how incentives change. Yeah. Now I want to stay, I don't want to leave.

Speaker 3:          00:45:33       Right. And I found a way to be in the freshman dorms as a Grad student, which is awesome as a computer coordinator there, which meant I kept the computers running and kept the paper in the printers. But man, I could have sort of freshman dorm life all over again as a Grad student. And that was fun. Uh, so if we look then at your masters, and I suppose it would have been, maybe it was simultaneous, but if or after you could tell us the NBA since all that came later that came later. So the NBA, why did you decide to get an Mba and if would you do it again? If, why or why not? A lot of folks who I knew and know or asking that same question and I think, uh, it's, I think it's a challenge a lot of higher ed is facing, which is, is this a vocational thing?

Speaker 3:          00:46:19       Is this mean one unusual thing about business school, it's the only educational program I know of where everyone comes in with prior work experience, you know, even law school and Med school and what have you, you know, you're just going straight in from undergrad. And so it's got a very different kind of feel to it that way. And then people might ask, especially when there's something like a.com boom going on in the 90s. Do I want to step out for a couple of years from the economy and miss maybe that window, that opportunity that might be so ripe. So the main reason I went is a networking really to uh, expand the, uh, the sort of an end to learn frankly, um, two x, but the networking came first to mind to meet a bunch of people who've come from all kinds of different backgrounds that I could learn from, uh, not only at school but throughout my life.

Speaker 3:          00:47:00       And one of the sub points on that is, for example, pretty basic questions like, what do I want to do in my life? I had bounced around from engineering to management consulting prior to business school and thought, well, from what I know today, I'd maybe want to go to product marketing. I thought that's what I wanted to do. I don't know. I don't know anyone that's done that. They know. And, well, if I've got a business goal in winter where I want to look, there's going to be plenty of students who've done that in the past and they're looking to do something new. And so you get all the, of all the consultants generally to consulting, you know, all the, you know, I bankers trying to leave I banking and learn about something new. Um, what better place. And then especially with your employer hoping to leave his bang for it.

Speaker 3:          00:47:36       Exactly. That's exactly right. In fact, that's exactly what happened to me. I was financed by my former employer, so I had that sort of safety net. And then when I decided not to go back, I had to pay for all my tuition in one on one check. That was don't let that one go that you have a, it's a loan. And I mean, rightly so. I didn't expect to get a free ride and not go back. But, um, but it did raise a barrier to leaving. Um, oh, the other thing is learning. I mean, I should, it should go. I mean the business was not what I went to learn per se. I knew there'd be some classes about business that I thought would be helpful, but I'd done so much at Bain that I kind of had a small business degree already. And I taken the classes back when I was an Undergrad and a Grad student prior in accounting and finance.

Speaker 3:          00:48:15       So I'd already taken a lot of, again, the core courses I placed out of every core course at business school too. And, and went right into the sort of the electives and the more interesting classes. But I also knew that it was an opportunity to take classes in other departments, you know, to brush up on actually the molecular stimulation of all things. And one of the classes I took was on modeling, you know, quantum mechanical properties of materials. Like you normally don't get to take a class like that. Um, and, and that really all played out. So it gave me, so did it do what I expected? In a way it did. I didn't know a venture capital existed when I grew up in Texas. I'd heard the term, I never met a venture capitalist. Never knew anything about them. Didn't, wouldn't know how to reach one.

Speaker 3:          00:48:53       No idea. Right now man, I grew up there wasn't internet, so like they literally would not know how to reach one. They're not in the phone book and you know, there's no way to find them. Um, they really aren't putting up billboards or advertising in any way. So, um, the entire transition, the venture occurred because of people I met there and got a good location for it too. That's true in the middle of Silicon Valley. That's true. Yeah. And that was the only school I applied to by the way. You think about it. Do you want to go visit school? I did not apply to any other school because there was another school that would have met that goal. Right, right. So, uh, uh, and also I learned a lot and the network back to the network, uh, almost every investment I made, I think it was almost for the first year or two out of business goal.

Speaker 3:          00:49:30       And that was a lot because it's middle of the.com boom. For me had some business will connection. It was either literally entrepreneurs were from business school or it was sent to me by a professor from that business school or like do like for the first year. That's how I jump started. Everything I did and I don't know. So my madness slash method is usually, uh, not chronological sewer charge. Uh, we're going to zoom out a little bit. What mistakes do you see otherwise? Very smart venture capitalists making? Are there any patterns? Are there any particular types of mistakes? Could be investors broadly speaking, but yeah. Oh my God, tons all over the place. And to be fair, uh, I'll try to drop in and mention when I made those same mistakes. So I by no means I'm trying to judge as if I know better.

Speaker 3:          00:50:15       Um, but two that jump to mind. One is way too many seem to be a of loss avoidance or fearful and I'll come, I'll elaborate that in a moment. And then, but the other one that jumps to mind equally is, um, they think that they've hit upon the only formula for success. And, yeah, that has many different levels at which that's worry something. So the first one, um, this notion that of being fear driven, I've come across so many investors who will say something like, well, we have a strategy to try not to try not to lose any company as if that's like we're in the trenches. You know, every company will succeed. And if you've just been at this game for a few decades, you'll realize that's just folly, right? The earlier ego, the higher your death rate's going to be a startup, the majority will fail.

Speaker 3:          00:50:59       Just give them time. And that's sad. Reality took awhile to sink in for some, but until it does, you're going to be very timid in your investing. So most investors I see just let all of the biggest home runs passed them by, uh, almost every term sheet I've written to a company that's turned out to be a spectacular home run. I had no competition at the time of the series. It was kidding. Like nobody else would invest in the company. What would the reasons for not investing? Oh yeah, it's crazy. Uh, it's way too early. It's a science project, no traction home. Yeah, there's no product. I mean, so, um, so first off, I almost everything I'm doing, there's no product, no customers yet. It's an idea. It's in prototype, stage of development or there's no even prototype yet or they just don't agree the world is going to change in this way.

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       So, uh, and in often cases, conventional wisdom would support their point of view. Like let's not invest in any automotive company because every investment, since Henry Ford has filled like 100% of them that are just roadkill scattered on the highway and there's been, but it's, by the way, many, many startups funded well over $10 million, you know, so it was like back, you know, decades ago. That's a lot of money. And the automotive sector, all of which have failed, um, many and batteries, many and solar, I mean just, just scores. I mean maybe hundreds of companies that failed. So when you've, let's say lost four times in a row, you just give up on the category. So sometimes it's the more experience grizzled investors like, well that whole sector, I'm just going to like steer clear of it because I'm too many scar tissues neither. Um, but that's not really the thing I'm talking to think about, you know, new entrance to the venture business people who you would think would take a strategy of differentiating myself from my peers and a bait like having a basic strategy.

Speaker 3:          00:52:29       Let's say they say, why would an entrepreneur want to work with me versus all the other firms? And if it's like, well, I'm investing in the hot sector, pick whatever it is, dishwasher, you know, consumer internet or social this or you know, blockchain that it's like, well it's the hot thing. Well, yeah, but this is also a hundred other people who had the exact same idea you just did. It's the hot things. Like why are you different? And there's like no answer. Right? So, um, this, this lack of strategic thinking about a, and also lack of thinking of, of, of, of a longterm strategy. Like, okay, whatever you're doing today was that, is that going to work 10 years from now? Whatever that strategy is and like I don't hear strategy from anyone. Like okay, here's how I'm going to stand out over a sustained period of time.

Speaker 3:          00:53:05       Here's how I will, um, you know, either, and it can be simple things like I'll have a niche, I'll only do x, Y, Z and there'll be known for my niche or my specialty. What worked for you in the early days when you're just getting started? It was um, well first it was a stroke of great luck, which is the.com boom as we now call it, you know, was just starting to happen and was ready for that and open minded enough. So I didn't have the scar tissue, which is by the way, scar tissue for traditional investors was if you invest in anything, it was like entertainment or media or shrink wrap software as they called it, which is low price software for consumers. That would be the consumer software segment. But it was just a horrible place and games hits driven business. It still is a horrible segment is to do non Internet consumer price points stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:53:50       I just said that zone. So they thought the Internet was that they didn't realize it's an entirely different business model. The whole what we now know around cloud computing, around subscription services, around viral marketing, its potential. None of this was known at the beginning. And if you put it into a prior bucket, it would be all those are bad sectors. So unbelievably one of the biggest investment opportunities probably the venture industry has ever seen was a largely avoided by most venture capital firms. And when I started in 1995 we did about a third of all internet investing industry wide. Wow. Like the entire venture industry. And that quickly changed in [inaudible] 86 87 and excuse me, 96 [inaudible] 97 and when Netscape at its IPO, boom, everything changed because now there was know example of a winter, this pattern will come again and space investing in everything.

Speaker 3:          00:54:29       Like as soon as you have a single winner, then the sheep phenomenon in the herd mentality kicks in, right? So you have scores of people and then investing in the sector after he's had his first one. So to your question, um, being under the tutelage of Tim draper to say, Hey, actually let's try to think big. I mean I credit him for being my mentor into the industry to say not, let's think about it the way bankers do. Let's not be fearful. Let's ask the entrepreneur how they're underestimating the market size to think how much bigger might this opportunity be. Then even the people pitching it or imagining that's a thought experiment I often like to go through and there'll be times when the occasional, not often where I'll be like, wow, you are so underselling your opportunity. Cause normally I, I'm just trying to sell to the maximum extent possible to predict the largest possible addressable market to think, well phase one of my business, I do this.

Speaker 3:          00:55:16       Then phase two I take over the world in some way, right? And then to actually try to push them further and then want to invest in them, you know, is an interesting adjunct because then they know you're on the same page. So I, so I credit Tim draper, I could at the Internet. And then most importantly, um, is there's a, there was a simple rule. I started implementing it and I don't remember when it started. It just seemed like the natural thing to do, um, around early stage investing. So when I thought about this, I was like, okay, most things fail. If they, when they've got to be huge, okay, check. They should change the world. They should be disruptive. You know, those are words people use. Well, how would I know if something really is big and disruptive? Like, Oh, everyone, everyone entrepreneur claims it, right?

Speaker 3:          00:55:54       Like he'd be doing a payment processing thing for backend, whatever, you know, payroll systems. Like we're going to change the world of payroll. Right. Okay. What really is going to make an enormous opportunity is, it seemed to me that a, they're describing an enormous market, but B, here's the killer. No one else has done it before. Like instill the simple rule I've used throughout my entire career investing is I wanna invest in things that are unlike anything I've seen before. And there's all kinds of correlates to come out of that. The first is, yeah, you're investing in some unusual things like d wave, you know, back in 2002, there were no other quantum computer startups, zero on the planet earth. There was not a single company claiming to build a quantum computer, big or small actually for about five years afterwards as well. So that one is like the most extreme like well maybe for good reasons.

Speaker 3:          00:56:34       No one was doing it back then when hotmail first came. There's nothing like it that we'd seen when I first invested in Skype. There was anything quite like that. The, the, the way they did peer to peer voiceover Ip. Um, as similarly with Tesla, an electric vehicles. And I can get it to why that one maybe is the most corner case of we'll wait. There are a lot of electric car startups. Why is that one specialty? And we can talk about it, but certainly space x, you know, who would qualify as well as unique ideas at the time in the startup domain. And, but the benefit for my career was it has me perpetually searching for the next great technology wave. So just when the.com boom was getting to it's fevered pitch, I wasn't smart enough. I know that this is a kid. I wasn't not smart enough to predict a crash.

Speaker 3:          00:57:13       I know that it wasn't cause I was contributing in writings and other things at that time saying well it's a boom is just starting, it's going to go up, up, up, up. Right. I believe that because I just want to do that. It's going to keep going and then we wouldn't have like a correction. Um, but on the other hand, I was not finding anything unique. I sought for business plans for selling pantyhose on the web. Like all we're going to do cause l.com that venture back like, like three others. Like really like for business plans to sell pantyhose or just balls.com and like, Oh God, what is just balls do? Oh yeah, just balls. Venture backed just sells false. The name was awesome. We got just false. Come. What do we sell balls? You want to bat? No. You want a glove? No, we got balls, balls and all kinds of small balls.

Speaker 3:          00:57:50       Big Balls, golf balls, tennis balls. Wait a second, where were you? A founder? No. Okay. Just making sure. But this shows you how absurd it got to say. Take the economy and like the Internet changes everything. We're going to like divide up the economy in weird ways that hasn't been divided up before and make that a business. Like that's when I knew this is crazy and I started investing in nanotechnology. I total left field shift. Um, and there's a reason I picked that particular sector. But the important point is I didn't keep investing in the Internet companies long past their prime. Not because I was smart on when the correction would come, but because they weren't unique anymore. There's like every viral marketing idea that I at the time that I could find had come now to my, so I avoided a lot of pain.

Speaker 3:          00:58:27       We love, we like if you add up every internet, remember we did so many of them. If you had every internet company we invested in that lost money, add them all up. It was less than single deals, lost from other firms like [inaudible] dot com lost more money than everything we've ever done combined because we didn't load up the boat, sort of drink our own koolaid too deep in any one of them. And we were, every one of them was unique so there wasn't like this sector risk. So you get diversification for frequent, I definition your diversified portfolio and it had any movement and has been throughout my career always on lookout to learn something new, knowing that I'm going to have to hop to new sector, not saying going to spend my whole life as a semi conductor investor or as a consumer software investor because that is so limiting.

Speaker 3:          00:59:04       Yeah. Right. That might have a good 10 year run, but if you're not continually learning something new at the edge is pivoting from the edges of what you already know, just something slightly different. You're going to be constantly, why did you choose now the technology that was a bit of a mistake, but um, it was a mistake in retrospect. Um, but it's the only thing I felt I differentially knew better than others. It was hearkening back to which, which, which fortunately it wasn't that many years prior that I had been studying some really hard technologies like molecular modeling and you know, chip design. It did some chip design it at Hewlett Packard. So I had enough as I looked at the venture landscape differential knowledge air to say, well, there's something I could Harken back to that's not the internet because the Internet anyone could do at this point.

Speaker 3:          00:59:48       Right. And the angel investors to flooding in like, you know, every banker, consultants flooding is like the landscape littered with capital and people investing in that sector. Well, there's nothing, we're not in nanotech. I had been, uh, exploring at the foresight institute a number of other sort of think tank like conferences that the radical potential has had to revolutionize a bunch of things. And the one part that I think was indicative of what's to come later in my career, it was not really an end in any way an industry. It isn't a sector, it doesn't describe a company. There's no such thing as a nanotech company unless you're building tools to service that industry. You know in a weird way, manufacturing equipment maybe now, but not any attractive sectors. It more was a set of science and technology capabilities that would strap across many industries, so even today there'll be companies that will meet with and things that were unique in that from that era will play out like well the value of simulation on any molecular system.

Speaker 3:          01:00:41       Like, well how, how good is your simulation? I need physical thing. You're building in general these questions or process questions like like how do you do innovation? How do you do entrepreneurship? That carries through, but that platform technology, which, let me just tell you what I'm, what I mean by this. Nano tech was like a platform applied to men or ears, new ways of doing material science if you will. Then there's this whole field of synthetic biology, like if you can manipulate DNA with CRISPR or other technologies, what are all the things you could do with that capability and it's very broad. It's not just health and food and then more recently deep learning neural networks, what we might describe as narrow AI. That whole field is widely applicable. I think every company will use it eventually. So again, we can come to that later.

Speaker 3:          01:01:23       But that's like a platform that's not they other shirt today there was some quote machine learning companies, all they do is stuff related to machine learning. But much more interesting is all of the industries that will be changed by the use of machine learning, the vertical industries. Um, and so yeah, to put it, to put a cap on it and nanotech you know, if you look, think, look back at it today, well no there isn't any now tech industry, it'd be like saying, well where's the thermodynamics industry? Well Shit, you know, version one right bit the sort of is like thermodynamics as a concept. You know, there was a time when actually companies named themselves thermo electron and you know, through medics there were all these ones that it's just now subsumed into the fabric of science and engineering. So as a geek, I've always been fascinated.

Speaker 3:          01:02:03       Are there see changes in basically how we do science and engineering? Maybe that's the simplest way of saying it. And I think today deep learning is the best example that a fundamentally different way of doing engineering. So that one more time. The loss of, of fundamental. So I think deep learning, or let me just call it machine learning cause there's a bunch of sub branches. This is everything from generative design in, in, in, in sort of the autodesk cad, Cam Sands. It's, you know, it's, it's studying seller Tom. By the way. Steve Wolff from does its genetic proteins sell automata. Ah, these are simple little, a simple little, a mathematical construct that just says if you're going to draw, oh my God, you're probably to edit this out of the final thing cause it's the, it may not relate to anything other than it created this book, a new kind of science and it really a series of epiphany's for Wolfrem and others that, that the world is really interesting when you look at iterative algorithms and applied millions and billions at times.

Speaker 3:          01:02:52       So seller trauma is just imagine you start with a random dot or two and then x line automaton. But with, yeah, it's sort of unveil. So you have this little simple rule, almost like a turning machine that says, I'm just going to go left to right and look at the dots above me. And if the dot above me, I'll look at the three dots about me, one directly above me left and to the right and based on all possibilities of those three dots, which is, you know, to the third power, um, uh, possibilities. I'll have either a daughter, not a.here. And so you would think that such a simple rule that just says, look at the three dots into, and there's literally only 16 possible things that I'm going to, you know, uh, uh, conditions that I could be seeing up there. Um, I'll have some other, you know, I'll do some something.

Speaker 3:          01:03:34       In most cases it's very boring. It's just like the whole thing is black or it's got like a nice pattern triangles. But in a few cases, like real 31, it unpacks into this incredible complexity that is not repeating. And there's no way to jump to, let's say the fourth, the fifth or the 50th, their hundredth Le Layer of this unfolding. You have to run the experiment. And the reason I find this so philosophically interesting is this is the same thing in evolution. It's the same thing in neural networks. It's the same thing. And all these new engineering modalities where you can't mathematically get a shortcut to the answer, you actually have to just run this little algorithm over. No, no, no her again. So you can't, like for example, you can't reverse evolve. You can't figure out where did we come from in any direct way.

Speaker 3:          01:04:15       It's sort of lost. You can run the tape forward, but you can't run it backwards. You can't do mathematical shortcut across it. And so an example of why this is as a thought experiment is important is whenever you're developing these neural networks, when you're, whenever you're training, let's say these little ais, and I think this is the path to AI in general. So it's important that this is how it works. You can't understand the thing you've made, nor can you predict as you train the further and further what you're going to get. There's a bit of discovery emergence, if you will. It's kind of like raising a teenager or parenting more than it is programming that you can learn about the process of creation. Like I know how to make a teenager, but I can't tell you exactly how it all works. Right. And I certainly can't go in there after I'm done and tweak a few neurons to make him smarter or French speaking or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:04:55       It's like, no, that's a really weird artifact that works really powerfully. But it's not purposeful design. It doesn't do what I tell it to do. Exactly. It can learn to do what I trained it to do. But you know, with some edge cases it's a little out of control and that's what I think the AI's of the future will look like. So I, I can come back to it if you want to talk about AI and deep learning, but I just, you asked about seller Tamida and the process learning. The key with this question started with his engineering, right? Yep. So they wanted, that I wanted to say is I think deep learning slash machine intelligence is the biggest advance in how we can do engineering. Specifically engineering since the scientific method itself. So can you weigh that gland engineering, I've been random like I think astrologists jewel, I think this is true.

Speaker 3:          01:05:39       And then you have the scientific method. You leased a method of compounding knowledge over time. This is a different way of innocence, growing solutions to problems instead of purposely designing them. But you can build things that exceed human understanding. We're doing this all over the place in molecular engineering, in software design and in a variety of fields. We have sort of reached the limit in many cases of what a human, any human or even group of humans can put their heads together and design and now we can push way past that and build things beyond our own understanding, which is pretty powerful. Yeah. Could you define, uh, just revisit, you might have already done it indirectly, but the deep learning and neural networks. Yeah, I guess I have sort of an approximate equal sign here. I'm not sure if like they're synonymous in the 80s. They call it neural networks and deep learning.

Speaker 3:          01:06:23       There is a reason the word deep Cayman. Well first you want a new name when something kind of came and went and let's pass a, you know, a couple of decades ago because I studied neural networks second eighties. Um, you know, I think of it a new moniker, but there is a reason deepen the sense of more layer. So what do they have in common? And in fact in general that works I think is could be a more generic term for all this. It's inspired by the brain. It's a way of simulating a brain like subsets. So not the whole brain. But imagine if you were to take a little tiny chunk of your brain, the cortical column or some area and say, well, what's really going on? Well, you have cells that connect to a bunch of others in our brain. It's usually a fan out of a thousand or so to 10,000 connections from each one.

Speaker 3:          01:07:01       So huge fan out. Each cell connects a whole bunch of others and when one fires it sort of goes down and write and then little synapse fires and it triggers another one. We all have some vague sense of, okay, neurons are in our brain and they, and they sort of wired together and they fire together. So now if you want to simulate one of those in a very simplistic way, in a way that you like imagined the programmers back in the eighties and I had pretty not very powerful computers, well how could you make a computer like brain? Well we don't need all that complexity. Maybe we don't need all the details of ion channels in synapses and, and all the neurotransmitter chemicals that are artifacts of our biology. What really is the essence of what's going on here? And the essence is something activates it, fires, it's connected in a network to some others.

Speaker 3:          01:07:40       And if there's enough, you know, inputs that are firing and beyond a threshold, then then downstream neuronal fire too. So the simple idea is if I, to recap is neurons fire. They're wired to other ones. You sum up all your inputs, everything that's connected on the input. There's like thousands of inputs. And if it crosses some threshold, then you fire. That's it. And then, then you just lay on tons of these. And so the deep learning is having more and more of these layers instead of just like one or two or three layers having scores of these layers and a variety of other algorithmic advances. But really the biggest breakthrough is has been that we have a lot of data today that we have back in the 80s from the Internet, from Mechanical Turk, you name it, all kinds of data sets to train on. Um, like if you want to pictures of cats with the label, that's a cat.

Speaker 3:          01:08:23       That's a dog. I mean that's obviously they would take it for granted. Like, oh, of course you want a million of those. You want to billion, how many pictures of cast? One right in the eighties. Good luck. You could spend your whole career trying to get a good data set to train these neural networks with them. Plus we didn't have digital cameras. I mean it's like, it's crazy if you think how little data we had an eighties. Okay, so data is the first. The other is, um, gps from nvidia. They started about 10 years ago. It wasn't a side project in scientific computing realizing abuse, right? So any gamer would be like, I want the latest to play my video games to do all these polygon renderings offloaded from your main computing chip, the Intel chip usually off on the side where it used to be a peripheral processor, a coprocessor, an afterthought if you will, that only gamers cared about if you were a business computing user, you in the old days in the 90s you didn't care about your Gpu, right?

Speaker 3:          01:09:08       And he only cared about was your CPU the thing that computes your excel spreadsheet or whatever your database. But the GPU people were like pushing a whole different kinds of computational math forward, which was on a lot of math. Like a lot of polygons. The more polygons, the more you know, sort of you know, resolution you have in your game. And so when a very exciting way with a different objective function, not do a program that a human wrote faster and faster, but take the same damn simple math of basically it turned out to be made what's called Matrix multiply. And add, multiply a whole bunch of numbers together and add them up, multiply, add them up. It's like that core multiple sort of mathematical operation. The more you could do, the better your graphics were. And so they had an economic incentive to really push the envelope where if you asked, let's say in the eighties or nineties, what else could that be used for it?

Speaker 3:          01:09:53       The answer was, well, nothing, right? That, that just does graphics, cds, I totally optimized for rendering graphics. Right? But somewhere along the way people realized, well, wait a second, there's other areas in the scientific community worldwide. By this I mean, let's say modeling the weather, you know, modeling how, you know, nuclear explosions occur in government labs where they were like, you know, we do a lot of that matrix multiply and add to can we try to see if we could use it? And so it was like a skunkworks project management had no resources against this. I knew actually one of the first four customers working on this r and d area of all things to model how neurons fire, um, scientific model model model. How Neuron Actually, oh, how actual biology of a neuron down to as much detail as possible coming to call it evolves machines.

Speaker 3:          01:10:32       And uh, they were using gps and I, and I remember years ago seeing, wait, you just bought for $2,000 at the local, we call it was Fry's and then Fry's electronics store. You just bought more power than any supercomputer of just two years ago for $2,000 because of this domain. Right? So this incredible computer resource was pushed to the limits from gaming. And I think almost poetically when you think about rendering three dimensional worlds in making the photorealistic, you're doing something our brain does exquisitely well, right? We get an avalanche of information on our retina, in our CORTEX and wheat down. Scale that to image recognition, building over there, your face, the symmetry of your eyes and, and, and much like a neural network when you train them. It recapitulates our biology, it builds edge detectors and then symmetry detectors. And then I face things and you, cause you can probe what's been built a little bit and get a sense, oh my God, it just recapitulated the sensory cortex in an artificial system.

Speaker 3:          01:11:26       That's when the recapitulated meaning recreate it from scratch. It's an analog, sorry. Cause you're just training it like a baby gets born, right. Opens its eyes, starts learning. Right, right. That's the same general thing going on with these neural networks. The fact that it has similar layers in his visual system as our babies do. But it's just like, that's when people like me like, oh my God, this is incredible. Right. So, um, back to, uh, the GPU thing, what I think is poetic is that something that in a sense is meant to be as realistic as possible to our vision system has the kind of computational systems we need to in fact do vision systems in like, let's do, let's recognize cats and internet or let's recognize cancer and a pathology slide that those general constructs occur because our brain has evolved to do data reduction and pattern recognition in the world in a way that is optimal for what we do. So that when we build these neural networks, what do they really good at? All the same stuff like, and so all the applications they are in like speech processing, visual processing, which is the simple stuff, the edge of our cortex. And then naturally it's gonna start moving into emotional systems and in the frontal lobe and the rest of our critical systems. And so that's why I think it's the obvious path to AI in the, in the broadest sense.

Speaker 2:          01:12:37       So many questions. Jay, the, I love that story for where that story slash explanation for a number of reasons. One is,

Speaker 4:          01:12:47       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:12:47       how careful one should be with dismissing certain fields or even if they seem trivial or a wait to be a waste of time like gaming, right. If you look at the byproduct of the incentives that drove that and then the off label uses of GP use our gps, I'm mistaken in thinking that they also have a role in a cryptocurrency mining.

Speaker 3:          01:13:10       Oh absolutely. Right. So the, the um, the, that's a very computationally intense task and so it moved definitely from until like CPU to GPU but then even went further than I went to these field programmable gateways. And then the custom chips designed from scratch and sort of it quickly went down that path and deep learning chips will as well. There was one of my investment themes the last few years is that deep learning is doing the exact same thing. Two custom chips. She mentioned something much earlier. One last thing on this. So you gotta take a Nvidia summarize something amazing and also out of Google did a paper, the majority of code at Google now is built by a computer, not by human. Cause that's one weird way of summarizing this is when you train a neural network, you're not coding, you know, if then else you're setting up the same thing you set up every time.

Speaker 3:          01:13:55       I mean that's to fungible. It's a very fungible skill set, by the way. And you train it and use the computers generating its own executable. At the end of the day, the majority of programming is that way now by by a factor of 10 so wild. Yeah. And every product that Google embodies it from search to you name it, it's like that is the key technological things. Striping across every Google product. So you're so excited by the science, by the engineering. You mentioned product manager while back and you did in fact do that for a period of time. Right. So Yep. What I've observed, not always, but very often at least did when I lived in Silicon Valley. Certainly that a lot of engineers have a severe disdain or at the very least a distaste for all things. Most things marketing related. Right, right. It's just, I remember that HP, just a bunch of like hand waving.

Speaker 3:          01:14:49       Yeah. The shyness them, I mean hell yeah. So many levels. So, so what, why did you, with the background, you have set your sights on product managing. Yeah, so I remember exactly how this happened. I was at I getting that right, product management, product marketing, product management, that's actually the word I was looking for. Sorry. In, in different firms use the terms differently, but I was open to both. Um, some cases it's more engineering rich, other cases, it's whatever. So when I was at HP, I was in chip design and marketing was in a different building as it often is. And I basically was getting frustrated even though it was not there very long on what I saw all around me, at least at HP, which was where promote from within culture, you know, over 20 years it'll become an engineering manager. And he's like, you know, most people, they were lifers as we call them.

Speaker 3:          01:15:35       And that seem kind of long. It's like I really, really dedicate the rest of my life to that career path. And then I was like, well, how can I accelerate this? And that's one of the first idea came off. I somewhat got into marketing and had, you know, it seemed like the boss has more than just one narrow functional domain. Like I mean, yeah, she gets an experience over there and then I'd be more of an engineering manager if I could know more than just my narrow bear end of engineering. I thought being in a dream manager was the end goal and learning a bit about marketing and product marketing because that was the mystery. Like how, how are all these decisions that seem to implicate, you know, the sort of impact our product development cycles and products it and canceled, you know, things succeeding or failing in the market.

Speaker 3:          01:16:09       That seemed important on, on what I was doing and not just didn't make a breakthrough. So I wasn't, I guess you could say I wasn't a scientist in my profession of well I'm just doing it to learn the best way to do something. I was engineering the through and through, which is I want to have an impact. I don't want to design a widget that's going to sit in a room and they will get used just cause I like to design widgets. It's like it really would love to have something to be meaningful in the world. And so that's why I thought about that. And yes, there was a big disdain for marketing, uh, amongst the engineers that I worked with and uh, and I did finally get the chance that that is, I wanted to work with Steve Jobs as well. So I got a chance to work at apple and next software it's called next is when they were moving out of the hardware business into the software only.

Speaker 3:          01:16:49       So, but next as it was called, um, and I would leave wasn't for me either though. Uh, I just didn't, some things just didn't click about. I think maybe in my short attention span and my interest in diverse things, uh, that hunkering down to any one thing in committing to do it for five years seemed anathema to my s my course. That's why I left the phd program after two quarters. And like I'm not going to write a thesis that's like, like spent four years on one little narrow area of actually neural networks would have been my thesis area, specifically neural networks and played the parallel processing computers was what I was starting down. Uh, I would have been fascinated by that but it would have been 20, 20 years too early. Um, anyway. Uh, same thing in any operating job. It's like I would be either job hopping the way some people do, um, who have this problem I have or I'd have to be on Hattie I think in my job cause it just the pace of change and learning would stagnate so quickly.

Speaker 3:          01:17:38       I could see these patterns over months, not years that like I'm not learning them as much anymore and they just executing the same thing over and over again. And so management consulting was an interesting way to play to that. And like all kinds of different client engagements, it just didn't have the same agency of making a meaningful impact. You could point to sure. Very vicarious, very diffused and ambiguous. Whether you've accomplished anything. And so that's why all the management solving from say we, you know, adding value all was talking about mad at and you're measuring how much value we added. All these things are being said because everyone knows in their heart and I can't tell them any value. How do I know if it was me or that it's usually then we can't really sing our own praises that much. So, um, so I love the diversity of management consulting.

Speaker 3:          01:18:17       I didn't like the life balance nor the agency. And so when, when finally I discovered venture capital and learned what it was about, it was like the perfect combination for me. Well, your investment, uh, or at least that facet of things you haven't seen the, the Lens of looking for things you haven't seen before. Right? That's where that also speaks right into that. Your programming, so to speak. You can see maybe that's the origin. I hadn't connected those dots. But it seems obvious now as I say this to you, that that desire to seek something new may have been a driver of that simple rule that I've been living my life by it, which is an injustice. Something that, uh, you haven't seen before. So when you, when you're looking at companies, and I am going to come back to Steve Jobs, I have some questions about Steve and Ilan.

Speaker 3:          01:18:58       I know you, you've spent a good amount of time both, uh, when you're looking at these companies that have no product, that are in the idea stage, I mean there may be some white papers or publications from think tanks or conference panels that discuss these subjects. Uh, how do you evaluate deals or how do you vet deals? Because I've seen a lot of people attempt to go as early as you do, but have just gotten their faces ripped off routinely. Right? So, yeah, I mean there's, there are and it particularly if you're trying to be bold, so not just invest at the early stage but also go for things that are, how are times, however many times out of 10 going to fail. Uh, how do you avoid running out of bankroll? Right. I mean I'd love to just hear a little bit about what you, what you look for in a situation like that at that embryonic stage.

Speaker 3:          01:20:00       What are the check boxes that help you to risk mitigate, if that's even a consideration though is um, well, sort of risk mitigation. Windex spray. Yeah. This is the last one. How many up cause but part of the luck I had in starting in the best dinner sort of economic boom for venture, you could imagine the.com boom, right? No small amounts of capital hello companies to scale incredibly rapidly. There wasn't really historical precedent for something that good for venture capital. So chock part of this up to luck. But the side effect then lasted is that I didn't have that fearful moment. I didn't slog through 10 years of just banging my head against the wall of failure, failure, failure, failure. It just was like shooting fish in a barrel to start, right? So that I think helped me a build enough track record that people would give me a bit more slack to pursue something right within my partnership, for example, to pursue ideas that, that I can't imagine what life would be like how I was stuck in a partnership that wouldn't give me credibility or let me run with some ideas.

Speaker 3:          01:20:52       Right. And they certainly would push back, believe me, Oh, space. The next bunch of companies like really you're going to doesn't rugged. So you kidding me? So I get, I'd have to defend some of these, but I didn't get the, no, no, no, you can't do this. Right. So that if I hadn't had that capacity to, in other words, to avoid the inner voice of doubt and the overt expert, a critic, right. And both internal and external, I don't think I could've done what I did in the, in the subsequent years. So, um, fast forward to let's say midway through my career into the present day. Um, so was the startup phase is a little different than the steady state. So now that we're in a steady state and I can realize, okay, there'll be some failures, that's fine in what I then look for is a combination of some personal attributes, marketing attributes and weirdly of late sort of process technology attributes.

Speaker 3:          01:21:39       So I would have in the past said, oh, technology breakthrough of course there has to be, you know, people, you know, huge market and something disruptive in the technology domain that didn't like to nanotechnology or something that like we couldn't have done this five years ago. Oh that's another question I always ask every entrepreneur either explicitly or implicitly if I know the answer I need to ask it, which is could you start this business five years ago? And if the answer is yes, then I don't want to invest. What are their questions? What are other questions? One I love to ask is, so what does this business look like in 10 years and 20 years out? And what is mind boggling is unfortunately how this weeds out the charlatans and the, you know, arbitrage seeking opportunities like nothing else. Or they just like deer in the headlights.

Speaker 3:          01:22:18       They never thought 10 years or 20 years old, they don't have any idea. And it's not because things change so rapidly that you can't predict 10 or 20 years so that they don't have a mission, they don't have a purpose for why they're starting their business. Right. If you ask Elon Musk that he knows right away, he has planet labs, he knows right away, yes Zuckerberg, he knows right away you ask Larry Page and Larry and Sergei Brin, they know right away what their business looks like in 10 and 20 years and they have a mission statement that they hold to throughout their entire life and it galvanizes the team. It motivates them to, you know, that's why they're in business. Other people that are, I call them arbitrize seekers, uh, when people flock from some industry cause there's gold in the hills, you want to weed that out, this is a great way to weed that out, right?

Speaker 3:          01:22:56       He's just, people don't tend to have long term visions if they don't really have a purpose for what they're doing. Um, so, uh, so on the people side, I increasingly have become enamored with purpose driven businesses as I was mentioning or mission driven businesses were making money is not the prime objective. It's the byproduct of the way they intend to change the world to usher in, you know, the transition to sustainable transport in clean energy to colonize Mars as a couple of easily understood examples. Those are both unique. There aren't any other startups at the time, you know, proposing that to colonize Mars. Um, nor is it something that you get done in a short period of time. It's like the star on the horizon that, that galvanizes so much action. Do you want me to look back though the to the, the overall categories, the process stuff and the other little and here about some of the attributes?

Speaker 3:          01:23:44       Yeah, sure. So on the market size, I think, I think a lot of venture investors in the early stage would have the following common answer to your question. I invest in good people pursuing big ideas in enormous markets. Right. Okay. Um, but sometimes they actually won't execute on that because enormous markets usually means that it's something really radical, that changing. There's a lot of unpredictability. So if you're investing in ride sharing as you did right before it was obviously a good idea. It was not obviously a good idea and most of them people probably thought it was a really bad idea. Well, there was a, there was an email that a naval Ravikant put up not too long ago, uh, which was the, the email that was sent out through Angel List, which was uh, ignored by something like 297 people out of 300. Exactly. It was not clearly a great idea actually.

Speaker 3:          01:24:33       I would say like when I first invested in Hotmail, I felt this, I felt that when we first invested in Skype side note really quickly, just cause I'm cheating, I'm cheating a little bit here and I didn't know this. Uh, where'd the name come from? How much? One. Oh, hot hotmail. Um, uh, it was spelled with a capital h. T m. L. So it was, oh, we're going to do web based email over html. It's getting big age smaller. Yeah, exactly. It was that Dorky and uh, that was it. Yeah. And even more interesting they, because they are offering free email, they put a lot of effort into the free aspect of this. So they located in Fremont, California on Liberty Avenue. They launched on the 4th of July, which is a national holiday. So they got no news pickup. Yeah, that's right. It's all free TV. So anyway, those companies were widely regarded as bad ideas.

Speaker 3:          01:25:23       Severe of hotmail famously was turned down by 21 venture capitalist before he found us. And I would say without a doubt, because I've met the number these venture people at the time, the series a was happening for Ebay and Google. The vast majority venture capitalists would not invested in series a. In fact, after the series they of Google that two primary investors demanded to get their money back. They want it to be redeemed at cost because of a little spat. They're having lots of founders not getting a new CEO, a not well known fact or one of the major venture investors. And apple sold their entire steak pre IPO. You know, they still brag about being an investor in apple of course. But people lose faith in the greatest companies that have invested in a newer bouncing around a lot. But I that that is, that is what I like to do.

Speaker 3:          01:26:06       So I, I was, I was doing a bit of homework and uh, you were very helpful in sending me links to a few things. One was an interview with Jason Calacanis. Oh yeah, I love that guy. And you had created a very nifty index of subject on your, on your, uh, flicker account. And one of the bullets was why I never sell shares of our companies and biggest misses also. But, uh, could you explain what you mean by that? I'm sure we listen what is never so never, never sell. It's a wonderfully liberating stance. And at first people were like, yeah, I can see your fish. Like, wait, that doesn't make sense. You know, buy low, sell high is kind of a munch. Yeah, no, I've never sold a share. Now let me add the caveat when I have control. So the vast majority of time, uh, in our business this would apply, which is we invest in a startup.

Speaker 3:          01:26:57       It either has an IPO or it gets acquired. Those are the two outcomes where it has a quote liquidity event, an IPO, some point after the IPO, you know, years later, or at least 180 days later, a venture for, and we'll distribute those shares to its investors. So I as the general partner gets shared, so I get shares of Tesla, I get shares of you name it right now what I choose to do that as my own personal decision, right? And from that point on, I've never sold a shirt. Now what I do is give him the charity over time. And some might argue that's kind of a sales decision, but not entirely be partially because it's not like I'm trying to time the market. I'm betting on them in perpetuity. And, and I'll give you another answer to why I do this. In a moment, but let me just, let me flesh this one out a little more.

Speaker 3:          01:27:38       This has been wonderfully, um, goal aligning with entrepreneurs because if I'm thinking when is the time to punch out? It's kind of a corrosive thought process when they're thinking I the ones I like one of my, what's the next 20 years look like for this business? How can we make the most out of it in this next phase of growth? Because the best companies are like these sort of power laws of compounding potential. They, you know, would you want to be punching out and you wouldn't write if Facebook or Google, if you know, 10 years ago, God, that would have been really bad mistake. Right. And I love, actually, let me jump to the point number two. Some of the very first advice I got when I was entering this field was from someone who had spent their entire career at the Rockefeller Group. I forget what she was, foundation or somethings and he's Peter Crisp and I remember him vividly because we were, I think my first week on the job, it was our first pitch to people who give us money.

Speaker 3:          01:28:25       And here I met someone who has just coming off a long career, sort of winding down, slowly off a long illustrious career investing. Some of the best companies you can imagine. And he's two comments to me were, wow, first I'm super envious. And this young group of people that starting your career right now, this looks like you're going to love this. I wish I was your age doing this again, this whole second wave. So I just liked it. Here I am changing careers as we mentioned earlier and not sure which careers are made from me that I had to hear something like that. And the second thing is looking back over his whole career, he wished he had never sold anything and that I had a similar reaction. What do you mean? He goes, well, I tried to time the market and if I had just held onto my apple shares, right, and who cares what it happened.

Speaker 3:          01:29:04       Everything else like the, as if held value today, it would've trumped everything else. I'd be a much richer man. I would have avoided all that anxiety. And that echoed in the back of my mind to this day. So in my, I won't show this specifics, but in my personal portfolio there was a similar power of mother as a single company that's worth more than everything else combined because I've never sold a share. And then if I look at number two, may I have to actually go back and do the math number two plus number three probably that kind of think about it as long tail exceeds everything else combined. So it's like a traditional power law and that is pretty amazing. So I just like when I made this decision and also around the same time to give it all to charity. That was another thing that created a living trust to give everything about a small fixed dollar amount to the kids.

Speaker 3:          01:29:44       Everything else going to go to charity. Then when you have a major crashes, it's not like, I know this is gonna sound weird. I don't stress it. I just lost 90% of my net worth. Cause that happened once. It's like, oh the charity just lost 90% of his net worth, you know. And so I was able to write it through when it came right back cause I didn't panic and sell when I literally lost 90%. My net worth. Um, I don't recall seeing, I don't remember who it was, but one of the, and there aren't that many as you know, uh, but a tier venture capital firms looked at their return on something or they're returned to limited partners of the, let's just call it 10 companies that had, uh, reached IPO and that they subsequently distributed. And they compared that with the amount made by someone who would have invested the amount in the companies at first opportunity at IPO and written it out something like five years.

Speaker 3:          01:30:40       And they would have made just as much money in, in, in most of the cases. Uh, yeah, there was a fun called technology crossover ventures I think formed with that insight in mind that says if you can pick some winners still private in, in and have a judgment from seeing the track record, the passion of the entrepreneur or a number of years, and then load up the boat, either just pre IPO or at IPO. Yeah. That you can put a large amount of capital to work in that. But the key was it was those prior years of exposure that really gave you confidence. So like my years with elan allow me to look at him in a very different way than other than entrepreneurs. Right. Yeah. And if you just literally had no prior data and he just walked in off the street, I would, you really know.

Speaker 3:          01:31:18       You see, you mentioned deal. So you spent time with jobs, Elon, many other impressive folks. But what, what are the commonalities you've observed? Biggest commonalities, biggest differences between those two? Sure. Well, let me start with differences because I think it's tempting to draw an analogy and I have been tempted to trust me. Um, but I think it's really important to keep in mind. So I'll start there. There's pretty big differences. Jobs was as a marketing centric individual with very weak engineering shops. Uh, Ilan is more of a physicist turned engineer slash computer scientist basically deep engineering chops, thinks of everything from first principles of what can be done from physics and then scales up to the product vision jobs. It's much more of a, you know, like almost a zen Buddhist approach too. Parsimonious design and the and the visceral agitation of its imperfection in design space.

Speaker 3:          01:32:13       You know, his famous calligraphy font thing and getting rid of all the buttons from the phone. There's all these like maniacal missions he'd had where at no point did he clearly lay out like, well here's the business strategy. Like you get rid of the buttons, everything lives in the cloud. You have software services layer you can iterate more quickly. Like this is going to be an awesome business opportunity from get rid of all the buttons and things like that and say no buttons or ugly. Get rid of them though. That's that shit. That design is shit. You know, he would say, um, but it wouldn't really give this like, ah, I get it. That's the master plan, right? Whereas Ilan is like master plan, part one, master plan part do in the French. He lays it all out and he's basically executed according to the master plan and there's actually a really well thought out series of steps to get from here to colonize Mars, a series of steps to get rid of the petrochemical economy, which is pretty amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:32:59       And it's all there for anyone through EAD. That's like night and day difference. Now, similarities, simple one, you know, CEO of two companies. I think that's interesting. Structurally, uh, not too many people have the shuts but to do that and I think by the way, in both cases it allows you to focus interestingly in a way that you couldn't have ice. You're saying, sorry, I heard that sentence to the CEO. Two companies, each of them independently, CEOs of two companies. [inaudible] you got Pixar and, and and, and either next or apple depending on timeframe. To be fair jobs was really not quite the CEO at Pixar, but he was by title. In any case, what you can do though is avoid meetings. Imagine, you know, it's the company Holiday Party and you just don't want to go, right? No one's going to double guessing. Like if you're normal CEO and then we'll come and you avoid your own holiday party.

Speaker 3:          01:33:44       He's like, well what really, what better thing is you have to do? Um, but this, this is awesome. You can basically avoid time wasting meetings and you have to delegate more. And so in both cases it is an intriguing thought experiment that being CEO more than one company has some interesting benefits for both companies, Huh? Yeah. Never thought of it. That one. Yeah. Um, the similarity, I think there's one area in design where the, the, the maniacal attention to detail. I'm, I, I described it as this, this visceral agitation that, I mean almost painful to Steve jobs to see things that were not right. Um, there's a bit of that in any line as well. I interviewed him once about design and it sounds so spooky. We still similar in that regard, but in a completely different wrapper, meaning you wouldn't really know or see it as a similar vector of like, like both think it's just easy and maybe it's a sign of brilliance, but it just, there's certain parts of this whole space that are intuitive and they do naturally.

Speaker 3:          01:34:40       And I wish I knew how to a do it myself and be spotted and others, right. So everyone wants to, wants to ask like, how can I raise my kid to be like Elon? Or how can I, you know, find entrepreneurs that are like him. And if you, if you think about just one element of that and how miraculous it is to be able to go into a number of industries, you know, commercial banking, are you leave with paypal, the aerospace industry with space x, the automotive sector, um, the, you know, the energy competing with utilities, with the solar city idea, really left field. Now it's part of Tesla. But when it started, it was really a left field sector. It wasn't one industry. I was like, well, that's energy generation. That's like competing with regulated utilities. Um, without any prior business experience in those sectors to become the dominant company in all of them, to have failed at none of them, to be the most important company in all those fields is kind of mind boggling.

Speaker 3:          01:35:29       So as an immigrant, I forgot, right? And the thing that I look for in companies that say we've got this mission as I was mentioning, but we're going to get this through incremental steps and engaging with customers along the way. We're not just going to like hunker down for 20 years and then pop out with colonizing Mars and the other end to actually paint the picture. How we get from here to there, that's even more miraculous in some ways. It's like everyone can have a big dream like, oh yeah, like thousands of people could have the dreams that Elon has. Almost none of them can paint a compelling picture how to get there.

Speaker 2:          01:35:58       That's where the, what's your 10 year vision? What's your 20 year vision comes into play? So Elon has this mythical status for so many people. I mean, just this kind of superman who's got everything figured out. Uh, I found this article on business insider that was talking a little bit about your relationship with him. And there are two things. One, I'll just, uh, actually two, two questions I'm gonna ask. The first is called him the most risk immune person I've ever met. Uh, and then, then I have a follow up to that. But what does, what does that, what's, what's, what's an example of him being risk immune? Yeah. I, is it because he does it because he feels differently in the face of the same risk or is it because he defines risk differently or something?

Speaker 3:          01:36:45       Yeah, that's a great question because I think it's passed through the filter of the Observer. We perceive risk, incredible risk, and some of the things he's done, I don't know that we have perfect vision on kind of how could we unreal. He does, he perceive the risk the same way we do, right. As external observers. And so I think part of the answer and his brother made it somewhat similar statement once I feel comfortable at least talking about this, uh, not as if I'm speaking out of school that, um, they're like, here, here's one I can say to externally. I've never seen an entrepreneur go all in for his companies and I say plural, um, as, as Elan, like some entrepreneurial take risks, they'll quit a job, they'll spend their entire life savings on some idea. They'll do whatever. Right? The personal commitment, personal sacrifice. I've never seen anything like Ilan and I think this story came out and where I was referring back to December, 2008 yeah. This, uh, and the, and the darkest period for Tesla. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:37:38       So yeah, muscular. It would take 50 million to get his first trip to Mars. And then next sentence, he was 200 million, 200 million in and had quit, spent all of his money between that and Tesla and he went into personal debt by 2008.

Speaker 3:          01:37:50       Exactly. So 2008 for those that might remember with financial crisis was happening for context. At that time, Tesla had just gotten rid of a CEO. Um, Elan was not, it had not been the CEO up until then and it was tough. A large investment bank, one of the most prestigious had just failed to do a fundraise. This is where you hot hire them, pay them lots of money, go out and get us the money. You know, you expect it to come in at the end of this process. They're like, sorry, we have nothing for you. And the company was rapidly running out of money. In fact, it was heading towards December, 2008 in and they couldn't even make payroll. And so Ilan wrote a check personally for $3 million just so they can make the December, Christmas time payroll of the employees. But like January is gonna be just as bad and there's like no money anywhere.

Speaker 3:          01:38:31       There was. And by the way, for context, there was no government program. There was no Daimler investment at this point. It was just a company that had a roadster that was negative gross margin, meaning every car you sell, you lose more money. Um, it was a surprise discovery. How bad the proposition was is when the CEO was let go, it was like, oh my God. Like contrary to our belief, we're actually losing money on every car. Um, and that's not easy to fix. By the way, you know, sell more cars does not solve this problem right? Readily. Um, and you had your largest insight investor. This is a term of art in the venture community. There's a lot of symbolism when your largest investor is or is not supportive of what you're doing. It doesn't, no, it doesn't mean they actually have a thing that can, a lever, they can pull that kill you are.

Speaker 3:          01:39:10       But the symbolisms bags that are in the trenches with you, and if they're refusing to write a check, that's a really hard fundraising environment. And the largest investor was as hostile as I've ever seen an investor. They did not want Ilana CEO. They did not want anything do with the company. They want it to pivot to a different business strategy that seemed a little too cozy, that it would support one of their limited partners. And it felt really icky. And they were openly hostile. So, oh, and he was going through a divorce and SpaceX rockets were blowing up by the way. And he spent every penny he had. So what does he do? He borrowed $20 million and he said, okay, we don't, our lead investors not here, this large investment bank has failed. I'm going to invest the $40 million that's needed. He didn't have $49. She's, I'm going to invest the $40 million is needed to hell.

Speaker 3:          01:39:53       A lot of you hear the terms and not to help, but I'm doing it. Train's leaving the station. And it flipped this design guys, if you will, from fear degreed. Right? And, and, and this is what it is. Meaning everyone's thinking, I want to be part of that is he see that I don't see. And, and to be fair, there is a, um, there is a dynamic which I'm sure you've seen, which is you can have a bunch of people around the table like we were, Dfj was very enthusiastic and wanted to invest, but we can't do the full 40 million and we need somebody to be the lead investor and we'll do our full share. Right? We actually did more than our full share, but somebody's got to step further this missing nut when your largest insider won't and you don't have any outside my, someone's got to set them up.

Speaker 3:          01:40:29       So he stepped up and said, I don't care. I'll do the whole thing if need be who's with me? And we took as much as we could. We brought our growth fund in for the first time. Um, and it, it is an easier decision to say, will I write a check, let's say for $2 million. Let's say you were just one of the random investors there as part of 40 knowing that at least as 40 at least we're going to get through this roaster cost problem and, and, and be able to turn some cards if you will. See, does the government through, does the Daimler relationship actually happened? Cause there's verbal conversations going on. We'll get resolution at least those major things. And so that there'll be hope to get to the next phase of actually building the model s car. If all that falls in our favor, let's be part of it.

Speaker 3:          01:41:06       So our $2 million check leverages the $40 million check. I'm just saying to arbitrarily, yeah. So if you, if all you can do is write $2 million checks, you would never just write it to him. The dollar check. That's like, like a, like a peer. It's not a bridge to something. It's like, uh, you know, and that's what a Elon was willing to do in December, all by himself. And then B, he was willing to do another one all by himself. I've never seen it. I get so he in retrospect was perfectly right. Everything went exactly according to plan. This is going to change the world. It's going to be an enormously valuable company. This was eight an incredibly good investment to make at the time. In retrospect, at the time it seemed like the riskiest thing I've ever seen. I've never seen an entrepreneur fund their own company, you know first when no one else would second go net negative by $20 million.

Speaker 3:          01:41:50       Unbelievable. Did you, have you asked him what he was thinking at the time? Not Directly. I didn't want to, I liked it. This is great. It just felt like the right thing is like I could see the fear of going to greed. By the way, in tough times you sometimes also learn who is going to stand by you and who won't. Well and so that that lead investor and then also maybe I won't mention the names, there's at least one board member who was like, oh my gosh. They showed their stripes and there's nothing like a crisis to know if you're in the trench with the right person, maybe who you're a fair weather friends are. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:42:26       To that point, it's mentioned in this piece that you don't call to you around the darkest times were. And so during some of these really tough periods, what does, and it doesn't of course keeping it whatever private should be private, but what is someone like Elon and you've interacted with a number of these people who have incredible capacity to do big things. Uh, what is someone like that say to a friend during their dark times? I mean, why do they call friends? So I'm not going to relay any specifics, but I can try to get to the gist of the question. I won't really any specifics of the phone call. And, and to be fair, I don't even really remember the specifics because I'm in so many calls over so many times. So, so with the caveat of, because, because if you look at the list of difficulties he was going through, like any one of those, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:43:12       Be Soul crushing, soul crushing. I mean will completely paralyze and send millions of people into a downward spiral. So it, so he has said some things cause I don't want to speak out of school but there is something I can share that might be helpful. He has spoken himself and it was like eating glass that this was like really terrible time. So he's made some comments personally, I'll just let him speak for what it felt like for him. But I would say that what I've observed in that crisis and other crises that we generalize is that he goes into a battle mode of focus that is really remarkable. Um, in this battle mode is allows him I think to ignore distraction and to have a laser focus on what needs to get done. So, um, it'll sometimes be observant as these sort of thoughtful deep moments of like, wow.

Speaker 3:          01:43:55       Like you see it on his face and, and you, you want to give him space to think. Cause I think there's like four people that can be times when your generative and thoughtful and brainstorming and thinking about all possibilities and the wonder of the world. And other times when you're like, you've got to like solve the problem and like focus in, in, in, in those modes, he can avoid distraction like no one else I've seen. So a lot of the smart CEOs and entrepreneurs I've worked with are, are some of them share afterwards that I have in spades, which is I'm interested in many things. I'm easily distracted by something and sometimes I'd rather avoid the tough crisis in my, you know, in thinking about it when there's something more fun to spend time on. Right. And so I'm almost the opposite of this exist to give credit to how valuable this says.

Speaker 3:          01:44:34       Um, when, let's say Tesla has faced various, um, manufacturing challenges, these sort of production hell times that he's described. He physically sets up his office on the production floor in a very visible area with no walls. So everyone can see that he's there through the weekend and I'm the vice presidency that and that ripples out. Um, when he's calling a supplier, let's say he was often the cause of a problem is like Angela, like, well, I'm here in the factory. Where were you going? Why aren't you here solving this word? I said, yeah, it has a lot of impact, right? That personal attention to right now, everything else needs to be gone. I'd have to solve this problem. I witnessed this for example, uh, in a, in a, in a more subtle way, more recently when I was setting up or trying to set up rather a very interesting phone call between the Marzano persons or the Mars exploration program for NASA, uh, Craig Vendor who's a pioneer and study biology and gene sequencing and gene synthesis.

Speaker 3:          01:45:25       And I want to just getting along on a half hour call because we, the sort of idea had occurred amongst us that we could do a much cheaper Marzia turned mission. In other words, fine. If there's any life on Mars, either, you know, um, archaic or currently living, the best way to explore it would be not to send it back from Mars, which is very difficult. But the Senate gene sequencer to Mars sequence a locally beam the data back and create the living organism on earth. That's actually is doable. And I thought Elan's should certainly be inserted in this cause. I'm like the next phase of Mars exploration, terraforming, finding out what organisms do live on Mars or not. If they mutate and margin actually start thriving, send the data back, create a version on earth to study, adhere and more rapidly telephone terraform, Mars. He's like, you know, that's great.

Speaker 3:          01:46:04       He said, I can't take that from only half hour phone call one day. That will be important right now. I get it, get it fucking heavy. They fly or they won't be that need for me to be doing that. So I'm like, I would love this half hour phone call with you once the three of them, he's like that. That can wait a few years and it can, right. Yeah. Um, and that remarkable ability to push aside all these interesting things when there's, I got to get Xyz to ship or fix the problem. Um, and so fixing the gross margin problem back in 2008 getting a CEO, which didn't have to be himself, I'm in place and solving on all the myriad problems that were in place was battle mode. And he would also lean on confidence and friends. So it'd be fair. There were others like Antonio Grassy, us and others who really rolled up their sleeves got on the factory floor and close friend.

Speaker 3:          01:46:46       Yeah, he's, he's amazing. So folks that um, really come and, you know, prove that there was some little stable investors out there, Antonio's happy to, to, to fight to support his friends too. Oh, exactly. I'll just say he's my favorite investor I've ever met in my entire network, so I mean get up more over, over a bottle of wine about this. But, so we were, Antonia and I were in the Henry Crown Fellowship program. The other thing that's been institutes, we, we've had a chest spent a lot of time together. Um, yeah, great guy. Absolutely. Great Guy. Said two things come to mind. The first is, and I'm sure I'm going to butcher this, but I, I hate to quote attributed to Steve Jobs. I feel like there are a lot of mistreated quotes. I'm pretty sure this is accurate. I don't think it's enabling can situations on the Internet, but that innovation is saying no to a thousand things that the, I haven't heard that button but in any case, uh, the other was he's also by the way jobs was very proud of and that's what his greatest creation or grades contribution to the world.

Speaker 3:          01:47:41       Greatest invention as great. It's thing on his death, but it was apple, the organization and it was really the process learning coming back to something, I was starting to have it earlier. He was focused on physical space design and keeping the engineer's in the marketing people thinking about where the bathrooms aren't Pixar, so you have to walk by certain areas to get to them. He was maniacal about architecting the way people communicate, kicking people out of meetings at the too big. So he had an intuitive sense about team size along before I did. And now I know that people are over a certain weight class or you don't want people on anything productive. No development team. Actually five the ideal number five plus or minus two boards of directors, development teams, creative groups. That's the one of the secret of managers of small companies that they have less people and they get shit done when it's a big company, has hundreds of people and sclerotic layers of management that Dave lost the small team dynamic.

Speaker 3:          01:48:31       So I always like to ask about, I asked about it with Elan, uh, the, some of the tougher times because more challenges because it's, it's easy I think. And I explore this with uh, lots of everybody who's on the show. I tried to ask her about how they are, how they try to deal with overwhelm or if they feel scattered, what do they do? And uh, it was, we talked a little about, a little bit about Elan, I'd love to ask you, because you recently had an experience in, a lot of people have in the sense that I, and many others get their turn as kind of the, uh, the punching bag. If you're public facing, I mean, you're going to run into things and you had an experience recently that I'd love for you to describe if you're open to it. And then I have some follow up questions just about how you then reacted to it, right.

Speaker 3:          01:49:18       Self talk and things like that. So maybe, uh, if, if I could just leave it open. So, uh, yeah, maybe it's an elephant in the room, but in the last couple months I have faced the most surreal experience of my career, which is, you know, what's, I'm 23 years of venture capital in many before that all positive press experiences. And then I faced a bizarre, so almost auto catalytic, you know, self-generating theme that I hosted a sex party with my fancy, um, in silicon valley. And at first I laughed. Oh, there's a hilarious, you know, as an ex geek, you know, growing up my whole life with glasses and braces and what have you, like the notion, I mean, my first date was in college and you're like, I really thought that was hilarious at first. And then it got a little more serious. I'm like, wait, this, this is ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          01:50:03       Um, and, and it really, the thing that's even when it came, it derived from a book that came out in February where there's no such claim that we hosted a sex party but it's in a chapter about sex parties that other people had. And we just happened to be the only party that has been anyone mentioned by name. And then it, I mean if I tried to put a simplistic spin on this or try to make sense of it, it looks like people just didn't read the chapter very carefully and they wait blog posts or other like very sort of nonprofessional postings online that oh my gosh, the sex party who was at Steve's house. And I'm like, well what she not only did the book not say that it wasn't true. And by the way, there's 150 people that attended this thing that no one's not true and like 10 of them go publicly on, which is kind of a risky thing to do is say I was at this party and there was no sex.

Speaker 3:          01:50:47       Like including Ilan and I, Elon Musk is like, this is irresponsible journalism. Or something to that effect. And he condemned the writer and like, like, and it's kind of bizarre because I know this author, I've been on her, you know, Bloomberg television program many times. She knows my email, she knows my cell phone. She never called me for a fact check, which I didn't realize in book publishing today, uh, in what's ostensibly a nonfiction category that the publishers do. No fact checking. And that's just a fact now it's transformed from decades ago and they leave it up to the writer and the writer just blue just didn't even try to see how it was true and more disturbingly would retweet even though she never said we had a sex party. She would retweet other people who did. So some, you know, other publication in Europe would say, oh the, the orgy, right?

Speaker 3:          01:51:31       So it starts to grow the orgy at our house and she retweets it really, you know, this isn't true. And I know she knows it isn't true, but she keeps re tweeting it because it sells more books. And I know executives for example, who've been pressured by their PR people to say positive things about the book because of her ongoing role is a Bloomberg reporter. So you have this weird conflict of interest when you want to sell books and salacious stories sell to propagate something that's not true. Even if you didn't say it yourself and then turn around and use your leverage and your bully pulpit on Twitter and elsewhere to gain support for your book. Because you know, people want to continue working with you and you're going to be the journalist of record in the tech industry at one of the biggest news organizations.

Speaker 3:          01:52:11       It's kind of unfair. Feels really horrible. Yeah. Well I was going to ask you like how did it, how did it feel and what was your self talk may be in the short term. And then I ask a lot of people about self-talk, uh, which I'm fascinated by it, right? So sort of the day of, let's just say when it ceases to be funny and then maybe, I don't know, I'm making this up in terms of timeline, but like a few days later when you've had a chance to maybe gather your thoughts a bit. Yeah. So despite the initial burst, almost like a defensive Aha, this is funny, you know, and then when I really allowed it to sink, they probably took some number of hours. I'm like, wait a minute, this, you know, like for example, the 150, probably more until about 150 that really knew there was nothing there and they were there the whole time.

Speaker 3:          01:52:53       They had to explain to their spouses and others are like, no, I really wasn't at a sex party. It's really embarrassing when those poor people, totally innocent. Um, anyway, and again, not to condemn a sex party. I mean, and there've been invited to one, I'd never held one. I don't want to say it's a terrible thing. I'll just say I haven't been the one, I don't want to be accused of one. Right. Well just as to inject some levity real quickly. So I just moved to San Francisco, this was a long time ago. And uh, one of my neighbors said, oh, welcome to the neighborhood. You should come over Saturday like we're having a party. I was like, sure, no problem. So, uh, I ended up like having a late dinner. I'm like, okay, it's too late. No, it's not too late. Come on over. So I walk in and I'm like, what's happening here?

Speaker 3:          01:53:30       Like people in various states of undress and a just in time to realize, oh my God, I'm actually at a sex bar. Like there's food served, but I'm like fully clothed with a beanie and a and a and a Hoodie on. And then they go, okay, everybody sit down and we're going to do a round of introductions. And so I sit down and like, wait, how do I get out of this? Cause they're like 40, 50 people there. And a, I did manage to scurry out and then then say to my neighbor, uh, wow, I won't name by name, but I was just like, please in the future, let me know, give me a heads up like, and I have nothing against it, but it's like let me know what's going on in any case. So that's like you're in the bay area, right? So it's like, I'm sure these things happen.

Speaker 3:          01:54:10       I literally invited to one. It's not my thing. So, um, so I don't want to sound too preachy because you know, but it's just not my thing. And it does feel weird to have a room full of tech executives and some of our closest business colleagues, scores of them, um, maligned in this indirect way. So, um, the way I felt though is I felt really betrayed and there were, and it wasn't just a single journalists that I've highlighted, like, wow, what happened to professional journalistic ethics? It's like just fact checking and caring about the truth. That's one branch of disappointment. The other was, um, a little more invisible. I'll keep this anonymous, but there were a number of people I noticed who would immediately lend support to this idea online. Like either simple things like you know, retweeting something without checking with me. You know, people who extensively know me.

Speaker 3:          01:54:56       Um, that was really disappointing. So I felt betrayed by luckily only a handful. I mean a remarkably small number of people who just, and frankly there was somebody at least well known context. So these aren't close personal friends that are like mid state, other venture capitalists lists. I just as a category, you know on the other side I was blown away by the outpouring of support by people who do know me. So a couple of um, you know, coworkers of ex employees that I used to work with came out with blog posts. And in every case it was after they published that I even knew they were putting something together and coming in my defense, it's like a female entrepreneurs of all types. You're like, no, it was anything but this happened at this event and we'll be eternally grateful for again, when, when time is really tough, you find out a bit more about people's character and you find out who is really someone who knows. You get somebody who knows me knows is not true. Right. And uh, what's weird is that I thought that'd be obvious for larger set, but at least the ones who really know me, they don't even need to ask about it. Oh my God, dude, what's going on? This is crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:55:56       What prevented you, I mean you had the outpouring of support. You also had a few people show their true colors. Some people when they get hit with something like that, anything, I mean I've had periods where it's like, I remember this kind of hit piece came out on me. Uh, and I'm not saying these are the same thing, but like it's hippies came out on me and it came out on my birthday at one point where I have it, I have this annual gathering of my closest friends and it was through a credible, I mean a very well known publication that had not only they had contacted me for fact checking via phone, I had corrected a bunch of misquotes and then they ran it as is without making any of the changes and it really bummed me out like I was considering not doing any interviews ever in the future. Maybe I'll have to make a number of changes to my life so that I'm not a exposed and I think that there are certain ways you can mitigate like always doing fact checking email, email responses as opposed to be a thousand. They can't deny. You always direct it to email. I mean there are a number of different ways that you can risk mitigate there, but was there, was there anything that you said to yourself or the other people said to you that was particularly helpful at the time?

Speaker 3:          01:57:08       Let me think about that for a second. Um, well the, the thing that jumps to mind is how supportive my fiance Genevieve was throughout this. I mean, she's a fighter and she was at my side throughout in some ways it was incredible. Um, and I'm incredibly thankful for her support throughout. This is the beginning of what you were saying. The part that it was going through my mind as you were asking the question is that one of the toughest things in it relates to advice other people gave me was the advice to not say anything. The advice to be just mum. I got advice from people who focus on PR. I got advice from people who've been through similar situations or worse, I've been accused of crazy things or like crimes, right? Falsely accused of crimes. Uh, which luckily I've never been accused of. Um, and in every single case like with like zero crack of, there's another side to this point of view is like you say, nothing, you do not point out the obvious flaws in these false accusations.

Speaker 3:          01:58:07       In the, in the, in the, in the research supporting this is disturbing but true that anything you say even definitively proving your innocence will only worsen people's perception of you at large. Just the mere recanting or resurfacing of that topic to then say it has been decidedly proven false. It will make people think worse of you on average now from from media perspective. So in private conversations that that's not the case. And I've asked psychologists about this, I don't know all of the studies like real clinical slash science driven studies show that you do not to say anything. Even the prove your own essence. So that's horrible, right? It's like that's where you're torn up with all the virtual conversations you'd like to have with the people who've done you wrong with the media. It cause you know, you can set the record straight. It's like I wrote pages of stuff that I never used.

Speaker 3:          01:58:58       Like well let's just set the record straight like I can I, my mind played for months. It would play through, you know? Well, here's what I would say that with just either a, clear it all up or B, get back at the person who I know is being dishonest to prove they're being dishonest right now. Fess up like you own this one. Yeah. So that is the most difficult. I really had a hard time with that because in every ad, that aspect of my life I don't have to do that. You can speak openly about like I disagree with you. Well that didn't really happen or that's a science based fact, you know, or something like x scientist. I hate that. It's so it seems like this, I mean you were able to withstand the flak very well. If you think back on, it could be at any point in your life, but has there ever been a particularly difficult period for you?

Speaker 3:          01:59:46       I mean, and that you know, I mean my whole high school I could say, but that was a long retracted series of pain of just feeling insecure and like that was a late bloomer. I mean, they sort of, I can tell you about tough times, but there wasn't like a shock to the system and it wasn't like, I mean, I was deeply hurt when my dad died. I mean that, that was tough, but it was something that's, that's life. It was a natural cause, you know, I'm not Paul Funds, so it was tough. Yeah. I mean I remorse and so I've gone through some tough things, but nothing that was quite like this, which is, yeah. Wow. That really someone did me wrong. Yeah. I had been betrayed as opposed to, yeah. You know, life has its cycles and I can feel sad about the passing of a dear loved one, but it's a different category I think.

Speaker 3:          02:00:30       Yeah. No, totally different categories. But the, I'm interested still in the coping mechanisms or the, the thinking that goes with it. So when your dad died, uh, no, I'm sorry for your loss. Um, and it's hard for me to imagine, but what was most helpful during the period of grieving or recovering from that? It wasn't, I didn't have a playbook of what to do and what seemed most natural, and it may have been the habit of mind, was to focus on my mom and helping her. Yeah. Uh, who survived him, who was there. I decided when he passed, um, of a heart attack. Um, it's just one of those things where like, why you're trying to revive him, you're trying to call nine one one for, I was like, oh, my heart went out so much to her and how her situation was worse than mine in a way that that consumed almost all my thoughts for some period of time dealing with, you know, I'm the only child in that family dealing with what needs to be dealt with.

Speaker 3:          02:01:23       They just, I want it to sort of almost nonemotional operations mode and may have been sometime late that night or the next day that I finally was. I allowed myself to cry, um, and really face what I had lost. Part of what gave incredible solace is perhaps some wisdom I could pass on to others who worry about parents who go and I know Tim urban and others have written some wonderful pieces about, you know, thinking about your parents, if you have anyone near our parents' generation, like how many days do you have left with them yesterday? The tail end? Yes. Everybody should read it. Absolutely. It was recommended to me just as a quick side note by Matt Mullenweg, mutual friend, favorite people, wonderful person who also lost his father not too long ago and he recommended it to me before it happened. Exactly. So maybe the thing that I took solace in that I'll share for others, it's not what you do and the weeks before someone passes, it really defines your relationship.

Speaker 3:          02:02:17       It's what you've done over your, your life. And so I had been going to the Ted Conference. I brought him with me. It was just one of the greatest joys of his life for years prior. The fact that we had all those weeks together, sort of these one on one times of intellectual pursuits in this in a way almost a welcome into my world. Like take dad to workday in a sense in this sort of sort of virtual world of like ideas and science technology. Um, when he, he went through his, uh, he went through a pancreatic surgery procedure and uh, uh, uh, just around Thanksgiving and came out of it. And then I was told by the nurse who first saw him when he came out of it. Was that because there was a chance he would make it even through the procedure? I get to go to Ted again.

Speaker 3:          02:02:56       It was like the first piece. That's, that's all. That's amazing. It's so hearing that then, and then he had complications a few weeks later that he passed from. But just knowing how much that meant to him and how much time I did get to spend with them purposefully, it was really took the edge off. Like if we were estranged, if I was at odds with him than I had really I think be torn up with guilt of having not come to closure and we had nothing. I mean, he's my hero. I've only had positive thoughts about him filling my life, so I made it easier ironically to lose the guy that I had the best relationship with. Yeah, I mean this is like, as you said, it's part of the cycle. Um, I'm certainly not looking forward to it. I mean, people will ask me like, what do you fear?

Speaker 3:          02:03:34       What are you afraid of? And there, you know, there are certainly things, uh, not, not as many as one might expect. I mean, I don't want to be eaten by sharks or anything, but I don't spend a lot of time dwelling on the fear of that happening, that just watching my parents get older and ultimately pass away is something that I, yeah, I think qualify as definitely something that occupies my mind and I, oh, Matt, a huge debt of gratitude because he led me to the tail end. I read the tail end and that led me a number of years ago to start taking extended trips with my parents, uh, twice a year. So at six month intervals we have not just the trip, which is usually, let's just call it two to three weeks, but uh, where I usually take them somewhere they haven't been, but also the entire period in between during which we can look forward to the trip and plan the trip and talk about the trip and that anticipation, I feel like hiss or 70, 80% of the enjoyment of it. Exactly. And so I had a huge thank you and he recommended a book to me. I haven't yet read, but um, I'm hoping to soon, which I believe is on grief and grieving. Um, and uh, he's been on the podcast

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       that people look up his last name and grief and grieving. Sure. The correct title, if that isn't, it will pop up. But he recommended that everyone read it even before passing of loved ones. So we talked about Matt Mullenweg, I pinged him to ask him what subjects or questions might be interesting to explore. And one of them was parenting. So it's, it's a good segue. How do you think about parenting or do it maybe doing it differently is too awkward question to answer, but what are some of the things that you think are important in parenting?

Speaker 3:          02:05:12       Well, you know, we don't really get manuals on how to do it. Yeah. The people, young parents, the first time parents are sort of thrust into it and then you find your own way. The thing I, the only thing I did to prepare for being a parent was to read scientists in the crib by Alison Gopnik. It's a not a parenting book. It's basically about the neuroscience of infants and uh, you know, through two and three years old that made it fascinating to study. And I mean literally this incredible creature when they were pre verbal, it sort of created a bond that some dads lack. I think when they don't have that physical connection and you know, say in nursing or what have you, that a mom might have and yet to marvel at this, this is creation that, uh, is in front of you. The things like how they pick up language, how they envision system develops it.

Speaker 3:          02:05:56       That actually gave me straight, I'm going to under strange rat hole here, but it gave me strange stranger experiments to run, like pushing the bassinet on the first day of life under a light overhead that was an l shape and the baby's eyes would open immediately. Every time I went over there cause he could actually see it through the closed eye and any edge detection just fires up the brains. I was like, she had visitors, hey watch this puffy, the eyes open. Um, and then during phony and development, meaning learning language, practicing Buh Buh sounds cause it's like, it's sort of, we take it for granted but we learn how to speak by watching others. Like what are you doing with your lips to make that sound right? So it made young childhood development easy. Then I got into my groove, which is like my power alley, which is playing with like kids getting down at their level, whether it's Legos or blocks or whatever.

Speaker 3:          02:06:36       And just exploration and fun. So what I loved about being a parent in the early years was an excuse to rediscover Mindstorms NXT or commercial lego's in general. Then Mindstorms, which got so much better. The toys have gotten so much better drones and I'm looking right, so when the kids are older, but basically playing with kids to me is super invigorating and metaphorically, uh, I think a lot of engineers, scientists and people close to that field, like even venture capitalists would do well to try to be creative like a child to engage like a child does with the world. Well in that childlike wonder.

Speaker 2:          02:07:11       Yeah. Not to interrupt, but this, this brings to mind and just for longtime listeners, the reason that I'm not going to ask a lot of my rapid fire questions that I normally do is because Steve, you were kind enough to answer how good a good number of them in my last book, tribe of mentors. But in that I asked you what you would put on a billboard and you said celebrate the child. Like mind. Yeah. So I, I mean I don't want to interrupt the discussion with parents. It's almost like a mantra came out of parenting,

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       which is, I could see how, and then this is something by the way, that hearkens back indirectly to this book scientist in the crib, that babies are like scientists. They form conjectures and hypotheses. They test the world of an inverse to putting things in their mouth. They're playing with everything. Sometimes it frustrates a parent, but when you see them as scientists doing experiments and learning how the world works from a sort of boot up phase, it is metaphorical for what we lose after oftentimes after many years of traditional education that can beat the creativity out of you. And I think the best engineers in the best scientists have that kind of a childlike mind. You can see it in the writings of fine mine and find it. And even Einstein and Newton and others like Newton I think once famously said, I felt like nothing but a child playing on this on the shoe store.

Speaker 3:          02:08:18       Um, that there's something deeply resonant about, um, seeing the conductivity and things as a child would and avoiding the strictures and mental ruts that academic disciplines, foster and job sort of tracks. I think about discipline, track. Those are both two things I don't like. I'd rather have less discipline and less tracks, right? I'd rather be exploratory and creative. And so, um, I found children and to be a wonderful opportunity, it's in such a wind when you're connecting with them, you're mindful of your presence and that later rolls into reading with them. And I spent a lot of time and tried to, whenever I'm with them, do what they like to do, right. Engage with them in the kinds of toys and things that they like and then push that a little further with all kinds of, uh, uh, actually put it, you know, tech infused adjuncts to what they might normally be playing with.

Speaker 3:          02:09:10       We, we probably don't have time to go into it right now on in this conversation, but, uh, people working, people learn about your rocket. Oh, rocket building. So I did a short ted talk on the, the joys of rocketry or, yeah, I think it's called the joys of rocketry. Uh, so ever since my son turned three, we started launching motto rockets. I in this story there was, I just went to a local toy store back when they had them, um, you know, physical place and saw this Estes rocket kit, you know, ready to fly. I'm like, wow, I sorta remember rockets and has little, I wasn't that into them. I built a couple. Um, and so we did this. And to make long story short, I found a mentor that could teach me like, you know, you can get really bigger engines in bigger rockets to f to the present day.

Speaker 3:          02:09:50       I've probably launched thousands of rockets. I Three d print these designs is to my son and I have been working on this. We got to the black rock desert every year and launch like really big things going well, past supersonic speeds, uh, routinely, um, launching large rockets. The rockets he could fit inside, um, as a, as a hobby. That's by the way where he first met planet labs was out in the desert launching rockets as an aside. So occasional good business comes out of it too. But most of all it's this incredible hobby of um, making science real light when something fails, launched or explodes in the pad or you know, comes back in because the parachute didn't deploy properly. Um, it is just visually exciting. I don't know, I just, I can't really put my finger on why it's not universally exciting to me. It just feels like something everyone should do a little bit of.

Speaker 2:          02:10:36       So tongue, my main science real, there were, there were a few tidbits that I pulled from one of your, your indices on various talks and uh, they were just seemed like fantastic attention grabbing headlines that they're not intended to be, that I was like, you know, I'd be interested in hearing the answer or just a little bit of elaboration on this one was drones and how to eliminate the TSA. So what's, what's the short ish? It doesn't have to be super short, but explanation of what that means. Sure. And so the Jones' thing is peripheral, but how to eliminate the TSA was an epiphany I had back, I think it was around 2005,

Speaker 3:          02:11:19       uh, or maybe earlier, maybe 2003, um, post nine 11 TSA is, you know, God in full effect doing all kinds of crazy things. You know, I think they just implemented the shoe thing, you know, for the first time. And I met this sort of brainstorming effort with them where they gave us the challenge, you know, how can we rapidly are radically streamline airport security operations to get on the plane sooner. And this was at the time looking at 18 years, I don't know why, 18 years, maybe it was 2002 and it'd be 2020 maybe. Maybe it was 2002. Okay. And so I came to that, I think it was only tech guy there. Um, the only, well 18 years, that's a long time to predict things. We'd invested by the way in some airport security technology stuff, but I didn't really talk about any of that.

Speaker 3:          02:12:00       I was like 18 years, that's going to be, you know, perhaps 18 doublings of Moore's law, which would be 256,000 x compute power. Hmm. What might someone do then that they couldn't do? Now we'll autonomous flight. It was like, there's a lot, by the way, as long before autonomous driving, autonomous flight or drones was a thing. Um, that those words didn't exist, at least not in the vernacular products. And I said, well, there's no question that we could have a Thomas flight by then. 18 years in the future about your 20, 20 like autonomous planes. Cause we already can today. Right? By the way, Airbus and Boeing, every one of those planes can land better than the pilot. Good and take off everything. But taxing is easy compared to autonomous driving. Any case, um, no one else was on that page. And I said, well wait, do you guys what happened?

Speaker 3:          02:12:43       Is there no cockpit? They made that a really nice first class lounge. The plane can't be used as a weapon, right? So why have any security gateway? Right? So just what you could do instead is go in with some biometrics. We know who's on the plane, have video surveillance in the plane as the trade off and bring whatever weapon you want on the plan. This would be a really bad place to go kill 200 people, right? Because you're going to get caught, right? If you're a terrorist cell, you will get caught. If you can't use it as a terrorist weapon, then why have the TSA at all? And then there was the wall web. We will it really work and it will to have autonomous flight. And we, we should, we should be doing it today with today's technology. No doubt about it. And you could telematically operated at each airport for the taxi part if that's really so hard.

Speaker 3:          02:13:21       Um, but anything that's that hard and then you get to go a step further to say, well, okay, well what about bombs? You know, made the plane falls out of the sky. Your luggage could fly separately in the autonomous thing from the plane itself, you'd have a smaller only plane. Uh, for the actual cargo part. You could have smaller planes, you know, the, the whole design space starts to change in terms of what the optimal design is. If you're not amortizing a pilot anymore in terms of that operational costs. And you could have multiple flights where there was a single one before. Now there's even less people per plane and more flexibility in your roots. All the unpacks. And I asked them like, have you even calculated the economic impact of the shoe policy? And they didn't know what I meant. Like, well you could just take like how much time does that just add to the queue or the average traveler times average salary of the average American and just the economic deadweight loss, like, you know, and, and part of what I tried to show them is that the immune response of a system is often worse and what kills you not pathogen.

Speaker 3:          02:14:10       Right? So it's often our own immune system that kills us literally as the method of death. And I said, well, how long till someone like puts a battery on fire, you're going to keep the laptops and cell phones off the plan. Do you realize the economic impact of that and they don't want to hear it. And I was, I'm glad that it hasn't happened quite yet, but I'm like, that's what the terrorist cell should be doing to cause the most harm. Just like have one Yahoo, make a halfassed attempt delight battery and fire on a plane and now look what it did do. I was like, I was in a flight from, I want to say it was, I mean I was in a far flung place, but I think it was Uzbekistan to is stumble or stumble to London. It was one of the two.

Speaker 3:          02:14:42       And we actually had to surrender all of our laptops and it created the amount of confusion and congestion and craziness that that created was just unbelievable. Yeah. Yeah. So the, the end of the TSA. That's right. Wouldn't that be wonderful? How do you, how do you budget as a technology investor for regulatory or political opposition from incumbents? Right, right. And you could look at, uh, I mean many different examples of this, whether it's uh, lobbyists or extremely powerful unions of various types that would be strongly, strongly, strongly incentivized to not allow something like the Tsa to no pilots' unions. I mean, some people would point out the uh, the, the usual like, well, you got to, it got a bit of an issue here. Um, so in the past and the 90s, especially when the Internet was like, you could just do Internet for awhile and that was fine.

Speaker 3:          02:15:41       We had the mantra that never invested in a regulated sector. And still to this day, try not to, I try not to invest in anything that requires any law to get past in order to be in business. The one exception is when all in an autonomous driving, what the product is currently illegal, but we know it's going to become legal, right? Fully level five autonomous driving, but without exception recently and the old school, if we not only try to avoid regular, they did invite us. We try to avoid if you had to deal with in any way as a customer and a partner with utilities or the government or in any of that sector. But I think frankly that left a lot of large sectors just plump, like a lot of entrepreneurs, we're avoiding them like the plague. So when Elon opened our eyes, it says you can actually take on what might be perceived to be the most uh, non market if you will.

Speaker 3:          02:16:27       Uh, you know, or non market factors, not like the best product doesn't necessarily win up the military industrial complex, right? You can take that on head on and just win with a better product. Right. And similarly going up against a regulated utilities with solar cities and like sort of distributed solar solution. And yes, they're fighting with every dirty trick you can imagine. Right? They're trying every angle, but sometimes there's just such a compelling advantage because there's been no new injury for like 25 years. They haven't faced a competitive threat in their institutional lifetime. They really don't know how to behave in response. So you have on one hand, yes, they'll try to do Daschle things and I don't know what to say other than you just kind of hope that enough of normal democracy will flourish, that you can overcome that and not have critical wounds.

Speaker 3:          02:17:07       We'll see. But on the other side, you don't usually know. Like when I was in software investing as a primary focus, you don't usually find opportunities to make a hundred fold or a thousandfold cost advantage in a product, but you do. And some of these areas, because they literally have faced no competitive threat for so long, they don't even know what it's like to compete. They take like, um, the aerospace industry, there's a number of Chinese ministers who early on once basics give their pricing for the Falcon nine, they said, w those prices are not real. We could not compete at those price points. Even if we had all of Western technology, like it's game over and other US competitors said, well, we basically have to shut down our product lines. I'm like, imagine if some competitive oracle or Microsoft said we're going to come out with something like, Oh yeah, you're right, we'd better stop selling windows.

Speaker 3:          02:17:52       Right. Or we're just going to not do databases anymore. Cause I, yeah. That, that's better. And I think they know, company responds with we're shutting down our entire product line and we were the monopoly. Oh by the way, with a monopolist prior, we were the thing. Right. And, uh, you know, you know, and, and, and the only caveat is they say that we're shutting down our product lines, but government, you got to have another company. So give us $4 billion, we'll build a better one. We can do it. We can build and get us $4 billion. Like we forgot to innovate for 25 years, but now it give us a pile of money. We'll start. Right. It's wild. Yeah. I never seen anything like it. Um, so one thing that we chatted a little bit about before recording that I wanted to ask you about is printed organs and synthetic meat.

Speaker 3:          02:18:39       So, hopefully not in the same dish that hopefully not in the same dish. You never know you the organ meats, the old nose to tail. But uh, in this case, um, you'd have to, I suppose, imagine the exterior would be, would be a figment of your imagination, uh, in the case of synthetic meat. But can you, where are things currently with synthetic meat and where will they be in the relatively near term? Yeah. And why is it important for that matter? I think it's, that's a great question. So, um, and the reason I think it's great as is, I think it's one of the major tech themes or factors that will affect a lot of people's lives over the next 10 to 20 years. And not everyone is fully aware of it yet. And it's an inevitability. So back when we were talking about, you know, these inevitable futures, like all cars will be electric, all vehicles will be autonomous.

Speaker 3:          02:19:21       This is one of those we will not slaughter animals to get meat in though. The question is, is that 50 years out is that 500 years out? But just like we won't burn oil and gas 500 years out, there's just no way we would do that in 500 years out. Especially not in small internal combustion engines that we won't slaughter a cow to get a steak. And so the, the insight occurs when you realize first it's a much cheaper and efficient way to grow the product you need without the whole cow. Like the hide. You don't need the methane production, you don't need all the inefficiency. That was an artifact of biological evolution. You don't leave the land, use the water, use the energy use. You can cut all that somewhere between 10 and a hundred x, all of those factors, which by the way, for the, for the listeners who don't know this, about a third of all usable land on earth is, goes to meet to production.

Speaker 3:          02:20:05       So this is the grain that gets fed to cows and pigs and chickens and the land that those animals live on. So like a third of all usable land. It's astounding, right? It's like one of the biggest water problems, the biggest methane gas, which is one of the most serious, uh, greenhouse gas problems. It's sort of on par with the whole petrochemical economy or in another hands. If you could say, I will get rid of oil and gas forever or it'll get rid of meat production, you'd be better off getting rid of meat production in the short term in terms of greenhouse gases in the environment. So pretty big, big deal. Okay. So why is this possible? There are two major branches of companies that are trying to solve this. One branch is to replace meat with something that's not meat and there's an, I applaud those efforts.

Speaker 3:          02:20:41       Um, it's a little bit of a more of an engineering challenge to get it past the consumer and each product has its own engineer. Each and every product is challenging and make the duck tastes like duck, make the chicken tastes like Jagan and have it not just be like, you know, sausages and hotdogs, but actually filet if you want to take on the whole core of the market. So that will make a meaningful impact. And be important. It's just gonna be slow moving because of how hard it is to do each product and to make it anything passable as challenging. Extremely hard. I mean exactly. I've tried a lot of people been trying every which way to do a Veggie Burger. There's big breakthroughs recently by using heme and plant based team. Just like a possible, that means you get a veggie burger that bleeds basically.

Speaker 3:          02:21:19       Exactly. Cause that they found a route of soy plant that has a molecular cage that holds an iron atom in the center that's called the Porphyrin. That's the same molecule kind of structures. We have an hemoglobin that makes your blood red, that makes it, you know, turn color when it gets out of your body. Um, that makes you right. Steak turn red, that makes it tastes the way it does. That makes it barbecue the way it does. The way it browns, when you buy all those things you put in a plant, right? You can also put it by the way, you can make chicken and red meat is kind of fun. But anyway, that's the plant based approach. It's a lot of engineering, a lot of effort, a lot of money per product. The other pushes when we invested in called Memphis meats and others like that says let's just make steak, let's make chicken, let's make any of these products in like not just the subject, make the exact same thing but don't grow it in account.

Speaker 3:          02:22:03       So it's more of a change in the manufacturing method quite simply. Right. Do you have the cow making the steak or do you have it in a lab now? How do you make it in the lab? Well the, the team came from cardiology and other medical backgrounds yet people that have done work in stem cell biology and people have worked in, you know the whole synthetic biology area and it's pretty straight forward to grow cells. You take stem cells, you can induce them be pluripotent or reducing the being mortal basically and you can just grow an infinite number of these cells that could become anything. They could become skeletal muscle, they become nerves. They could become skin. And the way you differentiate them into skeletal muscle, which is like our muscles and our arms is you put them on a scaffold that causes them to differentiate into that kind of thing.

Speaker 3:          02:22:40       A scaffold that is um, it's an edible gelatin like thing kind of, you know, it's basically some other food products and things like we had college in and other stuff you have the scaffold is things Arrow Gel. The cells differentiate and they merged together and he's long fibers just like our muscle cells. So what were formerly discreet stand on the cells form into one long multi multinucleated cell. It twitches, it does everything. Like a normal muscle is a muscle cell. That species where I have tasted the duck, but most recently, so it's duck muscle and over time you can add the irregularities of sinew and all this very, now it's just like a perfect cut of duck muscle. You know, the mouthfeel everything. It's just the same thing. Everything's a filet Mignon. Exactly. By the way, in the future, you can make it healthier. You can make it all a mega three rich oils.

Speaker 3:          02:23:24       You could tune things, but let's just start with a simple, don't confuse the market with it's, it's not Turducken, it's Turkey arts dog. It's not a blend. But you imagine blending is like a simple thing. Like there's no reason you can do infinite blending, like blending a wine and make it just the right mouthfeel, just the right whatever. Right? So, but in their term, let's not jump ahead of ourselves. It's just a substitute. And you can do this in small, like, you know, like a Chinese shipping container kind of things. You could put this near the point of consumption. You could have this in urban areas and you're not shipping meet all around the country is growing the steak, you know, sort of to order the end cost point should be much, much lower. And so to me this had one of those sort of lightning bolt moments of this is the inevitable future.

Speaker 3:          02:24:05       There's no technical risks that says this couldn't happen. There isn't like we have to invent some that element. There's a lot of system engineering, the optimize it, the feed stocks, you know, whatever. That's it. You know, spilling the right reactor size, it's gonna take some engineering, but it's not going to take breakthrough science. It's the same epiphany that when I first wrote in an electric car, when I first had an autonomous ride early on with the Google ones, uh, you know, the, the old, uh, is that they had an automated, it's like this is the future. Like you could, you could just see it like a clarion bell ringing in your head and then a few implications started the head like, wow, this will transform the world. And a lot of ways the amount of land and resources and real estate plays that relayed to me production today.

Speaker 3:          02:24:42       Not to mention, oh, mad cow disease, influenza h one n one, all these other things that we don't like, those collaterals that the climate has of the food industry and we haven't gotten to that. Um, you can see how we'll get from here to there that the buyers, the largest buyers of meat would absolutely like to diversify their supply chain. So they are not vulnerable to and for sure, or mad cower or any other disruption of their supply chain, you can see how they're going to want to feather that in. So by the way, Tyson and Cargill, two larges me companies in America invested in this company as well as in the series a with us. And um, but then I realized something about myself, I realized for the first time something where my future self will condemn my present self is immoral. Yeah. Right.

Speaker 3:          02:25:21       So I know that 50 years from now, once I'm eating the bacon and stake that is not killed an animal and its production, will I be able to visit a slaughterhouse for the first time? I W I won't do that today. I like eating meat so much that I refused to go visit a slaughterhouse. In fact of the USTA meat inspectors, they, 99% of them become vegetarian. They don't start that way. It's like if you see how it's made, you wouldn't need it. And yet I won't do that. And, and when I say moral, I think our humanity circle of empathy expands over time. You know, first it was, you know, family unit and the tribes and the nation state, then maybe global citizens. Now I think the Inter species, if you will, um, empathy is inevitable trajectory where I would welcome that. That would just be more thoughtful about other sending organisms and their wellbeing that we just look right past today.

Speaker 3:          02:26:11       It's kind of like being a slave owner in America back in the 17 hundreds, eh, the economy depends on it. I don't want to ask questions about how those slave ships, like I'm sure slave owners didn't visit slave ships in the few that did. And we're like, oh my God, we've got to change this. Right? You just don't want to look. And when you had the, once you have the economic alternative that doesn't have any money, any compromises, it's not like, oh, it's not really bacon or it's not really stake. It's the same thing. Just no animal died. Then you'll have the moral shift. I think profoundly we're, what is the current state? I mean, what products do they have that they're still in development because of the cost side at scale. So sure that this company's so, so when I mentioned the challenge of the plant based substitutes, is engineering something that people mistake?

Speaker 3:          02:26:54       I mean the, the the taste as good. That's the key engineering challenge here. The whole thing is just cost cause you can make something that's indistinguishable you, it just costs too much right now. Right. And there's three vectors are making it cheaper too are like total gimmes and one just was engineering. The gimmes are just making a bigger plant. So if you say you brew beer, if you just have a one liter of facility on your desktop at home and you're amortize the cost of your home to make one liter of beer at a time, it's gonna be expensive liter of beer, even if the formula is the same as a production planner. So scale. The second is a cheaper feed. Stocks just feed it something other than the very, very expensive serum. Using analogies in RND purposes to minimize variables using pharmaceutical grade inputs to the sort of feed the cells if you will.

Speaker 3:          02:27:31       What do they feed them? It's like a glucose mixture with amino acids, like a ceremony, like a blood serum. It's kind of like what you'd find in your blood doesn't make your blood cells live, you know? Wow. So, uh, it's a variety stuff that's used for very research purposes, but there's no reason it couldn't be that. But the reason it doesn't exist, there's no market for food grade, uh, you know, plant based feedstocks that cells can grow off of. Um, and now we have a good reason to do that. And then the third is just, uh, various engineering optimizations on the cells and the mixtures and like what combinations of cells do you want to try to boost the fat content? They've each cell or have separate, you know, muscle and fat. Do you want to have it all be like one, you know, one bite does all, or do you want to have two different types, you know? Well, I mean, if you, a few thoughts occurred to me as you're describing this. The first is, would this company, would this company utilize

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       the, the technology to produce human tissue, uh, for regenerative medicine or other purposes? And then I thought to myself, wow, you could also, you could become a moral cannibal if you wanted, like you could produce, not that you would want it to produce human burgers and eat them, but you could ostensibly do that. But that was just more of a thought. I was like, wow, that's, that's, that's well, you could also that small donor to revive and restore, which is trying to bring back the mammoth and extinct species, he could go back to have the mammoth. That's true. That's true. Without growing the mammoth. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. The little Panini Ganey, it's, this really gave me the brand burger brand. Uh, but, uh, it, is that maybe a, just a distraction or, I don't know the technology well enough to think of it from a, from a, from a, uh, from a medical, human medical is a good question. Yes.

Speaker 3:          02:29:11       The first sort of clean meat or alternative meat company that I came across was using, ironically, the reverse sequence, which is, it spun out of a company that was doing Oregon's, they'd printed bladders. There's a kid I met who's name is 18 years old. He's lived with a grown bladder for many years now. Um, and, and, but that was more like a three d printer. So when you're growing a specific Oregon that needs to be functional, it's super, super important to get a lot of the details right. Um, a chunk of skeletal muscle, you know what, if you just take it from the center piece versus the end with sin, you, you know, there's variation. If you want to make it function like a muscle and the connection to your sinews and what have you is you're making crown beef from scratching just a chunk of meat out of the middle.

Speaker 3:          02:29:51       It's just a chunk of meat. So do you have much bigger challenges with the printed Oregon's that lent itself naturally to a three d printer kind of approach and it, and it works wonderfully for some organs. They've been going kidneys and they're some of the connective tissue stuff around the reconstructive surgery, um, for the face and what have you. But it's slow and it's also great example of personalized one on one marketing. Like you want to go cells that are compatible with your body. So that you know, they would source of your stem cells to grow year Oregon for you. And it's, it's kind of a different approach and a number of ways intuitively from what you want to mass produce for consumption, where you could just have, you know, who cares where the cal, it could all be the same cow clone that you're growing the B from where every human implant wants to be a immune, uh, compatible with what you've got.

Speaker 3:          02:30:32       So the spinout didn't make as much sense to me to say, well, let's try to produce metric tons of meat using that three d printer. Again, any sense of a three d printer? And I'm sure they're gonna figure out some way to scale that up. But I just felt like, to me there was a definite technology risks there. Just, I couldn't see the hand waving argument says, why is that gonna get a thousand times better if for sure it could, but I don't see why it has to. It might not. Whereas this other thing, growing cells in a VAT inherently scales, it's like just have a bigger fat. It's like it's three d to start with. It's not a tutee lettering. There's something about the manufacturing method I guess that's been borne out and things like brewing beer and in a variety of fermentation tasks where you kind of understand how to generate metric tons of stuff with the fermentation.

Speaker 2:          02:31:13       For people listening like myself who are not particularly, uh,

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       I'm being generous, not technically trained, I'm certainly not an engineer by any stretch, uh, who want to make themselves more scientifically literate. Are there any books or resources or approaches that you would recommend? Yeah, there's two things that jumped to mind. One is the general purpose overview of what's important. Almost like a survey level where if you're just a business executive and you want to make sure you're not blindsided by some development that may be relevant than not be a practitioner. And then there could be a question of, well, is there something that like let's say you're a farmer, autonomous vehicle driver and now you're looking for the next thing, like what might you want to study to engage in the economy as a practitioner? And there are some areas that are more, I think easily approached to another. So on the, so first than the overall survey, I think there are some writers who do a good job bringing you with a sort of overview mentality too.

Speaker 3:          02:32:13       Like what's really going on in the world. People like Kevin Cavey, Kevin Kelly, um, and maybe Matt Ridley and maybe, um, and a few others like this, uh, going back with Hostetler and good electric Bach. There's, there's been a variety, but I might highlight, let's say Kevin Kelly. Yeah. Because the single book that's had the most influence on me and my entire life is one of his earlier ones called out of control. And it really started my lifelong fascination of the biological metaphors in technology. Everything from all that stuff we're talking about earlier about selling automata and iterative algorithms and evolution is itself an iterative algorithm. The power of evolution, the power of genetic engineering, all this stuff. So he was ahead of his time. He wrote this book last century and it recently got translated to mandarin and it's just in the current days, one of those is probably the most popular books in China today, even though he wrote it decades ago.

Speaker 3:          02:33:01       Um, because it's actually very relevant today. So that'd be a good starting point. I think it segues into the technology that either as a practitioner or just you can read about this. Um, if you just direct yourself, either simple Google searches or there's the particular book I point out just to learn about deep learning, learning about, and y'all networks. The reason I say that is I've never seen a greater demand for a technology and a scarcity of supply, like the salaries being afforded through the engineers in this area or out of control, you know, half a million dollars for beginners. Who are some of the more credible thinkers or practitioners who talk publicly about deep learning? Uh, let me think. Yeah, I'm trying to think. There's a good overview that the places, well I know that Coursera and some of these places are trying and I'm Sebastian runs a, um, you'd acidy are trying to do deep learning courses and such as an intro and I haven't taken those.

Speaker 3:          02:33:53       I don't know how good they, I would imagine even some of the, the very technical people have given non technical talks or whether it's at Google or elsewhere. I would imagine some of the thinkers that might be, uh, in their day to day work way too technical or specialized. I've probably given, this is a tough one, maybe for your show notes, I can try to come up with something. So part of the challenge I had is because I started a phd in this, I didn't seek the generic. Right. And I've been reading once in the back of my hand, I'm like, well, is that too technical? But I bet you I can dig some up. Yeah, sure. And it may sound self serving, but I've tried to give some of those talks and when I go to conferences a number of times, there's a real dearth of other people doing that same summarization.

Speaker 3:          02:34:34       But I would say that, uh, the group out of Canada, so everything from Hinton to Yoshua Bengio oil to Andrew Ng who's coming back, coming back to the u s in his case they are both of you know, leading edge of R and D and and such and they give really good talks. It's just not all of them. Some of them are deeply technical, some of them are overview. So I'll try to find other for you. Some examples of toxic gave that are for the average person. Perfect. Perfect. So that's, that's what we'll do. Then the last thing I want to say, but if someone actually wants to get into it, is it's actually remarkably easy to learn. When I said it's weird, the labor market arbitrage is, I don't think it takes more than six to eight months to become really domain expert in this. And you don't have to be spectacularly good at computer science before you, the background is, it's just so different from normal computer science.

Speaker 3:          02:35:21       Yeah. That arguably a new entrant has a great opportunity to just learn how these things are trained and forget about normal computer science. And you know, I can, uh, I can say a few things in response to that. The first is to recommend people check out. So we talked about Tim urban a little earlier and the tail end and so on. So I had Tim urban on this podcast and I asked him how he got up to speed on topics and he went through his exact, he just laid it out to them, just calls you call the guru on the mountain, just calls you on the, for those people interested, if they just search Tim Ferriss show Tim Urban, that'll pop right up. And he spends about 20 minutes talking about exactly this, getting up to speed, which, which should be I think helpful for a lot of folks.

Speaker 3:          02:36:04       Uh, and then in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast, you can just find this and we'll have some additional resources for people who want to include myself, uh, dig into this and learn, learn more. Uh, have you ever given a kid will be maybe the last question or second to last question. Have you ever given a commencement speech? Oh, funny. You should ask once for my high school and it was the most terrifying thing I've ever done. Like, like I love public speaking. I did debate back in high school and when I'm speaking to an audience that somewhat similar to the audiences I've spoken to before, check if it's on subjects that I've spoken about before, check is my power alley. I don't mind that. Oh my God. Trying to be relevant to a bunch of 18 year olds. Uh Wow. That was, that was back in Dallas.

Speaker 3:          02:36:47       Yeah. But I did that for years back. What did you talk with? Did you talk about what did, and maybe if, if it's broad, what did people respond most strongly to of what you told them? Oh, I can actually give you the shownotes. I managed to keep a copy and someone even translated in Spanish. Oh yeah. Great. So I'm trying to remember what it was. I was trying to, well here's it was the advice I got that really helped was think about when you were their age and the more time I spend thinking about what life was like with me, for me as a senior exes, I went to that same school, it all sort of clicked into place. The, what do I want to do with my life, what's going on in the world? And sort of weaving what I was learning from much capital and all the amazing entrepreneurs that I was seeing to convey to them like why you are entering the most exciting period of human history.

Speaker 3:          02:37:30       And I shared a little bit about things we spoke about on this podcast around things going on in synthetic biology, things going on in AI and what have you. Each of these areas is so rich with opportunity. And I gave him some general advice about just thinking about your career as a pursuit of passion, thinking about what you're uniquely good at, that no one else in your random walk through life may have done. And to keep that in mind as you hopefully infuse with a bit of technical open mindedness and creativity and childlike mind, an exploration of what you want to do, that they're just like, it's no better time to be entering the world and trying to make a difference. I tried to encourage them a lot to think entrepreneurially, to think about being change agents for the world. That everything that history books we've written about it is some new entrants entering a field they didn't know much about prior. Um, and encouraging them that this is what increasingly defines the world we live in.

Speaker 2:          02:38:20       You know, one, one question is somebody post to me when I was considering the question, we're considering unique strengths. I was like, I don't know if I have unique strengths. I do a lot of things kind of well, but I'm not sure. Yeah, maybe that's it. Maybe it's the pattern matching across those. And the question that they asked me was, what are, what are you, what do you find easy that some that a lot of your friends find hard? And I was like, Huh. And that actually ended up being very helpful, uh, question for somewhat indirectly landing on the strengths because I had a lot of trouble with that. Um, so maybe folks find that five is a good question. That helpful.

Speaker 3:          02:38:59       Yeah, because everyone does have some acid element to that question and they also have something they've done that back to that early question when I was in an venture capital, well, how am I different from every other venture capitalist who's, you know, trying to do this job. There's something about your personal background. It could be a language skill. It could be, wow, you had to take care of an aging grandmother in your youth and you, so you have a sympathy and empathy for what the age are going through that others lack. Like that actually could be a superhero strength if you want to be an entrepreneur for this aging demographic of baby boomers, uh, not everyone. In fact, very few entrepreneurs think about the agent,

Speaker 2:          02:39:32       for example. And I think you and your unique strength can also be an unusual combination of two strengths, right? I've heard of Marc Andreessen talk about, uh, layering public speaking on top of anything else and separating yourself. Warren Buffet would say something very similar. Uh, Scott Adams of Dilbert famous talked about this. Let's say you have an unusual combination, right? So maybe you have, that's exactly double degree and then you have an Mba that's right. And then you know how to debate. You don't have to be the best at the world at any of those things. There's a lot of wisdom there because it's that pairing

Speaker 3:          02:40:02       that, anyway, that's I think why most scientific breakthroughs are interdisciplinary. There are someone outside of the field of chemistry working with someone maybe in the field to come with a breakthrough, not someone at the core of, again, an academic discipline. And this is why universities are such areas of foment of innovation is because they have all the disciplines and the one physical campus. But if you just had a chemistry department or just the chemistry college, it wouldn't make world breaking changes. Right. The people who figured out the structure of DNA, we're like an orange theologists and a physicist, not chemists, right? Yeah. Crystallographers we'll actually, Roseland parks needs to get credit and it was going to shout out to her. So she's the traditionalist in that regard. But more and more people think about Elan, not domain expert entering a new domain. It's the cross pollination, right?

Speaker 3:          02:40:41       Being let's say software design with LEDs to the aerospace industry or [inaudible] Griffey into personal computers. Exactly. And so that pairing I think hearkens back to one other thought that might bring this whole thing full circle, which is every great idea is a recombination prior ideas. This is a a really powerful and simple idea that was popularized in three different books at the same time, which I think is Metta ironic that their argument at the same time as every good idea that happens around the same time. And the reason that's interesting is you can think in history of Edison and Tesla and Marconi is like the time was ripe given the breakthroughs that had just having electricity, magnetism to think about AC induction motors and radio and everything else got invented by all those same people are all within months of each other today writ large.

Speaker 3:          02:41:22       We have many more ideas. We have the Internet allowing us to cross pollinate ideas like never before. These two things that are unique to you, Paul on it together, the calligraphy and the, you know, computer design for jobs or what have you. The number of possible pairings is growing common editorially and I think that's why we have accelerating change technology. That's why Moore's law exists over such a long timeframe. It's not because of the semiconductor industry, it's because the number of idea pairings is growing as a to the end factor called Reed's law with the number of ideas and the planet. And once you break down the barriers between formerly discrete academic disciplines and strip all that vernacular way of their independent ways of communicating with each other that are so isolating. And you see the common patterns like wait isn't, that's just like a information theory I saw there and then my on the microbial design front, it's like then that same problems, all these rich array of new ideas is a sort of Meta reasonably, you can't really quantify how strongest would be.

Speaker 3:          02:42:10       We'll probably see more innovation than ever before and it's not just because we all will see more innovation than ever before. It's because it's common, it's real explosion of idea parents is happening globally and oh by the way, it's about to explode when the next 4 billion people come online and we go from two to 6 billion people online because of satellite broadband that space x and others are developing. That's all coming in the next five years. Like Holy Shit, we're going to have a just explosion idea, possibilities and innovation across the plant. Exciting time to be alive. Exactly. Especially when you have quantum computers accessing potentially parallel universes. It's right and where does it end? It doesn't. Uh, well, Steve, thank you so much for taking the time and as soon as a really fun and a is meandering is as the path I forged. Hopefully you had fun as well and to be continued.

Speaker 3:          02:42:57       Hopefully we have, we have many more conversations. Uh, and I've saw any more questions for you. So another fortunate for another time, but where can people find you online to say hello? See what you're up to? Sure. So on Facebook I'm just username Jurvetson and flicker username. Jurvetson uh, those are the ones, that's the ones I like most of my old writings or like the old stuff going back 2004 is mostly on flicker. And then my social network addiction does your, is Facebook and what is next for you? What's next? Oh, I'm going to start a new venture fund some point this year. Um, I haven't picked the name yet, but I'm bouncing some ideas around to focus entirely on purpose driven businesses with really long timeframes where we never sell a share. At least I don't. And, um, we, uh, we'll be investing in the kinds of things we've talked about today, companies that hopefully history books we've written about companies whose founders have a purpose greater than their own life on this planet in a purpose greater than certainly making a quick buck.

Speaker 3:          02:43:53       And there are more opportunities and more industry sectors and I've ever seen but not as if he's seen the 90s. It was like software semiconductors in life sciences. That was it. Like I never imagined I would invest and just [inaudible] dot com [inaudible] horribly wrong for a while. Just balls and all being the pinnacle or the Nadir of, of uh, intellectual curiosity. But now it's just a flourishing, coral reef was innovation everywhere and incredibly interesting tiny investing startups. Well, can't wait to see you do next. Thank you. And to everybody listening, there will be plenty of links in the show notes including the things we promised a resources to deep learning and much more. And you can check that out at tim.blog/podcast and as well always.

Speaker 1:          02:44:34       Thank you for listening. Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a few more things before you take off. Number one, this is five bullet Friday. Do you want to get a short email from me? Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering over the week. That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered. It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've somehow dug up in the uh, the world of the esoteric as I do. It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my close friends for instance. And it's very short. It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

Speaker 1:          02:45:25       So if you want to receive that, check it out. Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very next one. And if you sign up, I hope you enjoy it. This episode is brought to you by helix sleep. Last year I committed to making sleep a top priority, trying to fix onset insomnia or continuing to fix that depth of sleep, quality of sleep. I tracked a lot. I tested a lot and I revisited really everything from daily routine to the surfaces that slept on, playing with the chilly pad, whatever. And when I moved to Austin I got all new beds including mattresses from Helix, working with the world's leading sleep, certainly some of them he looked sleep, develop mattresses personalized to your preferences and sleep style to make sure that you can have the best sleep possible without costing thousands upon thousands of dollars.

Speaker 1:          02:46:20       He looked. Sleep has recently added a new layer to customize sleep with the helix pillow you all. New pillows are fully adjustable so you can achieve perfect comfort regardless of a sleep physician or body type or if you're a shifty type like me, I move around quite a bit when I sleep. Just take their simple two to three minute sleep quiz to get started and that will help ensure that they can build a mattress or pillow that you will love the mattress, whatever this be spoke mattresses that you arrive at. Uh, we'll get to you within a week and the shipping is completely free. You can try the mattress for 100 nights and if not completely happy, they'll pick it up and offer a full refund. I tested that refund policy because I test all of these sponsors and kick the tires a lot. We tested it and they came through on making sure that we got ultimately the right mattress for my body.

Speaker 1:          02:47:06       Type to personalize your sleep experience, visit Helix, sleep.com forward slash Tim and you'll receive up to $125 off your mattress order. That's helix sleep, h, e l I x sleep.com forward slash Tim for up to $125 off your order. This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic. You might remember four sigmatic for their mushroom coffee, which was created by those clever finish founders. And when I first mentioned that coffee on this podcast, the product sold out in less than a week, it lights you up like a Christmas tree, which can be really useful. However, recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum of new product and that is their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep. As you guys may know, longtime listeners, at least I struggled with insomnia for decades. I have a largely fixed that, but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy.

Speaker 1:          02:48:01       It still isn't easy very often and I found Reishi which had been fascinated by for a few years now has been very, very effective and calming their old formula, however, four Sigmadek old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners, all sweeteners for a host of reasons and I then just ping them and asked, hey guys, I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested, but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it. Too much of a headache, don't worry. And they are always game for experimentation and so they created a special custom version without the Stevia, without sweeteners. Now it is part of my nightly routine. Their ratio looks or comes in single serving packets which are perfect for traveling. In fact, I'm about to leave the country right now and I have a packet in front of me that's just going to sit in the end of my carry on bag.

Speaker 1:          02:48:53       You only need hot water and it mixes very, very easily. Here's some recommended copy that they put in the read, so I'm going to read it and I'll give you my take quote, a warning. For those in the experimental mindset, Reishi is strong and bitter in parentheses like any great medicine, so if the bitterness is too much, I recommend trying it with honey end or nut milk such as almond milk and quote. So I'm going to say, no, you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that fitter and maybe should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing young ins. When they say, well, I'm sure cool. Which means you're not able to eat bitterness. Bitter is in many cases and indication of things that help liberty toxification and so on. Not saying that's the case here, but I've tested this ratio, Letcher on family members, on friends, everybody has liked it.

Speaker 1:          02:49:47       It's a little bit or the, it's not that hard, so I would just say suck it up and no, don't put him honey or nut milk or any of that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea. It's delicious. I think if you like poo air, that kind of stuff, that type of tea, you're going to dig it. So just try it. Okay. Back to then my read. If you'd like to naturally improve your sleep, both onset and quality, I think naturally you might just enjoy this reishi elixir without any sweeteners. It has organic, Reishi extract, organic fueled, mint extract, organic rose hips extract, organic Tulsi extract, and that's it. No fancy stuff, no artificial watching McCall it anything.
