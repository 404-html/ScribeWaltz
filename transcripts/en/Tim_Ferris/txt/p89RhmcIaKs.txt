Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm looking at your stamp, the hunk over your name and they'll, it looks like, so it looks like it's Jean was something, right? Well, I don't know how to say your last name

Speaker 2:          00:11          right? I can't, I don't know one of your 50 language. I can't, I can't. Pretty good. I can't spot the other character. What is your choice? You know, it's because it's kind of a old, it's kind of an ancient calligraphy, older calligraphy, so it's way as in way phone, like bravery or valor. My father was, he was a nationalist, so it basically says my paternal Haim and then national valor

Speaker 1:          00:40          national valor

Speaker 3:          00:43          optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism. This episode is brought to you by trunk club.

Speaker 1:          01:07          I hate shopping with a passion. Going shopping for fun to me is like, let's go do our taxes. I don't get it. It's something that I have to do, but I don't like it at all and quite frankly, I'm not good at it and I always end up looking like I'm colorblind or homeless or something like that. So Roi really sucky and as a result I decided to try trunk club and I, I expected to dislike it quite frankly. But here's how it works and here's why I'm now a huge fan and just as a prelude, the items that I kept from them, I've had more compliments from random women on like t shirts and shorts and these funky green shoes that I got than ever before, which proves that I don't know what I'm doing. And they do. You go to trunk club.com forward slash Tim, you answer a couple of questions, then you get assigned a personal stylist.

Speaker 1:          01:54          So mine was Robin. Then they send you a trunk full of awesome stuff that they predicted you will like and look good in based on your sizes, preferences, et Cetera, that they've covered in this short phone call. It was really short and to the point then this trunk is delivered to your home. It's free of charge both ways. So you only pay for clothes that you keep. If you keep none of them, that's fine. You mail the whole thing back with a prepaid label. They even include tape to shut the box and you're good to go cost you nothing. There's no ongoing subscription. This is not a subscription service. So only when you ask for a trunk you will get a trunk. And I expected to keep maybe two items out of 18. I didn't want a thousand things sent to me, so I got about eight things sent to me and expect it to keep too, because they give you a preview online to show you what's coming and end up keeping four.

Speaker 1:          02:40          And I've been traveling with those. I've a very minimalist luggage, but I've been traveling for a couple of weeks and I've brought everything with me because it's been so multipurpose and so well received.

Speaker 1:          04:55          What's that? My Little Munchkins. This is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. I've been waiting to record this intro in this God damn garbage truck keeps backing up. So fuck it. We're going to roll with it and make that part of the ambiance. The Tim Ferriss show is where I attempted to deconstruct world class performers, whether they are chess prodigies, hedge fund managers, athletes, artists, comedians, celebrities, actors, you name it, scientists. We dig into everything. And the reason is you find that there are say morning routines. There are meditative practices, there are types of nutrition and training that transferred across all of these domains. It's pretty amazing that you find a common toolkit for excellence. And in this episode we have Jimmy Chin. And I remember at one point, uh, Jimmy was kind of introduced to me conceptually by someone who said if Chase Jarvis, the world class photographer and Laird Hamilton, arguably the biggest big wave surfer of all time, that's a biggest, the best big wave surfer of all time had a love child.

Speaker 1:          05:59          It would be Jimmy. And I was like, what the hell does that mean? Well, Jimmy is an artist, any professional athlete, often at the same time as a nat Geo National Geographic photographer, he has participated in, in documented breakthrough expeditions around the planet from climbing first ascents in the character rom to skiing first descents in the Himalayas, put another way. He is one of the few people to both climb Everest to the summit and then ski down from the summit, which is bonkers. Most recently he filmed the directed an incredible feature documentary called Meru, m e R, U, which is in theaters right now and one the 2015 audience award at Sundance. So what is Mary, I'll put this in perspective for folks in the high stakes game of big wall climbing. The Shark's fin on mountain marrow is, I suppose the ultimate prize. Everest is a cakewalk by comparison, sitting at the headwaters of the Ganges River in northern India, the shark's fin has seen more failed attempts by elite climbing teams.

Speaker 1:          06:57          These are the best of the best over the past 30 years than any other ascent in the Himalayas or the [inaudible] as they say. And this movie is a story of one group's journey to conquer it. And, uh, there are many mishaps along the way and it's a, it's a white knuckle quest of friendship, sacrifice, hope and obsession. How the hell Jimmy captured it on film while simultaneously risking his life is impossible for me to fathom, but we dig into it. So in this episode of the podcast, we talked about his origins training, nutrition gear, and tackling mirror, of course, uh, which just really blows my mind and I don't say that lightly. So suffice to say, if you want to benevolent kick at the ass, go see marrow. That's your assignment. I saw it with my family and uh, for probably 15 minutes afterwards, all they could say was, Whoa, whoa. Over and over again. My refrain was holy shit, under my breath, muttering, you know, 20 times every hour or [inaudible]. It's really mind boggling, which Jimmy pulls off. It's amazing, terrifying, and, and awe inspiring and inspiring at the same time. So that further ado, please enjoy my conversation with the incredible Jimmy Chin.

Speaker 1:          08:11          Jimmy, welcome to the show. Thank you. Nice to be here. It's, it's really been an interview that I've struggled with how to tackle because when I watched is it Meru or Maru, I don't know how to emphasize the name of this. I say marrow marrow. So it was basically 90 minutes of saying, oh my fucking God. Oh my fucking God. Oh my fucking God. So I feel like, uh, most of the questions that I would have formulated during that time might've been hijacked, but we're going to of course talk about that and many other things. But when you are asked by people, what do you do, how do you answer that? Because you have been described by a friend of mine as, as the love. If there were

Speaker 2:          08:56          one of Laird Hamilton and Chase Jarvis, which I thought was hilarious since, uh, both have been on, both have been on the podcast, both Amazing World Class Performers in surfing with layered in many other things. And then photography with chase. And I don't want the image in my head of them actually doing anything sexual. But how do you answer the question? What do you do? Because you do so much. Yeah, sorry, I was picturing something terrifying actually. But um, I feel like chase would, would really get the worst end of that. It'd be, um, you know, that's a question I get asked often and it's, you know, it's kind of amazing that I still don't have a very good answer for it. I generally break it down into three pieces. I'm a professional athlete, I am a photographer and I'm a film maker and that's kind of divided by, you know, my sources of income.

Speaker 2:          10:01          So I guess that's, that's the best way that I can describe what I do. And an athlete kind of entails everything from corporate speaking to, you know, endorsement of product or a brand ambassador, or working on rd and d with designers on jackets, you know, so they kind of spread through a lot of different areas. When I say athlete and the photographer is both commercial and editorial work and filmmakers kind of the same, you know, documentary filmmaking and, and commercial work as well. It not for those people who may not be familiar with your work, what, what would the, the Jimmy Chin highlight reel look like when you're introduced by a friend at a party who's had a couple of drinks, and so it was very enthusiastic when they want, when they want to really catch someone's attention with some of your accomplishments. What are the things that they throw out? I'd say, Oh wow. I mean, you mean flattering ones or.
