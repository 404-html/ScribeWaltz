Speaker 3:          00:04:45       Why? Hello Ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job each and every episode to deconstruct world class performers from every possible domain. Whether we're talking about entertainment, military, athletics, business or in this case something a little bit different to tease out the habits, maybe routines, maybe techniques definitely that you can use and apply in your own life. Now the subject matter and interviewee in this episode I suppose could be introduced at least should be introduced I think with a quote and that is those who are easily shocked should be shocked more often. That is by Mae West. So if you find yourself getting a little offended or find yourself recoiling or leaning forward with great interest and enthusiasm, notice that, notice all of those things. This is an unusual interview and it came about because I was walking through Dallas airport, I want to say at one point to catch connecting flight and I got a text from a friend and that the texts it Tim, exclamation point, exclamation point, hope all is well with you.

Speaker 3:          00:06:04       I have an interesting guest you might consider for the show Alice Little top earning core doesn't for the bunny ranch long backstory on how I know her, but seven figure earners, super smart. He would definitely be out of left field. Let me know if I can make the intro. Now for those of you who don't know, the bunny ranch is a legal brothel in Nevada, so I received this text from Rob Wolf. Yes, that's right. Rob, last name Wolf, w o l f Robb, wolf.com. You can check him out. He is the philosopher, king of the Paleo world. And I will let rob explain why he knows Alice some other time, but I get this text. So of course I say yes, yes, yes. Is she a good conversation? Zero to 10. How good at storytelling is she? And one thing led to another and then boom, I was connected with Alice.

Speaker 3:          00:07:00       So Alice Little on Twitter at the Alis, little is considered the number one top earning legal sex worker in the United States. She is a four foot eight, hence Ellis little legal sex worker at Nevada's world famous moonlight bunny ranch. Uh, and there are a number of associated brothels within that family, but we won't get into that. This episode is in case you haven't picked it up already. Definitely not suitable for work, people not suitable for work. And s f w can imagine you'd be listening to this on speakers at work, but just in case you have no common sense. There you go. And in this wide ranging conversation, we cover quite a lot, including technical sex tips, how Alice puts people at ease, including adult versions. Uh, and apologize, apologize, apologize. My apologies for the crunching in the background. That is my dog Molly chomping on a bully stick, otherwise known as bolt puzzle, otherwise known as bull penis.

Speaker 3:          00:08:01       So maybe very appropriate for this episode. Okay, back on track focus Ferris. Uh, we talk about BDSM. If you don't know what that is, we'll define it. And power play. We talk about three some do's and don'ts plus what she calls the Big Kao finishing move, uh, misconceptions about sex workers and the realities, why, what she calls the girlfriend experience. Gfe is her most popular offering, how she works with couples who want to explore new boundaries, new worlds and much more. Alice is also a vocal advocate for legal sex workers and the founder of the political movement, hookers for healthcare. A lot of back story there. She's been featured on ABC's Nightline and is no stranger to the conversation of what is called sex surrogacy that we get into a little bit and seeks to shift America's perceptions of sex workers and sex work. So there you have it. You can check her out@thealislittle.com and elsewhere. I hope you enjoyed this. Very unusual but very, very practical conversation as much as I did. So without further ado, here is Alice Little Alice, welcome to the show.

Speaker 5:          00:09:21       Hey, how are you? Thanks so much for having me.

Speaker 3:          00:09:23       I am fantastic and I'm well caffeinated. I've been looking forward to this conversation all day and if wanted to have this conversation or some form of it for many years because I want to say 10 years ago after reading the alchemist by Paulo Coelho, which has sold 100 million plus copies around the world, oddly enough, he ended up appearing in my last book, but that's a digression. I was in an airport and I picked up another book of his without really knowing anything about it and it was called 11 minutes, which is very, very different from his other books and it is a novel about the experiences of a young resilience sex worker and her journey to self realization through sexual experience. And it takes her around the world to Geneva and all these different locations and describes her lessons. And experiences and hardship, but also peak emotional experiences and so on. And I remember thinking to myself after finishing that, what a unique life. And at some point in my life it'd be amazing to sit down and have a conversation with someone in that world. And here we are. So thank you for making the time.

Speaker 5:          00:10:34       Absolutely. I'm really excited. Looking forward to this, we're going to have some fun.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       And on the book point I was looking through these bullets and I have so many questions for you, but one of the bullets was antiquarian rare book collector and I thought we would just start there for no good reason other than I'm curious. Do you ha, how did you get into that? First of all, and do you have any particular favorites that come to mind?

Speaker 5:          00:11:02       Yes, I'm a rare book collecting. Almost came naturally to me. My family has had a lot of heirlooms and antiques and a number of those include older familiar bibles. That just kind of sparked my interest from a young age. And then as I've grown my interests of diversified and I started looking into other types of publications that existed within that time period, I've always been attracted to things like leather bound books and the, the history of a book that is aged and has had ownership that there might be perhaps pencil marks in there or notes from the person who first owned at kind of putting their thumb print on that piece of history. And so I kind of think of those books is not just a piece of historical literature, but also a piece of historical evidence oftentimes as to how it relates to a particular person.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       Right. No, absolutely. That's one of my favorite thing. One of my favorite things about used books is, is in, in some cases, looking at the highlights and discovering what someone else thought was important in those pages. And you were, you mentioned your family, you were born in Dublin, is that correct?

Speaker 5:          00:12:12       Yes. Just outside of Dublin proper.

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       All right. Which might partially at least explain the natural red hair, uh, for which love known among other things and move to the u s uh, as I understand it at around age five. And how did you ultimately then find your way to sex work? Do you remember your first exposure or how that came to be? I would love to know the story, which I don't know and I had, uh, both myself and someone else trying to do background research. And part of what made me even more excited to have the conversation is there's not a whole lot. I mean there's a little bit, but there's not much. So I feel like this is very fresh, at least for me. So how did you find your way to sex work? How did that happen?

Speaker 5:          00:13:02       Growing up, I had always been a very naturally curious child. I would be the kid that asks one too many questions that had a little bit too much to say that always wanted to know more whatever it was that I wasn't supposed to know at that age. That's what I was most interested in. For example, I remember being a fourth grader and trying to check out the diary of Anne Frank and being told it was grossly inappropriate and going so far as to have my parents take it to the school board and petition for me to be allowed to read this book. So as far as being in, I guess connection to my body and my sexuality, as I progressed through my years, it came very naturally to me to be sexually inquisitive. I asked questions such as why is the model of monogamy? Why are we limiting ourselves to man and wife? What about other options? What other paradigms are there? What, what more is there to discover and learn from this? And that led me to discovering the cat house series, which featured the moonlight bunny ranch on Hbo. That aired for a number of years. It was incredibly impactful and it really kind of was the first sexual renaissance, at least in modern society that we have had. I watched that show growing up and I just admired the free sexual attitude that they had and the energy that they had.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       Were there any particular episodes or scenes or anything like that that, uh, stuck in your mind in particular? And where were you when you were watching this? Where were you living?

Speaker 5:          00:14:41       Oh goodness. I was actually living on long island in New York at the time and it would be way, way late at night.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       I grew up in long island, part of Long Island.

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       Oh my gosh. Are you serious? I grew up in Nassau County.

Speaker 1:          00:14:55       Oh yeah, I was, I was at Suffolk by myself, but I spent a lot of time in NASA as well. Okay. All right. Strong island reunion. Unexpected. I like it. Uh, so you're watching this series. Are there any particular moments or scenes or characters are really stuck out to you?

Speaker 5:          00:15:13       Air Force. Amy was definitely one of the most prominently featured women on the show and she captured me everything from the way that she carried herself to the language she used when talking about her job and the relationships that you had with clients. And she was willing to show things that many people oftentimes didn't consider, such as couples being at the ranch or BDSM being an option. She's even had an episode specifically showing pony play before, which is when somebody is hooked up to a cart and actually pull somebody around acting as if they are acumen pony.

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       I was going to ask, I wasn't sure if, uh, what variety of pony play. We were talking

Speaker 5:          00:15:59       pretty fantastic stuff. I just really loved that free ability to explore and innovate in this sexual way. And it really spoke to me. I was at the time a BDSM educator and still am to this day. I travel around the country. I presented all sorts of different events and panels and could you decide next step,

Speaker 1:          00:16:23       sorry to, to interrupt a Q defined for people. And I think we'll probably stop a few times in this conversation to do this. Uh, BDSM, having lived in the bay area, I've since moved, but in the bigger there for 17 years and having taken tours of the armory and so on, I am familiar with BDSM or what it is at least. Oh yeah, it's a wild spot. Uh, for those people wondering. Yeah, you can look it up. The armory, they buy a 50 gallon drums of lubrication, uh, at a time, which apparently you can get on Amazon prime, which I can't imagine as a net gain for Amazon, but I'm going off the rails. So BDSM, what is BDSM?

Speaker 5:          00:17:02       There are multiple different ways to define BDSM, but simply put, it's an acronym that can stand for several different things. Anything from bondage, discipline, sadism, Mac masochism too. Sometimes it's been used to describe say bondage, discipline, dominance and submission. So the exact wordage and the exact verbiage changes depending on the circles. There's not 100% agreement as to which letter has which particular meeting. But generally speaking, it's divided up into BD for bondage and discipline. D S for dominance and submission and s m for sadism and masochism.

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       What of all of those, what I think many of those are somewhat self evident or people can envision what they mean. What is discipline? What does that mean?

Speaker 5:          00:18:00       Discipline in the context of Bdsm is the exchange of a physical or emotional control over someone. Where you're either say spanking them or perhaps going so far as to verbally chastise them if that's the agreed upon that dynamic, it's set up to kind of recreate that structure. Often found within the military where there's this chain of command in this understanding of who reports to hill within the BDSM culture. Sometimes that discipline will enter into a submissive dominant relationship where that's used in combination with their relationship.

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       And, uh, it makes me think of it, I don't think this quote applies everywhere, but I want to say may west, but Mae West is kind of like the female version of a Mark Twain. You can kind of attribute any quote to her. So I may be getting the attribution wrong, but the quote was, I don't think she'd mind either. The, the quote was something along the lines of, uh, everything in life is about sex except for sex. Sex is about power. And, uh, that the, at least in the BDSM world, I imagine that would have some application, but the BDSM then it sounds like based on what you said, your fascination with that or even teaching that predated your, uh, work as a sex worker. Is that right?

Speaker 5:          00:19:27       Yes. I celebrated my 18th birthday by going into a dungeon space in New York City for the first time and finally getting to interact with this community that I had been waiting to for a number of years. My interest in BDSM started very organically in high school. Things like tying up my first girlfriend with rope and kind of enjoying that and it led me to discover the BDSM community. And from there I was just chomping at the bit to get that education and that knowledge.

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       And when did the then, when did the uh, or how really did the sex work enter the picture?

Speaker 5:          00:20:07       There's a very fine line between BDSM and sex work in the sense that both are very sexually charged activities. It's, it was very comfortable and easy almost for me to make the jump from one to the other. It was a very conscious decision where I sat down one day and said to myself, where do I see myself going within the next year? Where do I see myself going? The year after that? What about five years? And when I really sat and thought about it, I saw myself entering a profession that allowed me to connect with people on a intimate level more so than what society generally allows for. In the past, I've worked as a massage therapist do I got to develop that hands on relationship with the clientele, but it kind of just fell short of that deep personal intimacy that I was looking forward to. I've always felt that life is about enrichment, both for our own betterment as well as the betterment of those around us. And for me, sex work ended up being the perfect channel to do that.

Speaker 3:          00:21:11       You've done a number of other things. You mentioned massage therapist, and please correct me if I'm wrong because of course you should. Everyone should be cautious about believing everything they read on the Internet. But I, uh, emergency medical technician, jockey at race tracks. Those are other things that you tried, correct?

Speaker 5:          00:21:30       Oh yes. I have tried a little bit of everything under the sun trying to find something that just felt right. I wanted to find a job where not only did I feel comfortable with what I was doing, but I also felt a more meaningful calling than it just being a job. But it actually had a deeper purpose to it. That kind of relates back to the book you mentioned 11 minutes where she goes through the sexual journey and kind of finds herself it various true for many of us sex workers, that message of self discovery and sexual freedom and that ability to explore those parts of ourselves and share them with what are formally strangers is incredible.

Speaker 3:          00:22:15       What was your first, or what you would consider your first Gig? I suppose I'm, I, I'm going to stumble a little bit because I'm not, I'm not sure which labels or words to use. So if I offend, please forgive. But what was your first, I guess, client engagement as a sex worker? Do you remember your first experience and could you describe it for us or one of the first,

Speaker 5:          00:22:38       I remember it very, very crystal clear. The bunny ranch maintains a set of forums online which allows for a greater depth of communication and intimacy before we even meet face to face. It allows, the lady is like myself to post photos, different interests kind of share about us on that humanistic level rather than just that appearance level. I had posted about a particular interest I had in one of these specialty rooms at the ranch. I had simply said, hey, I'm something I'm really looking forward to trying. I'd love somebody to come out and spend that time with me. And within the week I had an email and it was my first appointment. The gentleman called, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:23:23       I'm sorry, what was the room? Maybe we'll get to it, but

Speaker 5:          00:23:27       oh it is. This set up where it's an indoor Jacuzzi with an attached suites next to it. This way you can come and go between the Jacuzzi and the bed as comfortably as you, so please.

Speaker 3:          00:23:39       Got It. Okay. Please continue. Sorry. So you, so you received an email from a client?

Speaker 5:          00:23:47       Yeah. And they're like, I love this idea. You have, I'm interested. Let's do it. So of course I have all the nerves and anxiety that comes with the first appointment in a new industry and everything ended up going as smooth as clockwork. It was just so much simpler than my mind made it out to be. I tend to overthink and overanalyze things. And so I naturally always prepare for the worst. In any scenario, what happens if I make a mistake? What if we don't connect? What if something happens in the Jacuzzi brakes? I tried to always plan for such contingencies and at the end of the day, the reality was, is the intimacy just very natural and comfortable. And to this day that client is still one of my regulars that I get to see and connect with fairly often.

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       All right. So you mentioned you were nervous, highly analytical by nature and then it went like clockwork. What is the format of one of those first encounters? And what I mean by that is I've read uh, that and I actually don't know where this term comes in, but I've read about negotiations. So it seems like you get paired with a big sister and then there's a sit down with the client. Is there a negotiation today? Did I misread that? And what role does the big sister play or the more experienced woman?

Speaker 5:          00:25:14       Well to start with, I'd Kinda like to describe what it's like when you come into the ranch cause that kind of helps set the stage for what inexperienced there is. Like. Sure. Either either somebody would set an appointment with a particular lady or they would come in and request a lineup. If you choose to request a lineup, all of the available ladies will come out to the parlor. We stand in the line, introduce ourselves and after we introduce ourselves, you're free to walk up to the lady of your choice, take her by the hand and go for a tour of the property. The bunny ranch is an incredibly historic property. It's been there since the 1950s it's beautiful and has been many times remodeled, revamped and renovated, so it really is a top of the line gorgeous facility, so we like to kind of showcase that in addition to some of the different specialty rooms, suites and offerings that we happen to have at the ranch.

Speaker 5:          00:26:10       After the tour, the guest in the lady, then go back to that ladies room where they will then set and have a negotiation. If the lady is Neil for the first couple of times they'll introduce the big sister or a mentor who's an older, more experienced lady that's been there for a little bit to kind of help you through those first couple of times until you start to feel comfortable and more confident during the negotiation. That's where we kind of have a conversation. I hate to use the word negotiation because it feels very business. I like to think of it more like having a conversation with a friend. It's something that happens very organically. It gives me the opportunity to get to know who you are on that personal level and also kind of let you know a little bit about myself. When it comes to intimacy and attraction, it's so much more than just that skin level.

Speaker 5:          00:27:04       It certainly goes deeper, so I really like to take that time during that first few moments to really get to know who somebody is as a person beyond their at a brothel. They're interested in services I like to take a little bit longer than most in that particular regard. During the negotiation we'll also talk about what particular activities we're interested in, what sorts of fantasies they may have, what sort of special requests that they would have, and from there we kind of formulate what our time together is going to look into feel like. How long would it be like to spend together? Would we like to stay in my room or are we interested in one of those specialty sweets I mentioned earlier? Is there a particular activity that they want to try or is there a second lady they would like to involve in the encounter? That's kind of where we get to shape and figure out what we're going to do. And after that point you would then go to the office. They handle all the financial transactions very discreetly. The ladies don't actually have any interaction with the client's personal information for their protection. All of that is handled by the cashier. We then get a set of sheets, couple towels, perhaps a bottle of champagne for fun and head back to my room where the Sweden. We're all fun and adventure. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       So I want to dig into a few followup questions. Um, so you sit down and I think in my mind, uh, I'm, I'm envisioning, I've only seen the first installment of the film, 50 shades of gray where they're having this conversation about what are the, the go no go rules. Uh, I suppose which, uh, among my friends who do BDSM of course is very, or it's on some level, seems very familiar. Uh, what are the, what are some of the questions that you'd like to ask or the most important questions that you ask?

Speaker 5:          00:29:01       I tend to work with a very wide variety of people and more often than not I work with people that I've had the opportunity to communicate with via email. That's given me the opportunity to tech to kind of get to know them and their personality a little bit. So I'm able to better adjust the types of questions I ask. For example, if I have a couple that is never had a third person involved in any sort of sexual encounter, the very first thing I'm going to ask is what are you comfortable with? What are you not comfortable with? And allow them to start setting their own particular boundaries. Cause with a couple of you certainly don't want to violate any sort of preexisting communication agreements that have made. And so I like to make pay on honor almost to their relationship and kind of allow them to dictate in a way to me where are they see me fitting into the puzzle of their preexisting connection versus

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       what if, sorry, not to interrupt, but I'll probably interrupt a lot. So let's see. A couple comes to you and as you noted, perhaps they've never had this experience. And so you ask them what they're comfortable with and they're not sure, and they ask you, what would you suggest as guidelines or how should we do this? We've never done this before, we're not sure what would make us comfortable or uncomfortable. What types of guidelines might you offer them or suggestions?

Speaker 5:          00:30:27       The very first thing that I like to start with is a very simple and really fun getting to know you. Exercise, of course, dig into a little bit more of an adult level. I find that here,

Speaker 1:          00:30:40       and this is an adult show so we can get into the details. It's okay.

Speaker 5:          00:30:44       Oh, fantastic. Here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:30:47       Yeah. For those parents in the car with their kids right now, I'd recommend earmuffs or having a pause break for birds and the bees conversation and we're back. So please continue. Yep. So, so people are looking for suggestions from you as a couple. What do you do? And you mentioned an exercise.

Speaker 5:          00:31:03       Yes. The very first thing I like to start with is a foreplay exercise. Women take significantly longer to become aroused, but then men, that's a biological fact and oftentimes in sexual encounters, there's not enough of that warmup period, especially during the get to know you, that first encounter with somebody. That time needs to be even more so explored and even more so embraced and so I like to simply start by the two of us, either myself and the wife or myself and the husband undressing one of the partners very, very slowly and essentially while they have their eyes closed. This does a couple of different things. First, when you close your eyes during any sort of intimate encounter, it's going tighten all of your other senses. Your sense of smell becomes significantly sharper, where you're able to smell a hint of perfume, where that width of Cologne, when you close your eyes, you feel every single touch of the fingertip, the pressure of the nail sliding over your backer, over your partner's nipples.

Speaker 5:          00:32:02       It's incredibly arousing and just that one simple thing adds a certain depth and really lets you sink into what's happening and appreciate every single movement. I kind of like to think of sex as a dance. In a way it's working with a partner or partners. You're coordinating your movements and your energy, you're breathing oftentimes will become subconsciously synchronized and just naturally fall into this flow where you're exploring, kissing, touching, and just embracing and letting things really naturally go with the flow and your mind kind of takeover instinctually rather than pre programming and deciding, first I shall remove the top, then I shall slowly remove this broad, but with my teeth that that removes all the sexual spontaneity out of it. There has to be that certain organic element to it. Otherwise you're looking at a porn, not a true encounter.

Speaker 1:          00:33:02       Okay, so you get, so you get to, you slowly address one of the partners. Then then what happens?

Speaker 5:          00:33:10       Then we go to each of the other two and turn either myself or the husband first, whichever things just happened to come naturally. Same process repeated over again. And at this point I'm going to start encouraging them to not just explore each other and spotless, but also explore their body. Or I also explore my body as well. So I might take his hand and kiss his fingertips and literally holding his hand, trace it down my neck and price it onto my breasts. This way he feels comfortable and that touch barrier has been breached. Once that's happened, I've had found that naturally people settle in a little bit more and they start to give themselves permission to enjoy that encounter. And Really, oh, that's really happening now. Oh, I can do these things. I do have the power of the sexual expression and freedom here.

Speaker 1:          00:34:03       So in that circumstance, when you look over your experiences with couples, what this, this is going to sent might sound funny, but what are the smarter guys do and what do the not so smart guys do? And the reason I ask is I recall a conversation I had with a dear friend of mine who for a period of time, he's happily married with kids now and has, has voluntarily chosen a monogamy. But uh, back in his sort of peak athletic, uh, years, he was a master of threesomes and I mean really just seemed to have near magical powers. And he said, he said to me at one point, he, he, he observed that if you have, if you want to have threesomes with say, a girlfriend or a wife, he said, rule number one is you do not penetrate the other woman on the first date. And he said, if you do that, you can have many, many, many threesomes. But if you penetrate the other woman, I e not your girlfriend on that first encounter, you could completely shut her down in meaning your girlfriend and then you've just, you've just ruined your opportunity to have an ongoing enjoyable experiences as a, as a couple. So I don't know if that's true. It sounds like it's plausible, but are there certain things that smart guys do versus not? So smart guys are experienced guys in that type of circumstance.

Speaker 5:          00:35:34       So the smart guys communicate, they're very, with their significant other as to what their desire is, what kinds of fantasies they want to see and what kind of an experience they want to have. They also have to be willing to wait until their partner is comfortable and ready to have that experience. Trying to manipulate your partner, intuit sexual encounter is the absolute worst thing that you could do. And that is typically the first thing that I see couples do when they're doing it the wrong way. If the guy is doing it for very selfish reasons where you know, he doesn't really care of his wife's into it, this is all about him, those guys, they're not being respectful of the woman's right over her own body, let alone their agreed upon relationship. So I would say that the very, very first thing is communication followed by consent.

Speaker 3:          00:36:30       Well, how do you help to break the ice? If, let's say you, you've removed the clothing, you've traced someone's hand, maybe both the, let's just assume for the time being man and a woman. So both of their hands on your bodies, uh, if, if they're still not sure what to do, what, what is a good next move? If you're directing things,

Speaker 5:          00:36:56       if I'm kind of playing ringleader as it was and we're still reaching this point where we're a little bit tentative and that intimacy hasn't quite clicked into place, the next thing we'll often go ahead is move onto, but it's called an edible body massage. This is where you use body safe products that also are either flavored incented, for example, um, uh, honey massage lotion, and then we'll go ahead and lay one or both of the partners down and slowly use that and warm them up that way. Again, keeping with that Taj, keeping with that sensory input and really allowing everyone to participate. This isn't a scenario where one partner is on the other side of the bed. This is the scenario where both myself and the wife may be massaging the husband or they must be massaging me either which way. It just allows for that continuation and natural flow of energy and chemistry.

Speaker 3:          00:37:55       Hmm. What are other things that, that you do in those circumstances to make the woman comfortable? Are there any other particular tricks of the trade or phrases or questions or guidelines that that you use?

Speaker 5:          00:38:12       This is going to be an interesting one, but since this is an adult show, yeah. One of the things I liked to do to help make it the woman relax a little bit more as I like to make her have an orgasm. This can either be through digital stimulation with my fingers or perhaps with a sex toy. Perhaps with the assistance of her partner playing with her nipples are kissing her, allowing the to go ahead and have that first orgasm in that threesome, it makes her feel secure that she's not going to be a less than partner. Many women have this concern about this comparison between themselves and the other women. I think it's one of the reasons why I have so many couples is because being a forefoot eight petite redhead, there's not a lot of women who can look at themselves and feel compared to me, the body type, the height. It's such a complete night and day difference that they feel comfortable sharing their significant other with me because they don't see me as a threat to their relationship. And then when we go ahead and give that woman the first orgasm, it's solidifying her place within that sexual dynamics saying yes, your feelings, your sexual experience is absolutely important and it's going to be a part of this. Women are lucky we get to come more than once. And so why not start things off with a bang?

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       Why not indeed. Uh, what are some of your best practices for helping a woman to orgasm? Do you have any favorite sex toys? Do you have any of many women have difficulty orgasming or May, may, may be coming into an experience, perhaps not, uh, with your clients, I don't know, but in orgasmic, right, they haven't experienced that before. Uh, what are, what are some of the approaches or, or sort of technical tips or, or toys that you use that you've found to be particularly helpful?

Speaker 5:          00:40:13       Sure thing. I happen to work with both couples as well as single women many times over this particular problem. And believe it or not, it's a societaly endemic problem where the majority of women have trouble reaching climax either single by themselves or with a partner. So I think talking about something like this was really important personally. I always love to suggest the simplest toy, which is a wall plug in Hitachi magic wand,

Speaker 1:          00:40:44       great device.

Speaker 5:          00:40:45       It is the best. And as far as sex safety goes between partners, always make sure you're putting a condom over the top of the Hitachi because we want to play safe with our toys. So when we're going ahead and using the Hitachi, that is absolutely fantastic for direct clitoral stimulation. You can go ahead and an increase or decrease the intensity by pushing down harder or softer and if that still isn't quite doing it. The second thing I like to do is a simple one or two finger insertion. Nothing too much more than that, especially on the first orgasm cause that's kind of a a warmup. We're like diesel engines. It takes us a moment to get warmed up, but once we're there we're going to stay pairing for a while.

Speaker 1:          00:41:31       And so you're doing the one or two finger insertion along with the Hitachi magic wand.

Speaker 5:          00:41:36       Yup. Just same slow, repetitive motion in and out. And the whole thing that a lot of guys make the mistake on when trying to help their partner climax is variation. In my experience, most women actually prefer a more rhythmic approach into at a simple one, two, one two in, out in out tends to work a lot better than one to one to Bonn too in out, in out like God, it's very difficult for a woman to achieve climax that way. And that's just a biological difference between men and women. I've noticed that men tend to like variation when pleasuring themselves are receiving a hand job for a woman. They liked the difference in strokes, length and pressure, whereas when they were pretty consistent about what we like, we like to do what we do and stick with that. So it's okay if you're doing the same thing over and over again if fits working. Trust me y'all now.

Speaker 1:          00:42:36       So a couple of a couple of notes on the Hitachi Magic Wand for people. Uh, a as you can certainly find it at just about any sex shop, you can certainly buy it also online, Amazon, etc. End It can serve double duty. For those of you who might've read tools of titans for relaxing, uh, hyper tonic or spasmed muscles. So for instance, in the forearms, in the forearm flexors and so on, if you've really tight forearms, a gymnast's, in fact, former national team, men's coach, uh, coach Summer Som Mer recommended the Hitachi magic wand, but not for sex, for relieving muscle tightness. So if you need that excuse, uh, guys, you can grab one of those and then your girlfriend will steal it from you. Um, but that, that's, that's one. Do you use the high or the low setting? Most often?

Speaker 5:          00:43:29       I'm kind of a low setting girl. I kind of just prefer that, that lower intensity level and I kind of, we'll save that higher mode for more of the very end of the session. If you really want to ramp things up and, well I guess the best way to describe it is that the Hitachi has two settings strong and crawling up the walls strong

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       and uh, how long is, let's just say in the case of the couple like uh, uh, a minimum or an ideal length of session, how much time do you have?

Speaker 5:          00:44:04       It completely varies from couple to couple. Generally speaking, for somebody first encounter, I like to go ahead and include something called an outdate. What an outdate is, is that it actually allows us to leave the brothel and then travel anywhere we would like in Nevada. So perhaps we all go out for lunch first. This way we get to have some conversation, get to have a little bit of that mental stimulating for a play, not just the physical stimulating for play. Then after lunch we'll head back to the branch and from there go ahead and kind of enjoy our sexual festivities. Couples that are on say, a traveling time schedule where they only have a couple of hours. It's absolutely okay to spend just two hours with some day or even just a single hour with someone, but generally speaking for couples, I recommend going ahead and investing in a slightly more elaborate experience, especially for their first time because that attitude and that energy is going to make a huge difference in regards to what you experience here at the ranch. With me, that little bit of extra connection time of just going and having a simple meal with someone, it gives all the stress and moment to leave your body. It allows all of your anxiety to kind of go, we'll buy in dissipate and by the time we make it back to the bedroom, you've already relaxed the butterflies to have calmed down and you feel a little bit more comfortable with where things are going next.

Speaker 3:          00:45:33       What? What are some of the most requested activities? You mentioned activities a few times what or what or if you were looking at the pie chart of requests that you've received, what are the most often requested activities?

Speaker 5:          00:45:52       I would say that there are two different things that would kind of fall into that pie chart. It would probably be more accurate to go ahead and label it as both experiences and specific activity requests and sometimes those things go hand in hand or they go separately. Probably my most requested experience is something called the girlfriend experience. It's where we take things to that next level of intimacy and I oftentimes it's argued it could even border on sexual surrogacy where you're taking things that next step further. That's where we're going out to eat together. We may choose to go to a concert together. We're going to keep in touch and communication between our time together via text or email or perhaps phone calls. It allows for that depth and that building of relationship that really transcends beyond just a single standalone session. Absolutely. The majority of my couples and the majority of my clients in general tend to fall into that more girlfriend experience category.

Speaker 5:          00:46:51       The second most requested experience is kink or BDSM and fetish activities. This may be in the example of a couple, a couple that is interested in bondage and discipline where I might teach the husband the safe way to use rope to tie up his wife and then explore how to use floggers and sex toys to give her that sexual release. Whereas say with a single male, he may be interested in having me dominate him instead and he wants to explore his submissive side and his submissive energy. So I'd say that would probably be the most second requested category I have. And the third would probably be two girl in counters. Having a threesome is on almost every single guys bucket lesson. There's no better place in the world then the bunny ranch ticket to have that encounter. We're professionals. I mean we'll take care of you the right way.

Speaker 1:          00:47:46       All right, so these, those sound like the experiences, if we were getting into specifics, are there any

Speaker 5:          00:47:53       as in more so the specific sex acts that ourselves

Speaker 1:          00:47:57       yeah. With, within any of those buckets. I'm just so curious to, to know, uh, because I remember having a conversation living in San Francisco for a long time, getting to know people who are very sex positive and support sex workers in, and one of them said, for instance, that, uh, they found, uh, like oral sex blow jobs to be very, very commonly requested because a lot of men are not given that by their primary partner. Maybe their primary partner just doesn't enjoy that for whatever reason. But I don't know if that's accurate since I'm not a sex worker myself. So w what are some of the most frequently requested activities or act?

Speaker 5:          00:48:41       I think this one may be more specific to me than necessarily the experience of other ladies. But very frequently I have men coming to me that want to have sex while standing up because I'm so petite, I only weigh 85 pounds. You can literally pick me up and have sex while standing in a variety of different positions. I also happen to be extremely flexible so I get a lot of requests for a Kamasutra positions or perhaps some sexually creative possessions where the man is standing and the woman is in doggy position at the end of the bed or perhaps we're having sex using a chair or in the case of someone with disabilities, perhaps we're having sex and using their wheelchair as sex furniture. All of those things often are requested. Oral sex also huge, huge request. It feels great. A lot of guys enjoy that sensation because like you had mentioned earlier, it truly is a rarity and for them it's a treats as far as specific sexposition goes when then you have got to start writing your men. They really like it when a girl is on top and is willing to take control. Oftentimes in modern society we still see this paradigm of man on top woman below this standard missionary position being the one and only position that men are getting to experience with any sort of frequency. So a variety of positions are often requested from cow girl to reverse cow girl doggy style and everything in between.

Speaker 1:          00:50:14       You mentioned, I'm sure we'll come back to a lot of different details, but you mentioned in passing sex surrogacy and I was hoping you could just take a minute and define what that is.

Speaker 5:          00:50:27       Oh, absolutely. Sex surrogacy is kind of an interesting thing because the definition tends to be personal. With that being said, a universal way of looking at sex or I guess see in the most simplest of forms is that rather than entering a traditional relationship with say a, um, the average woman that you would meet at a bar, you are instead choosing to enter into a longer based relationship. In this case with a sex worker in kind of replacing the traditional girlfriend or wife with core doesn't s court companion. You're filling that role with something other than what is the societal norm. It's very interesting though because when you think about it, didn't the King of England have multiple ladies in waiting? Didn't he have multiple women that he was having affairs with and having sex with? And that's really true for a lot of history. When you look back that having this secondary person or oftentimes in the case of sex surrogacy, this primary person being the person who is taking care of your sexual needs and desires, it certainly deviates from what we would expect out of society.

Speaker 1:          00:51:47       And uh, does this combine then in some cases or is it separate from a, because this is, this is something else that I wrote down, a consensual nonmonogamous, which it seems like you're an advocate for or at least know quite a bit about or are there particular, and I know this is a blended question, but are, do you have guidelines for people who are interested in exploring consensual, non monogamy?

Speaker 5:          00:52:16       Absolutely. Consensual non-monogamy. First off is defined as your partner knowingly allowing you to go ahead and have sex with another person. In this particular case with a sex worker, this has a couple of unique advantages over any other kind of consensual non-monogamy because first off, you know that we're professional. You know that I'm not seeking to steal your husband and try to marry him. That could be the versus thing from the case. And second, oftentimes there's a medical reason as to why people are interested in consensual or non monogamy. For example, the wife may have ovarian cancer and is unable to have sex because of the simple medical recent that it's, it's not feasible at that time. She may go ahead and acknowledge that her sexual needs and wants and desires. She's not able to take care of those for her husband at that time.

Speaker 5:          00:53:14       I'm a very firm believer that sex is a need, not just a want. It's been shown time and time again. It has a positive psychological effect on someone and it absolutely has positive effects in the overall experience of life. So by going ahead and allowing her significant other to see the sex worker, she is acknowledging not just his sexual needs but also doing so in the most ethical way possible. Your paying simply for a service which I am simply providing. I'm taking care of the need that at that particular time you're not able to fulfill. The wife has able to have a say over that because it's consensual. She's able to dictate, okay, these are this specific sex acts that I am comfortable with. Or instead say I am comfortable with everything but these particular acts and then she's allowed to then contribute her input. So as far as guidelines go for someone that was interested in something like that, we have to go back to the same number one I said earlier, communication and the willingness to have that communication followed by number two, consent. If you can get those two bullet points checked off, then you're well on your way to going ahead and entering this time of dynamic.

Speaker 3:          00:54:30       Uh, you, you mentioned, uh, before I completely derailed the train of thought, one example of type of client and you mentioned couples. Uh, my understanding is that you also have worked with a fair number of adult versions. Is that, is that accurate? Can you explain, just walk us through what that experience is like. I mean, how do you take someone, uh, presumably male, although that may not always be the case. Uh, and how do you make them comfortable? How do you walk them through that experience?

Speaker 5:          00:55:13       The very, very first thing, and I keep coming back to the same number one here, it seems to be very prevalent throughout my work is the very first thing is that communication aspect of getting to know them as a human before getting to know them. As a sexual cumin, I want to find out what someone's hobbies and interests are. I'd love to see a photo of someone's dog or hear about a funny story from when they grew up. That allows us to connect first on that friend level where we have that openness. At that point, I'm able to then ask questions such as what kind of sexual experiences have you had or what kind of sexual experiences have you not had? In many times of virgins, adult versions have never been on a date. They've never had a first kiss. They've oftentimes never proceeded past first or second phase, so in their heads, they're really not just an adult virgin, but they're a virgin to the whole dating experience.

Speaker 5:          00:56:12       In America. Unfortunately society favorites women when it comes to sex and relationships where women are sawed off to after by men, but men aren't oftentimes as sought after by women. Therefore we have a large sector of the population which is male and also a virgin in their twenties thirties forties and up. They've simply either never had the time to have the encounter. The opportunity has never presented itself. They've never specifically sought out something like that or perhaps they hire anxious. Perhaps they haven't had the ability to do so because they feel limited by a disability. For example, a large number of the adult versions I work with fall on the autism spectrum and for me it's understanding who someone is as a person and then understanding who they want to be as a sexual person and kind of developing our own customized date experience that allows them to experience the things that is that they are missing.

Speaker 3:          00:57:12       So this, this is fascinating with someone who say has autism and there's of course an entire spectrum depending on the severity of symptoms or the or the, the way it's been diagnosed and so on. But that would seem to also challenge maybe in some ways the tool that you keep referring to, which is communication and asking the right questions and so on. Uh, so what are some of the things you've learned after you've, say heard a story or two, looked at a photo of a dog, had a little bit of time to get the, get to know them as a person. Now it's time to progress to maybe phase two where you're starting to get to get to not only know them, but explore them as a physical human being, a sexual human being. What are some of the things that you do to facilitate that?

Speaker 5:          00:58:07       I like to communicate on several different levels. Communication isn't just a verbal, a lot of our communication is humans comes from that more subtle, either facial features, body posturing, how we lean in or lean away from something. And so when I'm working with somebody physically hands on, I'm also trying to read some of their body language and look for the social cues that someone is calming down in their respiratory rate as relaxed or instead they're leaning into an embrace rather than hesitant and pulling away and perhaps more nervous. For me, I never proceed to the next step or the next level of intimacy until we have reached that comfort barrier and then we're both ready to progress forward. Um, a number of my clients are war vets and they left for the military and completely lost the ability to have that normal first relationship. Now that they're getting to explore it for the first time, they're dealing with a number of different things, some of which have PTSD, some of which have hearing loss from explosives.

Speaker 5:          00:59:14       And so I have to be willing to communicate on whatever language basis, either verbally or non verbally that they're communicating in. So I have to have a certain level of flexibility when working with adult virgins because you really want to cater that experience and really create something that's going to be special, memorable and personal ball because this is a unique experience for them. There will never be a another first other than this one thing. So the way I look at it, I want to make that first time be everything they ever dreamed, hoped and desired.

Speaker 1:          00:59:47       So I'd like to get into some specifics related to that. So I remember when I lost my virginity and as I suppose fortunate to be pretty young at the time, but I was a nervous wreck. I mean I think that many guys are. So let's say that you're, you're sitting down with someone who's under very understandably nervous on, on some or many different levels. What are some of the specific things that you've done or questions you've asked or things that you've said to make them less nervous to make them more comfortable? I know it depends on the person, but what are some specific examples that you can give of anything that that you've done across clients to help them to melt into the moment so that they can be less preoccupied and nervous?

Speaker 5:          01:00:45       Absolutely. I think that happens on multiple different levels. The first thing I do is I like to create a certain ambiance in my room when we walk in. I like to create a visual change by going ahead and lowering the lights and I put on the little bit of relaxing background music. This way the rest of the world and the rest of the brothel and the rest of everything has the opportunity to kind of melt away for a moment. It's creating a space specifically for this encounter and kind of setting the stage that helps with that first step of visual of relaxation.

Speaker 1:          01:01:15       Do I to go to background music? Do you have any, any, any particular background music that you like?

Speaker 5:          01:01:22       I love Enya huge fan of Enya. It's soft, it's melodic, it's relaxing. It's very easy to take that to our romantic place and it's not so dominating lyrically that it would inhibit conversation and communication. It just flows very calmly and naturally in the background. Another one I really enjoy is Lindsey sterlings violin pieces. Those can be a lot of fun if you want something a little bit more upbeat and energetic, that's a lot of fun to listen to. And then the genre of chill step is the third music choice I tend to go to tends to have a little bit more of a beat and a rhythm to it and kind of help set more of that sexual tempo.

Speaker 1:          01:02:04       Love it. All right, very helpful. Okay, please continue. So you've set the the room tone so to speak. What's what, what then?

Speaker 5:          01:02:15       Well, go ahead and assume that the person I'm working with here is a neurotypical male virgin who has never even so much as kissed a woman before. And this is something I see almost every single week. So the very first thing that we need to do is established a physical, physical connection. This starts oftentimes with handholding and interlacing of the fingers playing with the fingertips and encouraging them to reciprocate that same motion, touching my fingertip, stroking my hand. From there, that progress is to perhaps gentle kisses across the neck and shoulder for you Jen. Something that is a little bit less intimate. Then lips on lips contact for that first time, kind of allowing someone to experience what that sensation is like cause just just stop for a moment and imagine that you've never kissed a woman before. You have no idea what that sensation is going to be like on your lips.

Speaker 5:          01:03:10       Is there a taste to the skin? How does the smell of her perfume or the shampoo she used affect your experience? By slowing things down and really, really exploring that first few steps of intimacy, it allows you to explore the depth of it and really appreciate that act for what it is for play. Going ahead and just having very, very nontraditional foreplay, such as gentle shoulder rubbing using my fingers to run them through someone's hair or tracing my fingertip over the outer edge of their ear, maybe running my fingers along their lower edge of their jaw. Those little acts of touching connection communicates nonverbally. That one, it's okay to touch me too and to, this is going to be a relaxing experience. I'm not going to try to undress someone, have them on the bed, on their back and try to hop on top of them and ride them til they orgasm.

Speaker 5:          01:04:09       That's not good. That would be the exact opposite of the kind of experience I want to create for my mail virgins. I want them to really appreciate that sexual connection. Another thing that's worth mentioning here too, and this is a very interesting thing, that more frequently than not male versions are not able to reach orgasm during their first sexual experience because of nerves and anxiety. It often does affect performance and that is a very normal biological occurrence. It's not something to be ashamed of or feel as if that ruins your experience. So I also like to set up the intention that the goal is to explore each other sexually. And if we manage to achieve orgasm during that process, all the better. But I don't like to place an emphasis on we're going until you orgasm because sex is so much more than the big finish, sexist, the journey.

Speaker 5:          01:05:07       It's an adventure. It's not just sex, penis and vagina. It's, it's so much more than that. And so I'd say overall from my virgins to make them feel comfortable is I let them know that it's not just sex, it's the touches, it's the kisses, it's their first kiss when I'm looking at them directly in the eye and I'm reaching my hand behind them and lowering their head towards mind and giving them that self confidence to reach out and lean forward and kissed me, that that's an incredibly powerful thing and it's an amazing gift to be able to give another human being.

Speaker 3:          01:05:43       Definitely. Uh, I think these examples you've given have been very helpful in terms of a client demographics and characteristics because many people listening may have had before listening to this, a certain image in their head of the client. Like who is the client who comes to, who goes to a brothel, uh, or works with escorts, for instance, what I mean, who goes to the ranch or works with sex workers? If you had to, to, to, to broadly paint, I mean, are there certain, are there certain demographics or psychographics that are particularly prevalent?

Speaker 5:          01:06:34       The easiest picture that I can paint is somebody who is over the legal age of consent. And with this, I will mention too, in that the northern brothels, you have to be 18 years of age. In the southern brothels which are near Vegas, you do have to be 21 of age. So do keep those things in mind. You have to meet the age requirements to enter the brothel and that's it, that that's literally the only requirement to be able to come to a brothel. I see men, I see women, I see individuals who are intersex. I have folks that are trans. I have folks that come to see me with no interest in sex at all, that are completely asexual and instead they just want to have experiences and cuddle with me. I see couples and adult virgins. I see nonverbal individuals who have to communicate using a tablet and I see folks that are in their seventies who are mourning the loss of their wife of 50 years.

Speaker 5:          01:07:33       I see everything from adult virgins who are 18 years in age to adult virgins who are 50 years of age. I see men who haven't had sex in 25 years and I see men who have sex on the frequent but they have a very specific fetish that they can't ask their general, like their general sex partner to fulfill for them. It is such an incredible rainbow of people that come to see me for just a huge, huge variety of women and unfortunately our society kind of has this stigma in a way. When we think of whoever awful client is where we painted this picture of this CD guy in his thirties isn't really well kept and probably has tattoos and piercings and just as disrespectful negative character I'm society. We have all these negative connotations with sex work, sex, work, clients with the reality of sex work is in this country that when you take a step back and look at the reality, I see everybody from the mailman to people who work in governmental office. The range is absolutely incredible.

Speaker 3:          01:08:46       What are some other misconceptions about sex work? Sex Workers, clients thereof, uh, any, any other misconceptions in particular that you'd, that you'd like to speak to or

Speaker 5:          01:09:01       in regards to the women themselves? There's this misconception about sex workers that we ended up here because of something that rather than choosing were reacting to something that happened to us that could not be further from the choose. The majority of women that come to work at the brothels are incredibly well educated, come from a variety of different backgrounds all over the country and a whole array of different ages and body types. Like to give you an idea, one of my coworkers, Emilia heart, she is just incredible. She has multiple college degrees. She's a massage therapist and is truly a brilliant mind meeting her for the first time. You wouldn't realize just how well educated she is until you get that opportunity to sit down with her and you hear the quality of what she's saying and you realize this is somebody that could be pursuing a doctorate if they so chose, but instead they've chosen to go ahead and embrace sex work and the one commonality that I have found between the women who choose to do sex work and then furthermore choose to do sex work on a longterm basis for be that six months, a year, two years.

Speaker 5:          01:10:17       Those ladies all look as sex work as a form of service to the community. It's something that we're able to do a genuine need. The society has and has always had that we're fulfilling or fulfilling a service just like anybody else, any other legal profession. We pay our taxes. We have to pass a stringent background check in order to have a license to work at the ranch for a required by law to go ahead and be tested for STDs and STDs every single week. It's an incredibly professional, upscale environment with incredibly high class women. And I wish that Maura Society would understand that sex is truly a societal need and so long as that need exists, sex work will always be the natural answer.

Speaker 3:          01:11:12       Well, I think this, this is

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       an important point because in the u s at least and elsewhere, certainly, I mean if you look at the war on drugs, which has been by almost any measure in a bismal failure with all sorts of perverse side effects and costs and ruin lives associated. If you, if you take something that is even more so in a neat, uh, human, not just drive but need like sex and try to in any way repress it or prevent it completely, which certainly happens in many different areas of the u s in different cultures in the u s that it will find some type of release valve whether you want it to or not. And that the more proactive, intelligent, uh, sort of benevolent way to approach that is to create a structure within which you can explore that or provide that safely with proper regulation and taxes and so on and so forth.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       So I really think this is an important point to underscore, uh, for many reasons. But the question I wanted to ask you, and maybe you can certainly provide thoughts on some of the other ladies, but aside from the services component and helping say these vets or, uh, clients who really need this, what else do you get out of it? Like, why do you, why do you do this? And it's not a moral judgment at all. Like I, I'm, I'm fascinated by it, uh, clearly. But like what do you, what do you personally get out of this that makes you enjoy the work?

Speaker 5:          01:12:58       Well, for me, what I get out of it is a very honest look at humanity and a very honest connection with other human beings in a deep and meaningful way that society otherwise could not provide for me. I've always long maintained that modern America is trapped behind the cell phone, behind the computer screen or we no longer interact with each other on that face to face level. We don't hug each other and we don't touch each other, and by virtue of my job, I don't get to just hug in touch the other human beings in my world, I get to interact with them in incredibly deep, meaningful ways, intimately, intellectually, and for me it's stimulating and it's enriching in my life. I find that it gives my life value and it gives my life purpose. There's so much to be learned by just getting to sit down with another human being, let alone getting to enter the bedroom with another human being. It allows me to learn more about myself at the same time.

Speaker 1:          01:14:08       What have you learned about yourself would you say over the two years?

Speaker 6:          01:14:14       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:14:14       I've learned that I am an incredibly confident woman and that I don't need to overcompensate for anything. Growing up four foot eight and being head and shoulders below my peers, I always felt this internal competitive nature like I'm not good enough. I have to work a little bit harder. I have to be a little bit better. I have to overcome what to me felt like a handicap. When you're very petite, people look down on you. They treat you like a young child regardless of the fact that you're an intelligent young woman, they don't give you that same level of respect. And so for me, I learned to have that inner confidence in myself and truly believe it and know that my value and my worth is very, very tangible. It's very, very real and it certainly isn't inhibited by who I physically am. If anything, I've come to find my height to be an advantage in my business, which is kind of a great irony in a way.

Speaker 1:          01:15:17       Yeah, that's coming full circle. I was looking at this description, which was a striking with natural red hair elfin features and a starting list startlingly petite four foot eight frames. I mean that sounds to me like a very strong set of differentiators, right? Right.

Speaker 5:          01:15:37       You an idea like during the lineup I literally will watch the guys will, they'll make eye contact with each girls and they'll reach me and you just see their heads look all the way down because they have to lower their head to make eye contact with me in comparison to the woman standing on my left and my right. So it's very, very fun. You always get to see this funny little head nod when I'm in a lineup and it kind of makes me smile.

Speaker 1:          01:15:59       Uh, what, what have you learned about, uh, what have you learned about men in the last, it doesn't have to be two years, but just in this work, what are, what are, uh, are there any particular insights that you can share or things that you've realized about men? And I understand that there that men is a huge category and that there are many, many, many, many different types of men with different likes and dislikes and so on. But if you were trying to generalize, are there any, are there, is there anything in particular that you would say you've learned about men?

Speaker 5:          01:16:39       I would say the biggest thing that I've learned about men is that society judges them and places this expectation of toxic masculinity which prevents men from embracing that emotional and that sexual side of themselves. That's incredible. Lee limiting his society. For us to have that kind of moral judgment against 50% of the general population. That's, that's craziness. We don't allow men to express themselves sexually. We don't allow men to express themselves emotionally. And when somebody comes to see me at the ranch, all men, regardless of what they think that they are coming to the brothel for, the primary reason that they are coming to the brothel is because they want to be heard. They want to be listened to and most importantly, they just want to be understood.

Speaker 1:          01:17:38       What is, what is it? Is there a particular ask or need or fantasy that guys come to you with and they think that it's somehow unique to them, but in fact you see it all the time. Is there anything that that comes to mind that would, that would I suppose fit that fit those parameters?

Speaker 5:          01:18:02       I'd say there are two things that I see that are most unexpected. The first we've kind of already touched on which our adult male virgins, many adult male versions come with this fantasy of losing their virginity and they don't realize that it's such a common thing and they feel very insecure and nervous about it when it's actually a very common happening. So that would probably be the first thing. The second thing that I see very, very frequently is men simply want to have sex with a woman when she has her eyes open. A lot of women have this interesting habit where we close our eyes when we're having sex where we don't want to make that direct eye contact with our partner. For a lot of men, they find that to be incredibly, incredibly erotic and stimulating. To see all the little micro muscles move and twitches. Somebody gets closer and closer to orgasm, getting to feel their breath and also see the expression change in their eyes and in their face and watch their pupils dilate and contract in response to what you're physically doing. I mean, God, it doesn't get much hotter than that.

Speaker 1:          01:19:06       No. Yeah, no it doesn't. There's a site that I wrote about in my second book for our body where they're actually two chapters, not just one, two chapters dedicated to female orgasm for this people interested, but there's a site, I don't even know if it's still around, I think it should be, but it's called beautiful agony and beautiful agony is, uh, is a site dedicated to user submitted videos of faces as each person is orgasming. So it's, it's specifically focused on, uh, faces during climax and orgasm. So yes, I agree. That's, that's, that makes perfect sense to me. So men who wants to have sex with a woman while she has her eyes open, incredible. Uh,

Speaker 5:          01:19:57       don't, it seems such like a simple request to, but honestly it can be kinda difficult as women because you have to be really confident in yourself, sexually confident what you're doing, a relaxed enough where you can make eye contact and it not feel forced or uncomfortable in an order for like eye contact during sex to actually come off in a way that's erotic. You'd be surprised. It's actually more difficult than you would think.

Speaker 3:          01:20:21       Well, just maintaining eye contact in general. I think in conversation for instance, particularly particularly when talking is difficult for a lot of people and like anything else you have to practice. It just requires mileage. I mean, you really have to put in the repetitions. A question for you, uh, I suppose it is, is somewhat related because you mentioned the, the Gfe, right? The girlfriend experience is the number one request, the requested service that you offer. Now I find this kind of puzzling in a sense and I'd love to hear your additional thoughts. And the reason I say it's puzzling is that I know, uh, I mean among say type a successful males who have traveled a lot around the world. It's, it's, at least in my experience, I mean the vast majority, particularly overseas, but not necessarily limited to overseas, have had experiences with sex workers. Very, very, very, very common. And for many of them, they choose to go to sex workers because they don't want to contend with the emotional elements of a relationship or potential attachment or follow up. They have this sexual need and they view, uh, visiting sex workers as a very sort of clean and simple way to satisfy that. So, so why is the, the girlfriend experience the most requested? I, it's, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's, it's, uh, that's very unexpected for me. Uh, so maybe you can speak to that.

Speaker 5:          01:22:09       Sure. And I'll even go ahead and speak as to the specific example you gave these men that travel for work, they choose a specifically, and this is a conscious decision to not engaged in a traditional relationship. Oftentimes what they will do is they'll see the same lady on a frequent reoccurring basis rather than seeing different ladies. So in a way they are kind of entering a unique committed sort of relationship within that bounded time constraints that they are there together with that person. It allows them to be in control of the duration of the intimacy, how that interaction goes, and you don't have to do any of that maintenance and upkeep as a relationship does. And then economically speaking, interestingly enough, it's cheaper to frequently visit sex workers then actually have a wife and get married.

Speaker 3:          01:23:03       Oh, that doesn't surprise me. I mean I, I, yeah, I remember

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       somebody, I heard somebody say in a movie, they said free sex is the most expensive sexual ever.

Speaker 5:          01:23:13       Honestly, it is so much easier to just seek out a professional because if you have that need and you need to get that need met, going to the legal brothel is an amazing solution. One, you know, you're not going to catch anything because we're literally tested every single week. Two, you don't have to worry about any of your private information being violated, especially for professional men that may not want to be open or put themselves at risk of doing any illegal activity. Sex in Nevada at the brothels is a hundred percent legal. You can go ahead and pay for sex and you don't have to worry about that legal risk of things. So for a lot of men, perhaps a huge advantage. Chill. Um, another thing that I oftentimes see with men that fall into that particular situation is they enjoyed the familiarity of the same individual girl, but they know that they're not obligated to do anything.

Speaker 5:          01:24:13       They don't have to tax, they don't have to call, they don't have to say, where are you? Why didn't you do the laundry? You don't get any of that nagging or any of those negative relation things that can be oftentimes detrimental and said, you kind of get to cherry pick the best parts of relationship. You get to go out on dates and have dinner. We can rent a helicopter and fly over Lake Tahoe and take photos together. Whatever this scenario happens to be. It gives you the exact experience you want within the constraints of time that you have available to yourself without any sort of commitment or obligation beyond that.

Speaker 1:          01:24:54       So I was just going to say it sort to most of what you just said would lead the, the friends that I mentioned before to nod their heads and say yes, exactly. So the, where do we then find the girlfriend experience, uh, sort of falling in terms of appeal, uh, because, uh, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. And I should also say for people listening, I mean, I think there is, I certainly find value in relationships, intimate relationships, and sex with, with, uh, girlfriends that I'm in deep committed relationships with. Nonetheless, I mean, this, this is, I think another piece, potentially another piece of the puzzle that's worth at the very, at a very minimum understanding. So the, the Gfe, why is that? Why, why is that the most requested? Right? Because I mean, I guess in my mind, maybe I'm just a savage, but I'm thinking, all right, if I'm going to pay for four hours, I've already established that I'm attracted to you. Why not have sex for four hours?

Speaker 5:          01:25:58       It certainly can do that. No one is saying, no, no, no stamina. Oh, please,

Speaker 3:          01:26:08       please, uh, please speak on the GFE. Why, why is that the most requested do you think?

Speaker 5:          01:26:15       Of course. I think the first thing that needs to be discussed is the girlfriend experience is just that you are creating an experience for somebody. It's bounded by the constraints of our time together. It's not a perpetual relationship, which is what makes it different than say, a standard girlfriend. It's an experience within that experience. You're getting a couple of very unique, um, let's call them features. One of the features of the girlfriend experiences that I specifically take my time to get to know who somebody is on an even greater level. Because generally speaking, within a GFE experience, we visit each other more than just once. This isn't generally a standalone encounter, but rather a regular occurrence. A couple times a year if somebody lives locally, perhaps more frequently, whatever. It's so maybe I digress a little bit here, but it's kind of important to point out that one of the classic features of girlfriend experiences that were frequently than not, it tends to be a reoccurring experience and it also allows us to develop a relationship with each other. For men, emotion and sex very, very frequently go hand in hand. It's not just the pure physical arousal, but it's also that mental stimulus. It's being able to sit and have a quality conversation with the woman you're about to have sex with. Like I think that's incredibly appealing to sit down with somebody and have them perhaps talk about astrophysics with me before foreplay. Oh yeah. Bring it on. That as foreplay for my brain right there.

Speaker 3:          01:27:54       What is the, what is the average duration of a girlfriend experience session, so to speak?

Speaker 5:          01:28:03       I'd say on average between the two to four hour range. Of course I've had experiences more limited that and then I've had experiences more extend ewas than that sale.

Speaker 3:          01:28:17       I know this is going to seem like a left turn, but we're, we're going to jump all over the place. What do you, what are your feelings or opinions of porn as a sex worker?

Speaker 5:          01:28:29       Ooh, that's a very interesting question. Indeed. I think that porn is ruining America. It's ruining relationships and it's ruining intimacy. What porn does is it creates this almost addictive compulsion where you're scrolling through, you're watching the porn. We're going to assume it's a male watching at this point, he's masturbating. He is being very, very rough with his genitalia and he is just going at it for however long. It's so May 1st rather than investing his time and energy in a genuine connection with a real human being. He's watching the Broadway equivalent of a sex act that is being overdramatized for his entertainment because I'll tell you right now that everything that women do in porn is the exact opposite of what happens in real life.

Speaker 5:          01:29:25       Secondly, it's causing men to cause physical harm to themselves. They're masturbating, so roughly that oftentimes they'll lose sensitivity and it makes it difficult for them to orgasm and climax with their partner, which of course leads to the almost a cycle of going back and masturbating because they're not able to orgasm with their significant other. They have to have that rough stimulus. The third thing that it does is it perpetuates this culture where we look as sex and we look at women as objects. There is no real way to verify, unfortunately, that all of the porn that you're coming across on these websites is consensual porn. You have no idea how old are these women necessarily are you have no, well, if they've been compensated for their time, like unless you've really done your research and you've picked an ethical porn website that does perfect record keeping based in the United States, there's no guarantee and the majority of guys that I know, they just go to some website, they just scroll through and they clicked on the first thing that looks interesting without a second thought as to what the impact is on the lives of the women and what kind of a societal norm that perpetuates.

Speaker 5:          01:30:37       If we managed to remove porn from our society, I think you would see men spending more time developing genuine connections with other women. They would be going out more. They would be exploring those dynamics and exploring those things rather than that self-gratifying behavior bitches also physically damaging.

Speaker 3:          01:30:58       Probably also be good for business at the bunny ranch out. Imagine if porn work to vanish overnight. They suspect that you guys would be overrun, but

Speaker 5:          01:31:08       it would be pandemonium. And the very first thing that I would have to do, believe it or not, is invest in a ton of flash lights. The number one,

Speaker 3:          01:31:21       my friend, my friend used to sell this, he's, he was the, he was the man behind the flashlight. So maybe you can describe for people, uh, why you would, why, what the fleshlight is and why you'd be investing in the flashlight.

Speaker 5:          01:31:35       Well, what the fleshlight is, is it is an apparatus used for male sexual gratification that is in a tube that looks very much so like a flashlight. But rather than having the inner working light component, instead it has an artificial vagina or lips or Derriere or breast made out of silicone or other fleshlight feeling material, which you then insert your penis into for self gratification. Got It. Wow. That was really technical way to just,

Speaker 3:          01:32:09       Oh, so you would keep, you would keep the fast running s porn deprived maniacs at bay by sort of hurling flashlights at them over some type of barricade like hand grenades just to make sure that, that you can keep this tsunami of sexual agitation at bay. Now that makes sense. I like that. Uh,

Speaker 5:          01:32:31       be like Oprah Winfrey and you get a flashlight.

Speaker 3:          01:32:37       Yeah. Well you'd have to take all these guys who spend too much time on laptops and train them on how to catch things cause you might just end up taking eyes out with flashlights lots. But, but yes,

Speaker 5:          01:32:48       the reason why I specifically mentioned flashlights is guys are hurting themselves when they're masturbating third gripping too tightly, they're pulling too hard. When you're using the flashlight, it takes away that ability. It completely takes it out of the equation. So you're still able to get sexual gratification with yourself, but you're also not hurting yourself in damaging your ability to enjoy sex with a partner. So honestly, I think all guys out there, the number one things that they could do for their own sexual wellness is by a flashlight.

Speaker 3:          01:33:18       This episode of the Tim Ferriss show is brought to you by the fleshlight. Okay. That one was free. Fleshlight please donate many thousands of dollars to your favorite, a benevolent cause, donorschoose.org I'm sure we'll accept your money, but a, yeah, you're welcome. You're welcome. Flashlight.

Speaker 5:          01:33:37       You know, a couple slides, not a replacement for a real human being. It certainly isn't a replacement for the true flesh and blood thing, but it certainly is an alternative option for single men out there who are masturbating at home and are starting to experience some of these sensitivity issues. It's something to bear in mind because it's going to make her sexual experiences so much more intense and so much better.

Speaker 3:          01:34:01       Yes. For the, uh, for the real vagina deficient masses out there who are masturbating themselves into genital destruction. Words to the wise. All right, so let me, let me segue on that to googling your name. All right. So you have reviews online and I've seen you described in very laudable terms. So in one word for instance, this is one reviewer in one word. Wow. In two words. Fuck Ya. In a sentence. Drop Your Pants Ladies and gentlemen, and see her now. Okay. So you, you have, you have, uh, as it were, very good Yelp reviews. Like if you are a restaurant, I'd be like, damn, I need to go to that restaurant. So what separates a, let's just focus on female sex workers. What separates a female sex

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       worker from a great female sex worker, right? Because you're sort of the, the, the Michael Jordan of your sport. So, and, and you're allowed to say communication, but it can't be your full answer. And if you say communication, you can, you have to give me very specific examples of what makes you different. Yep.

Speaker 5:          01:35:13       Thank you. Deal with communication in this particular case. Okay. All right. Well, I think the big differentiating factor is passion. That zest for life, that inquisitive nature and desire for more that lust overall for life, not just necessarily for sex or money, but rather that constant desire and drive for what's next, what's more, I'm passionate and I want to learn and I want to explore and experience. So I'd say being passionate about what I do really is what separates me and kind of puts me that head and shoulders above everybody else. I'm an incredibly vocal advocate for sex workers, sex workers rights. I'm an incredibly well educated individual when it comes to sex, sex needs, sex, intimacy. And it's something that I really consider myself to be not just an expert in, but something that I'm truly and genuinely passionate about. It has such a great meaning and impact on my life personally that it definitely has left its thumbprint on the essence of who I am because I've allowed it to affect me on that deep personal level. I'm also able to give of myself in a very deep personal way that I think is kind of rare in our society these days.

Speaker 1:          01:36:30       So give, give me an example if you can. Uh, because not to, not to really beat the Michael Jordan an analogy to death, but it's like, all right, Michael Jordan clearly had, actually I heard an anecdote from one of the mental performance coaches for the bowls at the time who I think previously had worked with the Lakers on a meditative and mindfulness practices who said that, you know, Jordan was perhaps the only player who reflected the skills he was trying to impart to the other. So, okay. But you were, so you have say his ability to generate this being in the zone at well or something like that. But then you have, you have Jordan as a brilliant, a technician and tactician and so on. So the PA I will, I'm interested in digging into the passion, but I need some examples. Like how does that translate to an experience for someone?

Speaker 5:          01:37:30       Hmm. Trying to think of the best way to verbalize that. I would say the easiest way to kind of encapsulate what you're talking about is to go back and reference something that I'm very interested in, which is the 48 laws of power. It's really phenomenal book. Really, really interesting. Yes. Speaks quite a lot about the mental capacity is of somebody, how we view and interact with the world around us. There's a certain level of mindfulness that that book preaches to be cognisant of your decisions, where you're making your decisions rather than letting yourself react to what's happening around you. So I guess one of the things that also makes me different is that level of mindfulness. I always take that extra step. I always do just a little bit more than everybody else would if it's somebody's birthday. And they told me that in passing they enjoy chocolate cake.

Speaker 5:          01:38:31       Well, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to bake them a chocolate cake and then I'm also going to go ahead and get candles for it. And then I'm also going to reference back and find out what sort of interest in hobbies they haven't get them a birthday present and a birthday card. I always like to take things to that next level, that next intensity, whether it be from simply doing, say my website and just blogging casually. Oh, no. I'm very, very careful and very specific in the way that I blog. I try and communicate my point in my viewpoint, within my words. I really tried to emphasize my beliefs and place an importance on that connectivity and that interaction that we get to share. It's, it really is the encapsulating part of the experience for me is being willing to take the time and the effort to do a little bit more than most when most people would stop working. That's where I keep going. I pushed just a little bit harder, whether that be through marketing, whether that be through clients interaction, whether that be through how I choose to present myself online. All of those things is just a little bit more, a little bit extra, just really demonstrating that I want to be known for this field. I want to be known for creating these incredible experiences for people and I want people to have those encounters and have those experiences and think about them as a potential for their own life,

Speaker 1:          01:40:12       so. All right. Let's talk about then something you mentioned is on the bucket list for a lot of Ben and that is a threesome. Say if you are working with say a one of your female friends and who is also a sex worker and providing that experience for men, what are some of the ways that you guys would go above and beyond in that experience and and specifically like I'm, I'm curious about maybe some of the technical stuff, some of the acts themselves, uh, things that may not be obvious or things that may be unexpected. Anything really that that is that unfolds. What are some of the, what, what is, what's the secret sauce? What are some of the magic ingredients

Speaker 5:          01:41:03       when it comes to a threesome encounter at the ultimate frosting? Cherry on top of whipped cream dessert of it all is honestly a two girl blow job or where the two of us are kneeling before a guy who was standing one position on either side of his member, both of our mouths and our hands on his body looking up at him and pleasuring him where he truly is the center of our world. For that moment. I have had guides rant and rave about that kind of experience more so than anything else when it comes to a threesome cause just being able to feel like, wow, I am the center of someone's sexual attention in the center of someone's Sexual Universe is hot.

Speaker 1:          01:41:50       Oh sure. Yeah. No, that's I am. I am not confused or surprised. The the related question I suppose for people out there who are interested in becoming better at giving blowjobs, right, what recommendations would you have for them? Are there any do's or do nots common mistakes? Anything that you can suggest to enhance the experience? What? What are your thoughts? If you were teaching a class, maybe you have taught a class on this, right?

Speaker 5:          01:42:23       I haven't backed out this class on how to give the better blow job. It's a fun one. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:42:27       All right, so what are, what are some of the, what are some of the key teachings?

Speaker 5:          01:42:34       The first thing you need to do is look at what your general blow job routine is. Are you doing the same things over and over again? Are you focusing on the head or a particular part of the penis? Are you making eye contact? What are you doing right now? Whatever it is that you're doing right now, the next step is to go ahead and add to it, so if you're just a standard vo job, focusing all the pause for a moment, look up and make really direct eye contact with your partner and then keep going while keeping that eye contact maintained. It's going to change the energy and change the interaction. Then you can take it the next step further and start playing with perhaps food. Have you ever taken whipped cream and put whipped cream on top of your man and then had whipped cream off of his member?

Speaker 5:          01:43:20       That can be an incredibly erotic way to do things. Not to mention the fact that in a technical term, by placing a food object, it kind of gives you your mouth, a taste guide for what parts of the body you have and have not paid attention to get. It really creates this moment where you have to slow down and you have to make sure you clean up all the whipped cream in. It's a really pleasurable way to slow things down and enjoy the moment and enjoy the action. So it's about being willing to try new things in your blowjob. And of course ladies watched the teeth.

Speaker 3:          01:43:56       Yes. Watch the teeth. That'd be a good bumper sticker. It said the good message to impart a hand. No hand if if hand involved just fingers full hand. I mean I guess your forefoot eights or maybe if the time you may probably have tiny hands. So I'm not sure. It must have, they must make guys feel amazing. They were like, oh my God, is my cock really huge or her hands just really small. I don't care. It's so amazing. Oh God. Yeah. Uh, so yeah. So, so what are your, what are your thoughts on hand?

Speaker 5:          01:44:32       You Comfortable Cup them. Massage them between my hands. Not to roughly. You really don't want to pull on them or put serious pressure on them. But just having that added sensation there for a lot of guys. Can actually make their orgasms significantly more intense.

Speaker 3:          01:44:47       Hmm. So wait, now you're talking about like one hand is cupping, like you're holding a baby bird or something like that?

Speaker 5:          01:44:54       Yes, kind of as if you had two eggs sitting in the center of your hand and then you're kind of spinning those two eggs back and forth against each other, kind of sliding them against each other. We're sliding them against her hand, kind of providing a light tactile stimulation.

Speaker 3:          01:45:10       Got It. And then what are you doing with the other hand or what might you,

Speaker 5:          01:45:13       I enjoy the sensation of feeling deep inside a woman and how they tend to perceive this. And a lot of guys do this subconsciously when they're masturbating, whatever hand are not using their placing on the the crook of their inner thigh and they're placing pressure there. But that tree is for the body is it transmits and translates to the nerves that makes them feel as if they are deep inside of a woman's body. So sometimes what I'll do is I'll place my other hand that isn't on their balls. I'll place it against their body, against their shaft. At the very, very base of it and kind of give that pressure sensation as if they are deep inside of a woman. That combined with the pleasure I'm giving, using my mouth and the pleasure I'm giving, using my hand, it can really create a mind blowing orgasm.

Speaker 7:          01:46:01       Hmm.

Speaker 5:          01:46:03       Like if the guy, like if a guy normally doesn't finish during a blow job, a lot of guys find that they're not able to by adding those two simple things, it can completely change their mindset on blow jobs and make it one of their favorite ways to finish

Speaker 3:          01:46:19       what is, all right. So we're taught when I was mentioning a five star Yelp reviews earlier. So in the context of a threesome that you're in charge of, right? You and another woman are kind of running the show. So you already talked about man standing, two women on the floor. Uh, if, if you're looking at greatest hits, like what gets the most rave reviews for finishing? What is the last, what is the last five minutes look like?

Speaker 5:          01:46:51       The big K out. So the big k o often looks like the guy on his back myself. On top in doggy style, the other lady is reversed where she's facing me, but sitting on top of his face in such a way that he's still able to see and her and I are making out playing with these Childers breasts and really getting into the encounter. I happened to be bisexual, so I'm already head over heels about everything that's happening. And most of the ladies that I do too, girl experiences with are also bisexual. So there's that energy of natural chemistry between the two of Boston. That attraction in addition to the focus on his pleasure, he is just so stimulating both visually and then just in regards to how he's feeling that a lot of guys come that way and they come really, really hard. Big K, it's a lot of fun because if you have never gotten to have sex like that, you are missing out. That is one of life's like life's eighth wonder is a mind blowing threesome.

Speaker 3:          01:48:03       Oh No, no disagreement there. Agreed. Agreed. Uh, yeah, that, that's, that's unfortunate. There aren't more threesomes in the world for sure. The big chaos now just to really hone in on the visual. So you are, you are on top of the man mounted on the man facing towards his head. You, you had mentioned doggystyle, but you're kind of in cowgirl, not really cowgirl. I guess it's cowgirl only when you have your knees up to your knees are down. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:48:27       Yep. So it's still considered to be cow girl. It's where I'm on top of him and my body is upright rather than leaned or tipped forward. The other lady is facing me parallels. So as we're looking at each other, so she is facing him and she's sitting on his face in such a way that he's able to give her oral stimulation. But then he's also able to see everything that's going on. Oftentimes we'll use the mirrors for this if the angle is a little bit difficult. A lot of our rooms already have them installed to kind of give that visual emphasis too, not just the physical.

Speaker 3:          01:49:05       Sounds lovely. Uh, all right, fun. I'm going to before I just get lost in reverie. Uh, back to my interviewing. I want to talk about the negotiating again because um, I'm very interested in this and I know we touched on it very briefly, but what types of points are you negotiating? Are you negotiating price or you know, she like I loved it for you to dig into the specifics, like give some examples like what kind of stuff is being agreed upon and settled on in that, in that conversation beforehand,

Speaker 5:          01:49:39       during the negotiation, the very first thing that is discussed is what we are doing, where we're doing it, what they desire to get out of that experience and what kind of a budget they're working with. And at that point, yes, we are definitely negotiating over price. Of course, some more flexible someone's budget is the more in depth of an experience are able to have. There definitely is a correlation there between those two things. What's very interesting in our industry is that there is nowhere else that we can talk about price except at the physical location of the brothel in our bedrooms. So this isn't something that can be done in advanced online or over phone. This system make that you actually have to do in person due to how Nevada law is written. There's no rates posted online on my website. None of that information is anything we discussed. So price is definitely one of the things that we negotiate for it. Of course it varies from person to person and it's worth mentioning that the ranch is built very discreetly so you can feel comfortable using your debit or credit card there because it is a professional business and not worry about that being a concern.

Speaker 3:          01:50:54       Tax Consultation, uh, Sin City or what is the descriptor? What shows up on the statement? I'm so curious. Oh, we actually usually don't publicize that info. Okay. All right, that's fine. That's fine. Gotcha. Oh, right, right, right, right. I would make thousands of enemies. Sorry, sorry, I didn't, I didn't really think that one through all the like wives listening would be like God immediately looking for all of the things that might show up. Okay. Got It. Got It. All right, so Safeway, potato chips, a ranch. I think that's, that would, that would be my code. Alright. Uh, terrible. Oh my God. I just said that out loud. Okay. So, uh, all right, let's, let's keep going. This, it's very discreet.

Speaker 5:          01:51:44       You'd definitely discuss price. Some clients are very comfortable talking about the intimate details of the sexual experience that you want at the client is interested in role play. They may be very specific and say, I want you to wear a red school girl skirt with a white tight blouse top with your heroin, high pigtails. It can be that specific or is generic as I want to have sex. If they're a male virgin and they're not comfortable talking about sex at that point. And so each person's negotiation is going to go a little bit differently. But generally speaking, I like to cover the, where we want to go, what we want to do. Do they have a specific end goal in mind or something that they really want to experience and then I kind of custom tailor and explain to them, well based off of what you've told me, I think the best encounter for you is going to look like this. Generally speaking, we'll want to spend, you know an afternoon together and this is kind of what we're looking at but price wise and then we just kind of take it from there. Either they're able to do that and we're good to go and this is where it's a negotiation because we can go, oh I can't quite get there. What if we take this activity away? Can we still have plenty of time for everything else we can have? Great, let's focus on that.

Speaker 1:          01:53:03       What if I don't get the power windows and I don't need the fancy rims? Then where do we end up? What is the range? If you're, if you're able to say, I mean on kind of low end, if we're going a lean machine up to like the works, what's like the, the, the full Cadillac, I mean is there, is it possible to give a range on something like that?

Speaker 5:          01:53:27       Sure thing. Of course it's going to vary from lady to lady because we're all independent contractors, but a very, very general range or a way to framework it would be um, a very brief encounter could be in the three figure brain range. Something a little bit more in depth, like going out to dinner would be somewhere in the four figure range and if somebody chooses to spend a night or a multiple of these with me, then we can certainly approach that. I figure range there been gentleman who have stayed at the ranch, have even spent in the six to seven figure range because that just happens to be what they're working budget is because we see such a wide variety of clients, someone's disposable income is completely varied. Somebody may be coming in and wanting to spend an entire week with a lady versus somebody coming in that really is just looking to have a really amazing massage and happy ending. There absolutely is no wrong request and there certainly isn't a write request. It's whatever works for you for your budget and just being willing to have a conversation about, hey, you know, if this is what I kind of had in mind, this is what I'm interested in, what can we make happen if someone comes into my room with that attitude, I have no doubt we'll be able to make something work.

Speaker 1:          01:54:42       Okay, so I'm just listening to some of these numbers on the high end debt. Is Dennis Hoff still the proprietor as he's still the owner or is it

Speaker 5:          01:54:52       yes. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:54:53       Okay. So Dennis is my, as I understand, it was a frequent customer who purchased the business in 1993 for $700,000 then he invested I think another half million in upgrades and improvements. So that means, and I don't know what the split is between the ladies in the house, so we can get into that or not get into that, but it would seem like with one high roller who comes in, he could have recouped his entire investment or at least the two trenches that I mentioned in the business. That's pretty amazing. I mean if that is actually the case, I have no idea how the economics work, but it seems like it seems like a very, a self sustaining, a attractive economic model I guess. I mean it particularly if you have some of these folks flying in from God knows where and they're dropping six or seven figures. I mean that's got to cover a

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       lot of incidentals.

Speaker 5:          01:55:47       Oh, it absolutely does that. Dennis is gone and he has expanded beyond just the bunny ranch as of this moment. He owns seven different brothels. We have up in the northern half of the state, we have the moonlight bunny ranch, the love ranch north, the kit Kat ranch and the sage brush ranch down south near Vegas. We have the alien cat house and love ranch south. So just to give you an idea, this is somebody that definitely found his industry, embraced it, ran with it, and it's created a tremendous opportunity for the women that work at these locations to kind of build their own business within a business and a brand within a brand.

Speaker 3:          01:56:30       So net you mentioned like alien, what was it? Alien Cat Ranch and uh, alien cat house. Oh, so close. Yeah. How sounds a lot better than cat ranch. And are these, are these different genres? Are they different types of food so to speak? It's kind of like, Oh, if you want Italian, go here. If you want Thai food, go here. If you want this, go there. Or is each of or each of those, uh, sort of buffet choose your own adventure of there? There's everything here or do each of them have a particular kind of personality and style?

Speaker 5:          01:57:07       I think that each location definitely has a unique energy to that location. However, it's not like all blondes go to the bunny ranch. Nell brunettes go to love ranch at each location. You're going to find a variety of women in all ages, shapes and sizes. And so really there's not a wrong place to go. As far as facilities go, we're able to travel between the different ranches. So if somebody at Kit Kat ranches say interested in having a threesome with myself and Hannah Fox who works over at the Kit Kat ranch, Hannah would be able to come up to the bunny ranch in and joined myself in a client or in reverse, I'd be able to travel to the kit Kat ranch and join her own her client. They're all within about three minutes of each other. So this is very, very close by as far as the northern houses, which is really fun because when you think about it, it literally is a buffet. There's 151 flavors and inevitably there's gonna be somebody that is the perfect match for you.

Speaker 3:          01:58:07       So I have, I have friends who are say travel writers and this is going somewhere and they find it difficult to travel for pleasure because as soon as they start traveling, their mind clicks into work mode and they think about the story, they could tell the detail they could write down and so on. Uh, I suppose what I'm wondering is, uh, after exploring this and pursuing it and dedicating yourself to this as a profession, what are the things that still turn you on the most? Like what are the things that you're hoping will get requested or does that make any sense? It's like a, in a given week are like, God, you know, it would really make my week if somebody asked for this, this or this is, is there anything that would fall, we would come up in your mind? Um,

Speaker 5:          01:59:02       oh one I really like working with gentlemen who are a little bit older in age. The reason for this is that they already know how to treat a lady, right? They're oftentimes very familiar with sex and they're looking for so much more than just that casual, quickie and counter. They want to take things to that next level of connection and intimacy. And I really find that my guests who are in their forties fifties sixties in up, they tend to have a certain maturity that I find incredibly, incredibly attractive.

Speaker 3:          01:59:40       Oh, Holy Shit. I just turned 40 I'm now an older gentlemen. Oh Wow. I'm not sure if, I guess sounds like a good thing I guess. Uh Huh.

Speaker 5:          01:59:49       I like to think of it as, rather than being older, it's, it's being experienced where at a certain point you develop an appreciation for women. And I think for men that sometimes can take a little bit longer and sometimes doesn't quite click into place until they reach a certain emotional maturity where they're able to look at the woman is more than just a sex object. But as being these incredibly intelligent and interesting beings, a lot of guys struggle to see women as more than just sex objects for a number of years. And so sometimes it can take a little bit longer for guys to reach that threshold. And honestly at that certain point to a lot of those older gentlemen expressed to me, Oh, you know, I just don't feel comfortable having sex with people my own age because I want somebody who's younger. I want somebody who's a little bit more vicious and energetic and maybe they have a little bit of a harder time finishing and so they're looking for somebody who has the energy and stamina to really work with them and try exciting new things and I really enjoy that interaction, that end. I'd say adults, virgin as well, really, really fulfilling to me to spend time with those people.

Speaker 3:          02:01:04       What, what was the experience like telling your family about your decision to pursue this work? Can you walk us through that conversation or that day? What did that look like?

Speaker 5:          02:01:19       Oh goodness. Well, I definitely could have done that a lot better than I did. I decided that much like a bandaid. I was just going to pull it off and just be like, hi, I'm a sex worker. I am going to work at the Moonlight Bunny ranch and no, you can not change my mind. And I pretty much set it about that directly and just very confidently said, this is where I want to go and this is the next step for me and if you want to judge me for that you can go ahead but you're not going to change my mind. I had already made up my mind at that point and nothing under the sun was going to change it.

Speaker 3:          02:02:00       It was at the time, not to interrupt, but like what did your parents think you were doing at the time before that announcement?

Speaker 5:          02:02:09       Well at that moment I was actually working as a massage therapist and I was getting ready to move out of the state for a couple of weeks just to try the job and make sure I liked it. And so the first piece of news was I was leaving for two weeks and here is why. And I decided in all of my stubborn wisdom that I was going to inform them of this the day before I was scheduled to travel out to Nevada for the first time. So I definitely should have gone ahead and given them a little bit more notice. But at the same time though, I was going into it with almost this armor meant around myself for I'm expecting to overcome objections and I'm expecting to have to explain and go into like this whole presentation about what sex in Nevada is, and the response I got back was pretty much, Oh, okay sweetie. If that's what you want to do, are you sure that's something you want to do? Is it safe? Are you going to be safe? You are okay, you can go do that. Oh, okay. Then that was a much better reaction than I expected.

Speaker 3:          02:03:16       Did you call a family meeting or what was the, did you go out to the olive garden? I mean, what was the, what was the setting for this? Right. Like keep key pass the breadsticks and, oh, by the way, I mean, what does breadsticks and sex works? They pair together. Yeah. So what, what was the setting, I mean, how did you, how did you tee it up?

Speaker 5:          02:03:38       I'm just at home what? We were in the living room. I have a younger sibling who isn't of the legal age of consent, and so of course they're not aware of what I do professionally. So I went ahead and specifically pulled my mother aside and had that conversation with her privately in the living room.

Speaker 4:          02:03:56       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:03:56       And was she watching TV where you're like, hey, let's just DVR what you're watching or was she doing a crossword puzzle? I just, I liked trying,

Speaker 5:          02:04:08       at the time she was just hanging out in the arm chair reading the magazine. I sat down next to her and said, you know, I want to tell you something. She put the magazine down and I just kind of blurt it all out there. So I'm going to be illegal sex worker and I'm going to go work in Nevada. And I just, a cascade of information kind of came tumbling out of my mouth as I'm trying to explain things. And my mom's face is completely unfazed at this point, which I have to say Bravo to her for that. I definitely didn't expect her to take the news quite as well as she did and I was very happily surprised that she was just, Oh, okay. That's nice. Another crazy adventure that you want to go on. That's about normal.

Speaker 3:          02:04:51       How, how do you explain that? I mean, did you just, was your mom like a free wheeling free thinking hippie back in the day or I mean having come from Ireland, I don't know the full background. Is She from Ireland herself?

Speaker 5:          02:05:08       Yes, she is extremely, extremely on the more conservative side of things, which is one of the reasons why I was expecting some of the objections to the states. She's kind of adapted a little bit more of the liberal standpoints here in Ireland, especially in Northern Ireland right now, and especially back then when we lived over there in the country, there is a very negative stigma attached to sex work. I had kind of done the research is what sex work is like in other countries and other places and what are the things I came across is information about how sex work exists in Ireland, which it does not. And I kind of, again, in that way, but I tend to overthink things, had this mental impression of what her reaction would be and the way that she looked at it, she's like, Hey, you know what?

Speaker 5:          02:05:59       So long as you're not racing those damn horses anymore and falling off and breaking your arm, you're just going to go have sex in Nevada. Cool. That's not bad compared to some of the crazy things that I have done with my life. It's very understanding. Just kind of interesting when you think about it from the sheer safety standpoint, being a jockey was certainly a riskier profession than being illegal sex worker in Nevada. My job is actually incredibly, incredibly safe, both because of how the location is set up in addition to the legality and laws that protect the ladies.

Speaker 3:          02:06:36       So let's, uh, let's, uh, shift gears a bit now. I'll ask just a handful of rapid fire questions that I asked just about everybody and, uh, we'll just spend a few minutes going through four or five of these and then, uh, I will let you get back to your day. This has been so much fun. I could go for hours and hours and hours, but the,

Speaker 5:          02:06:56       I was going to say, I am enjoying this so much. I am having a blast.

Speaker 3:          02:07:00       No, this is, this is, uh, I'm really glad we were able to connect and I will, I will, I will have already thanked the person who made the mutual introduction in the intro. But, uh, let's talk about books because you collect books. Uh, are there any books that you have gifted the most to other people? Are there, are there any books that you have given out more than once as gifts that come to mind or that you would give as gifts?

Speaker 5:          02:07:31       Definitely. I would say the top three books that I tend to give as gifts. The first one would be a book that's written by Dennis Hoff called the art of the pen. It literally talks about his journey. How he ended up getting the Bunny ranch in a lot of the intimate details in relationship to sex in Nevada. For anybody that's interested in what I do. Wanting to learn a little bit more about the industry. That is always the first book I give is this is kind of your handbook as it were to the world of legal sex in Nevada. The second book that I give out most frequently is to my coworkers. It would be the 48 laws of power. A lot of the ladies haven't had the opportunity or haven't been exposed to that book, and so I think that it's a great tool to get into the hands of women and get that positive thinking, going.

Speaker 5:          02:08:20       That energy that that book really tends to encapsulate. And the third book is kind of an interesting one. It's a book called memoirs of a Geisha. It speaks as to the life of a woman who ended up being a geisha in Japan during the World War Two era who was kind of purchased from her family and unwillingly brought into this very foreign world that could not be any more different than what her life was. The light. The reason why I tend to recommend this book for other people is that there's this incredibly beautiful humanistic element in the way that she describes the author uses language that is very, very rich and colorful, and it sits you into that time and place where you smell the fish in front of you. You hear the sound of the Shemy San that she's playing. Like you can really immerse yourself into that world and kind of get a sense of what things were like at that time.

Speaker 1:          02:09:33       Yeah, it's a fan. Fantastic book. And the author actually wrote the entire book twice. Uh, he wrote the, he wrote it first, was dissatisfied with how it turned out, scrapped it, and started over and wrote it a second time, which is just speaking as a writer's unimaginable. I've thrown out showers, know what the entire novel, Oh my God. And uh, yeah, it's, it's really, it also sheds light on some of the craft and art form related to being a cortison during that period of time. And I actually had the opportunity to go to, to spend some time in, I think it was cured or in Japan. I spend a lot of time Japan and to uh, to see a range, a formal dinner with performances, with a number of friends of mine with two what they call gate goal. So instead of Gay Shah, uh, it's, they would call them gay cold Karl

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       with a k o at the end and at the same idea, different dialect, different label, effectively no sex involved, but came in and played the Shami Sen. And uh, I did a number of traditional dance routines and prepared t and went through all of this ritual is very beautiful experience, uh, that, um, that are highly recommend if people have the opportunity. So those, those are those very diverse set of three books. Uh, next question is a purchase of less than a hundred dollars doesn't have to be less than a hundred dollars. It has most improved your life in the last year or recent memory. Any, any purchase that has improved your quality of life that comes to mind? Could be something that costs $5. It could be something it's free actually, uh, or anything sort of in that range.

Speaker 5:          02:11:33       Hmm. That is a really interesting question. I would have to say the leave it or not and it seems like such a strange little thing. I like to cook for myself a lot and I tend to eat very clean and healthy. I enjoy a lot of vegetables. The one contraption that I find myself using time and time again as one of those little spaghetti creations where you insert the squash or Zucchini and you kind of twist it and it turns it into a noodle instead it makes the vegetable really easy to cook. It's great for meal prep and given how hectic my work week is, having that easy to use tool available to me, it has made my life a lot easier.

Speaker 3:          02:12:16       So it's a, it's a vegetable spaghetti maker effectively. So it'll, it'll, it'll push it through some type of press to slice it into these thin strips. Is that what it does?

Speaker 5:          02:12:29       Yes. And then if I had to go slightly above $100, I would have to say that my cordless Hitachi has it been a gift from God.

Speaker 3:          02:12:39       Okay. The cordless Hitachi magic wand, which has, which has more setting has a lot more settings. Yup.

Speaker 5:          02:12:47       And now you're not limited to just being harnessed by this cord. Now you have a lot more freedom of movement with the toy. And having that available within the context of my job has been a ton of fun. We have had so many great experiences with it. It's been fantastic.

Speaker 3:          02:13:08       Alright. Hitachi, same thing I said to the fleshlight first one's on me, call me. We can figure out your official sponsorship. Uh, right. So the Hitachi cordless, if you were to be given a billboard, you could put anything on the billboard, uh, and metaphorically speaking to get a message out to millions or billions of people. So it could be a few words, could be a single word, could be a paragraph, it could be someone else's quote. What would you put on it or what might you put on it?

Speaker 5:          02:13:42       Well, the first part of that would be as to where, and I think that I would go ahead and choose to put mine as close to the White House as physically possible, where people in legislature going to have eyes on this thing as frequently as possible. And my vest message would be very, very simple. Sex is the need, not a want. Sex legalization is the future of America.

Speaker 3:          02:14:07       I like it. Sex is a need, not a want.

Speaker 5:          02:14:11       Legalization, it's, it's the next logical step. The fact that our country has it in one single state and only within the constraints of specific locations within that straight is of course very limiting. It means that you're required to travel to Nevada in order to legally spend time with a sex worker in the United States. And for a lot of people that's not feasible. And so having a legal options that are run very similar to the Nevada brothels system, but in other locations I think is where our country is going to inevitably be going.

Speaker 3:          02:14:46       Yeah, it's ridiculous. I mean I eat because if we're viewing it through the lens of a need, of course sex workers are everywhere and they just get pushed underground where safety is compromised and there's no oversight in the case that it is maintained, is illegal in those locations. So it's, it's going to exist whether regulators choose to ignore it or systematize it and embrace it in some capacity and they might as well get the tax revenue and decrease the risks for everyone involved. So I agree.

Speaker 5:          02:15:19       It's often said that prostitution is the oldest profession and that really is true. I mean if you look back into history and you go back into ancient soon there and Mesopotamia and Babylonian society, you have this incredible conceptual realization of something called sacred sexuality where by doing sex work, that's what brought them closer to their deities at that time. That's what brought them closer to the divine. The sex workers or in this case, they were also priestesses of their particular deity. We're incredibly revered. They lived in the temples themselves. They were treated like gold. They were incredibly well respected for the service they provided to society. When you look back on how the Kings of Europe treated their, their, um, mistresses for example, oftentimes gifting them with titles and nobility and land lavish jewels, sex workers that have always been treated as a treasure. And it's only in recent societal times that we've instead taking this negative connotation kind of attached that on to sex work.

Speaker 3:          02:16:34       Yeah, yeah. No, it's a,

Speaker 4:          02:16:38       yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:16:39       Ah, there's so many, there's so many changes needed in this country, but that's certainly one of them. Uh, if you were, let's say you had a chance to educate a class of young minds, so you are given the opportunity to teach a class. So say once per week seminar for semester for college freshmen or a college seniors. It could be even high school, let's say high school, senior or college freshmen. Let's just say that. What would you teach and what would you, what would you focus on? It does not have to be sex related, but if you had to teach something that you feel you know a lot about that you'd be qualified to teach on in some way, what would you teach? What would the class be?

Speaker 5:          02:17:26       I think I would give lectures about interpersonal relationships and connectivity as it relates to our society as a whole. Why we should be more cognizant of how we treat our service staff, waitresses, um, hotel, Khan, share staff, things of that nature, how we interact with humanity around us as a whole. How do we treat, say, the Mcdonald's worker or the person checking us out at Walmart? How do we interact with our classmates and our colleagues? What about the interpersonal relationship between that student teacher dynamic? I think I'd want to really go into talking about the depth and meanings of those different connections and how they can be used to better and enrich our lives in society. If we're able to change that generational mindset of the youth and get them to put their cell phone down and sit down and have a meal where they're talking amongst their peers, that's going to generate new ideas, that's going to generate new innovations. That's what's going to take us to that next point in our society where all of these things we say we'd like to accomplish within our society will actually be achievable through that unitive mind, that cognitive collection of everyone contributing and interacting and working together and kind of forming this unity and this bond. And sure, you could say that it could be about sex, but really I think that it comes down to that level of connectivity, that level of interpersonal relationship is vital to humankind.

Speaker 3:          02:19:03       I agree. So now we're at the tail end of this conversation of this round one at least, and people can find you online if they wanted to say hello at Alice, little on Twitter. Then you're on the bunny ranch bunny ranch.com. Forward Slash Alice Hyphen little, uh, where else can people find you online? Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:19:27       Yup. My Twitter is actually at the Alison.

Speaker 3:          02:19:32       Sorry about that at Alice Little, uh,

Speaker 5:          02:19:37       all right. Then I also maintain my own personal website and blog, the alis little.com and you can go on there to see photos of myself, go through my blog and see about the different topics I write about the websites. Also designed to kind of walk you through the different experiences and encounters that are available. And of course any questions related to sex work I'm open to. It's very important that we talk about these things that it's very important to embrace that curiosity. So if anyone wants to know anything about what it is I do on the service I provide, I would love to get to know you and I'd love to interact with you. Email is probably the, the best way to do it, which is aliceLittle@bunnyranch.com.

Speaker 3:          02:20:24       Oh God, you just did it. Okay. You may have to modify your email management approach, which is fine. We're just fine. You will be getting a, I don't think you'll have to worry about getting too few email. Uh, so,

Speaker 5:          02:20:40       Hey, I look forward to it. I am all in.

Speaker 3:          02:20:43       All right. Do you may, you may, you may get the hug of death. This is one of those, be careful what you ask for things. Is there anything else that you would like to suggest to the people listening or to recommend to them to ask of them? Is there anything else you'd like to communicate or impart before we wrap up this conversation?

Speaker 5:          02:21:09       I would say as an overarching message, if there was really one thing that I had to ask of your viewership, it would be to have an honest conversation about sex with someone. It doesn't have to be your significant other. It could be a friend, it could be a peer, it could be a professor, it could even be me. But let's talk about sex. Our society as a whole isn't talking about this and sex isn't going away. It's a natural and normal part of being an adult in society and it's something that we should feel more comfortable talking about. So go ahead and try to have that conversation and might be a little bit uncomfortable at first. But I guarantee you, if you push yourself and you actually engage in that kind of interaction, you're going to grow as a person for it and really, really benefit from it as a whole.

Speaker 3:          02:21:58       Good advice. Very, very good advice. And, uh, and you know, another tool in the toolkit that I'll recommend for people is to check out a book called, uh, and I think this applies in many circumstances, uh, to things that we are loath to talk about. But there's a book called radical acceptance by Tara Brock has also been on this podcast that I think is a useful, perhaps a useful wedge for getting your foot in the door to be open to accept certain things about yourself and then then discussed them. Uh, Alice, this has been so much fun. Thank you so much for taking the time.

Speaker 5:          02:22:34       Oh, absolutely. I had a blast. Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it and everything that you do.

Speaker 3:          02:22:40       Thank you. Uh, this is, this has been, I feel like this conversation has been a longtime coming since 11 minutes. Found me 10 years ago and so much more food for thought. And I'm sure I'll have many, many more questions. So perhaps we'll do around two at some point. But for everyone else that, yeah, I'm sure that there will be many followups and uh, God saved your inbox. But

Speaker 5:          02:23:05       Hey, send me your sex questions. Here we go. Let's do that

Speaker 3:          02:23:10       and for everybody listening, uh, as usual, you can find links to everything that we've talked about, including the books, the websites, the Alis, little.com at the Alis, little on Twitter and so on in the show notes along with the show notes for every other episode@tim.blog forward slash, podcast and as always, until next time, thank you for listening.
