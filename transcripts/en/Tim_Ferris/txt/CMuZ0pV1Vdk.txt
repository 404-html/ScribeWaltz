Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Do you think? I'm sorry. I'm just thinking, uh, interview, um, on the, uh, old Skype. Any chance you could not move them?

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism living this year. Thank you. For sure.

Speaker 3:          00:01:22       This episode is a conversation between yours truly Tim Ferris and Ed Cooke. Ed Cook is a grand master of memory based in Britain. Great Britain, a good friend. He's made a number of appearances in the four hour chef. He helped improve my ability to memorize anything and everything is also very well known for coaching. A writer named Joshua four from nothing I he ground zero to becoming u s national memory champion and I believe a year or so of time, a really astonishing feat and we'll get into what grand master of memory means. This is a two part episode, so you have two separate parts. They are very, very dense. They're hilarious. If you liked the Kevin Kelly episodes, the Josh Waitzkin episodes or any episodes that are similar to those very in depth wide ranging, you are going to love this episode. I hope you enjoy it. So without further ado, here's I'd cook.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       Hello Ladies and gentlemen, this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to a special episode of the Tim Ferriss show. I have my dear friend Ed Cook on the line. I grabbed him last minute for reasons I shall explain and he is a grand master of memory among many, many other things at the, at the ripe old age of 23 is when he turned that corner. But Ed, where are you at the moment and, and what are you up to summer? I'm currently sitting in the, uh, in the office where I work, which is a converted method is chapel in Bethnal Green London. Um, and it's

Speaker 4:          00:02:59       Friday night at 10:15 PM yes. Well, people with adequate social lives. A, I kind of be a, you know, running around town and falling in love. Um, yeah, I'm, I'm here and I'm trying to youtube and I'm delighted to be here.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       I wanted to actually share with people what we just talked about doing an audio check before we began recording where you gave the best answer I've ever heard, to a very mundane question, which is what did you tell me what you had for breakfast? Or what did you have for breakfast? And you can feel free to improvise, but what was your answer roughly?

Speaker 4:          00:03:35       Well, it was a sound check. So it, I myself of a sudden embellishment. But yeah, that was just what I think had a couple of 'em partridges um, um, a few sausages, some salmon, seven campground kippers I think they were, they were the campus and the peat smoke kippers uh, full boiled eggs and two poached eggs, that kind of thing. Yeah, I caught her. I actually don't know the English king, but, um, I had a friend who, um, uh, it was amazing. Fred said a friend who, uh, occasionally breakfasty to sorta chuck a lot of counter be. I mean, I'd be like, you know, what are you talking about? And He'd be like, oh, I'm just thinking about what, you know, Henry the sixth had for breakfast every day.

Speaker 1:          00:04:17       I should, I know I shouldn't give some background for folks who may not realize that, uh, you and I first connected several years ago and you were tremendously helpful with the four hour chef since that was a book about accelerated learning disguised as a cookbook, which surprise surprise ended up being very, very confusing to almost everybody in the universe who came across it. But there were aspects of it including, uh, chapters focused on pneumonic devices and other types of memory techniques where you were incredibly helpful. So first of all, thank you very much for that. Um, or my perfect and I was having trouble piecing together how we first came in contact. How did we first meet? And I should also just as context for folks point out that Ed is in the UK, I am drinking highly caffeinated tea. He is drinking wine and this is intended to be like a pub conversation. So please feel to the interpretation

Speaker 4:          00:05:19       did it already robots? So the context of a, of a ripe old age just pub. Yeah. Well we came into contact through, um, my dear friend Greg with whom I co founded the company. Um, and um, Greg was then a phd student at Princeton and I think you came to do a couple of tools. He got shy with you and it was through that, that we met.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       That's right. And so, uh, for those who are not familiar, uh, ed is cofounder and the office that he referred to is related to, uh, his company memorize, memorize Dotcom, which we'll come back to. And, uh, the, the concept of being a grand master of memories,

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       I were like concept that qualification, what is entailed in becoming a grandmaster of memory. So, um, yeah, so, so I think I'll, I'll explain that first and then we can discuss it a little bit. Um, just how stupid a term it is and what a marvelous device for kind of, you know, either ending a conversational beginning one at a bus stop. But yeah. So I'm at Grandma's to remind me, it's a kind of title given out by the, uh, the world memory sports, but they should and, and basically you have to be able to remember, I'm a 100 digit number in and out a pack of cards in under a couple of minutes and then 10 packs of shuffle the cards in an hour. So it's, um, so it's, it's three parts of the world, maybe championships, which determine, uh, whether you can get this title and um, yeah, I mean it's, um, it's a great title.

Speaker 4:          00:06:49       I mean, I can't really very compelling title and I decide either the number of times, you know, I've been in the kind of losing situation and like club, you know, outdanced um, you know, you know, I'm not a symmetrical person, Tim. Um, and, uh, you know, sometimes my visual, you're kind of understates the, the value of conversation with me. So this is sort of like, and, but he's just, you know, just, so I said, what's your problem? It's like, sorry, I'm [inaudible]. It's like, okay, you know, device from champagne and then we can talk further about this. That's important qualification. But yeah, it's, it's a very city concept. But, um, the, you know, the, the, the kind of the cultural context if you want from which emerges namely people doing competitive memory competitions I think is awesome and fascinating because, um, uh, because um, in 1990, the world record for memorizing a shuffled deck of cards was 149 seconds, which know if he could memorize a pack of cards in under three minutes and show that to somebody, they'd be fatty, astounded.

Speaker 4:          00:07:53       And we think you were teaching. And you know, it's not obvious to anybody that the human mind would be capable of that. Um, and I remember I was very proud, um, you know, 10 years ago when I first broke a minute, I asked like, oh my goodness, this is extraordinary. I mean, the word record now is 21 seconds for the memorization of a shuffled deck of 52 cards. You sort of think, well, obviously, you know, people presumably haven't got like four times faster brains and they did. Um, I'm only 24 years ago. But the reason for it is, is that there's been this competitive culture in which, um, there's an objective measure of mnemonic speed if you like. And over the last 10, over the last 20 years, people have on each year done their best to outgun the rivals and the memory scene and then very openly and freely shared the techniques and hacks they've used to be able to optimize these 30 arbitrary but nonetheless kind of interesting processes of, you know, memorization and the results has been an absolutely continuous linear increase in the amount of stuff that people can remember across of very wide range of disciplines in a particular amount of time.

Speaker 4:          00:09:05       So this is true or like names and faces, random strings of words, crazy like abstract, he generated images, all this stuff. People who have been able to think up to test people's memories with as a result of this community of competition and sharing. Um, you know, people have got almost 10 times faster now in the course of 24 years at memorizing things when it was already very impressive in the first place. So, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       I think that's why it's an interesting thing. Yeah. Is that a function of prize money, Prestige, social media? I'm very curious about the dynamic that has produced that progress. Because if you look at mixed martial arts for instance, UFC and you look at the first 10 of C's, compare that to compare to the competitors, to the competitors, say a 30 UFC fcs later. Compare those competitors with those of today as the prize money has increased. Among other things, I think it's primarily the prize money. Uh, you see a very quick evolution in terms of whether it's selection bias or just a larger pool of competitors that has gone from say, top 20% of athletes in the United States to top 10 to top two. And you're just looking at at mutants in many cases now, uh, not to, not to detract from their tech team, not to diminish your amount is applicable. Yeah. Right. Not to, not to diminish their, their gentlemen laid demeanor, uh, and technique and training. But is what is, what is, what are the contributing factors to the, the, the, the increases in, in speed. And came in, well, it over the options. You have it up the um, you can choose, you can choose other ones. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:58       Well total Twitter followers of a competitors of the warm every term ships is, uh, yeah, 20, 25 or something. But, um, yeah, the, um, and it's not money. There's no, there's no real money on it. I think it's, um, you know, I would just, I would her suppose that, you know, perhaps in a hundred years' time if people, we did still care, the current state of memory sports would be considered still extraordinarily immature. Um, and so I think we'll probably, what of, what's the kind of, it's like cricket in the 19th century in England where people were kind of working out the basics of technique. Um, um, in that case, historically, I believe it was the invention of the steam train, which allowed cricket. They get good because, uh, teams from further apart in the country could visit each other. Um, the, uh, information and press was delivered quicker.

Speaker 4:          00:11:50       And so there was a sort of general, um, increased in the talent pool. We're competing with each other. And, uh, and it was just possible to even travel and sort of compete. And it's something that said, like, people from all over the world can do it, you know, it's easy to hop on a plane so that that's a contributing factor. Um, but I think fundamentally the motivation is there. There's just so cool winning or doing well in the world memory championships, then it's purely a, it's purely a kind of, um, slightly comic form of status I think, which drives it as well as the fact that of course it's, it's phenomenally interesting to, um, take something which every single person there would never imagine they were capable of doing and push it and push it and push it to, to see how well it can be done. Um, and it probably helps that it's quite precisely quantifiable and he was like a hundred meters or whatever else. And I wanted to, I wanted to grab, uh, something you mentioned and come back to which is what, what

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       the average person is capable of doing or what most people are capable of doing. And, uh, perhaps you could recount for folks the outcome of one of the experiments that, that you and I did a also involving your team, which was related to the four hour chef. So we wanted to incentivize people to try to memorize a shuffled deck of cards. And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about that and the outcome because a lot of people listening will probably assume like a thousand digits. I could never even remember a phone number. I couldn't remember 20 numbers. And they underestimate what they're capable of doing. So I would love if you could just perhaps recount the results of the experiment that we did related to the book launch.

Speaker 5:          00:13:31       Yes. That was, that was a fun, fun thing we did. So, yeah. Or memorize we, um, we don't just competition, uh, with you, Tim. Uh, yeah. At the same time as the launch of the book. Um, and you know, it was a $10,000 prize. Um, I believe munificent be supplied by Youtube. Yup. That's right. I spent it on a, yeah. Anyway, so, um, so anyhow, so yeah. So did I had this, um, this great engineer and the office called tank who built this amazing system, which was basically, um, a standard memorize course where you would, um, learned to associate with each card in the deck. Um, a person. And I'd actually proposed like a group of 52 people, but there are ways of changing them to be people, uh, that you, you wanted to have in your, in your set of images. And the basic technique underlying this is the, um, you know, cards are boring and a memorable sequences are boring, are memorable.

Speaker 5:          00:14:26       How do you remember them? Well, you turn the cards into images which are more memorable. And so for instance, Tim, you are slightly more memorable than the three of hearts say, um, because you have characteristics, you have a personality. I can imagine you in detail, like I made new interacting in situations, so you're inherently more interesting to my brain than mere card or figure or, um, or, or anything like that. Um, and so mean this is going to be and couldn't be and here an expedition, but I'll keep going. So, um, I think it's, I think you do think you're doing great. The assumption that I have personality is a bit of a stretch, but besides that you're doing fine. I didn't say that it was an adequate to I one. I just said there was one. Um, anyway, so, um, so you know, the basics of memory techniques is that our minds love certain kinds of things.

Speaker 5:          00:15:17       So we're very, very good at remembering spaces were very, very good at remembering things, which, which attracts our interest. And so, you know, a good of thumb I like to use is that, and I think we should grab your attention if you're wondering down the streets is the kind of thing which will grab your attention and your memory. So you know, we'll something grey and um, written in legal language. Grab your attention if you are walking on the street. No, but we'll like kind of a small elephant being attacked by Lemars. I try to attention, yes, you will. A spectacular lists of naked woman. I tried to attention, perhaps we'll um, a um, Balart do. So probably not. And so it's the same thing when we kind of perceive within ourselves, which is to say when we remember the, the vivid, interesting emotion grabbing things.

Speaker 5:          00:16:05       I again, Tim, I'd like to clarify the evoke vivid emotions particularly, I mean I'd just take it as yourself, but anyway, these things, this is covering attention. So the art of memory is basically transforming information which is not interesting into forms of information which are interesting. And four pack of cards. The technique which I, um, I use myself, um, and it's very popular in the Miami community, is to take each card and then wrote, associate a person with it. And, and you know, if you go with personal association could do this very quickly. It takes like an afternoon for normal person to associate with 52 cards, 52 people. And then having got that code, which is a bit like a language really though you think of as language. So if I say all our to you, you'll say, oh, hi Ed. And you've just learned that arbitrary association between some letters or La and a meaning.

Speaker 5:          00:16:55       Know Hi there. Something. Uh, and it's just like that with the cards. It's like a, it's like a very, very small language, 52 words. And so when you go through the cards, you, I'm, you imagine the people you've associated with the cards instead of the cards. And already it's massively more interesting. And the second thing you do to tackle the sequence, which is difficult to remember because it's just a bland sequence, is that you string these people who were standing in the cards into an amusing stories. So you, uh, you might be getting your doorstep and you know, there's Tim Ferriss and he's, he's desperately trying to impress the queen. She's not impressed. And then slightly down the road we've got like the pope and he's chatting with Ed stone and, and, and you know, these, these people are standing in for cards. And because Tim is trying to impress the queen, it's kind of funny, you know, kind of a kind of colonial, perverse humor vibe or whatever.

Speaker 5:          00:17:47       And it's just more interesting than three of hearts, seven of spades, kinda think. Anyhow, so that's the best city. So, going back to your original question, we, we put together a course on memos which helped people make these associations is that, you know, people will play on that for an hour and they build up this vocabulary of waste thinking about cards. So they're just more interesting, more vivid, uh, that sort of, they attract more emotion and so they're just generally more memorable. And then, um, we propose the technique very famous and the memory kind of community, which is just sort of imagine going around a space and actually for your blog, Tim, I remember embarrassing myself when my local street in a snow storm trying to wonder around demonstrating how to place images in space. I was like, oh look up there. There's some of that.

Speaker 5:          00:18:30       I remember that very closely. They, the search for it, good cook, Cook, Cook with the knee on the blog to find that video. Yeah. Anyhow, so, um, so we did the competition. Um, so people learn the technique and they could practice with this cool system on the, on the website. And, um, what was astonishing was that, you know, a few thousand people entered, you know, most people, um, like basically couldn't be bothered and give up quite quickly, but, but, but basically anyone who did persevere and actually just learn the images and then start practicing. Um, many of them got really good, really fast. And, um, the girl who ended up winning it, um, who, whose name is Irina Ziad, she's a fabulous young lady programmer who, um, who lives in the Ukraine. I tried to recruit her for memos, actually. She was sort of only dimly interested. Anyway.

Speaker 5:          00:19:22       She, um, she, um, did it in about four days, so it's just like sat on a computer, a practice of thing, and then within four days. So basically now that I could do it under a second, and then the memo is Christmas party. That year we poked her in live on Skype to prove that she could actually do it and wasn't cheating as opposed to you, about 200 people crowding into the church, you know, scenes of unbelievable at the butchery. Tim, uh, I, uh, I, I think his eyes wide shut. One of the, yeah, it was that, but we better chat, better lighting. Uh, Eddie, how, um, yeah, it's just, you just nailed it again, live on Skype. Um, under the pressure. We, we told her I think that that was how she could actually win the POWs and um, and that's kind of it. Just a nice example, you know, like it's, um, it is very doable.

Speaker 5:          00:20:15       And, um, I had, I had a kind of another interesting experience with, um, where I met a, I, I went to the u s maybe championships I think in 2005 with, um, with my friend say this has been a sort of diversion, but I'll tell the other day. So I got this friend called Lucas who's from Austria, from Vienna who is, um, a, an absolutely hilarious and wonderful fellow who, um, before we'd done this, uh, we've been contacted by channel four and they were like, we're just interested to hear how her memory athletes train. And, um, I always been a bit

Speaker 6:          00:20:47       suspicious to be honest. So the concept of sort of self hacking, you know, never be quite quite clear whether that's something I really want to do my life anyway, so I, so I said, well, you know, like we like to get to high altitude and I'm going to complete seclusion. And I was kind of channeling an image of Ricky Hatton, the boxer, you know, going into the mountains and sort of getting through some there. They were like, awesome. So anyway, Lucas and I, we headed up into the mountains or we, um, we put on as a source of comedy show and this can be found on youtube, but a, um, a kind of image of what a mental athletes training program would look like. Well, it's a sort of press ups involving claps and I'm competitive. I'm boxing style mutual recitation and binary numbers and stuff.

Speaker 6:          00:21:29       Anyhow, so, um, it's, it's, it's a kind of, it's a minor. So there, for the sort of 12 or 13 people who, um, in your, in your listenership who, um, who think that I'm actually going to it, I get into an anecdote within 90 days I would look at it. Okay, so sorry. We went to America and we went to the u s memory chose ships and it was, it was quite hilarious. So, so both of us at that point, none American competitors, we're not really allowed to compete, but we were allowed to, can be. And um, anyway, we came first and second by a margin of about times three because at that point the sport was not very well developed in the u s and M. Anyway, there's a journalist then he was like, oh my God, you're a geek. You're a a seven.

Speaker 6:          00:22:14       And the rest of it. And I was like, uh, no, me, you know, we were two young lads who've got an enthusiasm for maybe attendance. And so he was like, well, there, but this is impossible. So I was like, no, no, no, no, I'll train you. So, uh, so I trained him for a year and he wound up the next year. And by the way, I'm a pretty brutal coach. It's a kind of a way of, um, is a way for me to transcend my own insufficiencies is to criticize others. And so, so I trained him up for a year and a, yeah, he wound up winning the American memory championships. Um, and um, yeah, it, it was pretty cool. And he wrote a book about it. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:22:49       that was Joe Garcia for

Speaker 6:          00:22:51       correct. Yeah. Let's just share for his, um, yeah, he's super cool.

Speaker 1:          00:22:56       Moonwalking with Einstein. Yeah, very, very, a book did very, very well and had a great piece in wired that introduced me to that, uh, as well. Um, but, uh, sorry to interrupt, not my, uh, not mine. Perfect. Perfect. Well, I was, I was, I was, uh, I was taken aback by your sudden silence, which I mistook for, for, uh, shy shyness, but I think it's just drunkenness

Speaker 6:          00:23:30       taking another slug.

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       Nice. Nice. Nice to get you a camera for our next podcast. The, the, uh, so just to put in, just to put things in perspective for folks with a, it was arena, right? The Ukrainian woman. Um, yeah. So she, she learned to memorize a sh a shuffled or randomized deck of cards and less than a minute in four or five days. Uh, and the previous us record, I guess a few years ago had been what, 147 seconds or something along those lines. Um, so she beat the US record with four to five days of training. I mean, granted it was an older record, but I think that that just highlights what is possible for people. And, uh, the, the, the question I'd love to ask you is, I mean, what, what are some, some, uh, some perhaps if people have an afternoon and, uh, they are not going to necessarily focus on the pack of cards. Is there something else that they can do to prove to themselves that they have greater, uh, mental athleticism or memorization potential than they've ever thought possible? Is there something else that they can do?

Speaker 6:          00:24:49       They can make love to a beautiful woman in their imaginations without moving a muscle.

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       Okay. And why would you recommend that?

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       Um, well, it was a joke. Okay, you got to, you're so dry. It's just dry. British humor are, we're still dragging her.

Speaker 6:          00:25:09       That was like, she just, that was a straight straight out, oh that funny. But I suppose the tinkle of a thought which underlies every joke there, but take it with a thought. We started as a joke though. He's just, the imagination is, um, an our capacity to form images just while talking just what communicating is, um, is already extraordinarily potent. And it is, wait, wait, wait. So what will the thing which confuses people, it's like how can you possibly like form an image in a second, which you then end up remembering five minutes later. And, um, the example I like to give is that that's what happens in conversation the entire time. So, you know, if I say to you, I might just describe my office to Tim and then we'll actually test your memory. I know, I know that you're sort of getting out of bed and um,

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       getting, getting a little, a little long in the tooth. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:26:08       Daughtery but uh, yeah, so describe the office. We've got a quite a colorful off it. So I'm going to kind of, I'm going to begin here where I am and about 15 seconds, I'm going to describe to you the sequence of objects. I'm going to see. I'm going to make it a bit more vivid by imagining myself as an amusing character. Kind of leaping around, say like, let's say the I am, um, can you, can you want it? You name the amusing character Tim.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       Uh, musing Mortimer

Speaker 6:          00:26:34       motorbike is, I'm more trauma. Um, and I'm gathering into a laptop. I'm going to take a bottle of wine right by me and I flung it into the wall where there's a picture 25. I didn't know what they are. I mean, let's just say you're Cousy and sort of jock straps and tattoos, Japanese men, um, or a picture of them on the wall. And then I jump around and others, is this a hammock? And in the hammock there are two labs. This is not true by the way, but anyway, two lambs, eating cheese. Um, and then you jumped over the hammock and then, then something's a grand piano and there's a young man playing shopper. Um, and he's chopping away at the piano and then move over. And then there's a swing. So it goes from Canada to the swing, does most of her, and the swing is covered in pink roses.

Speaker 6:          00:27:13       And if you kind of trace up the swing of the robe, you'll see the, at the very top, there is a, uh, a model of a rhesus monkey just dangling from the top of the rope, jumping back down. You'll land on the kitchen table where four people for a unfortunate memos, employers are just trying to sort of have a quiet evening in, um, you know, reflecting on the, on the vicissitudes of life. But there by the big Auger, the big metal oven, and I'm the, the metal oven is emitting heat. And on the Auger there was a pot full of spoons. Okay. So that was, um, an incoherent narrative. Last thing, about 45 seconds, I'm guessing, uh, in which I mentioned motors, Mortimer's little adventure. And, um, and you know, the first thing I'd say to your listenership is it just merely by listening to that you followed it, you formed the images at the speed of talk, which is, you know, one or two images a second, and you've strung that into a coherent mental concept or Inca here and one, you know, I'm drunk, come on, calm down and goes. But anyway, you, you start getting into intercare in of concept in a spectacularly small number of sectors. I read something phenomenal. If you think that it's even possible to follow that, a battery out them, we're going to, we're going to not going to test you. So I'm on my laptop more summers there and he's looking at that to what happens next.

Speaker 1:          00:28:28       Uh, it grabs a bottle of wine, which is right next to him. The throws it into a picture on the wall, which has 25 Yakuza jock straps with tattoos. Uh, and then, uh, I'm having a bit of recency primacy here. And then, um, after that, um, I want to say there, there, there are two lambs in a hammock. That's correct. Yep. And, uh, I don't recall what the eating, yeah, that's what they are eating cheese if I remember correctly. And then, uh, then jumping out of the Hammock to a, uh, I believe it's piano after that there's a gentleman playing Chopin and chopping away at the keyboard, which was very clever of you to use the ch twice. That helped. Uh, and then, um, uh, then from there we, we, we get to a swing, which has, is covered in pink roses and oddly enough as a model of a rhesus monkey hanging at the very top of it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       Uh, and when Mortimer jumps off of this swing, he lands on a kitchen table where therefore memorize employees just trying to go about their business. And it's very disruptive, quite obviously a, and there is a, then next to them a, this is where I got tripped up a little bit. Um, the, the Auger on the stove top, I don't know what an Auger is a, but there's a pot on top of whatever an Auger is with spoons in it. And then that's the, uh, the curtain falls and that's the end of the Mortimer shows. I remember it

Speaker 5:          00:30:04       that Seg so well done too. So yeah, just, just sort of a ticket it, we've done that. So you go on laptop, bottle of wine, you accuser 25 of them, jock straps. So we're up to about six items. How much lambs, cheese, Pnh shop and shopping swing, pink roses, Reese's jumping off landing kitchen table memos, employees. Oh, okay. Even though you didn't know what an Aga was, it is by the way, his mother more of this kind of European oven, which is basically am a one ton block of iron, permanently heated, which acts as central heating and as a cooking mechanism, which is what I mean. And on top of that, there was a pot with spoons and says it's 20 things you correctly remembered in sequence. They're just really by dint of understanding human language, which you have successfully recounted in order. Uh, and for that, the, uh, the narrative helps, but it just kind of give skips one an insight into how these aren't in the same way that say for instance, firing an Arrow through a, um, a blackbird, you know, we're just flying through the sky is like a skill you almost have to learn, you know, on the, on the top of basic motor skills, but you have to learn it very, very specifically.

Speaker 5:          00:31:17       These sort of memory techniques draw from quite fundamental cognitive capacities. They're quite, yeah, it's quite, um, it's quite basic. And you know, I do this other thing where I kind of, I do these things called memory works. When you just get a bunch of random pedestrians got them together and say, okay, we're going to learn whatever, you know, the u s presidents, the first pharaohs of Egypt, what have you, and you just wonder around the town for about an hour and you're like, oh, imagine you know George Washington, the, I don't know who George Washington is. I mean, just, okay, but imagine jewels is shark washing himself tons. So they go, okay, very good. They imagined that in the window over there. And you gotta wonder around and with no prior training whatsoever, you can sort of unlock is too strong a word. You can just, um, make use of the fairly phenomenal underlying kind of cognitive capacities that you have at your disposal all the time. So, so it's, it's, it's not I kind of elusive geek skill fundamentally. It's, it's basically just to kind of cunning use of what the human brain does best, namely process wheel meaning imagine interesting things happening in space and, um, and kind of integrate narratives.

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       I know I, it's, it's something that I feel like, uh, and this, this actually touches on a sort of a deeper, uh, I wouldn't say insecurity, but a conflict that I have an inner conflict that I'm hoping you can help me resolve. Um, very, uh, I'm very, I'm very indecisive about my sexuality. Not as, not at all. I wanted to, uh, sexually ambiguous. It's caused me a lot of strife. Uh, no, that's, that's also not it. The question is related to utility of highly refining certain memory capabilities. So I, when I was in, when I was in college, I read a number of books including, I think it's just called your memory and how to improve it as like the most generic. I think that's it. Higbee uh, most generic title imaginable for something that talks about vivid imagery, but I remember it becoming very fascinated by memorizing numbers and, uh, and then I might be getting the terminology wrong, please correct me, uh, if I am, but the, the sort of number of consonant system where you're, you're converting and the numbers and the consonants, you convert those into words and images and that allows you to memorize long, uh, long strings of digits.

Speaker 1:          00:33:42       And I would, and I would place these images around typically my surroundings and I think that might've been a weakness in my method. I would always use wherever I happen to be as opposed to a predetermined route. Uh, the, the only benefit to that method is that I, when I, when I would play this game with people and I would typically have them pull out a five, a single and a $20 bill. So I'd have them pull out bills of different denominations and I had memorized the serial numbers on those different bills and then you to the policy teams. Oh yeah. It was, I wasn't fast enough to make it really exciting. I was like, okay, cool. Give me five minutes. And they're like, what? Okay, this is really boring. Um, but what was really fun about it is I would memorize these numbers. They would, they'd be like, oh wow.

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       It's amazing that I do them backwards. Oh my God, that's amazing. And then, uh, but it, it only took a really a week or two of practice to get to that point. And I'm, and I'm so confident that almost anyone can do that. The what was fun about having the Loci, I mean the, the locations dependent on where I was sitting at the time is that very often I could bump into that person a week later and say, hey, you still have that five or that single or that 20 I can, I can give you the serial number. And I could remember it because I had so many distinct locations, which was kind of a fun trick. Um, but the, it took a decent amount of effort to get good at that. And what I'm wondering is, do you find that there are any particular mental exercises that have a high degree of carry over to other areas or that have more utility than others because there's, there's so many different kind of party tricks that you could develop or competitive capabilities is if you had to pick one that you think people would get the most out of?

Speaker 1:          00:35:30       Is, is that even a possible? Is that a good question? But I think about this because it does take time to sort of mean for me to maintain a high degree

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       of proficiency with these things. Right. I think the, I mean, I wouldn't necessarily recommend to, you know, anybody with a rounded social life to get too deep into the, uh, the number of memorization stuff. But I mean for, for me, um, the, the interest in memory techniques kind of, um, is I guess, you know, emerges out of a much more general, um, interesting consciousness and sort of, um, yeah, the, uh, the curiosities of having a mind of the character of that we have. And, uh, to the question, um, you know, what is the most generalizable, useful, um, concept, not maybe requiring practice that one can draw out of. Um, the theory into the history of memory techniques. I think I'd give two answers on the first is, um, you remember things which ignite your imagination. Um, and we all know this in our hearts. You know, if you're really into soccer or football or as we call it here, you know, you might be a, a pathetic credit score, but you might be able to remember something like, you know, if you actually added it up, 12,000 distinct football results, the equivalent of a kind of medical degree, uh, in terms of scatter of information, it's because you're interested in.

Speaker 6:          00:37:05       So, um, I think a lot of people, um, are kind of embarrassed about the characteristics of the mind that, you know, the other things that they have a greater tendency to remember the things which they feel they need to do to really wrap their mind around a topic. And so the first thing would just be like the most, the things which, um, you find stimulating and interesting other things you remember. And don't censor yourself in finding what those things are at allowing yourself to kind of, uh, experience information in that way. Um, and so I'll try and make that concrete, you know, um, I think the, um, a lot of people will be reading some nonfiction book about economics and it was sort of ignite in the back of their mind the idea that this is actually a bit like their friend owl. Um, and how he, uh, how he behaves with, with their made Dan.

Speaker 6:          00:37:55       Um, but it's actually officially about, you know, US China relations and you know, that metaphor that, that way of comprehending things that are very kind of personal, perhaps trivial, um, manner of comprehending things through the filter of one's own experience gets suppressed leading to kind of boredom and, um, uh, a lack of emotional engagement with the subject matter. And so, you know, uh, just to say it succinctly, like just, just back wherever your mind needs to go and endorse it and ignite interest through kind of imagination would be one thing because that's a very succinct, a piece of advice. Uh, second thing is succinct, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       which is just the, um, when two things are in the same place, either in your mind or on a diagram or, um, in a semantic space, if you, they will get confused with each other. Um, and, and I think the genius of the special techniques is the genius of having different contexts or different thoughts. And you touched upon this actually with, um, with your own, um, adventures with five and $10 bills, which is that where thoughts were experiences and thoughts are separated. Um, they stand alone, they don't interfere and they can, um, they can persist through time, but where they are, um, sort of specialty connected and you know, actual experience or um, or especially connected to kind of within the mind. So where, um, um, where were two concepts just feel very, very similar and you kind of, when you're thinking about them, you kind of thinking about them in the same way, they will tend to fuse with each other and then fail to be distinct entities in their own rights.

Speaker 5:          00:39:34       So just literally separating stuff out in space is incredible as a general cognitive tip for brainstorming, for resolving arguments, for clarify emotions that in relationship to you know, anything. And you know, because uh, because of this I, I discovered some quite interesting thing about how to design house parties. Um, so you know, you still have these, um, these moments where, you know, we have an incredible Houseparty talk to 25 really interesting people. It will be, you know, super thing at the time. You are just flush with happiness. And then the next day the whole thing would be in your mind would just be a kind of a blur. You just be like, yeah, I recall being in the kitchen and there was some people there and we chat about stuff. But, but because all those kind of memories or on top of each other, because of the spatial constraints of a house party, you don't really remember all the things which happened.

Speaker 5:          00:40:26       And if you can sort of take a house party, and this is true of any kind of experience, it could be true of, um, an evening out with friends. It could be true whether it's obviously true of road trips. It could be true even of, um, uh, of a friendship or a romance or anything else. If things are kind of spread out through space, if each kind of context or experience has its own place, then they can all live by themselves and you just get a much richer level of kind of autobiographic memory. Um, and so we, with house parties specifically, I kind of recommend always having three or four phases to a house party, a preferably with a different style, a different kind of music. I'm a different fundamental focus specialty. Um, and narrativize the transitions between them. So rather than just being like, there's a splurge of a house party and everyone's just getting drunk and try to chat each other up.

Speaker 5:          00:41:18       Instead you have a kind of a phase where you're being quite portion drinking champagne and listening to, I'm listening to French music and then, um, a bunch of people arrive and you're like, okay, we're not going to eat. I know once more we're going to eat on one leg and said, you can have a bunch of time hopping around chewing on reindeer or whatever it is. And then up onto the roof. It's a and you a differently. And so by, by creating an artificial structure you end up with, um, you end up with much richer experience. Um, um, and the, yeah. So that there would be some ways from Tim two pieces of advice or like, um, make stuff vivid and personally interesting and don't censor yourself. And then if you are relating to anything, it could be learning or even just personally experience, um, find individual spaces for each thing, um, because then they'll survive by themselves and not just kind of merge into the, um, into the kind of fall off of similarity,

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       right. Blending together into indistinguishability. So that has, uh, it's funny when you, when you start to think of just the, the basic programming that we have, uh, that of course has a lot of applications to dating as well. Uh, and you, you did mention something in passing. I want it to come back to which was clarifying your feelings about a relationship. And I wanted to know how, how you think about that because this is a pain point for a lot of people at different points in their lives, or at least a source of anxiety. How do you try to, uh, if this is even the objective, find objectivity when clarifying your feelings about a relationship or maybe it's just getting a better understanding of, of your own subjectivity, but, uh, I want it to kind of digest that and buying a challenge. I wanted to, wanted to just unpack that a little bit. So how would, how do you think about clarifying feelings in a relationship?

Speaker 6:          00:43:16       It's actually quite funny because, um, my girlfriend's cool, Clara and your acid does sound clarifying. Not sure there's much more I can do, but, um, anyways, so, um, I mean, I'm definitely not a relationship guru, but I mean, I, I, we're happy to freestyle on this subject because I think it is fascinating and is a lot of, it's a big source of pain and, you know, and it's also, it's an, and it's not just romantic relationships. It's also, um, you know, creative and personal relationships, relationships with friends and, um, and uh, you know, I've, uh, I've suddenly sort of, um, thought about this a bunch because they, one of the surprising features of adult life alongside like, um, not being competent as he was assuming going to become competent, whatever. Uh, and um, uh, and the fact that sort of, um, that you are actually going to be covered adult and this is kind of, you know, we'll see when you're 18, you know, it's a pretty abstract thing.

Speaker 6:          00:44:20       You kind of, you know, aging is a kind of comic, um, encounter with something you can conceptually deny with certain futility. But anyhow, so relationships to the other thing where you of, um, well when you're looking at a person, your in some sense you experiencing the entire, or at least, um, that person is the focus of the undifferentiated focus of a whole, like incredibly complex, um, tissue of fundamentally distinct, you know, emotions and judgments and attitudes. Um, and so, you know, you find yourself in a relationship, you know, in, in an argument saying, and you're like, well, um, and you basically, you're, you, you come from an emotion, you come from emotion, which is like you probably don't perceive yourself and you're thinking like, I don't feel very happy about what's going on sort of thing. Um, and the tendency is to map that against basically whatever springs into your mind, um, or whatever the person is, is telling you or what the situation is.

Speaker 6:          00:45:26       And so, you know, this is why like someone's late to a restaurant and someone can go absolutely mental about it out. Of course, it's got nothing to do with being late. The restaurant. It's part of a whole load of other stuff, which is dot, dot, dot, right. At the same thing. Um, and so, yeah, so for instance, [inaudible] and an argument that I have had, which turned out to be, um, amazingly stupid, um, I shall not shy, but now I actually think about what the talking room was about. I'm not sure you're timorous readers really what uh,

Speaker 1:          00:46:01       I want to hear about it.

Speaker 6:          00:46:04       So, um, so I had a, um, going to have to cut this out of the final recording cause I'm just going to have to pause and just sort of jumping to another topic. One of the fascinating things about language is that when you begin a sentence, even if you sort of have a, a intimation of how the sentence is going to end up, you actually got no knowledge of where, what the sentence particular formulation is going to be. So as you initiate your sentence, you have kind of like, oh, there's something interesting to be said with a particular kind of internal mental urge and the words begin to come out and you kind of shepherd it and it's slightly chaotic fashion to the end of the piece of meaning. You had implicitly wanted to admit at the beginning of his had to, but which is not like consciously before your eyes. At the beginning it just kind of, it's like a seed which becomes a tree. The seed contains the tree, but the seat doesn't look like the tree or whatever. Well, a similar thing with anecdotes. Um, you know, you, I think, oh, this is a really good idea, the best, best sell Tim about this day. And then, um, actually the anecdote is not actually before your eyes. And so I have to take a quick timeout just to see where this having to is like she get away. No problem.

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       Um, I can give you, if you'd like a bite or a pause, I can ask a few other, uh, and this then I might forget to come back to it. So we can also do that. Um, but uh, I would like to come back to it, but I'm cheap. I could hit you with a couple of rapid fire questions if that would take the pressure off. Okay. When you think of the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind

Speaker 6:          00:47:40       and why? Um, so I think of the German, oh wait, gutter, um, who, um, actually this is, this is good. It's a good topic. And I'm, by the way, very happy to return to the previous one because they're both interesting. But, um, but I, I'm quite suspicious of, um, um, the concept of marriage. So like, it seems to be like one of the guiding, if you'd like, philosophical assumptions of, um, you know, and I think actually, especially like western American California and, um, culture that Marriott is the correct thing to drive outcomes in humans lives. So, you know, if you try hard and you know where it goes off and your inherently really talented and you're not benefiting from saying, you know, inherited wealth or whatever, then the success and happiness and whatever else, there's my supposedly the immersion of that is justified. Um, and, um, and in fact, Tim, you know, you, um, you know, you write books in some sense and you know, and you're, you're interested in, you develop the concept of improving as a person of, um, of finding kind of powers and talents and, um, um, possibilities within yourself. And this is kind of inherently attractive idea, right? And it's very difficult on the face of it to say, well actually, you know, there's a problem with this, but I don't know what I'm saying those handovers but, but you know, Mary is kind of a fundamental assumption of, of um, of goodness. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       in the mirror. It is associated with effort. I guess I just want to define, I think

Speaker 6:          00:49:26       the noble concept of math Marriott is associated with efforts. So it's like, um, if you do something really incredible and you tried really hard that that success is something you deserve. We think of that as like morally justifiable. Um, which is kind of problematic for sociological reasons, but also programmatic for kind of a, and the sociological reasons being, some people have the opportunity and situation to express their talents kind of thing, but it's also problematic because you know, you just don't choose your marriage. Um, and so you might say, okay, I don't use my merits. Um, but actually I do choose them because I trained really hard and I learned about how to improve myself and I express discipline. But again, the underlying capacities which allowed you to find the time to train hard and control your, there's been, these aren't things you choose and you know, and so, so the, so almost all of our kind of, um, culture of admiration for people who do really well is based on this kind of implicit moral idea that people determine their own outcomes.

Speaker 6:          00:50:30       But once you kind of begin digging into that, it's not really clear. They, they, they do. Um, and the second part of that is, um, you know, what are the kind of categories and concepts with which we use to kind of determine Marriott. So like, um, you know, I'm always really struck by the fact that, um, that, um, for instance, in our society, there are people who are, um, have a level of genius for artistic expression and, um, other things which aren't kind of commercially valued and therefore aren't really culturally valued except in extreme cases. Um, who are, you know, are only like seven pounds an hour working in a cafe. Um, they have a mental world and range of learning and sophistication of perspective, which is enormously rich. And like, obviously compatible with that in most cases, in many cases like, you know, superior to according to a different perspective, someone who's like really good at coding and commands $200,000 a year and has high status and so on and so forth.

Speaker 6:          00:51:33       Um, and you know, in that case there's a kind of a, a, a kind of capitalistic I guess, reason for ascribing merits to one person over, over another. Um, but you know, you changed the perspective even slightly and um, the Marriott flips completely. And so the whole kind of concept of merit, um, does depend on these kinds of background thoughts about, about what is valuable, which is kind of often problematic. How would, how would you flip the perspective with the artistic Barista versus like, sir, we'll say one, one example, one different paradigm would be like, um, towards richness of experience. So, um,

Speaker 5:          00:52:14       which, um, you know, which people's mental Lowe's would

Speaker 5:          00:52:20       make for a better novel, you know, I don't show or whatever or you could say like, you know, effect on the environment. It is someone who's Super Dynamic and successful. The rest of it will tend to fly around and create capital and spend the capital in January. He taught the world economy, which generally heats up the world and so on. And so, you know, we, we have no way of tracking the kind of externalities of human action either in terms of comma, I. E the emotions of the people who surround and come into contact with important times to say environmental impact because we can't track them. And even if we could, we, uh, we might not. Um, we don't. So these aren't, these aren't metrics which we could, couldn't tune into. Right. Um, and because their metrics, we're not, we can't get into, we just kind of assume that don't really exist.

Speaker 5:          00:53:10       Um, and they, they have no real influence on, you know, um, a changes in behavior. But B, you know, what, as a society or culture, we find easy to admire. Um, so how did, how did good to make you think of marriage? Just like Jesus bad and just ask you a simple question. Answer Big Leftwich. Dot. Okay. Just like, I know, I know you hate iron rand. That's fine. Um, what do you think? A good day guys. It's really cool. Cool. So he's like, um, at the age of 25, he, um, you know, I, as a teenager, he sort of, I'm falling in love the entire time and writing poetry to Australians. And so then he's 25, he writes a novel, which kind of is an extraordinary brilliance for the troubles of young birder. It's this wonderful story of a young man who, um, who, um, falls in love and I'm, it doesn't really work out so well.

Speaker 5:          00:54:15       And as an aside, Gerta wrote this book by locking himself in a hotel room for three months, imagining his five best friends on different chairs and then discussing with his imaginary friends, different possibilities, applause and so on and so forth. Which is an example by the way of that spatial separation I was talking about, which is to say that in one's own mind with his son when somehow it kind of inherently boxed in and constricted and by like imagining in different spatial locations, different perspectives, and then kind of iterating and idea or, or um, or novel in this case. Through those perspectives, he was able to kind of give himself five perspective separated out and uh, and give himself the kind of multidimensional play ground for creating the work of art, which by the way is an awesome credit. [inaudible] hey have, so it does that.

Speaker 5:          00:55:05       And then he starts writing, you know, the best purpose already, the best pro stylists in the history of German language. And then, um, there's this like jewelry. That's how I was going to bring his thoughts to look. He goes, he's appointed of the Weimar republic as a kind of poet in residence, but then just got really interested in as other stuff. So he started like redirecting the construction of the canal system and do various other stuff and um, and doing lots of kind of inventive things. And so then he gets into, um, um, basically administered in administering a human affairs and he becomes a fairly good at that. And then at the age of 39, um, he basically falls in love for the first time, Trudy. Uh, or maybe that was starting to fall well valley, how he just disappears one day. He's like, he's like this very prestigious, sultry, important position.

Speaker 5:          00:55:50       He's kind of like the mayor of Weimar effectively. Uh, and then he just pisses off to Italy, just read, leaving a small note and then basically runs round, you know, falls. And now with lots of beautiful people, right? Some of the best sort of sexually what it poetry, every return. Meanwhile he's becoming, Chris comes back, becomes incredibly interested in, um, in Newton's theory of physics, which he thinks is appalling. And like it doesn't capture the mystery and beauty of color at all. So he wrote so theory of color, which is like, um, uh, an amazing fountain of incredible goodness for philosophers and stuff about the phenomenology of color perception and how shade and context and meaning influence the character of color. Um, and then meanwhile his rating Faust, famous play is the kind of greatest work. And he kind of completes that and it's 50 years, but that hasn't lost energy at all and goes through like three or four totally different styles of poetry.

Speaker 5:          00:56:50       Um, you know, and by the time he dies, the age of 82 ish, he, um, has become really interested in eastern culture. And, and did I forget to mention that he, he, he's got this deep aesthetic vision of, um, of science and our relationship to nature. And it comes up with basically what's the theory of evolution. Um, and, and I'd, I'd like studies plants and humans and does this particular thing there, which at the time a justification for humans, differences for the animals, which I think it was called the Inter maximally. We burn some random bone in your jaw. And it's amazing how we try and distinguish ourselves, you know, uh, Percival thumbs language, humor, there's, you know, consciousness or intelligence. Uh, and that, that point, it was the interface Minnery bird. And he actually did some dissections of animals and young humans show that this burn was present in both it fuses later in life and therefore is not the basis, you know, and, and so therefore it can be missed, but, but humans are animals are fundamentally the same.

Speaker 5:          00:57:48       And he talks about plants and, and the similarity of plants. Um, the efflorescence of a flower with the way the human cranium kind of bends round links up with itself. And so he's kind of, he's just cool. He's like expressive. He's incredibly independent. When Napoleon invades, um, I think he was living in Frankfurt at the time when opponent invaders, Frankfurt, everyone else's like sheltering and the houses and he was wandering the fields looking for evidence about the color pink for his theory of colors. It's totally called transcending the local context. Um, and uh, anyway, so he's interested in all this stuff. He's, um, passionate and intuitive. Um, he is a genius, which helps. Um, but he produces a kind of a body of work and a set of perspectives, which, um, which is just fundamentally life affirming and in a way which kind of carries through the ages. And so, like I actually got into girls, I, my God, I was traveling round or the age of 80 in the world is what people in England do. And between school high school in university, and I'm in my career, I just had girders aphorisms, his short little thoughts

Speaker 6:          00:59:06       in my pocket. And so I read and reread and reread this book. It's actually had quite a fundamental perspective on my life because these are his like little snippets of wisdom on almost any imaginable topic. Um, and all of them are brilliant. You know, it's things like the company of women, his schooling in good manners or boldness has genius, power and magic or you know, uh, and, and then the ones you don't remember in, um, in, um, their precise form, but which nonetheless act as little micro filters for interpreting reality. Um, and, uh, anyway, so let's say he's that kind of a big influence on me. I mean, one of his coats HD is like, uh, something along the lines of there is nothing so depressing as um, someone who is Derek, um, being praised by somebody who isn't. Because when we praise people, we put ourselves on a level with them, uh, ads.

Speaker 6:          01:00:03       So I was actually just trying to think of like a credit which related to this situation. And so here I am praising Gutter and actually as I'm describing it, I'm kind of channeling a bit of his general awesomeness and feeling a bit better about myself and uh, yeah. Anyways, so, uh, and by the way, I just as a general concept that that phenomenon of how a memory can have influence perception is the fundamental reason why I think it's still worth knowing things even though we can look them up. Because, um, by looking everything up, we give away and divest of the kind of central flow of our consciousness genuine, um, richness. Cause it's by having, it's by being able to recognize the differences between 20 different birds that you don't just perceive a bird, you perceive, oh, you do a particular variety of bird. And what on earth is it doing round here at this time of year, it must be lost. Perhaps the migration patterns being fucked up by global warming, whatever it turns like pure data into connection with a meaningful world. And that's kind of what memory does. And um, and so, and that will be kind of my general justification for, for me things. Um, you know, I liked that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       Ah, the, this is something that I, I also grapple with just as is I strive to sort of be the master of this tool. It is technology and not the tool of the masses. The, you mentioned two things about good to that I wanted to dig into a little bit. You mentioned passion and intuition and um, you can revise that, but those were two of the characteristics of good to that you, that you pulled out. And one of the reasons that I, I reached out to you very much at the 11th hour yesterday to see if you wanted to, to chat and catch up and just record it because I thought it'd be fun for people to listen to you. Is that been having, I've been having a bit of a tough time with medical issues related to Lyme disease and other things and uh, have felt a little, a little down, a bit in a bit of a slump.

Speaker 1:          01:02:11       And I find that you are always, you always strike me as very, and this could be an illusion, so feel free to disabuse me of this notion, but in a excited, very passionate, very, uh, energized. And I'm, I'm wondering if that is something that you feel you've, you've, you've always had intrinsically, or if it's something you've developed and if, if the ladder, and maybe it's a combination, you know, how do you strive to, to encourage that type of state, um, you know, what, what are the things that contribute to your better moments? Those are a lot of fucking questions in one, but, um, and I don't have, I don't know. I don't have, alcohol is huge.

Speaker 6:          01:02:53       Yeah. There will, I do. So if I might a slowing nonsense at this end of the Skype call, but, um, well first of all, sorry to hear about the medical stuff from the depot of, um, difficulties he has and that's, um, undoubtedly tough and, um, second thing. Um, no, I'm not always really happy about it. So I, it's funny, like day a company has been, um, an amazing journey full of just like the highest highs and the most like exact quibble, horrifying lows. You know, because it's sort of a, it's, you know, I guess it's just life really. But, um, everything, you know, you start a company, everything turns, it starts out, you know, like, oh, this is going to be absolutely incredible. You know, do something amazing. Everyone's going to love it and it's all going to be beautiful. So thing. And then, um, and then it turns out to be just like a much more complex human process and that, and you have, um, you know, you have breakdowns in relationships where people you love and you have, um, decisions you make where you subsequently realized that they were the wrong decision.

Speaker 6:          01:04:01       And it caused a lot of people's pain and you have, um, successes, which are wonderful, but, which are compromised by the fact that they weren't what they should have been because I think anyways, so I of course, like anybody else, like I'm, um, I'm uh, a, uh, you know, I have, uh, access to the full range of, of, of goodness or badness city. He would experience obviously. Um, I am quite keen on life though too. Like I do, I do. Um, and I, I do. Yeah. So I'm curious. I don't know where that, I mean, cause I mean I've, I guess I've, I am, I suppose it was also that I get my energy from the world and other people rather than internally. Like I'm, I'm, I'm very kind of, I'm on interested generally in, um, supposedly scientific assessments of, you know, personality and, and so on and so forth.

Speaker 6:          01:04:58       I think the, um, the reductive impulse is demeaning to humans. I'm also probably quite worried about what I discovered if I really liked it too. But, um, but, um, but I am an extrovert and I did read one thing, uh, in my studies, according to science, which struck me as fascinating piece of self knowledge, which is the, you know, introverted people tend to have a much higher internal level of energy, so that a proactive, interactive in every interaction with our environment isn't so necessary to keep them rewarded and interested. And there were just an, I am, um, undoubted the extroverted, so I absolutely love and gain huge energy for interacting with people and the, and so on and so forth. Uh, and so, so that's, that's kind of a personality thing. Um, regarding, um, like passion, I guess it's, um, this kind of might connect with a few interesting issues, but I think the, um, the, I suppose I'm a, I'm a dick and so I hate doing things, which for me basic. Yeah. I mean, as in like, almost everyone in life has to like, you know, SLAAC it up and just get on with things because things like it, but like, I have a kind of quite visceral, emotional reaction against being bored. And that does, um, and that does influence things. Uh, the other thing you touched upon there, which I think is such a good subject is intuition because, um,

Speaker 7:          01:06:34       the

Speaker 6:          01:06:37       process of rational need justifying to yourself, your action is it incredibly slow, um, full of like grayness and complexity and generally, um, like

Speaker 7:          01:06:57       yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:06:58       it's like, um, it's sort of 5% efficient process of moving forward in one's ideas and beliefs. Uh, because you know, you're like, ah, you know, we should really do this in the, you know, on memorize or you know, we share or um, I think I, I think this girl is like the personal I want to marry, but, and then you, if you allow Russian, I [inaudible] into this. Um, you end up with like, um, a situation where all the energy is going in the wrong place. It's like, but on the other hand, he didn't eat. She is, she know she, when are you going to get along with me and old age and like, what kind of person am I really looking to connect with them and say, you know, you could, you can sort of double question yourself to death though the on most things and when you know, when life is really, really good, one isn't like pissing around like going, oh, I really where I go in.

Speaker 6:          01:07:54       I'm like, ah, you know, it's, you know, it should I turn left or right out of the door to day. You know, you end up, it's going to existential burden's ass stuck between a million possibilities and never really doing anything right. When things are going really well, you're just like, this feels right. You might be wrong. Thank give a shit. Let's go. And that is sad. Agentic and this is actually something, I mean I've, I've, I've really had a journey in this within the, uh, within, uh, because, um, because um, my intention where they actually isn't at all with, um, we're helping people remember more effectively, which is the kind of thing you might do to a computer chip or know that is a, an element in something much more interesting, which is like helping people feel like a genius. So helping people love the world they're learning about or helping people just get pleasure out of their minds and the visions that their consciousness and learning.

Speaker 6:          01:08:50       Um, and one of the things about like as I think it is probably true in almost any profession because it starts out you've got this thing where you're like, you've got the, the, the push and shove between what happens in one month's time and what happens in 12 months time and um, and so, and all the time you're like, wow. Um, yeah, this idea we've had would be absolutely incredible and would make people feel like geniuses. But on the other hand, it's not going to move any metrics for two months. And it sounds a bit irresponsible. And whatever. I'd start in the early days, for instance, I had this idea of the, um, what we should cause we know we're fundamentally like a language learning side. Um, and I had this idea that we should all get on a bus, like a converted double decker bus and just go around Europe.

Speaker 6:          01:09:34       You know, a lot of coders, designers, you know, the whole team. I just got on a fucking road trip around Europe and it would just be incredible. It just be the best idea ever. So, um, and you know, we've learned so much about language and it would have been an incredibly fun, diverse, interesting experience. Um, and it would have been a wonderful way of getting PR and the rest of it. But on the other hand, and this is where rationality came in, you know, what the hell are you doing? You're supposed to be doing a startup, you're in a bus going around Europe, um, where he could asleep. Um, exactly what function does this have for the product, you know, and so they're really, another thing has come in and you're like, well, and so that was, that was an example of where intuition was watered by kind of banal kind of self recriminating rationality resulting in, I'm, I'm almost certain like a less interesting product and less fun.

Speaker 1:          01:10:23       Now you bring up a really interesting, uh, you bring up a really interesting set of questions and this is, this is something that at times I do better with at times I do more poorly with, but I've tried to at various points in my life, um,

Speaker 1:          01:10:43       make increased the speed with which I make decisions. So if a, if a decision is reversible and a nonfatal, then I find my life is generally much better when I just do exactly what you mentioned, which is like left, right? Who gives a fuck? I'm going right. It'll be fine. And if it's not, I'll figure it out later. And making these types of reversible decisions as quickly as possible so that you don't have a lot of cognitive burden and you're not sort of stuck up your own ass all the time. Um, but in the case of the bus, yeah, the business, let's just say or uh, how do you balance the, in the intuition, which at some at times can be an irrational exuberance with yeah, the sort of proof prefrontal cortex calculation. Yeah. Well that's, I, that's the question.
