Speaker 2:          00:00:24       This episode is brought to you by Inc tell and I've used them personally ever since I wrote the four hour workweek. I've been asked over and over again how I choose to delegate tasks, how I do 80 20 analysis and so on. At the root of many of those decisions is a simple question. Actually two questions. Number one, how can I invest money to improve my quality of life? I use that in investing as well. The second, how can I spend a little money or moderate money to save significant time inc tell is one of those investments there a turnkey solution for all of your imaginable customer care needs. I used Intel during the launch of the four hour body, which was very, very involved and they provided 24 seven customer service for my land rush campaign because it was critical for me to take care of every person who purchased my books and participated.

Speaker 2:          00:01:13       This allowed me to focus on the things that I am better. At my strengths, like the marketing plan that we'd worked on for six months, implementing that until trains their experience, customer service reps to know your business and your products inside and out and make it your customers are raving fans. They answer more than a million customer service requests every year and they can do so across all platforms, including email, phone, social media, texts, even chat, leaving your customers with poor service or just mediocre service, which by the way, in a competitive pool is a huge liability. Long wait times are unanswered messages carries a massive cost and risk to your business. Uh, Intel removes the logistics and headaches of this type of communication, allowing you to focus on your strengths and grow your business. It can be a real competitive advantage. And I see many, many ecommerce companies and tech companies thinking of customer service as a good enough checkbox or an afterthought.

Speaker 3:          00:06:48       I had Kale smoothie and an egg with Bacon on top. One egg with Bacon on top. One egg, a whole egg. Nope. Cause I was on the road at 4:00 AM I went to Starbucks and I took the sandwich. I took it apart and I just had the egg with the Bacon on top. Nice. And then the Kale smoothie was before he left the house. A Kale smoothie was, uh, at the gym before I, yeah, shortly after. What is in the Kale smoothie besides Kale, Cale peanut butter. Um, some of this, uh, projects, uh, like protein powder and almond milk.

Speaker 2:          00:07:20       Fantastic. Well, I think we're just gonna keep rolling since that sound check was so successful.

It's great to be here. And we just had some fun demoing things and certainly learning things. I wasn't doing anything I was observing in the gym, in the garage. So for people who are listening and want some additional video, which I highly, highly encourage, just go to tim.blog/podcast and click on this episode or you can go to youtube, Tim Ferriss, two r's, two s's. And you can find a bunch of video. Now you are considered, and I know you're not going to say this, but a Demi God within the world of crossfit by a lot of people, people look up to you for good reason. And I'm curious to know, if you were to look back at your peak competitive, uh, success, what do you think the advantages were that you had or developed? Like why were you as successful as you were? And of course you have incredible work ethic and so on, but if you, if you had to sort of dig into that, what do you think the, the, the elements were that made you as successful as you were?

Speaker 3:          00:08:34       I think primarily it was that I really enjoyed training. I didn't do it, you know, a lot of people, they like to compete. I didn't necessarily like to computer or did like to compete. I enjoyed competing, but I enjoyed training more. I like being in an environment that just pushed me. I liked, I liked, I'm getting comfortable, uncomfortable. I liked leaving the gym and feeling like I just got my buck kicks. It made me feel good about what I accomplished. And then I went on and try to accomplish that same concept in the rest of my life. Right. And I think that was something I really picked up on early on when I first found crossfit back in 2006 and then I won the crossfit Games in Oh eight and I was able to compete eight more times, mainly because I just love to train, you know, and, and, and the byproduct or the expression of that was my ability to go out there and compete.

Speaker 2:          00:09:20       Are there any particular workouts that come to mind or exercises? Anything that you find particularly enjoyable, even though they might be very painful?

Speaker 3:          00:09:31       I mean, I, I liked the ones that give you the biggest return, right? I mean, I think if you're doing thrusters, yes, they're very challenging, but they give you a huge return in terms of benefit, in terms of the way you look in terms of whether you feel the byproduct of strengths. I think thrusters, burpees, those type things. If I had to pick several items I would only do, or several movements I'm wanting to do for the rest of my life, it'd be things like that. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:09:51       if we were to say, look, while we're going to look forward in a second, I want to keep focusing on that for a moment. Any particular, uh, if you wanted to gage, say the, the fitness right, they cross fitness of anyone for that matter. Are there any particular tests that you would put them through to evaluate that? Whether it's like a certain variation of Fran or anything like that?

Speaker 3:          00:10:13       I would just look at like different metrics. I look at, you know, what is your mile time? Uh, how many pull ups can you complete? Uh, what is your Max deadlift, back squat press, um, and then start looking at a few, like the movements that combine both. Right. And so I think sometimes there's people that are really good at running and there's some people that are really good at, um, lifting. But I think the beauty is when he can combine those two. And so you know, a lot of like the Franz and the different types of work. I like a fight gone bad score. Those are good ways. And what is a fight going bad? So Phicom vow was originally created a with Bj Penn and Greg Glassman. Oh yeah. Long time ago. And baseball was, was, this was back when Bj was probably training at the Health Gracie Academy in mountain view old school long time ago.

Speaker 3:          00:10:53       And essentially what it is is one minute, one minute, one minute, five, five movements, and then you one minute rest and do that for three rounds. What are the five movements? So it's a Sumit old high pole. There's a push press, there's a rower, a wall ball and a box jump and all the movements are light enough that you can keep moving on them. And so you know, when Bj finished the, as the story goes, when Bj finished it was like, aw man, I feel like a fight gone bad. And so that's kind of how the story goes.

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       Just as a random side note, I used to go to these chiropractors, the Jansens who worked on a lot of fighters and I remember they described Bj Penn's hip flexors as the hip flexors of a camel. They said they were just like a quadricep done normal humans. Just, uh, if you were to say want to get someone hooked on exercising because you enjoyed the training, not everyone enjoys training. So let's say you're taking someone, you want to get them hooked on that drug of training. Uh, is there any particular approach that you would take? I mean, you've coached lot of people, you've, I'm sure encountered every different type of person from NFL player to say engineer who's never played sports and everybody in between. Uh, what do you do to get someone hooked so that they continue to come to the gym?

Speaker 3:          00:12:07       Yes. I mean, I've been really fortunate, you know, over the years. Um, I started a company NC fit and we have a ton of members and I've been able to look at it and say, hey, what is generally gets them to kind of stay with us? And more times than not, it's starting off slow and then working their way up. I think a lot of people get Gung Ho, right? They come in, Oh, you know, I want to lose weight. I want to do this one or that. I'll eat whatever you tell me, I'll do whatever you told me. And then all of a sudden a month later they're gone. Right? So I think the secret to success is, hey, just take your time, right? This is not a, this is, this is a lifelong journey, right? It's not like a one month you don't fad. It's, you know, I want to be fit and I want to be fit for the rest of my life.

Speaker 3:          00:12:43       And so I think it's important to recognize that and it makes small steps towards the right direction. You know, take out sugar, do this, do that small little steps, then go into the gym and start doing certain stuff. But I think finding a comradery, finding a coach, and find a community support you. Our rule number one, I think that doing it on your own is very challenging. You know, you and I were talking about cooking earlier and it's like if I want to learn how to cook, really, really learn how to cook, I could learn from a book, I could learn from maybe watching a show, but to really kind of dive into the nuances, I would need to have someone to kind of show me in the kitchen what I would do next. At least for me. Right. I don't have enough experience with it. And some people going to the gym, sure they can read books, you can do stuff. But I think having someone there, like a coach advise them on different things is, is is going to be an easy way for them to get more success from it.

Speaker 2:          00:13:26       Yeah. I think the, just to reiterate that, I think the social accountability piece is huge. So having some type of, of social cohesion just gigantic. And for people who are listening who might be in the sticks, don't think you have access to that. You can certainly find communities online like coach.me and other, uh, other, other sites or services along those lines. But the, the point you made also that I think is really important to underscore is in the beginning, focusing on the good program that you will follow versus the perfect program that you'll fit that you'll quit. Because a lot of people come in, like you said, they're like, okay, I haven't done anything since college. Now I'm going to do a two hour workout five times a week as my new year's resolution. And they just flame out or they get injured or fill in the blank. And like you said, they're gone a few weeks later as opposed to saying, look, since you're starting from zero, let's just do whatever it might be, half hour workout twice a week so that you develop the habit and then you can always make it harder,

Speaker 3:          00:14:26       more complex later. But if you make it too hard, too complex in the beginning, you're going to be gone. Yeah. Like we have a program that we've incorporated calls the rise program and what it incorporates, the nutritionist, a mindset coach and I, and a fitness coach. And for a lot of people, it's all a mindset, right? It's all for decades. They haven't exercise, they've use food as an outlet or whatever it may be. Right? And that's okay, but they need to get over that in their head to truly make an impact and change for, for a long time. Right. Instead is making it like the short term thing that you really get down to the root of the problem and make it as more of a part of their daily routine instead of just something they do. Right. And that starts, but to start it slowly then work it up is much easier than just to kind of go crazy. And then it just, I haven't seen it work as well.

Speaker 2:          00:15:14       And then I have a nuclear meltdown and have to restart again for your next new year's resolution. That's right. Uh, I'm going to take a couple of questions here that have been, uh, volleyed over via the Internet because there's some really good ones and they range from training to family, to business. Uh, so we're going to get to that in a second, but I wanted to ask you, uh, you mentioned NC fit. How many locations do you currently have? 24, 24 locations. So you've been very successful as an athlete and many people who put in the effort and focus that you did. And athletics are so singularly focused that they have trouble. And I've observed this and friends transferring them to a career outside of competitor, rent sponsored athlete. Uh, if you were sitting down with an accomplished athlete or not, who wanted to say, uh, get into business and let's just for the sake of simplicity, say it's a similar business there somewhere in the Midwest and they want to get into fitness and gyms and so on. What advice would you give them or resources would you point them to, uh, to increase the likelihood of success?

Speaker 3:          00:16:27       Yeah, I mean, one of the things I'd ask them, and I could ask this often is, you know, hey, I want to open up a gym. What do you think? I'm like, okay, well let's start with these three simple questions, right? Number one, are you qualified to do so? Right? What makes you qualified to open up this business? Do you have an expertise in it? Do you how? How are you going to basically give yourself this competitive advantage that you know that when you go to open up, you're going to win, right? Right. What is your competitive, what's the credibility, right? Yeah. Just because you like to work out, does it mean you should necessarily go open up a gym? I love to eat, I love food, but I sure as hell are not going to open up a restaurant because I'm not qualified to do so.

Speaker 3:          00:17:04       I don't have the training, the expertise. Right, and it's okay if you don't in certain areas, just go find an expert in those other areas right there and ask of you is, you know the, are you doing it with a strong intention is strong. Why? Right? Like what is your why? Why do you want to open this business? Is it to make money? Because if it's just to make money, just like competing at the crossfit games, you didn't have a strong internal why? Because when your back's up against the wall, it's very challenging. You need to revert back to that. Why? To push through and in business it's not always, you know, rainbows and Unicorns, right? There's challenging times and senior to be able to revert back to your internal why of why you started to be able to do well. So I would say, hey, how are you going to win?

Speaker 3:          00:17:45       Right? Tell me how you're going to win. Why? Why are you better than the other guy down the street to do you have a strong reason why you want to open it? And then three, is it a good time in your life to do it right? Is it a good time for you to open it? Do you just have a baby? Um, do you have tons of mortgages in different types of stuff, right? Or is it a good time in your life to go ahead and, you know, go open up this business is really what I like to ask people. What are the most common mistakes that you see or that you think you avoided? Like if you look back at your business, another way to phrase it so you can tackle it however you want is what were some of the most important decisions that you made?

Speaker 3:          00:18:20       Looking back, I think looking back, it was understanding that back in the day you weren't going to make money off your competitive fitness career. And so I had to open up a business and I had to open it and I think one of the best things I ever did was I recognize it, try and rob and steal as much as I can, knowledge from people around me. So when I was in high school, I worked at the front desk at a conventional gym. Then when I graduated high school, I went to college, I started working as a sales associate there and I started making good money. So as I'm going to a junior college, you went to vast valley. Actually. I was there and I, I just got woken up like no one cares about me. I was like the jock and I was like the, you know, kind of like the class clown in high school, they'll have a sudden you get to college.

Speaker 3:          00:19:01       It's like they don't care about you. Right? So I really turned a corner. I say, hey look, you know, I need to take responsibility for what I need to get done. I want to be successful. And so I started going to school full time, working full time mode. I also did was I learned how to talk to people. I learned how to sell, which was really important because in my line of work in the fitness industry, your coach and you're, you're talking to people, you're coaching him. But if you're a business owner, you also need to learn how to sell. But one of the things I would also do is on the, you know, dot. Twice a week I would go and ride the elliptical with the owner of the business and I would just pick his brain, understand what's going on. I think one of those things early on was recognizing how wanting to learn everything I could from his mistakes.

Speaker 3:          00:19:41       I didn't make as many. And one of the things that we've done a lot is delegate out things, right. Not, you know, have enough of a humbleness to be like, hey look, I can't do everything best the best I need to hire outside people. And I think I learned that early on from him learning from him some of his mistakes. How did you convince him to do the elliptical with you? What was the pitch, right? You were in sales. So how did you get the owner to hang out with the former class clown on the elliptical? So funny enough he really took me on as like a mentor. He really like, he really mentored me really well and he would ride the elliptical as part of his fitness routine routine. And I would just go over there and it just go meet with him. And I don't think he disliked it because we would just, you know, bullshit. Have good conversation. I think it kind of made the time go by a little bit quicker. Got It. So you just roll up when he was working at [inaudible] rolling. And, uh, when your back is against the wall, you mentioned the why. So when you were competing and say, this is actually a question that came up at least once from, uh, people who are listening to the podcast. One wanted me to ask you what, why did you go back to when you were competing in the games?

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       I mean at the time, right? Or, or

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       uh, sorry to keep rephrasing my questions, but I've had too much caffeine and that is uh, when you were say behind or you saw someone gaining on you, uh, the why or like what is the self talk to make sure that you don't fall out of

Speaker 3:          00:21:07       that you don't drop the ball or otherwise just get, get psyched out. Well, I think positive self talk is a really hard thing to learn, but it's an important trait to develop. And I've learned that, um, over the years with a mindset coach I work with where, you know, you try and find ways to reframe things in your head if something's going wrong, instead of saying, oh, my legs hurt, you say, hey folks on mid foot strike if you're running or whatever. Right? You try and rephrase it in a positive and reverting back to your why. I think it's really important that going into these games, what I would do is I would tell myself that I've made a commitment to myself, my family, to go out there and do this. And I wanted to do it because I wanted to get comfortable with the uncomfortable.

Speaker 3:          00:21:43       I wanted to see where I stack up against my competitors and I wanted to do it for me. Right? And at the time I didn't have as many other obligations. Now as life changes, right? Things change. But at the time, my why was, hey, I made a commitment. I'm gonna do this. And I remember one year we did this camp Pendleton race and I was, it's a 10 mile, just crazy Hilron and I was like, halfway done. I just, you know, I'm like going through like this desert and I look around, there's no one around. I'm just like, oh gosh, and I see a translates to the true story just walking across. I'm just looking at him like, what the hell or a biggest spider? Maybe. It was interesting. It was big ass. I was like, well, what am I doing out here? Right? And I had an instantly revert back of my head.

Speaker 3:          00:22:21       You know what? I made a commitment. That commitment was I was going to finish out these games, so I bet her slap myself in the face, stop being a wimp and finish it. Because if I allowed myself to give in and then what other things would I allow myself to give into? Right? I made a commitment to myself and I wanted to live up to that. Now, over the years, because of other things happened in my life, I haven't been able to make that strong of commitment. So therefore I choose not even to go out there and, and, and, and attempt

Speaker 2:          00:22:46       and the, I'm very fascinated by these little moments or days or weeks. It can really affect the complete trajectory of people's lives. And you mentioned a couple of minutes ago, you get to college age, you realize all right and no longer the class clown in high school and you did a course correct, right? You started going to school full time. So what triggered that? Was it a particular conversation? Was it a particular afternoon? What was it? So, you know, so

Speaker 3:          00:23:15       going out of high school, I thought it was gonna play football at, ended up not working out. So I ended up going to West Valley and you know, first day it wasn't that big of a deal. Right. I get it. I get there the first day I'm like, Oh, I'm not West Valley and no big deal. I'll transfer another school in a couple of years. But all my friends had gone to a four year Santa Claire University, which is where I ended up graduating from. Right. But I just remember first day of school, we're going round and we're all saying our names, right? And it's like, Hey, I'm John, this is my first, second year. Hey, I'm Mary, this is my, you know, whatever second semester it is. And then all of a sudden you have this woman next to me and I kid you not write my first class on my first day at West Valley and lady goes, hi, my name is uh, Suzanne.

Speaker 3:          00:23:55       I can't remember the name exactly. She has that for a fact. This is my seventh year at West Valley. And I just remember looking at her and looking at this teacher and just be like, dude, I gotta get my ass in check and you'd get my shit together. Right. That's what I told myself. Right. And so that moment I left there, I went to the counselor's opposite, said, hey, look, I need to figure out the best way to get the heck out of this school. And so I ended up on taking full class loads, do whenever I had to do. I ended up applying to Santa Clara two times after that and not being accepted because I tried after one year, I didn't get accepted. I tried for like a year and a half getting to accepted. Then after two years I was accepted, which got me on track to graduate in four. So I graduated with all my peers, which was great. I graduated my wife actually, which was really cool. Um, but that was the moment that really like kinda sparked it. Like, dude, like playtime's over high school's done. It's, you're in the wheel rolled. No one really cares about you. You better get your ass in check.

Speaker 2:          00:24:49       And when you applied, make me think of Rudy a little bit. So you get, he applied, didn't get in, applied, didn't get in and applied and got in. What did you change in between the not getting accepted and getting accepted?

Speaker 3:          00:25:01       Well Matt had more courses underneath my belt. Swag. They didn't have to use my high school GPA anymore. Right. You're able to only you they call it, you could use your trend,

Speaker 2:          00:25:08       your credits that would transfer. That's right. Got It. All right, so, so many questions, but I'm going to pull some in from the audiences from fern Hernandez. What are your thoughts on the frequency of doing crossfit as another way? What benefits do you lose or gain from doing say twice a week versus four to five times a week?

Speaker 3:          00:25:27       I mean, I think by design, when you look at it like a program and if it's constantly varied by design, he should be able to do it, you know, five days a week and you should be okay. If the programming is an appropriate in the volume is good and you're listening to your body, you should be able to perform that program, you know, five days a week because of the variance, right? You should be able to go long one day heavy one day, you know, below parallel one day. And that just depends on how much effort people put into the program itself. So two days is better than no days, but two days also challenging cause you go in, you get really sore and then you're, you recover it and you get really sore again and your body never gets into this rhythm. So assuming you go to a gym as good programming, I think you can go five days a week.

Speaker 2:          00:26:08       And you and I were also though, just to touch on good programming in the gym when we were messing around, messing around, you were demonstrating backs while we're talking about a five by five and so on these five, five sets of five reps and so on. If the variance doesn't exist and someone's trying to do five by five, seven times a week with the squad.

Speaker 3:          00:26:29       Yeah, I mean you got, you got to have a program that has variants, right? So we, we do it at our gym and he's going to have one person creates this template, the skeleton, and then he creates the workouts and then we have a peer reviewed by six other of our coaches and then it gets back to him. So we try to have a lot of and balances our program because regardless of who's programming the program, there's always going to be some type of bias towards what you like. Sure. Yeah, always. And so you need to have other people have checks and balances on that. How might someone create a skeleton of a program? And I'm not saying just Joe blow in the street. I'm saying one of your coaches, right? W what does that process look like? What are they thinking about or considering as they do it?

Speaker 3:          00:27:04       Well, and I think they're looking at time domains, right? So you're looking at, you know, are we talking five minutes? We talk in 12 and as we talk in 20 minutes, we're talking in 30 or 40 minute long workouts, total duration, total duration of the actual, you know, rap email, whatever they're doing, right? Things are look just for non crossfit is as many rounds or reps as possible. And then you know, you start talking about in the skill work, right? What is a theme for the month that we tie in to develop someone's hand, Stan and we tried to, there's a lot of things in play. It's, it's, it's a, it's a challenging topic to discuss briefly, but in theory it's hey, let's have a, let's have some big macro goal, right? Maybe it's to get everybody ready for a five kids coming up. Maybe it's to get this skill of maybe we start noticing that our gym members need benefit in x.

Speaker 3:          00:27:47       Let's create that macro goal. And then during our warm ups, make sure we touch base on it several times a week. Then let's have these other goals where it's like we go heavy to three times a week, right? Then we go longer. Metcons are metabolic conditioning workouts couple times a week, and we add any short burst, high intensity, one's a couple times a week. So in, in skeleton you want to think about, you want to push you on to pull you on a squat once a week, right? Um, you want to incorporate the Olympic lifts as you know, when you can. And that's kind of the big picture stuff. But you also, when you program, you want to think about kind of this idea of, you know, if I'm programming workout, I want to think about what's going to keep people moving. So you wouldn't want to do, for example, uh, squats, lunges, jumping here, squads, uh, jumping lunges and what it was like a bunch of whatever he's, what'll end up happening is people will just burn out their legs and let us sit there and stand there until they can recover.

Speaker 3:          00:28:36       But now if you did, you know, jumping lunges followed by pushups, they're not the same muscle Muslims, right? They're different functions. And so you can keep your body moving. And as you mentioned, uh, when we were chatting before recording just the audio, the Olympic lifts generally would come after say a familiarity, at least familiarity, maybe a mastery of the mechanics of say, power lifting movements and some gymnastic components. Well, I think we incorporate the Olympic lifts early on. We do. How do you do that safely? I think it ultimately just comes down to the coaches that are doing it right. How do you, you start off, you make sure that people can do it right with just the PVC pipe or a light bar and then you can work your way up. But I think the difference is that whereas with the power lifts, it doesn't take as long to develop the, all the techniques incorporated with it.

Speaker 3:          00:29:20       With the Olympic lifts it does. And so you need to be okay with doing the Olympic lifts early on, right? Almost from the beginning. It's okay, but you need to do them at a moderate controlled level verse the back's way. You can kind of push a little bit more. I mean, you could push them all be, don't want to push the Olympic lifts so much. So the start developing bad habits and the same thing applies to the backwash is a little bit less. So the Olympic lifts a little bit easier to Incor uh, you know, they're, they're highly technical. Sure. Let's just say you have average person off the street or powerlifter comes in. I want to learn Olympic weightlifting if they have really bad thoracic mobility and shoulder extension. Right? So they're, they're here, right? They can barely get there. Their biceps past there. They're yours.

Speaker 3:          00:30:02       Do you have any, any favorite approaches to helping address that or, or any suggestions? You know, our friend Kelly has some good tools. Mobilitywod Riley start. Yeah. Kelly's threat. I mean, I think that there's multiple different things you could do but ultimately needed commit to it, right? I mean, if you have poor, uh, you know, shoulder range of motion, it's going to take you out to develop that. And you know, that doesn't mean you have to avoid all lifts all together, still doing them. Just recognize you need to put in the time, you know a couple, you know, 10 20 minutes a day to develop the range of motion and mobility. And the best way to do that is by incorporating the movements slow and control with light to little note no weight, right? If you want to really develop a good squat, try and work on the squat up against the wall with no weight and work through the full range of motion of it up against the wall.

Speaker 3:          00:30:47       You mean facing the wall? Yeah. Question from Luke Campbell, ask about his training with former endurance athlete. Now coach Chris Henshaw's. It was interesting to hear how a giant like Jason could build his aerobic capacity without sacrificing size or strength. How does he do it specifically? That's a great question. Um, you know, Hinshaw is great. You know, years ago I started looking at summary results from across the games and it would be like, you know, top 10 top 10 top 10 top 10 50th you know, top 10 top 10. I'd be like, Oh boy, I got a glaring weakness there. And so I found Chris and he really helped me out and he made running fun for me. He made running. Who is who? Who is Chris? Just for [inaudible]. He's a local guy raise here out of Palo Alto area yet. And he's a former, you know, iron man triathlete.

Speaker 3:          00:31:28       Really successful but he, but he has a unique way of making running quantifiable and fun. And what I mean by that is, you know, I'll go to the track and before I'd just be like, oh run 400 meters. I would just like run it aimlessly. But it felt good for him to give me, you know, a hundred meter pace goals, 200 meter pays goals, et cetera. And then those goals then turn into something I could really try and shoot for. And I think going back to the whole thing about someone going to the gym is for those people who are interested in doing running or doing types, does having a program that kind of gives you quantifiable numbers is shoot for, I believe it's a great way, not only to get better results but also to keep it more fun. You don't need this go out for a five k on your own.

Speaker 3:          00:32:05       That's cool. I get it. But you should start quantifying what you're targeting, the numbers are and your target paces. And that's what I did with him and that's why I was able to maintain those numbers. When you were at your peak of of training, what did your nutrition look like and were there any goto supplements on top of that? It's a tricky sort of murky waters that we get into sometimes and it's fine if, if any of them were sponsors, but if you could just indicate which, which were, if that's the case, but a diet. So would your nutrition look like in at the height of training and then any particular supplements that were kind of your go to? So I never have and I until this day eat as much as what most people probably think I eat. Um, but with the amount of his training, sometimes, you know, just Broccoli and cauliflower weren't cutting it for the carbohydrates I need to do retain.

Speaker 3:          00:32:53       So sweet potatoes had to be thrown in and things like that. I try to eat real food, right? I still do, I try and eat real food and I try and avoid excess amounts of sugar and different types of things. But that doesn't mean that if my daughter wants to go out and you know, if it's her birthday, I'm not going to eat her birthday. Kicking it and never has meant that. Right. I'm okay with that. I trained because at times I want to be able to go and in and enjoy a, you know, a Margarita with my wife. Right. That's okay. And it always has been that same way, whether I've been training at the highest level or, or where I'm at today. And you know, as far as recovery and I partnered with a company called progenics. I think they make a good recovery tool for me.

Speaker 3:          00:33:29       That's something I use outside of that. Maybe some fish oil and, and, and that's pretty much the extent of it, right? It's just real food. I think people don't realize the value you can get from just consuming real regular food. And did you track macros and all that type of stuff? Just know a lot of the guys at the top don't really track all the macros. Some of them do, but not, not a lot of the guys, you know, a lot of them just work hard, train hard and just eat appropriately. All right. This is, this is a question that I would love to hear your thoughts on. This is from Lee Jackson. What do you picture your workout to be when you hit 60 years of age? That is, I mean I think my workout is gonna be roughly the way it is right now.

Speaker 3:          00:34:11       Just just basically scaled down. Meaning you know, the, the demands that I have at, you know, my age with, you know, my street. Like we all need a squall, we only oppressed. We only lift. So what are, I'm 60 30 50 I still want to be doing those same movements. I just might do it a little bit of a less intensity. Right. And even now being 31 the intensity that can bring the workouts a little bit different than when I was 25 my body's been beat up a lot by doing that and so I just need to recognize it, listen to my body and recover as well as I can. But the amount of volume I'm putting in isn't as much as it used to be. And I assume the time I'm 60 the amount of volume I'm putting, it wouldn't be as much, but the movements would be similar.

Speaker 3:          00:34:48       Is there any particular type of movement, a conditioning strength, fill in the blank that you'd really like to work on and develop more now? In other words, you talked about like top 10 top 10 top 10 50th place, top 10 the top 10 are there any particular weaknesses that you're trying to work on now? It doesn't have to be limited to the gym either. Like is there anything that you're there they're working on currently? I mean, obviously, you know, I like rolling Jujitsu. There's a ton of things get better at there. But for me it's really on the business side, on the family side, right? I'm trying to be the best dad I can be the best husband I can be and I'm trying to support our business [inaudible] and run it the best way possible and treat people that way. And that's what I'm really focused on.

Speaker 3:          00:35:28       You know, stealing a line from Mark Cuban is just the sport of business and I'm trying to win at that right now for myself in particular. So that's what I'm focused on my fitness side, I'm still hitting it all the time. Right? I still work out really hard, but don't have any specific goals other than just to maintain my fitness. So this is, this is actually a segue there. We're talking about family a little bit and uh, these were very highly uploaded. So this, this is a question from Sherry Gall. I've so admired him as an athlete and businessmen, his work ethic and determination to continue to improve, as well as his humility of pushed him to great levels of success. I've also watched his journey through Ava's illness and seem him give back in the midst of it, blood drives, etc. I know behind all of this is a good marriage.

Speaker 3:          00:36:10       I'd like him to talk about marriage and how ava is doing. I would also be fun to hear his perspective on the evolution of the sport, but let's, let's keep that separate. Could you talk a little bit just about the components of a good marriage and also just tell us a little bit about your, about your family and, and Ava. A lot of people listening are going to be familiar. Sure. Yeah. So my wife and I, Ashley, we started dating freshman year of high school, so 1415 years old. And we've been together almost ever since. What happened is we started dating for a week, two weeks. Actually, I thought we were in love, right? I went home. I told her mom, I'm like, mom, I found a woman I'm gonna marry. Right. And I was all fired up. And then of course, two weeks later she dumps me cause she said I was too nice.

Speaker 3:          00:36:54       Well, you know, a year later, right. She knew, she knew, you know, we are meant to be together. So we ended up getting back together again a year later. We haven't been separated since. Right. So that was, you know, 15, 16 years old. And, um, so, you know, we went to college, Graduate College together, did our thing. We got married in 2009, uh, had our first child in 2011, Ava. And then we had our second child. She has a 14. Kayden. Uh, ava was diagnosed with Leukemia January 21st, uh, 2016. So about a little over a year ago. And uh, you know, I think when you talk about what makes a marriage successful, I think it, it's an obviously a number of things. You have to respect each other. You have to become best friends. You need to be able to be okay with supporting each other on their journeys, but you also need to, um, align well on difficult times.

Speaker 3:          00:37:47       And I didn't know that until ava got sick. You know, when you're in high school, you don't know how your wife is going to react or girlfriend is going to react to a negative situation life. And I think what's really intriguing about what happened to us is my wife and I and my family in general has gotten a lot closer through Ava's diagnosis primarily because she was so strong and she still is. And that's the, that's really exciting for me because I take on like, Hey, you know, we're going to get after this, we're going to be successful. And she was the one who really started that from the beginning. You know, when we, we first find out ava had a leukemia, we, uh, we were called the Er at Stanford Er. Before that she was having a lot of leg pain in different types of things.

Speaker 3:          00:38:23       It was, when did that start? How old was she? Uh, so she, she right now she's five, she'll be six in a month. You know, it's, look, looking back on it now, it probably, we probably have identified the shit leukemia earlier, but everything like had a reason like sure shedding your infection. Then she had another one, then she had another one and then you know, the doctors are just the worst ear infection I've ever seen. We were like, wow, well her immune system seems kind of suppressed. Like we didn't really think about it. We're just like, oh, we'll just keep getting her medicine. She has an ear infection. Then it's like, oh my legs really hurt. I can't walk more than a hundred feet without stopping. Oh man, it must be growing beans. Let's get you a trampoline was get you in a PT, all these different things. Then she started having bruising and that's where we knew something was up and so we're waiting for blood work.

Speaker 3:          00:39:06       We called it in the Er and when they told us that night that she had leukemia, he was at like 2:00 AM in the morning and I should remember, you know, as he was a, it was a very challenging time for us. And now I've had a lot of time to reflect on it, so I'm a little less, you know, uh, you know, I used to talk about it as a lot harder now that I've reflected on a lot, it's a little bit easier to talk about, but I just remember when I told my wife, you know, she just went out, you know, we're, you know, I was crying and she just looks at me. She's like, hey look, you tell our family, uh, you know, tell her family, let them know she has leukemia, but just tell them that they want to cry. They can crowd outside.

Speaker 3:          00:39:41       But as soon as he walked in the doors, they'd better be happy and they better have a smile on their face or I'll stay, can't be let it. Right. And it was kind of that mentality that was just like, you know, Kinda like, you know, she's just like, yeah, hell yeah, we're going to crush this shit. And then it made me realize like, oh yeah, we're going to crush it. Like it was this very much so like football, like, you know, you're in the huddle and like you're in the fight of your life and it's like, no, no, we're going to crush this thing. Right. And we've had that mentality ever since. And you know, her strength has been, has been awesome to see from a marriage perspective. Right. So that's, that's a kind of a cool, cool thing to find out about your spouse for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       What types of practices or routines, anything really, uh, do you have that helps the family to be as cohesive as possible? Well, I think we have a lot of really good family support. So we've been super blessed. You know, the night that my daughter was diagnosed, my mom and dad took my son and took him for a month. We were in the hospital for five weeks. Right. Um, Lucille Packard, they've done some really great things for us. Um, but you know, like when, when you see that family around and then all of a sudden my father in law would be there every day my phone, I would just be sitting in the waiting room, right? We didn't, we wouldn't call them when doing it. You'd just be sitting there. And that family dynamic has been something that's been really special to see. And, uh, it's something that will never, I'll never forget.

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       And even now, here we are over a year later and we still have a lot of challenging times and it's a family that helps us get through all of it, right? Because my, for example, on Saturday, we were in Vegas, my mom and dad helped watch our children set, my wife and I could go have a night out to ourselves. And those are really important things in life to my wife and I since the beginning, I've always said, hey, look, it's, we love our children, but it's me and you first for our relationships. If our relationship isn't good, then we're not gonna be able to have a solid home for our children. And so we've really tried to set aside time to do date nights and do this and do that, which has really been helpful, especially during this time because sometimes we have to have adult conversations.

Speaker 3:          00:41:33       Like right after this I'm going to go see a counselor because you know, we need to get some support to help us with this situation in my wife Ad have adult conversation about that to go see a counselor. Yeah. If you were giving advice to someone who, for instance just found out their child is diagnosed with x, some type of very intimidating disease and they wanted any thoughts or advice from you whatsoever, like for instance, what your wife said, which was you can cry but has to be outside once you come in yet you have to have a smile on your face as it is there. Is there anything else that you wish that you'd share with them? I think it's really important to educate yourself, educate yourself on the disease. So my daughter has all, it's a specific type of leukemia. Uh, she's, uh, it's, it's a very treatable, which is awesome, right?

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       There's a lot of them that aren't as treatable. And my heart goes out to his families. I mean, you come sit in the oncology department for a day with me and you'll just be humbled. So what I would say to them is educate yourself. We've had phenomenal health care, phenomenal. But there's been one or two times where we've had to catch the doctors because sometimes, you know, they have other things going on. But for me, there's no, there's nothing else going on. It's just this. But I need to be able to educate myself on it with all the different medications. What's going on here? What is this one of the side effects? What should we be looking for? Because those things are critical, especially for us. I mean, we ended up in the ER probably once every two weeks because of, um, uh, uh, temperatures. But we have to be actively engaged to take the temperature.

Speaker 3:          00:42:58       We had to be actively engaged on what the side effects are of certain medicines. I think that's the most critical pieces. Educate yourself on what's going on cause no one's going to care more than you're going to care. This is going to seem maybe like a gear shift, but I think it could be related. When we were talking about transfer, when we're in the gym earlier looking at say modeling your pushup position so that it transfers to other movements. Your elbows are flaring out, looking at deadlifting say first and foremost and a conventional stance that it transfers more to and everything else. You mentioned Amref earlier the as many reps, as many rounds as possible and you mentioned an rep philosophy before I hit record and I was like, okay, I want to come back to that. So what does that, what does that mean?

Speaker 3:          00:43:37       Does it apply to areas outside of the gym? So it's actually something I've been working on for a while and I've given talks about is called the Amorette mentality. And to me it's the way that, you know, I kind of live my life and I'm trying to live my life. And with the emirate mentality really means is think about if someone said you, Hey, I want you to do as many pushups as you can in, in a minute while you're doing and you're just focused on that right now. Focus on anything else. She's folks on the pushups. And then when you're done with that, you move on right now on podcasts with you. This one focused on, on, um, am rapping with you right now. We're trying to do the best we can together, but what I'm not doing is on my phone. Right? And talking to you and trying to work out at the same time.

Speaker 3:          00:44:14       Right? I'm not doing that because, you know, I think nowadays I would make the argument, I don't know if we're less productive or more productive than we were 20 years ago because 20 years ago when you're at work, you're working, when you're at home, you're at home. Now it's this huge carryover. So what I found myself doing for many years, and I had to really knit myself in the button, I still am trying to get a lot better is I wouldn't be focused on my family, are focused on what I was doing, I'd be focusing on are things, there's times where I would go to dinner and I would be having dinner with my wife and I wouldn't remember anything we talked about cause I would be thinking about the crossfit competition I had coming up. Right. And that was an example of [inaudible] am happy not being present and focused on what I was doing.

Speaker 3:          00:44:53       So the theory is you identify your focus, right? Whatever it may be, you know, for me it's family fitness business, then you work hard at it, right? Whatever it may be. Then you switch gears and you do this throughout your day and then every now and then you need to reevaluate. So I'll give you an example. For a while I was going competing at the highest level in crossfit, owning the business. And I had the family that I had more children in. The business grew and the competition got harder. So I decided to switch gears and go team because I didn't have as much time to allocate to these other things. So I had to switch gears, evaluate what was really important to me, and then do that. But then when my daughter got sick, it was another time for me to reevaluate what am I trying to really focus on and how many things can I actually am rap.

Speaker 3:          00:45:35       So now I chose not to compete because I want to do the best I can in business. Then I want to switch gears and go best I can with family and then I still want to work out, but I can't spend as much time on it. And that's kind of the Amorite mentalities. Identify her focus, work hard at it and switch gears and then every now and then reevaluate and get rid of some of the stuff on your plate. And when you're, when you're reevaluating, do you sit down with a pad and a pen and write it out? Do you see, do you have a set time when you might do that in the morning or at night? If you could just describe perhaps some of the details of what that looks like. I mean, reevaluating happens with big moments in your life such as your daughter getting sick or you're getting married or you have children, you have reevaluate with the things you're going on.

Speaker 3:          00:46:20       You used to love maybe playing video games for three hours a day. Once you have a kidney reevaluate, you can't do it anymore, right? You, you just can't, it, you need to reevaluate those times. And so reevaluation happens kind of internally for me. Uh, whether, um, you know, uh, on the bike, just kind of like, you know, thinking in my thoughts or whatever it may be. But I, I, I identify every so often when I reevaluate, but on a consistent daily basis, I try and check in with myself. I trust myself, hey, did I do the best job today as I could to be a father, to be a husband, to be a business owner and did I maintain my fitness? Did I do that today? And if the answer is yes, fuck hell yeah, but if the answer's no, then there's always tomorrow. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:47:03       And, and I think if you do those micro goals on a daily basis, it doesn't lead to these oh shit moments where you wake up and you've been doing the same thing for five years and you're unhappy. Right? You need to start taking that into your own hands on daily basis and really evaluating what are some of your goals right now from a business standpoint? I mean, I just think that's service based. Fitness is a way to go. I really do. I feel very passionate about it. I think that you would say, what does that mean? You just service like you walk into a gym. I want to be, so once the want to help me, I want their guidance and direction. You know, think about hotels. You go into a hotel, gym, the four seasons everywhere else. It's like, hello sir, how can I help you?

Speaker 3:          00:47:37       This that you're going to the gym, there's no one there. You just get on the elliptical and you have an aimless workout. No direction, no guidance. So from a business perspective, I want to bring service to the hotels. I want to bring service to corporate wellness where instead of people is going to the gym and you know, wearing their headphones. Now all of a sudden they're creating connections and that helps with productivity in the workplace. It creates with foster and his sense of, of more culture in that workplace and then also wanting to that on the commercial side, open to the public. I want to be experts in the best at service based fitness, right. Bringing the highest level of of of quality coaching combined with quality programming in a fun atmosphere. That's what we're really focused on right now.

Speaker 2:          00:48:19       This then, if we could rewind the clock, this is from Pilar Eggman think it is. If you, I mean it's Jason could go back to 2008 after winning the crossfit games, what advice would you give yourself in regards for training for the Games and or business? Yeah. What advice would you give

Speaker 3:          00:48:36       your self at that time?

Speaker 2:          00:48:37       It doesn't have to be actually related to games. Business, I'd say, Eh, what advice period?

Speaker 3:          00:48:41       The advice I would say is earlier on identify this whole concept of Mri mentality and evaluate more regularly because there's times in my life that I, that I regret not spending quality time with. You know, I mean I don't necessarily regret cause he's got us where we're at today, but there's been times where I haven't been the most present father. I've been doing a lot different things and I wish I had learned that earlier on. At least now when I travel or like the small, I left the house at four and I'm not going to be home until later. At least now every time I do that I recognize that it's a sacrifice I'm making but that I have to except it and then you know, try and make it right in the future. Right. But at least being aware that there's sacrifice. I think before it was just kinda like I was trying to just do so much. Now I need to identify and say no to more things so I could really start pinpointing my focus.

Speaker 2:          00:49:31       The question I had earlier about how you go about doing that is still one I'd like to dig into a little bit cause I think it's so important. For instance, I was chatting a few months ago with this older gent. He's in his sixties he has a couple of a bunch of kids and every quarter he gets a report card from his wife and the report card is a zero to 10 in four categories. He's got provider, husband, father, lover. Those are the four. Wow. And he for, he owns his own company, at least one company and travels a lot. So let's say he's traveling, but it's for business purposes and he's opening up new manufacturing plants or whatever it might be in China. Who knows? So he's gone. So he'll get, he might get a 10 out of 10 and provider, but he's going to probably be very low on the lover score and so on and so forth. You know, may five out of six on the others who knows and it's allowable as long as he has a good average.

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       So it's like one can drop as long as the others are higher and so on it, how do you keep track of reprioritizing or, or think about that? Is it, is it all in the head or do you put it down anywhere or is it something that you try to do at the end of each work day? I know we talked about it a little bit. Yeah, I think it's just in my head. I think it's just constant evaluation whether, um, um, you know, I like to, let's just say, you know, be alone with my thoughts and like in the garage working out and I just think about, you know, hey, what am I doing right now? What am I doing well, what can we do better at? How can I be better at this, this, this, this, this, and it's just that constant pursuit of being better at whatever I'm doing.

Speaker 3:          00:51:08       And I think it's an internal conversation with myself. And I think that if I ever get complacent or comfortable, that's where I start getting nervous. And I think I want to get uncomfortable in business. I want to get uncomfortable and get out there and start sharing my message of what I'm trying to do and what we're trying to accomplish and provide for more people to do what they love for a living. And these are the conversations I have in my head, right, is hey, eva is getting better now. I can start focusing a little bit more on this, but don't forget about this, you know, and things like that. Do you have any favorite books or books that you've gifted to other people? Either or both. The one that stands out to me the most. I read a lot. I think there's some really poor books at the airport.

Speaker 3:          00:51:47       I really do. Sure. Anyways, for me, I like more of a Pratt publication book. I like a book like Mark Cuban's sportive business. I like it because it gets me fired up. I like it cause it's a real story from a real guy just saying like it is and it's easy reading. It's not so analytical and things like that. And uh, so that's the look I like. Got It. Let's talk about morning rituals if you have any. So this is from dot. S G no. Or Sj, excuse me. What are some morning rituals or reflections that he does to keep passion alive while juggling children and life's twists and turns? So I would say let's focus on the, on the routines or rituals. Like do you have, do you have any, if we look at the first 90 minutes of your day, and I'm sure it varies, but generally speaking, are there certain routines, habits, elements that you have?

Speaker 3:          00:52:34       I'd say in general it's probably some type of exercise in general. There's exceptions to that, right? But in general it's exercise, whether it be Jujitsu or you know, hitting it in my garage, whatever it is. I like to get the body moving and I like to get flowing early in the morning. Do you do that before breakfast? After breakfast. Before, before breakfast. So that's before the kids get up. That's before my wife is up as before everything that, what time is that typically would you say? I mean it varies. You know, used to be a lot earlier. Now it's like, I mean, well this morning I left early yesterday I left early, but on average it's probably six, six. Yeah, because some days it's a lot earlier. Sundays is seven. And you're exercising on an empty stomach. Yeah. Did you drink coffee? I do. I love coffee. Do you drink coffee before your workout?

Speaker 3:          00:53:17       Would you say that for later? How many cups of coffee do you have a day? Um, I probably have one and a half. Okay. To maybe modern. Maybe. I love coffee. Um, what I'll do is normally exercise, come in, see the kids. I'll make my coffee, like doing pour overs. I want to get a really cool espresso machine. That's what I'm working on next. Um, and you know, hanging out with the kids, they get breakfast, boom, they go off to school and I go off to work and uh, we do our thing and then I'll be there and I'll, you, I'll go to meetings or go to different gyms. I'll try and just see what's going on. Then sometimes I'll do, uh, you know, workout. I'll take one of our classes right throughout the bay area. And then, um, I'm always home for dinner at five 30 with the family.

Speaker 3:          00:53:57       And then I get back on emails and different stuff around seven, eight, uh, around seven 30 till about 10 when the key, because the kids go to sleep. So basically his regiment, my day is like, it's exercise, get the body moving, it's time with the family briefly in the morning, they go to school, I go to work. Then when I get home at five 30, we have dinner, we hang out. Then for the rest of the night I'm doing work and I go to bed. I check my bed by 10 30, 10, 10, 30, and then do it all over again. Do you have any particular, and maybe this doesn't happen to you, but when you have so many different hats, right? I mean you have your business owner, father, husband, uh, certainly competitor make, perhaps not going into the games necessarily, but still you have extreme athletic drive.

Speaker 3:          00:54:41       Do you have insomnia or do you find it easy to sleep? Do you ever have insomnia or you, so I find it pretty easy to sleep, you know, you'd think with, with the different stresses I have, uh, I, no, I think it's because I exhaust myself throughout the day. Right. I generally run it a high, like some people say it's like the, the um, full throttle or like, you know, like I generally run on a high level throughout the duration of the day. Kind of like a kid, you know, it's like [inaudible] and then all of a sudden they get to you like, like a bedtime. It's like you just don't happen to me. You definitely have a sort of high standard Rpm, which is good. Do you have any wind down routines or anything you'd like to do before bed? I mean, generally it's, it's answering a lot of emails because during the day I'm doing a lot of other stuff is dancing, a lot of emails, getting back to people.

Speaker 3:          00:55:26       And then sometimes my wife and I, we'll watch a show together. But that's pretty much it. That's it. And then Facebook and then face plant. And on the weekends I'm like, you know, we like to travel, we like to go do things like last weekend or this week can come up, we're going to Disneyland with my daughter. And uh, that weekend after we're going to Mexico to see one of our locations balls have a good time. So we try and travel as a family and have those times. Who Do you go to for business advice? And I got a few. I mean, you know, we have a few mentors have really helped out some of our corporate partners. Western digital is one of them. Some executives in there have really been amazingly helpful just in asking you about things. Because for me and my industry, sometimes I get overwhelmed.

Speaker 3:          00:56:04       So I need to get outside. My industries are asking what's going on. And you know, I have also friends through different sponsorships that I have that they really helped me out from, you know, Paul and I have a lot of people. And then in the beginning, who would they? Paul Gomez. It's got my core Donohoe Jerry. Um, and then Joe Jagan Tino back in the day. Right. Was like the original guy that really kind of took me under his wings from a business perspective. And then this guy, men taught me everything to do with sales. Okay. So wait, so as Joe, the fellow on the elliptical. Yup. Josie, elliptical and men was guy who came over on a ship from Vietnam, got in a concentration camp in uh, I want to say like career something and ended up getting here selling perfume door to door. And now he's doing really well for himself.

Speaker 3:          00:56:46       So straight up hustling. How did you meet men? He was the gym sales guy and I wanted to be like him because he was making big checks. So you met him at the same time that you were also later doing the elliptical? Yeah, mentoring sessions happening. How ambushing him. I was working the front desk and so men would put in his sales slips and I looked at his commission slips and I was like, dude, what's going on? Teach me how to sell. And he did. And that was really a cool experience because I learned at a talk to different people, identify what their wants and needs were and you know, see what's going on. But it was also a time of my life where I started recognize that you need to run an ethical business just because you make money. Making money is not everything in life.

Speaker 3:          00:57:23       Running a very ethical, successful businesses critical for me. And what would happen is I would sell them the dream like, Hey, join our gym for nine, nine nine a month. And you know, you're getting the best shape of your life, but they wouldn't. And I knew I was selling them a false hope. And so that's when I got into the kind of like the Group, uh, coaching style, which just changed the game for me. I want to talk about two, two pieces of that. What made been so good at selling? I mean, the best way to describe him as a straight up hustler. I mean just, just hustling like right. But for some people that's going to conjure the image of like some guy with a foldout table and three card Monte. He was like picks up and runs away from the cops when the siren, sorry.

Speaker 3:          00:58:01       He lived by the code, you know, abcs always be closing. Huges identify what someone needed to hear and he would work really hard at doing it and there was no sugarcoating. He would follow up with people. You would tour people. Well he showed me from an early age that there's no easy answer in life. You've got to put in the work and you've got to get on the phones and hustle it and you want to, you want to get leads, go to the collections who like all the members who are past due, call them all and try and collect it. Go back to people who visited the gym from five years. Go and call them. And I would just end it with stacks, be on the phone that Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. You got, maybe you get one. What's the, uh, so what, what would be an example of say and a potentially successful script or question when you're, when you're calling up the Glengarry leads that you have from five years ago, what, what, what does a good call look like if you were you, if you, if someone in your company had that job today and you're like, here's a stack that have starts smiling and dialing, what would you tell them?

Speaker 3:          00:59:00       I mean, I think you start off just saying, Hey, I'm, you know, I'm Jason [inaudible] with NC fit. Uh, I just want to follow up with your, you know, whatever. Um, I think really what you would try and do is just identify, hey, so you know, you know, how has your experience, we're just checking up. Did you enjoy your experience? What were you looking for out of your experience? And you identify with they're looking for, right? And they say, Oh, well, did you hear that? We actually just added program that, you know, kind of tailors to what they were looking for. And I think finding out what people are looking for, I think it's really important. Instead of trying to force feed what you think they want, find out what they do want. Asking good questions. What's, what's, what are the magic ingredients to a good tour?

Speaker 3:          00:59:36       He said men toward, well, oh man, he had toward the best, you know, you know, to some people just be treadmills and ellipticals, but to him it was, it was money making pieces of machinery that you could sell. Hey, this is the, you know, lifestyle 10 32 top of its class. It comes to the fan. It seems music to you, right? And you just like selling a Mercedes and then you'd talk about the treadmill. You talk about this and that. Oh by the way, let me show you downstairs. Did we, you know, and then finally get down to the DA. And it's like, oh, did we tell you though that you could, for an additional $8 a month, you can get teleservice and let me show you where those towels go. Let me show you what they look like and let me show you the quality of them.

Speaker 3:          01:00:19       Right. And those are the types of things that you learn, right? It's just if you have a, did he have a strong accent or no. Oh yeah. No, that's great though because it just shows you like it does not matter. You're very strong views. No, nobody powered through it. I mean, I used to live in San Jose and, and uh, you know, used to go to a Vietnamese barbershop and it's, it's one of my best friends growing up was Vietnamese on long island. And I, when, when anyone has a strong accent, it's a heart. It's a strong accent. But he was able despite that to just power through and become one of the top, if not the top. Oh, it was, he was a dude. Oh yeah, he was, he was a baller. I learned a lot from him.

Speaker 3:          01:00:57       All right. I'm going to ask just a few more questions and then maybe we can do around two sometimes since we're basically in the same, same neighborhood. Uh, one would be if you could put any message on a billboard, and this is a metaphor really, but just to get a message out to millions of people, let's assume it's noncommercial, right? So it can't be an advertisement, but what might you put on a billboard? I mean I would, I would love to get this out to as many people as you could possibly push us too. It would just say like be easy. It's like life is good. And I mean that because I really believe that meaning when you seen children, you know, when you seen children, oncology, it changes your whole perspective. Yesterday I was on the road and this woman is just tailing me so hard coming around, get all crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:01:45       I just look over at her. I'm just like easy, easy, like life is good. You have a beautiful car, you look healthy and young and pretty whatever. Like chill the hell out. You know? And I think people, they get so caught up in these little problems and he let it manifest into something so great that they stopped to, they never stopped reflect that, hey look, life is okay. But I, I choose to look at the world. Me Personally, I choose, look at the world in a pair of glasses, not sunglasses. I choose to look at things in a brighter light because especially after you, I spent three nights in the ICU and I, my daughter was on the brink of not good. You know, you don't go to the ICU as a cancer patient. I mean it was really, really not good. Right. It was the only time that we really felt like it was a life and death situation.

Speaker 3:          01:02:33       I'm sitting there and there's this baby to my left and he's seven months old and his dad comes in. The baby had never left the ICU before and all night they were there were sucking fluid out of this kid's lung because he had pneumonia or whatever it was. And I'm sitting there for two days straight, right up all night eating muffins, looking at my daughter over here, like really not in good shape. And this guy or this baby over here in the dead, I'm just sitting there like, and people are complaining that there's traffic and fucking plane and it's just, no, I'm not expecting people. I never want anybody to be in our position. I don't. But what I want you to do is to really reflect on their life and realize that everybody has something to be grateful for. If you think about it, right, you're alive, you're well, you have the ability to get up and go do some amazing things, you know? And, uh, I, I think that sometimes people get caught up and they forget that. I think they could use a reminder of that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:23       Yes. I think that is where, shoot, we should wrap up. That is, uh, I think that is if among many other things, what I want people to remember. So that's a, that's a fantastic point. And just in closing, where can people find you online, learn more about you, learn more about your business and, and, and

Speaker 3:          01:03:43       anything else you'd like them to take a look at? Yeah, I mean, I, uh, NC fit right? nc.fit would be great. Um, I'm very active on Instagram.
