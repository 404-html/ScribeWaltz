Speaker 1:          00:15          Cindy, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. I am very excited to dig in. And a, I thought we could start. Can I in media arrests as they say in novels, we start right in the middle of the action. So we're going to bounce all over the place. As I always do. Jp Morgan Healthcare Conference, I've heard some sort of murmurs about stories and getting attention or people to focus. Could you please describe for folks what happened?

Speaker 2:          00:41          Awesome. So biggest conference in all of healthcare I get invited in. I have eight minutes do or die. So proud of this opportunity again in front of the room. You can imagine. Here's me in hot pink, head to toe. I started to talk about women in sex and the whole room starts to giggle. I can feel this giggle going off or you know, across the crowd and I'm panicking like watching the clock count down so I can remember reaching to my laptop. That's where in as fast as I can to a slide that was just brain scan studies. Studies of women with this condition versus women without were in black and white. We could see there's a biological basis to women's lack of desire for sex. So I turned, I put the slide up, I turned and pointed long enough for it to be uncomfortable for everybody. I went silent. And when I did that, I said, are you looking at what I'm looking at? Cause I'm here. I'm just here to talk about the biology of sex for women is an important lesson for me. If at what I was going to have to do to make people focus. You let the silence do the work. It was uncomfortable. I figured it was long enough for it to be uncomfortable for me, which was a fair trade for them. Have you made me really uncomfortable if they started giggling and wouldn't pay attention?

Speaker 1:          01:49          Silence. Yeah. It's uh, it's so powerful. It's so, so powerful. And I remember advice I was given at one point while I was given that advice first by someone named cal Fussman is a master interviewer when he was going over some transcripts from this podcast in the early days. And he's like, no, you're too fast. Like you don't leave gaps. Hmm. Uh, and you don't have to save people, like let the silence do the work. So I just, I, I love that story. And so speaking of letting the silence do the work, I'm going to go silent for a bit because I want to ask you two questions that I'm might take a few minutes to answer them and start with a short one. What is your favorite business and why? Hmm.

Speaker 2:          02:30          My favorite business of all is Wegmans, which if anybody's from the northeast, uh, they appreciate this as a grocery store. How can you get excited about a grocery store? I'm excited because it's from my birthplace. Rochester and I went there every Sunday as a little girl. Here's why I loved it because of the incredible loyalty that they instilled. How do you get folks that are cashiers at the checkout line with jobs that may seem relatively unexciting to show up with unbridled enthusiasm for what they do? So it opened years later I moved my whole life, uh, and it opened in the DC area and I went the first day that Wegmans opened in DC and I walked up and all of their employees are standing outside holding their hands above their head like a w because they have a Wegmans pride, the Wegmans way. And I got to tell you that first date, anybody in the entire DC metro area who'd ever been to a Wegmans showed up and stood in line to walk through this store. I love them for being a private family held business that has that kind of loyalty and longevity of employees.

Speaker 1:          03:36          How do they instill that? I mean is it's filtering for the right employees who are prone to that to begin with? Is it something else? I mean how do they develop?

Speaker 2:          03:45          I think it is, oh so simple. I think it is their basic appreciation for the people who show up and work for them every day and they reward them through the right incentives. They reward them through the best benefits. They help develop them, they encourage them when they lose weight. I mean there are all of these incentives to their employees that make them truly feel that appreciation from their employer. And also I think, you know, be proud to work there. They go home and have pride in saying who they work for. So I started studying businesses I loved at a very young age.

Speaker 1:          04:19          I had a conversation with Frank Blake, former CEO of home depot right here. He's sitting where you are and who they develop this orange apron cult as it was sometimes referred to and the dedication that some of these employee shows. Incredible. And his point was in one of these systems they instilled was a positive reinforcement by sharing stories on a very regular schedule basis of kind of stand out customer service. And it doesn't have to be complicated.

Speaker 2:          04:49          I have to tell you, when I sold my first business slate, yeah, I sold it to a group that was private equity back. And I ran into one of those guys, uh, one of the bankers years later, and he said, that group you had, they were almost cult like, and I think he said it was sort of one eyebrow raised like, hmm. They, and I said, why thank you. That's the guesses. Compliment I've ever received.

Speaker 1:          05:12          Uh, yeah, the apple way, not the David Koresh way. Perfect. Exactly. So the next question, which will seem odd to people listening but will soon make more sense is it's not really a question Irma. I'll be polite and make it a question. Could you please give me your three minute commercial? Tell me about yourself. Soup to nuts.

Speaker 2:          05:36          All right. Um, moved my entire childhood. So every year from fourth to 12th grade I was in a different school, so I was the perpetual new kid. I think what that did is perfect my ability to stand on the outside of the room and look in and really listen, understand motivations, understand sort of the dynamic which served me well later in life at the time I went kicking and screaming. Um, I have a love that started very young in life for what makes businesses great. So as I went through college, I was fortunate to have a great business professor who really cultivated that in me. So I'd have to report to her every week what my favorite business was, why, what were they doing differently? And along that way made a unilateral decision that I was going to go work for Merck. So she thought I should probably brought my options.

Speaker 2:          06:23          It wasn't such a slam dunk. I told her, no, I'm going to work for Merck. Um, they weren't hiring when I got a school, but eight months later they were, and I got the job, called her up a said, I got that job that you said I might not. And she said, great, we're going out to dinner and you're buying. So went to work from work, started in Pharma because it was fortune's most admired company. That's why I went there wanting to learn from the best. I thought I would actually take it elsewhere and apply it. Didn't really think I was going to be so fascinated with the science fell in love with the science and the innovation, what it could mean in people's lives. Loved what Pharma had the capacity to do, hated how they got it done in the bigger companies. So I made the leap went smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller, um, until I ultimately was maybe crazy enough to start it for myself.

Speaker 2:          07:09          Uh, built two businesses both in sexual health people say, why say Irish Catholic of course. Um, so built a business late with the only a long acting testosterone for men. Uh, and that made me on the path of watching this emergent science for women. Um, when the drug, when this drug was put on the shelf by the company that invented it, I made a decision to stop it off and take it on and got the, uh, only ever drug approved, uh, for sexual desire in women, sold that business and now as a pass through, do nothing but spend my time reaching my hand back and trying to get female founders there to my kind of outcomes faster than I got there myself.

Speaker 1:          07:46          That was really good. And how many minutes your listeners will know if I'd use my spider sense. I think that was really, really close. So I'm very impressed and for people who are wondering what the hell is Tim doing? This is the oddest interview have ever heard him, uh, attempt to give it is because why? What are the last two questions have in common? Why did I ask those two questions?

Speaker 2:          08:12          You asked those two questions because I love to ask those questions of everybody I interview cause I think that if you'll just be quiet and listen, uh, which you heard a little bit from my background, people will tell you a lot about themselves and what their motivations are. So that was always probably my initial question and interviewing and figuring out from people what they would tell me about themselves. Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:31          What would you look for or what were, were there any particular sort of checkered flags? Meaning fantastic or red flags? Meaning hmm, maybe not a good person to pick four.

Speaker 2:          08:43          Me, you know, it was discomfort with change, the lack of adaptability because in my environments they were not the same structure that they might have been coming from. They were going to have to be nimble, have to move quickly to keep pace or I always laid my cards on the table at the end of interviews and said, here's who we are, here's this culture. Um, we both should lay our cards on the table because six months from now I don't want us to be unhappy with each other. Um, so I think I'm always listening for those cues that would indicate a fit for my environment and a, and in it, I think I was finding the people with a love of businesses. I often ask that question, what is the business that you most admire? Because they've got to have that passion. I think particularly in small and startup, you have to have a real love affair with what it is that makes things tick.

Speaker 1:          09:31          What did you study in Undergrad business? Yeah. What did your business professor do besides have you report back each week on your favorite business of the week?

Speaker 2:          09:45          I think she just took a special interest. I think she saw something there and cultivated it so that she was pushing me. So not only did she push me with the assignment that was above and beyond what she was asking of everybody else, but I think she also tortured me a little bit with, um, the doubt to see if I would push through it. You know, when I said to her, I'm going to go work for Merck, she's like, wow, I don't know. Their science grades aren't that good. I mean she really sort of pushed back. Like it wasn't such a sure thing. So she was constantly setting the bar for me.

Speaker 1:          10:19          Did she know, I don't know if you had a chance to ask her, but once she, did she genuinely think that you would have trouble getting the job or was it a Yoda trick to get you to stubbornly then pursue, pursue it twice as hard?

Speaker 2:          10:35          100% of stubborn trek. Yeah, and I think she knew that I have sort of a healthy chip on my shoulder of proving it. Um, so she was definitely pushing right at that button, um, of, you know, go out there and prove it. So yeah. Very clever.

Speaker 1:          10:51          So how does one start a Pharma company without a Pharma background?

Speaker 2:          10:58          Well, Pharma background and that I'd been in the industry for a long time. So had the right, you know, contacts had the industry experience. Yes. Without the scientific backgrounds, right. Surround yourself with it. Extraordinary scientific team. I feel like I've learned at the hands of some of the best in science and I think I've always brought a lens to it of, you know, what would work in the market. We were sort of a magical pairing because many times in science you can get enamored in the lab with youngs and not look out, tried to what's really going to work in the mainstream. So it was, it was a lot about having just a great team. How did you pick, and I can play a doctor on TV now or at least think I can,

Speaker 1:          11:42          people's ear buds if they, that's right. How did you end up choosing the, you said long acting testosterone. So, uh, paint a picture for us. Well, I mean sure because we can certainly get into testosterone and like HP Pta and all this fun stuff up, but I don't, I don't want to bore some segment of my population, uh, of listeners to death, although I'm fascinated by, so we probably will get into it. But the, how did you end up choosing that? Right. So you have, you want to start, did it start with finding the opportunity and then I want to start a company or do you decide I want to start a company now let me try to find that product.

Speaker 2:          12:19          Yup. I wanted to start my own company, so I felt like I had a hypothesis that, and if you don't mind me asking, how old were you at the time or where were you in touch? And I know that I was in my early thirties at that time. Got It. Oh, when I started it and I had had one sort of career experience, it was very informative. So I'd been at a company that was acquired in this. They had been gobbled up by somebody who gobbled up a lot and then they had to integrate them and I got to be on that team. So I got this sort of put together of the perfect company. That was a great career moment for me. Um, and then I got to go apply it in, in doing my own. And the reason I did it is that for that same reason, I love Pharma for what it can do at three m in the morning.

Speaker 2:          13:00          If you're sick, you love Pharma. Yeah. In the light of day you probably don't. And it's because it is an industry that has a certain reputation. I thought there was a way to do it better. And I had the hypothesis that here I am driven and succeeding in these environments, but totally uninspired to have to be other people like me. What if I got them together, gave them permission to do it on their own terms and that was slate. I named my company Slade on purpose, clean slate. We were going to do it, we were going to do it our way and it was to go out and find a diamond in the rough and asset that had been overlooked. I loved the category. I love sexual medicine. I'm a card carrying member of the sexual medicine society. Who knew there was that there is other, it makes me popular cocktail parties. I'd like whip it out. No I it, there really is, this is a society and it's because like actually our understanding there has really come much more recently. Like it's a relatively new field and yet we're learning such interesting things and it's in conditions that, you know, you might not lose your life from them, but you will lose your life as you know it when you're affected by these dysfunctions. So found, um, this inventor who had the only FDA approved long acting testosterone and interestingly, how do you find someone like that

Speaker 1:          14:17          you'd think that like in a, in a world of some of Pharma discovery that the bones would have been picked clean?

Speaker 2:          14:24          Yes. Okay. So this is a great story. So a scientist that I knew from previous company was quoted in an article. This gentleman reached out to him. He said, I don't really, I don't know anything about this space, but I know somebody who's really interested in it. Commercialize was a very fortuitous sort of introduction and couldn't believe that this had been overlooked. The reason it had been overlooked is that almost of this product was being used off label, meaning that not for its indication was being used interestingly in women. So my journey started very early in this use for libido. It was testosterone and it was a pellet. So, uh, it was put it long acting put under the surface of the skin release testosterone over of sort of four to six month window. Yeah. So I, so here's me looking at it going, hmm.

Speaker 2:          15:17          First of all, it should be used by urologists in men. I did it, this crossover analysis. Only one neurologist in the country was using it. So I thought this would be a great business to build and frankly, the delivery system is better than what's available on the market today. If I thought of something that was custom made for men, they have to remember, I big brothers, I'm used to being around guys, you know, they can be sitting on the beach burning bright red and they still won't put sunscreen on or rubbed something on. And the most common application for testosterone at the time were gels. So this was like, Hey, can you remember to show up three times a year to the doctor?

Speaker 1:          15:51          Yeah, yeah. All right. So the inventor reaches out to your friend, the scientist who says, I can't help you, but maybe my friend Kat. And that's how it starts. Uh, and the, uh, so the pellet, how do they know, I'm thinking of, for instance, like trembling, which is used in cattle in some cases also popular, some power lifters and so on, a who do not use it in pellet form, but how is it, how is it administered or how is it put into the patient?

Speaker 2:          16:19          So put in, in an in office procedure at the end of it, it requires a bandaid. Um, so there's a device, a Trocar, you go just under the surface of the skin, set it underneath the skin, put a bandaid on. And it was, yeah. And for your urologists who are surgeons, this, you know, in, in office procedure was very simple. And the great news is it was half the price of anything on the market. So everybody was winning in this equation.

Speaker 1:          16:43          Why was it half the price? Just because of the purpose for me. Cause you set the pricing less costly because you are comparing it to other modes of administration which require more visits. Tense. It's not, no, it was just the market positioning. Yeah. Hmm. Fascinating. What was the,

Speaker 2:          17:04          I have sort of a belief system around that and Pharma about drug pricing. And so it was important to me to do that. We were making great money building a great business and we were doing just fine at that cost.

Speaker 1:          17:15          Right, right. You don't need a 500 million. Yeah, exactly. Uh, yes. And as, as we may, we may or may not talk about, some people get into a lot of trouble for that. Rightfully so. Yeah. Uh, what other questions do you like to ask when you're interviewing people that, are there any other questions that you find yield, uh, are, are worth the effort that are particularly helpful or, or other approaches to hiring?

Speaker 2:          17:42          I'm going to go back to silence. Isn't that I'm going to go back to you. I do more listening than asking. I asked the one open ended question and try to see where they'll take me cause I think I'm getting a lot of insights into who they are and by doing that, so I don't think they're, I don't think there are magical questions. I think there's ways to tease out cultural fit and that is so important. I care much less about the resume. Um, the quality, you know, everybody wants to come in and impress you. They haven't really hit your doorstep unless they have the credit. I think to be in there interviewing for the position. So I feel like it's my job to really tease out that cultural fit so that we're both happy with each other.

Speaker 1:          18:22          So culture can mean a lot of things too. Yeah. To two different people in this particular case. Uh, and you mentioned the adaptability, which in a, in a small startup especially, I mean, you're gonna learn a lot of hats in those heads. Make Change. She, you need someone who is adaptable. What else were you looking for and what did it mean to you?

Speaker 2:          18:42          Six things, so minor, minor, pretty specific looking for, well, let me say overarching. I'm looking for people who wake up everyday and make deliberate choices. It's all a choice, right? How you go through life. And mine were my six where they had to choose to be an owner, maybe highly motivated by that ownership. Um, they had to choose to be bold. We're going to make decisions a little differently. They had to choose to be quirky because I needed them to feel that permission to be individual in my environment. Most of them are coming out of environments in which we, we beat like, you know, sameness into people and homogenize the whole group. Um, they did choose to be learning. That's fundamental to me even as I invest today. So important to watch what people do to learn every day. Um, choose to be family. Uh, because we were going to be a small, tight knit group and they had to choose to be appreciative. And I think that that is how you go through life. You know, what is your attitude? Do you sort of marvel at the opportunity you have to make impact. Um, so those were my six choices I was looking for.

Speaker 1:          19:40          How do you avoid false positives in the sense that if you ask someone or if you lay out, if you say to them, these are the six

Speaker 2:          19:51          because it doesn't, you're, you're listening to this story that shows that I think exposes those values. But if you ask somebody that, like if you choose to be quirky, uh, sure, I cheat. I mean it, you know, that's a, you're not going to get, I think the right response. I think you have to know your core, who you are and who fits. Um, and then I think you have to ask the questions. I will say there is one other question I do always ask and I ask how was the very first way you ever made money?

Speaker 1:          20:17          Oh, I like that. That's a really good one.

Speaker 2:          20:19          And, and if they can't, they never, if they can't tell me, you know, I put like flyers in the mailboxes in the neighborhood and said odd jobs called me or if they are like, wow, you know, my first job out of college was they're out. They don't have that sort of mentality that's going to fit

Speaker 1:          20:36          one of, one of my friends, um, Brian Johnson who has done a whole host of very impressive things, he was the founder, I don't think he had a cofounder, but let's just say one of the founders to be safe of Braintree, which then sold for a whole lot of money. And, uh, when entrepreneurs come to him, because he invests quite a lot now and they say they want to start something, he'll ask them, is that an itch or is that like, is it, is it an itch or is it a burn? And, uh, and then he'll take them down that discussion to assess like, do you really have the sticktuitiveness and the stubbornness and just the, it can't be any other way with me to actually make it through this because it's not going to be all.
