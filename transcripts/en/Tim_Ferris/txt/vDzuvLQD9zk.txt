Speaker 1:          00:00          Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. This is Tim Ferriss. What you're about to hear is part two of a two part conversation with Ramit Sethi. He is an entrepreneur, he's tried venture backed now he's going self funded, bootstrapped. He is a behavioral change and persuasion expert and also a very good friend of mine. If you didn't catch the first part, you might want to do that before venturing in. If you don't mind, your stories is more of a jigsaw puzzle, then by all means keep on listening and we tend to bounce around quite a lot. So I think that you could almost listen to them in reverse order and still get a lot out of it. But for the background context and so on. Part one has a lot of that. This episode is brought to you by the Tim Ferriss Book Club, a handful of books that have had a huge impact on my life and keep in mind that I read three to four books a week on average.

Speaker 1:          00:46          So these are four to six that have really made a huge difference. Check them out@audible.com forward slash Tim's books, audible.com, forward slash Tim's books. And if you would like to join me, Richard Branson, Seth Godin and some other amazing folks. I'm not calling myself amazing, but those people aren't managing, uh, on Necker Island, which is Richard Branson's private island for a week of mentorship. Uh, it's going to be amazing. Check out shopify.com forward slash Tim, that's Shopify, s h o p, I f y.com, forward slash Tim. And now without further ado, please enjoy part to the final part of the Tim Ferriss show with Ramit Sethi.

Speaker 2:          01:30          My hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism living now. So

Speaker 1:          01:48          the revenue per email, I'm your quintessential case of reticence to monetize. Right? And of course I've been, I've been ridiculed for years by many friends because of this, which is fine. My general approach to date has been, it's either free or it's really, really high end and very expensive. Uh, and I think a good example of that was Ota opening the Kimono that that event that I said was going to be one time, and at least to date it has only been one time and it was depending on when people sign up. It was between $7,500 and $10,000 a seat and it's sold out from one blog post. And I remember I was talking to someone about event management, somebody who does this for a living. I mean someone who's putting on events once a quarter making a lot of money from the events or or so I thought, and I asked her at one point what she would do to fill an event with between a hundred and say 20 and 200 people at this given price point.

Speaker 1:          02:47          She said, well, you're going to have to hire a full time person to do, to falling 12 things. You're probably going to have to pay for the following type of marketing and outbound and this and that. And the other thing and all it took was one blog post. And now the way I explain that is that I've given away so much free content and value, hundreds of books worth of content on the blog that I've established a level of trust with my audience so that when I finally offer something for sale, the understand and assume I've given it a lot of thought, which is true. Do you think that's a foolish approach?

Speaker 3:          03:20          No, I think it's great. I mean I give away 98% of my material for free and then for many of my flagship courses, they're extremely expensive if I tend to 100 times what my competitors charge. So I love the idea. In fact, I'll even take it one step further. You know a lot of times people, they would come to me and say like, that's ridiculous. Maybe if it were $30 and I just smiled because I don't play in the $30 sandbox, I don't want to play there. I'd rather give it to you for free. Then play in the $30 sandbox. And I think it's very important when you think about pricing and positioning is very important to think. What does this mean for you? It's the same reason where if you go to the farmer's market and you see a guy selling a tee shirt, you know he's selling it for 25 bucks and you go in there and say, I'll give you, I'll give you $3.

Speaker 3:          04:09          Look, the guys probably still making a profit on $3 but why is he going to laugh you out of his store and just turn his back on you? Why? Because he doesn't want to play in the $3 sandbox. And he would rather just say a blanket, no, then even make a small amount of revenue. So I really love the idea of giveaway as much as you can for free, but don't be afraid to aggressively sell. We are unapologetic about how aggressive we are because we've done the testing and we know that it works. So we sell at high price points and we sell, you know, when we sell. And, um, I mean, I could share stories of how we've done that and all that stuff, but I think you should be unapologetic about that.

Speaker 1:          04:50          And, um, so, so let's take her to take a real case then, something that I've been considering, but I've been very hesitant about, and I've been considering this for a long time. I know you probably kind of laughing to yourself because every time we meet up, I'm like, you know, I've been thinking about this.
