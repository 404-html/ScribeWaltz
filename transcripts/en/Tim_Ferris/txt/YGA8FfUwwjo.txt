Ex-Officio makes clothing and as far back as 2007 2008 I had a hit video that went viral called how to travel the world with 10 pounds or less. And I talked about ex-officio underwear. Ex-Officio underwear is lightweight, ultra lightweight, quick drying and antimicrobial. Why is this important? Well, I've gone through 20 plus countries with two pairs of underwear before, both from ex-officio, and I'm not alone in this.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       This might sound crazy, but a lot of executives, for instance, we'll take this underwear, they'll wash it in the sink or somewhere else, roll it up in a towel, like a Burrito step on it, and a few hours later they are completely dry, completely clean. You don't have to just have to and yes, they have to be comfortable for all day wear, but check out their clothing as well as their underwear. You can go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim that's x, e, x, O, f, F, I, C I o.com forward slash Tim and you can see this video which has a bunch of other packing tips, but this underwear, this clothing is not just for the gents ladies. You have choices too and they really have an incredible collection of high quality products that I've used for almost 10 years now, so check them out. Ex-Officio dot com forward slash Tim.

Speaker 2:          00:02:56       Hello might've seemed Munchkins. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. It is late at night. I'm in Boston back on the east coast for beautiful, beautiful fall day, or I should say evening. It is probably close to 1:00 AM and I just finished up some work with build.org if you are an entrepreneur, you got to check them out and build that org. But to our subject matter at hand, Rolf Potts, Rolf Potts Potts for off pots, raw fox. I'm in the Halloween spirit and a, I'm attempting to summon Rolf Potts to my hotel room like candy man, but it's not working and why would I do such a thing anyway, I would do that because Rolf Potts is hilarious and he is. One of my favorite writers in this episode showcases his intelligence and his wits. I think one of the quotes, for instance, is war is God's way of teaching Americans geography.

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       This guy is hilarious and he's also a very astute observer of human nature and a master world traveler. Among other things. He is the author of several books, including vagabonding in vagabond vagabonding. Vagabonding has a very important place in my life. I sound like the the science duck modeled after Albert Einstein. I'm going to run with that, but I won't subject you to that horrible invitation for the entire bio. So Rolf Potts road, vagabonding vagabonding is a very important book in my life. It is one of two books. The other being Walden by thorough that I took with me when I left the U S and ended up traveling nearly 18 months around the world in 2004 and of course all of those experiences set the stage for later writing four hour workweek. All the notes that I took and vagabonding had a huge impact on my thinking and how I approached all of that time.

Speaker 2:          00:04:55       And it was initially a four week trip. It turned into 18 months. So vagabonding is an incredible book, so much so that I partnered with Ralph very recently to produce the audio book because it is one of my favorite books of all time. And you can check that out by going to audible.com forward slash Tim's books if you want to check that out and get a free sample. It's an excerpt, but longterm travel, longterm world travel does not have to be a wealthy person's sport. And in this conversation we talk about all sorts of things ranging from how to travel, how Ralf travels rights, wanders, gets lost, study success studies, quitting success or managing success. And maybe you haven't thought that's an important element of life planning, but it apparently is. I've come to believe, and I almost forgot, of course there are a ton of resources and links and websites and books mentioned in this episode.

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       All of it can be found in one place in the show notes, so you just have to go to four hour workweek.com all spelled out forward slash podcast four hour workweek.com forward slash podcast you can find the show notes and resources and links for this episode as well as every other episode like those four Peter Teal, Tony Robbins, Mike Shinoda, you name it. So you don't need to scribble furiously unless you want to. But four hour workweek.com forward slash podcast is where you want to go. And uh, I had a blast with this interview. It is a two part interview. This is going to be part one. And then there's part two. And I really hope you enjoy it as much as I did. It was just fantastic fun. So without further ado, please meet Rolf Potts.

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       Little Ladies and gentlemen, this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. I'm very excited for this episode because I get to catch up with a good friend of mine who didn't start off as a good friend. And that is Rolf Potts. Uh, Ralph, thank you so much for making the time. It's good to talk to you. Yeah, and I, and I realize by saying that you didn't start off as a good friend. It's, it makes it sound like we might've been arch enemies or something. But what do you mean by that? Is I really felt like I got to know you through your book. Vagabonding which was one of two books. Uh, many people do not know this, that I took with me around the world for about a year and a half, starting in late 2004, early 2005. It must've been 2004 and I, it is one of my most heavily underlined books and really acted as my guide and my companion for all of the various travels, adventures and misadventures during that time. So first and foremost, thank you for writing such a spectacular little tone.

Speaker 3:          00:07:44       My pleasure. Thank you for reading. You know, it occurs to me that I heard from you in late 2005, which was in retrospect was pretty soon after I had written the book. So you must've found it pretty soon after it came out.

Speaker 2:          00:07:56       Yeah, I found it. I found it. Uh, I found it soon after it came out because, uh, I suppose in this, this may be true for many people, uh, the, the buying of the book, then the reading of the book and then the implementing of the book, quite a bit of lag time in between those various junctures. And, uh, but I think like a lot of people, I was really, uh, I spend a lot of time fantasizing about travel and, uh, taking that leap, but had more than handful of nebulous fear about it. And, uh, I suppose we could start there actually, and, uh, naked ask very simply, it, what are some recommendations that you have for people who, who may be able to work up the savings if necessary and, uh, are really just fearful of taking the leap and exploring longterm travel. And I suppose just wrapped into that, you might give a brief description of vagabonding itself and the subtitle and, and, uh, and, and why you wrote it. But, uh, I'll let you explore that multipart question if you wouldn't, uh, wouldn't mind.

Speaker 3:          00:09:14       Yeah. Well, I liked that you bring up the idea of fantasizing about travel because I think it's something that everybody does and it's one of those top three, if not top two or one things that people dream about that and you, and you see it in the movies all the time. Um, and in fact, I mentioned this in vagabonding, you know, the heist movie where the whole goal is to have this complicated, um, robbery so they can have enough money to, to move overseas to a wonderful place. And as I say in the book is that you don't need to rob a bank to do that. In fact, you can do that for a cost that is equal to, and sometimes less than your cost of living in a major American city. Uh, and so I think an important principle I bring up in vagabonding is saying, don't, don't put this off if you're dreaming about travel.

Speaker 3:          00:09:59       And most people do. And you know, and if you don't run about travel, that's fine. But I really address these travel dreams, which are so common that don't wait until you get to tell you're too old because, um, you know, retirement isn't necessarily the best time to, to, uh, to do something like this. And in fact, a Henry David Thoreau, I think Walden Woods is the other book you'd, you took on your travels. That's right. Talks about how people, and I'm not quoting him directly, they, you know, they put off what they really want to do until they're too old to actually do it. And you know, that's a paraphrase. Um, and so if you're 18, 28, 38, 48, whenever you'd ring them about travel, put, make your goals soon and, and don't put off those goals because they're very attainable. And you know, I think there's a lot of fears that are tied in to confronting vagabonding which you asked me if the, for the definition it's money and as long term travel, it's not just a vacation, it's not a week or two off.

Speaker 3:          00:10:56       Um, that you know, society gives you as a vacation. It's six months or two years or s you know, six weeks that you make for yourself to travel in earnest, not as a consumer experience, not as a vacation, but as you know, a more deeply meaningful life experience and as a way to actualize your wealth of time. And I think this is an idea we'll come back to a lot and it's something that you write about as well as me as the idea of time wealth, the idea that your experiences are more valuable in life. Then the, the things that you accumulate, then the things that are all is being touted as the most important things in life. So a travel is a great way to cash in on your time wealth. Um, and vagabonding just by definition is a more meaningful way of travel.

Speaker 3:          00:11:40       It's a way of slowing down and really discovering parts of yourself instead of just buying a lot of experiences, which is, which we've sort of been conditioned to do, uh, as American consumers. My first vagabonding trip was 20 years ago this year. Um, oddly enough and happy anniversary. Thank you. Thank you. It was just this time that I was, that I was straggling back to Kansas after having this amazing eight month trip around North America and it was a trip that I thought would be my last, I thought I would get travel out of my system so I could become a responsible American workaholic and then maybe returned to travel and I was old. But you, you mentioned the idea of fear and the fear is I had going out were um, you know, is this going to be expensive? It's going to, is this going to be dangerous?

Speaker 3:          00:12:25       Am I going to come back and be compromised professionally? And all of those sort of turned into the, into the opposite, that it was a lot safer than I expected. It was a lot cheaper than I expected. And I came back and for 20 years had been integrating, uh, travel, uh, with, with a, a professional life that continues to diversify. I continue to, to, to do other things, to make money, uh, while at the same time having big swaths of time to travel. And I'm not suggesting that everybody needs to, you know, become a vagabond or for a 20 year chunk. And in some ways I travel a lot less than I used to, um, you know, 10 or 15 years ago. But it's something that you can do. It's an option that you can have and it's, it's not an APP, an option that you wait for life to give you, you create it.

Speaker 3:          00:13:11       Uh, and so I'm a big believer in the active, uh, aspect of vagabonding of saving your money. The lottery is another metaphor I use a lot in, in vagabonding that people keep waiting for the lottery to reward them. Um, but as, as we all know, the odds that you're gonna win the lottery is pretty low, but we've already won the lottery. We're born with time wealth. And so it's just a matter of creating these travel experiences or these time rich experiences, uh, through things like simplicity and a, just the decision to make these sort of things happen. Well, that's

Speaker 2:          00:13:44       one of the, the scenes and I think gifts that you provide in vagabonding and for those perhaps wondering this, the subtitle says a lot, which is an uncommon guide to the art of longterm world travel. And I think uncommon in art or both keywords in that subtitle, uh, you provide a, a, a portfolio, it sounds to financial, yeah, a quiver of, of philosophies and uh, uh, suggestions for simplification, viewing the world through a different Lens, really decluttering your life both materially and, uh, emotionally and psychologically. Even if you do not travel. And what I've noticed is I recommend vagabonding to people who have no intention of travelling or for whatever set of circumstances feel they can't travel, uh, simply because, uh, and uh, I'm blanking on the attribution here, but, uh, I really believe that most people, even those who have more money than they know what to do with live lives of quiet desperation and they have this, they've, they've fallen into a drone like schedule where they have these material objects they thought might make them happy or give them something they were lacking beforehand, but they've lost that, uh, the excitement and anticipation perhaps that they once had, you know, the, the, the leaping into the unknown, uh, the, the, the feeling that kids have the night before Christmas or the week before Christmas and adults lose that.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       Nothing. One of the easiest ways to capture that is to actually fantasize about travel, but do it in detail. Right? So not one day I want to travel, but to read vagabonding and go, oh my God. Like I could do a, I could be, I could go to Japan for the first time. I could go to Europe and Busk, I could do all of these things that, that rekindle, that passion and enthusiasm and excitement, uh, because I think that excitement is a much more, uh, tangible metric for perhaps, uh, what other otherwise can be very nebulous in the word successful, right in the US. I think that, uh, for better or for worse, and I think perhaps for both, we have this, uh, you know, Protestant like work ethic towards a relatively undefined goal, which is this, this success. And, um, what are some exercises just in terms of helping to address that fear?

Speaker 2:          00:16:24       So you mentioned one thing which would be setting a, a near time horizon for travel, right? And I, I completely agree that the, in many ways the utility of travel, uh, decreases as your physical capacity decreases, right? So you can do the most, you have the most options. Uh, the younger you are when you travel, or at least, uh, the, the more functional your body is when you traveled, aside from setting a tight goal and whether that's, you know, a few weeks away, a few months away, uh, what are some extra, are there any exercises that people can go through to decrease that fear factor and a, or anything they can read but besides vagabonding to decrease that fear factor and their, their stories, for instance, that I'll tell folks, uh, about, uh, Columbia is a good example. So I recently, not too long ago, spent a month in Midian, Columbia, which was formerly the murder capital of the world, uh, when it was under the iron fist of Pablo Escobar, the drug kingpin. And I, I, I feel more threatened on market street in San Francisco on a daily basis whenever I go and walk down certain portions of market street, then I ever felt in Midian. And I went all throughout the entire city. Uh, and, uh, you know, I think that sometimes the stories can be helpful, but do you have any recommendations for whether it's exercises or things to read to sort of overcome the fear of the, the big bed, uh, overseas adventures and all the terrible things that await you were not?

Speaker 3:          00:18:01       Yeah, well add. There's a couple of big picture ones. It, it's funny. [inaudible] I was, I was just there a year and a half ago and I think now it's like the breast augmentation capitol of the world.

Speaker 2:          00:18:14       Yeah. It's, it's a, yeah. You know, South America is, it's like the CR, I guess Korea has its facial bleaching and then, you know, South America has a, if you Brazil there, it's the, the implant capitol of the world, which is still incredible just to even ponder. But yes, continue. Sorry to interrupt.

Speaker 3:          00:18:31       Right now the drug lords moved out in, the plastic surgeons moves in. That's it. It's a beautiful city. But that was just, it was a strange, like physical attribute, um, that it's, it's obviously a surgeons had been hard at work, wonderful city. Um, the, the advice is the advice that I have. There's a couple of a big picture ones, uh, big picture advice that I have for this. And one is too, they're both sort of mental. They're about redefining your relationship. Um, or just how you think about things. One is your relationship to money and what it represents and what is your relationship to information and what it represents. Um, you mentioned success, you know, the idea of the American, uh, you know, puritanical idea of what success is. And money is a great metric for success, but it's not the only metric for success.

Speaker 3:          00:19:18       And I think people fixate on money to their own detriment because I met, as I mentioned before, it doesn't take that much money to travel. The world. Travel isn't a consumer experience. And I think you, you said you weren't sure the reference, I think you're recording throw when you're sort of talking about these rich people who were sort of bound by their own riches and he's, he's actually stealing that from the Bible. And, and, and the, the Old Hindu scriptures, which talk about these, these golden chains with, you know, under which we sink. You know, we're bound to our possessions and through success, it is a very old philosophical idea. Through success we lose perspective on, on the good life because we tie success so closely with money and possessions and material splendor. And so if you can, if you can just redefine your relationship with what success is, um, and, and, and really goes back to the idea of time, wealth, that success is being able to do what you want, whenever you want. And there's billionaires out there who are compromised in ways that you or I or you know, you're a plumber or your local park ranger, um, are not, because just realizing that money is a tool, it's not a metric for success. It's a nice side product of success, but it's a tool for allowing you to live a time rich and experience rich life and really live in ways that allow you to not only follow but discover passions that you never realized you had.

Speaker 2:          00:20:46       No, I, I, uh, I, I, I agree on so many levels and just, just to, because of course the, uh, we, we both think about this stuff a lot and I apologize for jumping in, but the, the, just on the billionaire point to give some concrete examples. So the, this is very recent. I was talking to a fellow, he is putting together an event, it's going to be 20 or 30 people, a number of billionaires and attendance and it's a week long retreat of sorts. And, and he said to me, and this is a very, uh, this, this actually that the gentlemen is organizing it is very materially successful but actually has a very level head on his shoulders and has been able to keep things like time and mobility in mind is as important currency and metrics for his quality of life. Cc, he's done a really good job, but he said, of course the billionaires can't take a week off so they're only going to be there for 24 to 36 hours.

Speaker 2:          00:21:43       And I thought about that and the billionaires can't take a week off. What the hell is the point of having their billion dollars if they can't, if they don't have the options, if they have fewer options than I do, if that makes sense. And it reminded me of a conversation I had at one point with a another person who shall remain unnamed, but he has at least several hundred million dollars, maybe a billion plus. And uh, he was commenting on the number of homes that he had and uh, he's a good guy. It, but in effect, his accumulation had, had gotten so out of control and the ad between six and 12 homes around the u s and he said, I know I no longer feel like people work for me. I feel like I work for them because he has staff of five to 10 people at each of these homes. He's never at nine out of 10 of them.

Speaker 2:          00:22:39       And uh, so he's effectively just working to pay for homes where his staff basically are the owners of the homes because they live there. And I was like, wow, it really brings to mind. Um, uh, this is also a quote, of course, I don't know the, the, uh, the attribution, but the, the, the idea that things an excess become their opposite, right? So, uh, you know, money that provides you with freedom basically takes away your freedom, uh, when it's, when it, when it reaches a certain point, it starts to reduce your freedom. Uh, the idea that so called freedom fighters, uh, in, in excess, you know, given too much power, become tyrants, right? So, so things tend to flip when they get to a certain point of excess. Um, what, and, and, uh, also just because I'm such a die hard fan boy of vagabonding correct me if I'm wrong, but the example that I think you gave in vagabonding of, uh, of sort of Hollywood nonsense related to overseas travel was from Wall Street, wasn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:23:50       From Wall Street where the, the, the Charlie Sheen's big goal was to save up enough money, you know, one day when he strikes it big to, uh, to get a motorcycle and drive a car across China, I think. Yeah. And you pointed out that you could scrub toilets and China not even in the u s for a month or two and probably figure out a way financially to make that possible. Um, so certainly, I mean, when I was traveling and, and ultimately putting together the notes and observations that became the four hour work week, I save tens of thousands of dollars compared to simply staying in the bay area in California. And, uh, anyway, just a well

Speaker 3:          00:24:33       that's, that's the thing is that if you live in, in an expensive city, like, like, uh, you know, San Francisco, New York, um, there, there's probably a half dozen other examples in the United States alone. You're going to be living on fewer dollars per day by far. If you're traveling in Southeast Asia or South America or the Middle East, then you would just be paying your bills and paying your rent and buying your groceries at home that you're, you're traveling in a completely different economic zone. Which was sort of the point of, of pointing out this Wall Street example, uh, in China, that was, that movie was from the 80s. Certainly China is more expensive since then. Uh, you might not have to clean toilets, you might have to clean something else now to ride your motorcycle across China. But the point is, is that, uh, you know, all this importance is placed upon conspicuous consumption.

Speaker 3:          00:25:22       A romantic idea is of what we can do a, and oftentimes it's not money that's in the way. It's a mindset thing. Um, which is why, um, I'm sort of answering your question, your earlier question in big picture way that it's, it's really a mindset about your relationship to money and your relationship with Tim formation, which I'll get to in a second. But you were talking about, you know, the billionaire who has sort of become a slave to his own parasitical wealth. That's an old idea too. I have a quote from the ancient Sanskrit scriptures in vagabonding, which is about the king in his palace only has half a bad and, and, and the food on his plate for all the grain in his fields. Does he own the rest? You know, right. At the end of the day, even the Kings, and I knew this 3000 years ago, even kings only eat one meal at a time.

Speaker 3:          00:26:11       They only sleep in one bed at a time. Um, and at the end of the day, the substance of your life is through experience. And if you're suddenly compromised, your material wealth and your money is, is there to actualize your experience and, and um, you know, to enhance your life meaning, and the moment that it becomes parasitical the moment that you're a billionaire who has 36 hours to go to a conference. And I'd love to know how much money is spent flying to the conference, catering it, you know, because I, you know, I know people who could travel probably for five on what 1 billion our spins to go to that 36 hour conference. And I'm sure you know people who could do the same. So that's just such an important thing to keep in mind is to, I have nothing against success or material success, but really know where the line is.

Speaker 3:          00:26:57       The point at which, um, the success you've achieved is actually getting into the way of actualizing a, a good and meaningful, uh, and option filled life. Definitely. Where does, where does the information come in? I'm a, I'm very curious, have the, the relationship to information plays into all of this, right? Well, this is a, this is where the, the fear factor comes in. You were talking about Metta Gene, you know, there's a Mexico, um, that has a lot of drug war violence going on. Of course, the Middle East is a perennially, uh, a bad reputation place to travel to. Um, but keep in mind that information is something that can work against you or work for you. And these days, information is everywhere. When I, when I left to travel the United States 20 years ago, I was actually more afraid of the United States then in 1994 then I'm afraid of any place, uh, in, in 2014 simply because their beef pre worldwide web I had, I didn't know what to expect.

Speaker 3:          00:28:01       I had no examples. I've been in Kansas, which is not, you know, in sort of bullseye middleclass circles. I didn't have a lot of friends traveling full time. Um, and so I didn't really have anything to compare it to. Now if you're, if you're a successful person with the money to do it and, and the physical capacity to do it, you can go online. Uh, and, and not only can you, can you realize that people are traveling in Mexico, they're traveling and Columbia, they're traveling, uh, in, in Egypt and Israel and other parts of the world where you think that might be dangerous. You realize that there's, there's family bloggers out there who are traveling with five kids to these places or traveling with a diabetes problem or with physical handicaps or with, you know, money that they've made on a job that has a fraction of what most people make. You know, people who have simply decided to become wealthy in time, regardless of the fact that they work as park rangers or exotic dancers or maintenance men. Um, and so that that information you can, if you get past, I guess media exists in a, in a man bites dog world, they're going to talk about explosions and revolutions and bad things around the world. Um, and so much of what we understand, in fact, there's that famous phrase, you know, war is, is God's way of teaching Americans geography.

Speaker 3:          00:29:24       God, that's so horrible and so true. And so because Americans are so NC pillar, our international understanding is really pegged to major world events that don't really represent day to day life and the towns of these towns around world. So if you can look past the panic driven man bites dog tenor of media and realize that Mexico is actually a giant country and that the drug violence is very isolated and that there are ways to travel in, in a very safe way and a very inexpensive way, then suddenly Mexico, it becomes this amazing and very close way to travel. My, my sister is a college professor in North Central Kansas and she, they, they, she and her family took a little, um, there's a, a big Mexican American community in Kansas and they just took the local Mexican minivan now down to Fresno or Mexico and just a family of four.

Speaker 3:          00:30:19       And they, they've traveled for next to nothing in an amazing way for their teenage sons, uh, in to, uh, to a part of the world that people assume is full of drug violence. Right? And, and that was just taking a minivan from five blocks over, you know, away from where they live. And so that information, realizing that the big picture news media information is always going to be panic driven. It's always going to be a, you know, man bites dog. And so the more you get to the specific information and think, hmm, you know, I'm, I'm 37 years old, um, I'm looking to take a sabbatical from my job. I live in Virginia, uh, and I like to drink beer. Well, within 30 minutes you can find somebody who's from a very similar life situation, who's doing what you're doing. Um, and again, even if, I mean there's, I mean there's people who are blind who are out, who are traveling for years at a time. There, there are people with, with major impediments, uh, and if you're able bodied and you have a little money socked away, there's really nothing stopping you except your own fear, which has sometimes tied to your ideas of money or your ideas of what the world is like, which is pegged to information. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:31:31       Agreed. What, uh, what type of sites or resources would you recommend to people who are trying to find a comparable folks? Let's just say people who will help them alleviate their fear of travel or just in general, what type of online resources do you recommend?

Speaker 3:          00:31:51       Um, well Google for one, I mean if you just Google, you know, 35 year old years old, two kids, one year of travel, then odds are you'll find 20 blogs of people in that demographic who are doing just that. So, so really be the unabashed Ed and very specific about googling, you know, your fears or your demographic and just see who like you is, is out traveling. The world. There's a lot of great traveler communities. I've been affiliated with boots and all.com, um, since the very beginning of vagabonding. And part of their emo is just sort of creating community and, and uh, and support, uh, for people. And they have, they have blogs and resources on their site and there's other travel communities. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       and uh, you know, you, you, um, and boots and all is well, we'll put the links to everything in the show of course in the show notes, uh, for those people listening. But, uh, it's boots, the letter n all.com, right?

Speaker 3:          00:32:53       Yeah. B O t s n a l l.com. Uh, and, and they'd been operating out of Portland, Oregon for years and have just quietly been doing very, this, the nice work of a reassurance and saying, oh, so you, so you're worried about it. Uh, and around the world flight, well, here's what around the house, around the world, flights. Look, you know, you're, you're worried about a certain situation, you know, here's, here are some resources for that. And, and they're not alone. I'm most familiar with them because we, we've been, we've sort of shared a similar mission for a long time, but there are big communities of travelers who, who are happy to help and, and sort of help new newbies feel better about these, uh, prospects have of longterm travel.

Speaker 2:          00:33:36       Yeah, they're all over. I remember one that was very helpful to me in the beginning was a virtual tourist.com and that I was with the site for a long time and then the four hour work week came out and I ended up becoming friends much in the same way that I reached out to you. Uh, I became friends with the founder of virtual tourist and some now actually involved with a site of his called trippy, which is just trippy Dotcom as people would expect. But, uh, it's a, it's effectively community of, of open questions and you can follow specific locations, right. So if you're interested in, whether it's San Francisco, Buenos Iras, Spain, Midian, whatever, all of the questions that come up, for instance, I am just, I'm just taking a quick look here and you can add, you can pose any question you want, but, uh, you know, what's the steepest place you've ever been in country x, uh, the, uh, what, where's the best rock climbing in San Francisco, which is generally going to be extremely inexpensive.

Speaker 2:          00:34:38       You know, what are the best online tools for group vacation planning? So if you're, if you're a family or multiple families, so like you said, there, there are many different options. Speaking of, of technology, uh, how have, how have, uh, different services like, um, whether it's couch surfing or even say a airbnb or, uh, anything else really, these collaborative consumption companies changed travel, um, for you, uh, and, and, uh, perhaps there are older examples, but you mentioned that you're, uh, you're taking a trip before we started recording. Uh, and you're doing a home swap. Is that, is, uh, would you mind perhaps elaborating on, um, how some of those options work, those that you're familiar with? Because I think that many people who consider travel think in terms of one of their main expenses being staying in a hotel. Right. Uh, and, uh, I'd love for you to share any of your thoughts on that.

Speaker 3:          00:35:42       Yeah, well, it's shifted the way the travel world works in, in, in some ways that are delightfully convenient. Uh, and, and, and in some ways that are a little bit strange, I, I think that technology is one of those double edged swords that in some ways has turned this into insufferable micro managers on the road.

Speaker 2:          00:36:02       Can you elaborate on that?

Speaker 3:          00:36:04       Yeah. Well, I'll, I'll start with the negative. Um, you know, I, I the travel culture, which I started in, which was 20 years ago, but really my more international traveler travels are more like 15 years ago. Um, it's about showing up in town and knowing that when you get there, um, the unexpected awaits you that you, that you're going to walk to the hotel district. You may have a guidebook with some hotel recommendations. Um, but you're going to shop for your hotel. You're not going to find a deal online. You're going to walk in there, you're going to see the room. Um, you're going to haggle because in, in, in all throughout Asia, you know, basically any place outside of the industrial world, prices are up for grabs. And, and, and haggling in person is so much more, it gives you so much more leverage and haggling online cause you can go and look at the room and physically leave, uh, if the, if the owner doesn't give you a price that you're, that you're into.

Speaker 3:          00:36:55       And so these days it has become so convenient. Not always a bad thing, but it has become so convenient that people just assume that the best deals to be had are the ones online. And then pretty soon you've locked in your traveling for six weeks and you know where you're sleeping every night in advance. And it really compromises the flexibility of travel and the serendipity of being inspired by a place and thinking, I'm going to stay here for a few days. Or Wow, I just met this traveler who told me about this great place up in the mountains and I'm not going to go to Varanasi. I'm going to go up into the Himalayas and spend my time there. This technologically enhanced micro managing cuts into that serendipity in a certain way. And, and it also connects us to home and, and again, it's a two edge thing. Um, social media and the constant connectivity that comes with smart phones for example, allows us to really find things that we couldn't find before.

Speaker 3:          00:37:48       But it cuts into the idea of wandering around and finding things by surprise, finding things organically and letting, letting it get destination reveal itself to us on his own terms instead of sort of finding that place as a consumer before we get there. Um, and a lot of technologies have eliminated things like loneliness and boredom, which sounds good and is good to a certain extent, but loneliness and boredom, um, can lead you to those moments that, that sort of force you into a new version of yourself. They force you to be more extroverted day. Totally agreed. Totally agreed. They force you to read the local newspaper instead of, you know, looking through your Facebook feed. Right. Uh, uh, and so that's, that is what we're up against with this technological, these advances. And I don't want to be the grumpy older traveler because I remember being being 20 and listening to these, you know, baby boom era hippie sort of lectured me on how travel used to be, you know, back at a time when telephone answering machines and credit cards were seen as this decadent form of technology.

Speaker 3:          00:38:51       Um, and, and so I know that there are younger travelers who don't know anything but the constant conductivity of travel. Um, but unplugging is important and we can talk more about that if, if you want. Um, and we can also talk about the pluses and there I have many recent examples about how technology has have helped this recent home home exchange. It's just a long time friend who lives in Brooklyn. She's a writer and she wants a quiet place. I have 30 acres in Kansas and so I get an awesome pad in Brooklyn for a week and she gets a quiet farm in Kansas for a time. And, uh, the positives you mentioned or alluded to, the positives? Um, I I definitely want to delve into the importance of, of disconnecting. Ah, yeah. I think I've become somewhat, uh, especially living in silicon valley, but, um, have some thoughts there as well.

Speaker 3:          00:39:41       But what would you say, how would you expand on the, the recent positive, uh, positives are positive examples. Yeah. Well you mentioned a Airbnb and couch surfing. Uh, I think in place and more expensive places like Europe, you know, the hostel was your go to, it was where if you wanted to save money and you would go to the, to the youth hostel, um, and it was a great place to meet people. You get a cheap bed, you went, you, you would forego a few amenities that you would hang out in the hostel. Well, I went to Amsterdam, uh, this summer, uh, I teach, I teach a writing course in Paris every summer and my sister and my nephew came and visited me and we wanted to go see Amsterdam. And using Airbnb, I was able to get a full cottage, a 15 minute train ride outside of central Amsterdam for about half the price as a hostel for three people in the center of Amsterdam.

Speaker 3:          00:40:38       So instead of staying at, at at somewhat grungy, hostile, and the red light district, um, we were staying in this little town filled with windmills, uh, and we had our own house to ourselves and we could just walk down the street and get groceries. And so that was an airbnb hookup. Couchsurfing is a similar, has similar benefits. Uh, it, it just allows you to break out of not only that old hotel set of assumptions, but also out of the hostel instead of assumptions. The idea that the cheapest option in any place is going to be a hostile, especially traveling in groups. For the three of us, if I had been alone, maybe I, maybe the cottage, we wouldn't have been as cheap as the hostel, but with three of us where you're getting hostile one bit at a time, um, we just got the perfect place to stay through airbnb.

Speaker 3:          00:41:23       Uh, and so those services and even social media, even going on Facebook or Twitter and, and I'm not a big believer of tweeting while you travel, I think that that really puts you into this whole mindset and it pulls you out of the place where you are and the point of travel is experiencing what's before your eyes and not what's coming across your social media feed. But before your travel, before once travels. I'm a big fan of throwing, throwing out a tweet or Facebook post that says, Hey, look, I'm, I'm going to be in this place. What are some suggestions? And that is something that didn't exist 10 years ago, uh, and is not tied to a business or social networking thing like Airbnb and couch surfing. But it could just be that your buddy from high school has a friend who's in the military in Germany and they have an ex girlfriend who lives in Stockholm and suddenly you have a place to stay, uh, through very random circumstances.

Speaker 3:          00:42:18       And so that kind of, it's, it's the old model of sitting in the hostel or sitting in a guest house or a bar. And an exotic part of the world, talking to the six travelers who are there with you and them giving you advice on points further down the road. That principle has been taken to social media and through networking. That's another way that technology has allowed that, that that old hostel room, it's actually killed the, the literal hostel room where people are now staring at their phones in the hostel room. But is it, has expanded the virtual hostel room where instead of talking to the six travel or is your width physically, you can be talking to 600 travelers through your networks who might have some good advice for you?

Speaker 2:          00:42:58       No. Agreed. And the, to touch on the disconnection point, uh, I think that, uh, I think that social media and being online while traveling, if the objective of travel is to, uh, gain some introspection, have unique experiences and come back better than when you left in some way, uh, is very dangerous. Uh, and at least speaking for me personally, uh, the laptop is a portal to many different things and it's, it's very common, at least for if I'm speaking from my personal experience and looking at many of my friends whose, whose professional lives are based on computers. They look at a laptop that look at their smartphone, they look at their desktop computer for work, which is most, the vast majority of them, uh, who were, who were managing email using base camp or other online services to manage business. It is, it is a, uh, it's very easy to use Twitter or Facebook socially is a gateway drug and you're only one tab away from, from, from going right back into your, your old routine.

Speaker 2:          00:44:16       Uh, and it's extremely easy and seductive, like you said, because of the convenience to travel abroad. And I know many people who do this, unfortunately, uh, I don't see the point, but they will take a laptop, go overseas, stay at a hotel that could just as easily be the four seasons in any major city in the United States. And they come back and they really haven't. They've changed time zones, but their mind, their experience hasn't changed, uh, more than perhaps what they had for lunch while they were abroad, which is a real shame. Uh, and so when, uh, when I've taken these, uh, when I've taken sabbaticals, which are typically because I feel like I need to reassess my priorities and gain some perspective on things that are hard to assess when you're down in the weeds, right? When you're, when you're deflecting bullets and, and dodging problems and putting out fires, looking at your email inbox, it's very hard to step back and look at the larger picture of your life and goals and whatnot.

Speaker 2:          00:45:24       From a 30,000 foot view, uh, that, for instance, when I went to, I went to Bali to Indonesia for the first time and took 30 days, uh, off of computer phone and a calendar basically to, like you said, move from the micromanaging of my daily experience to the extreme opposite for me at least, which was pretty much pure serendipity and forcing myself to, uh, rather than feel comfortable and convenienced, uh, to feel as uncomfortable as possible. Uh, at least when you consider how routinized life becomes this, even if you're, especially if you're kind of optimizing for efficiency, right? It's very easy to become trapped in systems of your own making where you're like, whoa, fantastic. My per our output is, is wonderful and doing all these new things I'm taking on new projects and then you step back and you realize, wow, I might as well just be a cyborg running, you know, running in all these systems.

Speaker 2:          00:46:27       So this is a very long meandering observation. But I think that, uh, even if your only goal, and I don't think this is a crass goal, but even if your only goal were to, uh, improve your professional life, uh, especially if you run your own company, taking a month off the grid is perhaps the best way to do it because you have to set up systems that will persist after you get back. Uh, if you're taking three days to go to Amsterdam, you don't need to do that a week off. You can probably come back and still rescue things, but a month off, completely off the grid. Um, and I was available for emergencies via phone, by my assistant or other people. Um, they had to call the office at the Bahasa Indonesian language school and find their way to me. Um, you really have to I think, think about the bigger questions that are easy to avoid, um, by, by, uh, keeping your hands full with busy work. But anyway, long, long sort of preachy observation. But I really think that um, you know, the, the less you feel you can go without your smartphone, the greater the value of going without your smartphone.

Speaker 3:          00:47:37       Yeah. Well this is, this is an old conversation. Um, if the first person to do this in, in the technological age was, was actually JP Morgan. Um, when the Telegraph was invented, uh, he went to Egypt and I forget exactly it was, it was a little over a hundred years ago. Uh, and his companions talked about how he was in Egypt, but not really because he was always, he spent his whole time in Egypt attending to business. It was exactly, it was like the turn of the previous century version of what you just explained. It was him in a hotel room. Um, you know, attending to his business tech technology. Basically the Telegraph, which is seems very primitive in retrospect, um, prevented, you know, JP Morgan from actually being in Egypt, he may as well have not left home. And so this is an old problem in, in, in fact, the travelers of previous generations have complained that sailboats, that steam ships were compromising travel in ways that sailboats didn't isn't in, in, in, in the Roman era.

Speaker 3:          00:48:38       The, you know, the technology of Rhodes was changing the way travel was experienced. George Orwell talked about how trains, uh, we're changing the way that, that travel was experienced in, in trains. When you think about it was a technology that allowed you to Prabal so quickly compared to how you previously could, that you could maintain a business relationship of sorts while you were traveling. Um, I don't think there's, there's a silver, silver bullet, um, that can keep you from being a slave to your smartphone when you travel. It's hard. And as he edit, as you mentioned, there's some things that you have to maintain, um, back home if you're traveling for more than a couple of weeks. Um, to an extent it's a lot about self discipline. Uh, there's something to be said for physically not taking your smartphone with you, which is something I don't do when I travel. I use the Internet, right?

Speaker 2:          00:49:25       Yeah, absolutely. I make it, I make it harder so I don't have a data plan that, uh, that generally allows me to get international coverage. So I can't, I can't use the phone.

Speaker 3:          00:49:36       Yeah. And this pays off in tangible ways. There's been recent research that having a vacation that is actually a vacation, and this isn't even about vagabonding, this is about vacations is important for your creative mind. It's important for your brain that, um, having a cessation of obsessing on your creative life will allow your brain to work in ways that will give, that will make you more creative. So even if you go, if, if you traveled to Amsterdam or or Bangkok or, or the the Andes for a week and you're constantly attached to your smart phone, in some ways it could be less advantageous to the creative life of your business or your career. And if you just let go, because if you let go of that constant stream to the information, the micro managing, then your brain is working in the same that it was back home.

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       And part of the gifts of travel is your brain and your emotions and everything is working in a new way and your brain actually, that obsessive part of your brain is resting. But it's a, it's actually working in its own way and, and this is actually a scientific information the New York Times reported on in about a week ago that you actually come back if you can unplug, if you're going to actually immerse yourself in a new place and turn off that obsessive part of Your Business Brain, then you can come back and your mind will gift you with, with, with creative ideas and insights that it didn't have if you had spent your whole time in the Andes or Amsterdam or Bangkok obsessing on those very business issues. Definitely. I'm sorry you took, you took an inhale. You feel, it sounded like I interrupted you. W well, there's one more point I was going to make is that it's sort of, it's sort of, this ties into the idea of time, wealth, but sometimes these days, this new generation has a way of stealing time wealth.

Speaker 3:          00:51:23       Again, it's, it's not that new, I mean, Plato complained about that, that written literacy was ruining people's ability to memorize poetry. Right. Um, but now this technology is so, is so immersed in our lives that we can steal our own tongue wealth by, by being hooked into virtual experiences into our social media feeds instead of the experiences that are before us. Um, you used a great phrase, which is optimizing for efficiency and just think if you're going to sit down and do it in Italian meal in Italy, are you going to want to optimize that meal for efficiency? If you're going to hike for a week in, in, in the Andes and the Machu Picchu reason, are you going to want to make sure that that hike is optimized for efficiency if you're going to be sitting on a beach, you know, in, in, in Thailand or Brazil, or are you going to want to optimize that, um, experience for efficiency.

Speaker 3:          00:52:11       I think that that Italian meal metaphor can apply to so much of travel that of course you don't want to make it more efficient. You want to savor every bit of it. You want to be you. We want to be, you know, eating tomatoes that were in the ground two nights before. And, and having just these very sensual, tactile experiences, not just in not just food experiences, but just ideas of the unexpected, of, of unplugging yourself from the life that you can predict the life that you could consume and buy and stumbling into experiences that catch you by complete surprise. And I don't want to overuse the idea, uh, the word super serendipity, but it's something that is at risk when we can unplug. And, and the gifts of serendipity, um, are not just, you know, actually you can stumble into a bad experience is as easily as you can stumble into a good experience.

Speaker 3:          00:53:04       But it's, it's, it's admissive ventures or the unexpected good experiences that actually change you, you know, to, to the core of your being in a way that those preplanned experiences don't. And so if you can't unplug, you're robbing yourself of that aspect of your time wealth. You're, you're making Tito extend this metaphor. You're making optimized efficiency out of, at an Italian meal, every sense of the word. Um, and it's hard to break away from. But in the vagabonding sense, it's essential. You're, you know, you're going to be selling yourself short if you can, if you can't stop micromanaging and optimizing for efficiency. And the more you think about those phrases in the context of the best parts of travel, um, the, the more you realize that you really have to throw, you know, the jargon, the efficiency jargon of daily life out the window and just throw yourself open to the travel experience.

Speaker 2:          00:53:57       Definitely. And what you, just, one thing that I think about a lot and part of my motivation for traveling oftentimes, and you don't have to travel a over overseas to achieve this, but I find the, the, the change of scenery to be very helpful for resetting, um, is to focus on appreciation as opposed to achievement. And I'm, I'm very type A, always have been and it's competitive. Uh, and then those can sometimes really reinforce themselves in, uh, in good but often destructive ways. And, uh, when I go abroad, I think food is a fantastic lens, actually use, not, not just metaphorically, but to really focus on slow, long meals is, I think one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself. And that was one of the, one of the experiences that I brought back after my, my nine months in Argentina, which was supposed to be four weeks.

Speaker 2:          00:54:55       As these things often turn out, um, with, with the really long dinners, you know, a couple of bottles, wine, a bunch of friends, of course they have the Benicia and the incredible meets of, of Argentina. But, uh, putting aside the fact that they're famous in South America for being unproductive, uh, putting that aside, uh, the, the long meals, uh, with, with larger groups of friends was something that I brought back with me to the u s and that I try to do at least once a week or once every two weeks. Uh, the, the other observation I wanted to make for folks because I really was, well, no forget, was I think once, once a computer addict, always a computer addict just to kind of borrow from Aa and once an addict, always an addict. And you have to manage that. And I think one of the easiest ways to manage that is to not rely on self discipline.

Speaker 2:          00:55:48       What I mean by that is when I took my, my trip, uh, in 2004, which, which some people know, began with a one way ticket to London and no planned itinerary, no plan return date. Uh, I didn't take my laptop. I did and I knew I, I couldn't take my laptop because I would default to using it. And what that meant was at the time, and there are many different ways to do this now, but I had go to my PC, installed on a computer at home, and if I wanted to use my laptop so to speak, I would have to go into an Internet cafe at which, which is not generally one of my favorite experiences. It's pretty deep. They're usually dingy eight. It's just not an experience I enjoy, which is entirely the point. I want it to make it inconvenient and unpleasant to engage in a sort of masturbatory, a computer use, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:56:45       And uh, and uh, I think that it's, it's very easy to default to that because you can always find something on the Internet, right? Whether it's, and you could very easily go to Morocco and then end up sitting on your laptop watching the stupidest cat videos on youtube for hours a day. The hate, because that's what the Internet optimizes for. It optimizes for clicks and views and everything else that can be commercialized generally speaking. So, you know, don't even enter, don't walk through the door if you don't want that to happen. Um, so when, when possible, sort of change your environment and remove things that facilitate bad behavior as opposed to trying to rely on willpower, which I think is very, very fallible. Uh, the, uh, you mentioned creativity. And I wanted to, to ask you about that because I really, really enjoy your writing. Uh, and I, and I don't say that lightly, uh, not that I'm the ultimate connoisseur in writing, but I think that a lot of writing is very, very bad. And I, I, uh, I, I've, I've loved your writing and enjoyed it for a very long time. Thanks. Of course. Yeah, it's, it's had a huge impact on my thinking and not, not moreover my actual behavior and way of living. So the, I want to talk about the, the concept of a staycation. Uh, are there times, uh, for, for, uh, creativity and let's just say you use writing as an example. Uh, do you find that you can replicate some of the benefits of travel in what people might refer to as a staycation?

Speaker 3:          00:58:25       Yes. Yeah. And this goes back to something that, that we were talking much earlier, um, in the conversation about decluttering emotionally. You, you talked about the idea of a, I think he used the word portfolio to describe something. Um, but I think, I think vagabonding uh, the principles of vagabonding apply to life in non travel ways. Um, and it, it's, it's been used as a text and social studies class and it's sort of about another, tying into something else you were talking about earlier, you were talking about something that's sort of constitutes what some people call it, the beginner's mind, which is part of the excitement of traffic definitely is that we get stuck into being experts and the, and, and online resources allow us to be sort of Dillard, [inaudible] experts in everything. You know, we can, we can suddenly know a little bit about everything when in fact the beginner's mind is, is, is one of the most daunting and exciting parts of travel where you just allow yourself to be a child again.

Speaker 3:          00:59:26       And in fact, I have some quotes in vagabonding talking about how you go to a new city and you're as dumb as a five year old, you know, you can hardly read. You know, you don't know why it's dangerous to cross the street. You know, that this is a gift, a of travel is that it allows you to, to have the vulnerability of being very young, but also the excitement of very being very young and the discovery of being very young. And sometimes for all of the research you do back home, the coolest part of showing up in, in Bangkok or websites or, or, you know, Cape Town is just smelling the place, you know, or, or, um, or going in and into, not into a tourist place, but into a supermarket and realizing how different everything is. And it's, it's that beginner's mind. It's, if that wonder of childhood stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:00:15       Um, and that can become a, it can turn into a cheesy metaphor, but it's a real thing. It's the, it's the beginner's mind that allows you to engage in a new way. And so I think that ties into the idea of creativity and the staycation, which is a silly word for, for what is a great idea, which is taking that beginner's mind, taking that travel mindset, which I talked about at the end of vagabonding, the idea of coming home and treating your neighbors as exotic tribesmen back home. And one thing, and actually one thing I'd love to talk to you about is the idea of appreciation versus achievement, because there's limits to achievement. I mean, you've been, it's been four hour work week, came out with seven, 2007 yeah, seven years ago. And I think there's, you know, there's an extent to which that ongoing success can be as meaningless as ongoing lack of success, and that you have to have a relationship with that to realize that appreciation becomes more important than achievement because there comes a point at which that you've achieved your goals and now what, you know, definitely.

Speaker 3:          01:01:22       Um, and so I think achievement is a linear way of thinking, which is very American and important. And I'm a big believer in that. But appreciation is that more eastern circular way of thinking, of being able to save or what you do have and balancing that with your achievements and, and so, so that goes back and ties into the creativity, the idea of coming back home. And I own a house on 30 acres of land in Kansas and that, that's no accident. I'm close to my family, but it's also really, really cheap. And instead of letting it in a fashionable part of a big city, I can, I mean, what's happening right now as an example of it, I'm doing a, I'm going to go live in Brooklyn for a week and, and, and do a little home exchange. And I have the option of living in, um, for short periods of time, anywhere while at the same time saving money and really building a relationship to a place which is my quiet 30 acres in a sparsely populated part of north central Kansas. And I am extraordinarily creative there. Um, not just because it's quiet, but because I can have sort of a quieter sense of discovery, sort of a walking space, neighbors pay sense of discovery, uh, in the place where I live. Um, Eh, this is another one of those silver bullet things you were talking about. Um, how you enjoyed my writing. Um, and it is so tortured sometimes to write well,

Speaker 2:          01:02:41       you know, that you're very familiar,

Speaker 3:          01:02:44       beautiful, smooth reading, logical, inspirational paragraph with pros is the process of a day of labor and self-loathing. So I just, because I have this wonderful place to write and, and uh, that I, that my increased creativity is enhanced by, by marrying my travel mindset to my home. Doesn't mean that I just am sitting at my desk laughing and glee with my glass of wine writing brilliant per pros. Um, it doesn't get easier, you know, I guess it, it enables that creative pro enables that tortured process to be fruitful, um, in a way that, that perhaps it wouldn't have been otherwise. I don't know. I don't know. I know that you have a very, Annie Dillard said that his schedule is a net for catching days. And I think that you, you're a believer in being very disciplined about having a writing schedule. I'm not very disciplined, but somehow it works anyway.

Speaker 2:          01:03:42       Well, just, just because I'm a believer doesn't mean that my fantastic practitioner. Right? But, uh, I think for folks who are wondering what it's like to be a writer for most people, now I should maybe caveat that with the observation that I ha I have extreme jealousy slash anger sometimes towards extremely good journalists who have daily or weekly deadlines because, um, many of them, uh, to my, to my great upset, uh, disagree that writer's block even exists. And the say, I don't have the luxury of writer's block. I need to kick out 1500 words a day and they're exceptionally good at it. And it's just infuriating because my experience with writing is number one, it has not gotten easier. Uh, generally people ask me like, oh, well after the third book, you know, it must just get easier to use. I'm like, actually, it just gets harder and harder because I have to, I feel like I have to ensure that I'm not repeating myself.

Speaker 2:          01:04:41       Uh, but the, uh, the, the, the most accurate sort of portrayal of my experience of writing is a adaptation. And Oh my God. And uh, and uh, I actually, I think Nicholas cage is amazing in it. Um, but, uh, the movie, the movie is weird. I, I read the screenplay first, but just the idea that you sit down, you're like, okay, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. And you're like, no, God, I should really wash my face. You know, like, I should just, she did a donut. I need to relax before I start writing to all of these, like, you will at least I, you know, I'm rand, I can't, I can never really, I don't know if it's iron or, and, but anyway, let's just say I'm Ren, uh, had a book called how to write, I think it was, how to write nonfiction.

Speaker 2:          01:05:24       And there was a portion called the white tennis shoes. And I remember the white tennis shoes is a refers to the fact that if you sit down to write and there's a pair of white tennis shoes with a little blemish on it, you will, you will convince yourself that you need to, you need to clean those shoes before you, right. And that a writer will do anything to avoid writing. Uh, so that's, that's my general experience. I feel like a, a, a schedule or at least a plan helps too. Even if you don't fulfill that plan. For me it's, it's done. I think this is actually a Winston Churchill quote where he said that, uh, in effect, you know, a plan is important, not because you're going to follow the plan, but for the planning itself. And I find that having a plan for writing decreases my anxiety associated with writing, which helps me to write, even if I don't execute that plan perfectly. Um, but, uh, what did, what did, what is your writing process like? And I have a, you know, some, some additional questions about travel of course, but, uh, and vagabonding I should say rather. But what, what does your writing process look like? When do you typically sit down to write and why?

Speaker 3:          01:06:37       Uh, well, it's funny that you mentioned, uh, the Nicholas cage character, character and adaptation as something you can relate to because that's like the least glamorous depiction of a writer, you know, and you're, you're going to compromise people's romantic conception of you as a writer. And, and, and, and my process is, is possibly even worse, I think, because, I don't know, I think in, I, there's, there's different neuroses attributed to writer and, and mine, um, is maybe a little bit obsessive compulsive that sometimes I could be the guy who writes two hours before breakfast every day. And sometimes I am, but sometimes I'm the guy who writes for 14 hours. Um, and, and is, is it most fruitful at our 13? Uh, and so, you know, my, if I wrote a writer's handbook and I teach writing and I try to instill discipline and ideas of discipline in my students, cause that's important because people can over romanticize writing and think about the muse visiting them. And in fact, you need to be the one who creates this. But in practice, I'm, I'm sort of a bad example that there's some days we're all just sort of be just frustrated with myself. I'll have my spot on the white shoes problem. I actually bought the freedom APP. Do you know the freedom APP that turns off the Internet connect?

Speaker 2:          01:07:53       Oh, the freedom APP. I thought you said the freedom map. I was very excited. Yes. No, the freedom APP is cool. I agree.

Speaker 3:          01:07:58       Yeah. Uh, and it's just one of those things where despite my good intentions sometimes, uh, you know, my, my, my monkey brain goes back to the Internet and I just have to be my own mother and discipline myself. Um, I wrote a, um, in 12 days earlier this month. Wow. And so that's an example of, it was really, it was sort of a [inaudible] movie screen play that I did for fun, just because I had this idea. And, um, I, I, I would compromise my happiness if I didn't suddenly write this movie that was about design, be zombies and giant dinosaur attacks. Um, and I think that was almost part of resting certain parts of my intellectual brain. And it was just delightful to write a really Popey story. But it was interesting. It's like I keep teaching myself lessons when I wrote something low stake when I wrote a B movie, uh, you know, uh, a monster movie earlier this month. Um, it gave me such an interesting creative perspective on mine, on my own processes and the importance of just getting work out there, um, that I was, I was able to write 90 pages in 12 days, where as sometimes I can be torture portrait over a 1500 word article. So I think there's something, you know, worthy and the idea of, you know, Anne Lamott's idea of shitty first drafts of getting the word, the words on the page. Kurt Vonnegut said that there's two types of writers. There's supers in bachelor's, a Superbowl.

Speaker 2:          01:09:23       I'm so glad you're bringing this up. Yeah. Please go into this. You're familiar with the concept, but I want you to, I want you to explain it cause this is so key.

Speaker 3:          01:09:31       Yeah. Uh, well supers tend to be people who will blast through their first draft and then they'll spend days, if not weeks, working on draft number two and number 13 and number 67 until they get it right. Whereas bashers, um, they go sentence by sentence, um, and by the time page one has done then paid, then paragraph one has been written, rewritten 10 times. And by the time they finish what they're working on, be it 1500 words or 30,000 words, it's pretty much done. They're not going to do a whole lot of rewrites, but that process has taken, you know, 20 times as long as a super we'll take, and these are both legitimate creative, um, uh, methods and, and he suggests that maybe women tend to be sweepers and men tend to be bashers. And that might be statistically true. But I've met, you know, a male supers and, and female bashers. Um, and they're both creative ways. I am a basher through

Speaker 2:          01:10:30       true. I am as well. And I think, I think of the two, I've never been a super, so I don't know how it feels, but I have to imagine that being a basher, it's just the most torturous process of self loathing and doubt. I just, I, it's because there are days, I don't know if you've experienced this, but it'd be like, okay, great, I'm going to try to knock out whatever it is, a few pages and I will just agonize over the first two paragraphs for in an hour. It's, it's so god, it's just like gives me anxiety even thinking about it. But yeah. Anyway, I apologize. Is this is serving as a therapy session for me?

Speaker 3:          01:11:07       Oh, no, it's, it's actually an, and hopefully people in our audience getting can take hardiness, but it's the exact same situation that the last third of a story or even a book is the easiest to write because I have the first two thirds to show that I'm not a complete incompetent, you know, and that I have, I in my office, I have different, you know, writing awards and articles about myself to sort of remind me that I'm not a completing competent, but would that blank page that the generations of writers have talked about is a real kind of anxiety. Um, and, and getting started. And I have a, I have a really bad combination, which is that I'm a basher, but I'm also an optimist. And I, and I think that if I completely gave way to self loathing and pessimism that I would just throw something horrible out and then, and then I would have something. Um, but I'm just, I just have this blank page anxiety coupled with, with the optimism that I, that I, that I, I think I can do good. It just makes it that much harder to get started because I'm a, I just can't, I know that something is going to be good, but for some reason that first step is somehow at odds with, with, with my optimism. So it's, it's a weird thing and I, and I'm actually relieved to hear that you, um, struggle with the same thing.

Speaker 2:          01:12:24       Oh yes. Struggles I think are very, uh, generous light words, especially when we were both successful authors. So I think that there's something, know, hopefully people take, take some solace in that. Uh, the, uh, I think, I think matters are not helped by the fact that I've, I've tried for years to change my writing schedule so that I get good synthesis. Um, I tend to differentiate between research and, and synthesis or gathering up all of my material and then putting it into prose. Uh, it doesn't help matters that I've tried to become a morning writer and I have friends who do this for the wake up really early and they kick out good pros in the morning. I've never been good at it. So I tend to get started in the middle of the night when it's pitch black outside. And so I have those moments of acute anxiety. It's just I might as well be in solitary confinement in a, you know, in a basement. Um, so I, that probably doesn't help my psychological state much, but who knows, maybe some good has come of it. Uh, the, what are you, what are some of your favorite books or articles on writing itself? Uh, or just commentary. These could be authors who've written about it, but I'm just, uh, I'm looking for her for things myself quite frankly. Uh, to read it, you mentioned Anne Lamont. I think bird by bird is a fantastic book. Uh, but what, what uh, what are some of your favorite books or commentaries on writing?

Speaker 3:          01:13:58       Uh, what is this funny? Because I, I teach writing in various,
