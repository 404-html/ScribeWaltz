Speaker 1:          02:50          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:52          Hello, this is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job normally to deconstruct world class performers through interviews, whether they're from business, sports, entertainment, military, otherwise to tease out the habits, routines, favorite books and so on that you can use. In this episode, I'm going to let someone else do the heavy lifting and he's very, very qualified. Reid Hoffman on linkedin and Twitter as Reid Hoffman. Rei is a frequent flyer of sorts on this show. He is often referred to as the oracle of Silicon Valley by tech insiders who look at his company building and investing track record with all the companies include Facebook, Airbnb, Zynga, flicker, and many, many, many others. Read is well known as the CO founder of Linkedin, which has more than 300 million users and sold to Microsoft for 26 point $2 billion. Prior to that, he was exec vice president at paypal, which was purchased by Ebay for 1.5 billion.

Speaker 2:          03:55          And at paypal he was nicknamed firefighter in chief by the then CEO Peter Teal, who's also been on the podcast and read is widely considered one of the most successful angel investors of the past decade. He's now a partner at Greylock partners, a top tier venture capital firm. And on my phone there are very few podcasts that I listened to multiple times. There are very few podcasts that I recommend over and over and over again to other people, especially entrepreneurs. And what I'm going to showcase in this episode is a conversation between read and uh, Brian Chesky who is a cofounder and CEO of Airbnb. And there are a couple of other cameos and I'm doing this for a number of reasons. Number one, if you want to learn how to scale your company from whatever the number might be, 200 million, 200 million users, uh, paradoxically you can increase the likelihood of success by doing things that do not scale.

Speaker 2:          05:00          And this is a really critical concept to understand and it's best done through examples and that is why I want to showcase this discussion, which is from the first season of masters of scale and I really, really hope you enjoy it. Uh, I loved it and Joe Gebbia, cofounder of Airbnb has been on this podcast before and we covered his development as a designer and an entrepreneur leading up to the original development of the business model for Airbnb. That was part one and I promised a part two. So this is in some ways that part too. Exactly. And a masters scale is a great show. If you haven't seen it, it, uh, showcases famous founders and innovative leaders and so on, sharing their lessons for success. And there is a brand new season out right now. The new season includes episodes with of Spotify,

Speaker 3:          05:58          Instagram, taskrabbit's, shake shack, and glossier among many, many others. You can subscribe to master the skill on apple podcasts or learn more@mastersofscale.com so without further ado, please enjoy this short episode with Reid Hoffman, Brian Chesky and many others. And if you've heard me recommend 1000 true fans to you many, many times before as the article you should read. If you're only going to read one article on marketing, which is by Kevin Kelly, you can find it on kk.org this is the audio compliment to that. So with much further ado, much further ado, what much further ado, please enjoy. Joe and I are broke. We're losing weight and I didn't have a lot of weight to lose. You know those binders that you put baseball cards and we've a credit card to them at this point. I am $25,000 in credit card debt. Joe's tens of thousands dollars in credit card debt. So this is like make or break. We need a lifeline

Speaker 4:          07:02          that entrepreneur and need of a lifeline. That's Brian Chesky, cofounder and CEO of Airbnb. A service that lets you rent a couch for the night or a cabin or a castle. Today AIRBNB is valued at $30 billion. Eight years ago, a very different picture.

Speaker 3:          07:24          We had this website and maybe 50 people a day are visiting it and we're probably getting like 10 to 20 bookings a day. So, and by the way, didn't work out for a year and a half. So for anyone who's worried your company as an attraction, that was our traction. It was 2008 and election year in the United States. Barack Obama was running against John Mccain. You needed the tax code that Brian was, that the Democratic national convention hatching a PR campaign for Airbnb when they could rescue the company and their credit card bills. Joe and I look at each other and we said, we're air bed and breakfast. Air Beds aren't going so well. Maybe breakfast. We'll as we thought, what if we could sell breakfast? Maybe we can make some money. What's a nonperishable breakfast cereal? And so we thought the presidential campaigns coming up, we just launched at the DNC. What if we created a Barack Obama themed breakfast cereal?

Speaker 3:          08:13          We thought, what would it, Barack Obama themed breakfast, he'll be called Obama o's, like Cheerios, the breakfast of change. We thought, well, we want to be a nonpartisan website, so we'd also have to need a John Mccain themed cereal and that's a no brainer. John Mccain was a captain, the navy, and so we came up with Captain Mccain's like captain crunch, a maverick in every bite. We ended up making a thousand boxes of collectible breakfast cereal. We sold them for $40 a box. That's $40,000 not bad for pocket change and it got them through a cash crunch, but it came at a cost. We had to physically make the breakfast show ourselves, meaning we get a printed poster board and we had to fold it and hot glue it. No one told me I had Haku breakfast here and they should call it burn glue because every time you get on you, you burn. You and I had the perfect one to one ratio of burned a box and so I literally had to hot glue 1000 bucks a sterile at one point in the middle of the night. I remember meeting, I wonder if when Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, he had the hot glue breakfast cereal.

Speaker 4:          09:16          The answer was no, and this was not a good sign, but what was a good sign was Brian's willingness to work with his hands, Burns and all. I'd argue that painstaking handcrafted Labor is actually the foundation of his success. In order to scale, you have to do things right

Speaker 3:          09:31          that don't scale. You got to have incredible talent at every position there are fires burning when you're going out

Speaker 5:          09:41          such an idiot and when you go back to this is totally going to be amazing. There are so many easy ways to do. I have no idea what it is. Sorry we made a mistake, but you have to time it, right? Nepal, 10 years later, I can say you do it. Just do it.

Speaker 4:          10:04          This is masters of scale.

Speaker 5:          10:07          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          10:07          I'm Reid Hoffman, Co, founder of Linkedin partner Graylog and your host. On this episode, I'll make the case that the only way an organization can truly scale is the first two things that don't scale at all. I'll try to prove that theory through stories from some of the smartest entrepreneurs I know over the last 20 years I've worked on or invest in in many companies that scale to 100 million users or more. But here's the thing, you don't start with 100 million users. You start with a few, so stop thinking big and start thinking small hand serve your customers, win them over one by one. Now, this may sound like odd advice if you're an entrepreneur with global ambitions. Mark Zuckerberg didn't personally invite 1.8 billion people to Facebook. He built a great product and the users just poured in, right? Not exactly on this show. I'll dispel that myth by talking to founders who fought to win their users.

Speaker 4:          11:02          I'm starting with Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb because he epitomizes the idea of handcrafting the user experience before you start to scale. It's a principal. He first absorbed in design school. I was doing medical design ones. I designed a children's ventilator. I had to sit in the shoes, the child and so I had to like imagine being a child, get in like the operating table and like you have to put yourself in the shoes of the patient where the person using your product and if you're only doing ab tests like you're never designing with empathy. But a funny thing happened to Brian when he moved to silicon valley, he sort of forgot about designing with empathy for a single user. It's a common mistake amongst entrepreneurs with global ambitions. They have to promise investors the world, tens of millions of customers, billions in revenue. It's intoxicating. Just listen to Brian Go. This is a travel industry

Speaker 3:          11:54          that is something like 7% of global GDP, somewhere between five and $7 trillion 10 times the market size of Google's market size and Brian might've stayed in the stratosphere if not for a fateful meeting with Paul Graham Co founder of y Combinator. Y Combinator is a startup incubator which cultivates and invests in early stage companies. Brian was admitted to y Combinator in 2009 and his first meeting with Paul was confounding. Paul tends to stump people with deceptively simple question and he asked us, where's your business? And I go, what do you mean? Like where's the traction? I go, well, we don't have a lot of traction. He goes, well, people must be using it. I said, there's a few people in New York using it and you've said something I'll never forget. He said, sue sewer, your users are in New York and you're still in mountain view. I said, yeah.

Speaker 3:          12:40          He said, what are you still doing here? And I go, what do you mean? He said, go to your users, get to know them, get your customers one by one. And I said, what? That won't scale before. Hugely millions of customers. We can't meet every customer. And he said, that's exactly why you should do it now because this is the only time you'll ever be small enough that you can meet all your customers, get to know them and make something directly for them. Brian and his cofounders followed his advice to the letter. We literally community in Newark from mountain view. So we would be in why com era for a, was it Tuesday night dinners and then Wednesday Joe and I would go to New York. We literally would knock on the doors of all of our hosts and we had their addresses and we say, knock, knock, hello.

Speaker 3:          13:17          Hey, this is Brian. Joe were founders who just want to meet you. It's a little creepy just to knock on the door on announced. We need to excuse it, like in their home. So they came up with an offer that the host couldn't refuse. We'd send a professional photographer to your home and photograph your home. Of course, we didn't have any money and we couldn't have played photographers. So Joe and I, we'd show up at their door and they're like, wow, this company is pretty small. These home visits became AIRBNB's secret weapon. It's how they learned what people loved. It's really hard to get even 10 people to love anything, but it's not hard if you spend a ton of time with them. So if I want to make something amazing, I just spend time with you. And I'm like, well what if I did this?

Speaker 3:          13:55          What if I did this? What if I did this from those questions? A handcrafted experience is born. We'd find out, hey, I don't feel comfortable the guests, I don't know who they are. Well, what if we had a profiles? Great. Well what do you want your profile? But I want a photo. Great, what else? I want to know where they work, where they went to school. Okay, so you add that stuff and then you literally start designing touchpoint by touchpoint. The creation of the peer review system, customer support. All of these things came from us. Literally. We didn't just meet our users, we live with them. And I used to joke that when you bought an iPhone, Steve Jobs didn't come sleep on your couch. But I did. Yes. Was there a particular experience that has really stuck in your mind? I remember we met with a couple of hosts and it's winter, it's snowing outside and we're like in snow boots and we walk up to the apartment and we went there to photograph the homes and we're like, Hey, I'll upload your photos to the website. Um, do you have any other feedback? And he comes back a book binder

Speaker 4:          14:52          and he's got like dozens of pages of notes and he ends up creating like a product roadmap for us. Like we should have this, this, this, this, this. And we're like, oh my God, this is our roadmap because he's the customer. And I think that always stuck in our mind as the roadmap often exists in the minds of the users you're designing things for. And it's typical to get very detailed feedback from some of your early users. And if you're not getting some people who say, this is super important to me, I love this. I really need this to work well. It usually means you're off track. Passionate feedback is a clue that your product really matters to someone and one passionate user can turn into many. If you listen to them carefully, it's essential to get this kind of feedback early while you're still defining the product.

Speaker 4:          15:39          It's like setting a foundation. As an architect, you wouldn't build a skyscraper before. You've built a solid foundation user feedback and sure as you won't build a dozen floors on an unstable swamp. Brian is a simple method for extracting detailed feedback from users. He doesn't ask what the product he already built. He asks about the product of the dreams. We'd ask these questions like, what can we do as surprise you? Like what could we do not to make this better, but they make you tell everyone about it and the answer is different. If I say, what can I do to make this better? That they'll say something small. If I were to say read, what would it take for me to design something that you would literally tell every single person you've ever encountered and you start to ask these questions and it really helps you think through this problem.

Speaker 4:          16:20          It's essential to seek out and listen to user feedback, but the caveat is you have to figure out which users to listen to. You're going to have different kinds of users giving you feedback and some of it will take you in the wrong direction. So you need to exercise judgment and discerning, well, this particular user and particular feedback lead me to the mass market, or is it an edge case? For example, at Linkedin we had one group of users who invent a name for themselves. They call themselves lions, which is linkedin open networkers because their theory of the world was that everyone wants to directly connect to everyone else in the world because that's the way they wanted it, but they're actually not the majority case. A lot of people who are very busy, how have access resources who have some celebrity status do not want that. And if we've followed their feedback, linkedin would not be where it is today. We had to steer away from a bunch of passionate users who told us very explicitly that we were fools for not following their advice.

Speaker 3:          17:19          If you want to build something that's truly viral, you have to create a total like experience that you tell everyone about. And so we basically took one part of our product and we extrapolated what would a five star experience be? And we went crazy. So a one, two or three star experience is you get to airbnb and no one's there. So you knock on the door, they don't open. That's the one star, you know, and maybe it's a three star. If they don't open, you had to wait 20 minutes and if they never show up and you're pissed and you to get her money back, that's one star you never union says again. So a five star experience is you knock on the door, they open the door, they let you in. Great. That's not a big deal. You're not going to tell every friend about it.

Speaker 3:          17:58          You might say, I used Airbnb, it worked. So we thought, what would a six star experience be? A six star experience. Knock on the door. The host opens. Hey, I'm reed, welcome to my house. You're the host in this case. And you would show them around and on the table would be a welcome gift. You would be a bottle of wine, maybe some candy, you'd open the fridge, there's water, you go to the bathroom, this toiletries and the whole thing is great. That's a six star experience. And you'd say, wow, I love this more than a hotel. I'm definitely gonna use airbnb again. It worked better than I expected. What's a seven star experience? Knock on the door. Reid Hoffman opened. Get in, welcome. Here's by full kitchen. I know you like surfing, there's a surf board waiting for you. I booked lessons for you. It's going to be an amazing experience.

Speaker 3:          18:47          And by the way, here's my car. If you can use my car and um, you know, I also want to surprise you, but I got you. This is best restaurant in the city of San Francisco. I got you a table there and you're like, whoa. Like this is way beyond adding stars clearly excites Brian. It took some time to run through this mental exercise. We'll skip ahead to the 10 star experience. So would a 10 star check and be a chance. Our check in would be the Beatles checkin in 1964 I get off the plane and they'd be 5,000 high school kids cheering my name with cars, welcoming me to the country. I get to the front yard of your house and they'd be a press conference for me and I would be just a mind experience. So what would 11 star experience be? I would show up the airport and you'd be there with Elon Musk and you're saying you're going to space the point of the processes that maybe nine 10 11 are not feasible. But if you go through the crazy exercise of keep going, there's some sweet spot between, they showed up in the open the door and I went to space. That's the sweet spot and you have to almost design the extreme to come backwards suddenly doesn't just like having like knowing my preferences and having a Surf Board in the house seem like not crazy and reasonable. It's actually kind of crazy logistically, but this is the kind of stuff that creates great experience.

Speaker 6:          20:06          How far do you go toward the 11 star experience to create the Nirvana product? All successful entrepreneurs at some point have to come back down to earth. There's really two stages of a startup's product. The first design, a perfect experience, and then you scale that experience and that's it. But which part of the perfect experience do you scale? So the most ambitious entrepreneurs, let's call them the Elan's, after my friend Elon Musk probably get there through raw energy because they're convinced they need to solve a problem. And the unscalable thing is one step that they have to push through on the way the Elan say, I'm going to Mars, but first I've got to solve this problem right in front of me first. I need to get that rocket and I need to have a business model for that. First rocket and that looks like satellites.

Speaker 6:          20:51          Okay, I'm going to try satellite launches and how do I get my first rocket? I need to create a scalable rocket platform. But unless they get the first rocket up, it doesn't matter. And you kind of work back to that. Then you've got folks like Brian who say, I realize that to get this awesome experience, I have to ratchet back to something that still seems like magic, but it's totally doable. And then I need to design the elements that get me into the totally doable thing. So how does Brian decide on the doable thing? He settled on a service with the appropriate level of magic and started building it. And here's the next thing to notice. They didn't launch perfectly scaled services. They built everything by hand. We had

Speaker 3:          21:31          saying that you would do everything by hand tools painful. So Joe and I would photograph home sells painful. Then we get up at arbors that we manage them with spreadsheets til it's painful. Then we've got an intern.

Speaker 7:          21:39          I don't think I knew how anything would grow to the level that it did.

Speaker 6:          21:44          That's Ellie feel. She's the intern who manage those spreadsheets. She still works at Airbnb

Speaker 7:          21:49          very manually. I would email the photographer and the host and connect to them and the photographer would then send me the photos. Um, I would go through each one giving feedback if they needed to be retouched, and then I would manually upload them to the hosts website. They're listing one by one. It would take hours to upload. Multitasking was the name of the game,

Speaker 3:          22:14          and then we automate the tools to make her more efficient.

Speaker 7:          22:17          And we kind of looked at this and we said, okay, what is the easiest thing that we can automate? Any little thing that changed was, you know, quite a shift in what I had been doing, but for the better. And I remember one day Brian would come to me at the end of every day, how many did we get, how many photos were shot? And it was like, oh gosh, I have to go through and count all of these.

Speaker 3:          22:39          And then eventually a system does everything. We built a system where now with the host comes, you press a button, it alerts our system, which goes to a dispatcher, photographers. It's all managed through our technology. They get the job, they mark it through an app that we built and then payment happens. The whole thing is automated. Now

Speaker 6:          22:55          note how they gradually worked out a solution they didn't guess at what users wanted. They reacted to what users asked for and then they met the demand through a piecemeal process. And here we come to the true art of doing things that don't scale. It's not just a crude way of succeeding on a shoe string budget. It also gives your team inspiration and urgency to build the features that users really want. I've seen this handcrafting story play out over and over again with entrepreneurs. Take my friend Patrick Collison, he's the founding CEO, stripe and online payments company. Today, thousands of businesses use stripe to process payments from their online customers, but in the early days they were a scrappy startup and Patrick paid close attention to his users, very close attention. We had a chat room, uh, where we would just help customers both whatever issue that they wanted to ask about.

Speaker 6:          23:48          And we were very distressed if for a while to notice that occasionally it would come into the chat room, Holger of sleeping and ask a question, you know, they wouldn't get any response. And so we wrote a Bot, they were just page one of us. If somebody asks a question, they didn't get a response after more than 30 seconds or something and someone would kind of groggily bleary eyed, wake up and like help imagine and get back to sleep. So in addition to being CEO, Patrick had become stripe's bleary eyed customer service rep, frustrated users would page him at all hours. It sure did not feel glamorous. You just tapping away on my laptop for half an hour in beds. Actually that reminds me, I don't know if you know Paul English who founded Kayak. Kayak is an online travel service that finds the lowest available rates across different websites.

Speaker 6:          24:29          We noticed a little bit. Yeah. Paul, um, for a number of years and Kayak had his cell phone number as the customer service number. W we also had one of our, uh, there's some of that stripe two who did exactly the same thing. Now it's common for entrepreneurs to swap stories like this and they think it's worth dwelling on these early days of handcrafted work because most entrepreneurs tend to have a funny reaction to these experiences. They may laugh about it later. They may call the work unglamorous. They may celebrate the day. They could hire a helping hand or automate these chores out of existence. But thoughtful founders will never say what a complete waste of time. They'll often look back on this period as one of the most creative phases of their careers. Nancy Lublin, for instance, scrappily launched an international nonprofit from our New York City apartment. Her Organization dress for success started as a clothing drive for women who needed to walk into a job interview looking sharp and feeling confident. Nancy stockpiled sweaters on her bed and jewelry and refrigerator. And soon she was inviting volunteers into our apartment for informal training sessions.

Speaker 3:          25:35          So people start hearing about dress for success and would contact me. Just random people would contact me and say, I want to start this in St Louis. I want to start this in Hartford and I would say, great, you want to come stay with me? People literally strangers would fly from St Louis and stay on my Futon, my college futon in my tiny like law school apartment in New York and I'd be like, how can I help? And I would send them postcards like saying like, don't give up. I know it's really hard. You got this and I just killed them with kindness.

Speaker 6:          26:01          Today dress for success has affiliates and 145 cities worldwide. But let's be clear, the transition from the handcrafted phase to the massive scale phase is a challenging one and I wanted to spell any illusions that you can switch from one to the other with ease. In fact, it requires two opposing mindsets. You have to fully empathize with a single user at the same time you have to worry about everyone. I like the way that Brian describes the difference.

Speaker 3:          26:27          The designing of experience is a different part of your brain. Then the skilling, your spirits. It's a different skill set. The scale and experience is a highly analytical operations oriented nick tology oriented problem. The designing of the experience is a more intuition based human empathetic end to end experience.

Speaker 6:          26:43          One parallel might be writing and editing, so the hand crafted phase tends to be more like writing. It's a more inventive and creative process. Whereas the scaling phase tends to be more analytical. It's more like being an editor at that point. You tend to do more pruning. You realize, well, this whole thing is magical, but if we focus on this 20% we get 80% of the magic. So you prune you compact, you distill and you architect so can now run at a rocket ship rate. You're transitioning the product or service over to a scale organization that can now run it. The organization needs a simple plan with very few errors and very little improvisation. Now you might think the first step design, the ideal user experience drops away as soon as your product goes viral. Then comes the glamorous work of expanding a new countries and thinking about your strategy in the years ahead. Handcrafted work is essentially a kind of booster rocket that helps you get an orbit, but it's not the kind of rock and for the whole trajectory. It gets you out of the gravity well and after that get ready to slingshot around the world,

Speaker 3:          27:42          it became an international company. Then middle of 2011 we raised money. We were like this billion dollar evaluation company and then in summer 2011 a woman's home got trashed and then we had to go to the next step, which was we are just this little company department. But as far as the world's concerned, we have a giant office building. We better be grownups. So we had to build 24 seven support, had to have more secure payment instruments. We had to add a trust and safety team. We had to verify people's identity. We realize we have to get our money transmission licenses. So then there's this whole like administrative bureaucracy that gets added. Then 2012 we get to the point we are, we have like 50 a hundred employees. We have no executive team. There's no management. There's no like company meetings. There's no communication. So no one knows anything.

Speaker 3:          28:25          Look, literally nothing. I don't, I don't even know how we ran the company. And so I instituted some basic things like I have to have an executive team and then the lawsuits come in and you have to really sort it out. And unfortunately we're not regulate the federal level regularly at the city level. And every city is different and they're like, I see what you did in Paris, but here in New York were different. I see it to go city by city and you've got to hire those people to really triage and deal with all these issues. It's like a video game. You slay a dragon, you think you've completed the board game, and then you have the next level and all of a sudden the dragons get really big.

Speaker 6:          28:59          But when you're slaying dragons, it's hard to hold onto the handcrafted mindset still. I would argue that the sharpest founders never fully abandoned the mindset, no matter how big their company goes. And so the organization will start having antibodies against new handcrafted. Then it's a response that protects organizational efficiency. It says, look, this new thing, we can't get it to scale. It won't operationalize. It won't fit within our process. The reason the scaled companies have a hard time with is handcrafted process is all in the list of objections about why this won't work, why this shouldn't be integrated as part of the company. And so what you need to do as a founder is be extremely choiceful about which handcrafted you choose and how you protect it. Organizationally. You need to protect it because the natural reaction of the scale organization will be to kill it. He wanted to reinvent the industry again and he knew he had more to learn about the travel experience in order to do it.

Speaker 3:          29:57          So he turned to Hollywood for help. I often find that to reinvent an industry, you're not taking inspiration directly from that industry, that you need to look at orthogonal industries and for us, the orthogonal industry to travel with cinema and the best ships you've ever seen are the trips that characters and movies have and that we would provide that analogy in real life. And I actually literally hired a storyboard artist and Pixar and we had them storyboard the perfect airbnb experience. When we did that, we realized there was like this two hour movie and only 20 minutes we're in the home. There was all this like leading up to the home, getting the airport, going around, going to dinner, hanging out with friends out and about and be like, most of the trip was not in the home, but we realize that point we need to be in the end to end business of travel. So the same way that he did things that don't scale, we call them magical trips. We decided let's find one traveler and create the perfect trip for them.

Speaker 6:          30:52          Notice how quickly Brian turns his attention to a single traveler in an instant. He switches from global concerns back to is artisanal roots and that's because he's building something radically new here. He wants to scale the perfect trip, but what is the perfect trip? What are the essential ingredients that make a vacation truly memorable? It's a question that Brian can't even begin to answer until he delivers that experience to at least one person. You're about to get a masterclass in handcrafting.

Speaker 3:          31:25          So we put up these flyers as anonymously saying, seeking a traveler will photograph your trip to San Francisco if you let us follow you. This guy, Martin Ricardo replied, he was from London and we send a photographer around him while he was just traveling to San Francisco. What we learned was his trip was awful. Like he'd show up, he'd go to Alcatraz by himself, put on the headset and then you go to Bubba Gump shrimp. He'd stay in like, uh, like budget hotel. He'd go to a hotel bar by himself, like sitting like with a bunch of dudes at the bar and talk to anyone cause he's introverted. We call them back. You say, Ricardo, we want to create the perfect trip to San Francisco for you. You fly him back and we had the team storyboard, the perfect experience for Airbnb. We had a driver pick them up the airport and we took them to the perfect airbnb.

Speaker 3:          32:12          They're all these services. He went on these dinner parties, we got in the best seats at restaurant. We took them on as midnight mystery bike tour, like 60 riders go on it and nobody, but the leader knows what. We'll end up and it's just like there was this crazy, magical world. I see him at the end of the trip. I say, how was your trip? He says, it was amazing, and then I walk away, yells at me, Brian, one more thing and starts like crying and he breaks down a thank you. This is the best trip I've ever had. I was like, oh my God. I guess it kind of kind of worked like it really moved him because I don't think anyone ever tried to like design end to end experience or somebody like they're in a movie before and we did it. That became a blueprint and we said, we are confident on an unscalable basis that we know how to create a trip that deeply moves somebody is better than anything they've ever experienced. The question is, can we develop a technology scales and do 100 million times?

Speaker 6:          33:12          Notice here how quickly Brian Switches back to the analytic mindset. He can extrapolate from a single journey to a list of essential ingredients. Here's the systematic breakdown of the perfect trip.

Speaker 3:          33:24          When you first go to city, you need a welcome event within the first 24 48 hours. We are around people. When you land and you get acclimated to the neighborhood, that by day two or three, you need to have a challenge out of your comfort zone. If you do not leave your comfort zone, you do not remember the trip, okay? And if you can belong out of your comfort zone and something new happens to you, then there's going to be a moment of transformation where the person you were in a small way dies at a new, better version of yourself is reborn. Now, this is the narrative of every movie you've ever seen. A main character starts in the ordinary world. They leave their ordinary world, they cross the threshold to a new magical world where all these obstacles happen and the overcome something and they call it the hero's journey. And we applied this to trips, build a small team, and we spent the last couple of years figuring out how to scale this. And this has led to what we have today, which we call airbnb trips.

Speaker 6:          34:23          In November of 2016 Brian unveiled 500 ship packages in 12 cities and now he's fully in the scaling mindset, figuring out how to expand the service to new destinations. But as Brian will tell you, he misses the handcrafted work. Here's a surprising message for entrepreneurs who have only a handful of users to serve.

Speaker 3:          34:41          I kind of tell a lot entrepreneurs who don't have traction, I miss those times. I mean it, yes, it's exciting to have traction and have a super sense like companies like huge scale, but the biggest leaps you ever get as when you're small. And another way of saying it is your product changes less. The bigger you get because there's bigger, more customers, more below back, more systems, more legacy. The most innovative leaps you'll ever make often, especially for your network, are going to be when you're really, really small, you can change the protocol a whole entirely in a week. Try doing that at Linkedin or airbnb today, that'd be a huge disaster. So I think taking advantage of that subscale, designing the perfect experience, asking yourself what you could do is amazing. And if you have a teeny startup,

Speaker 6:          35:23          good news for you now is the moment you can take the most daring leaps to your career. Dream big and act small. Pay Passionate attention to your users, handcraft the core service for them, create magical experience

Speaker 4:          35:38          and then figure out what part of that magical handcrafted thing can scale. I'm Reid Hoffman. Thank you for listening. Masters of scale is a wait. What original?
