Speaker 2:          00:03:56       Hello Ladies and gentlemen, this is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. More specifically another edition of the Tim Ferriss radio hour where I go back through the 300 plus guests who've been on this show. Think about the conversations and look for patterns or themes that we can explore and this episode we'll dig into travel. One of my favorite topics and I will take partial credit or blame in advance as it might make you want to quit your job and head off to the airport with a backpack. Coincidentally exactly what I am doing tomorrow and why I'm recording this intro way, way past midnight now. I've interviewed some fascinating people from around the world. It's kind of crazy to think that this is my job. How happy am I? How lucky am I? And in the next hour, we will actually travel around the world with them in a way, because we recorded these episodes all over the planet.

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       We'll also explore specific tips and strategies from our conversations related to how they think about travel, how they personally travel, the tools and gadgets they use, and the role that travel might play in your life. First I talked to the one and only Rolf Potts, the author of vagabonding, one of my favorite books of all time. Some of you may know starting around 2004 I traveled the world for roughly 18 months after this complete implosion and deciding to either shut my business down or completely reinvented and extricate myself. The lessons learned over those 18 months form the basis for much of my first book, the four hour workweek on that journey, which ranged from the back alleys of Berlin to lakes and Patagonia. I had next to nothing, one suitcase, one backpack, and only two books. One of those books was Walden by Henry David Thoreau naturally and the other was vagabonding subtitle and uncommon guide to the art of longterm world travel written by Rolf Potts, which is about a lot more than just travel people, you know, they put off what they really want to until they're too old

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       to actually write,

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       do it next. My friend Kevin Rose and I share our travel experiences while sitting on Tatami mats in a traditional, in the Japanese hillside in Kanazawa specifically, and we cover everything from how to cope when not speaking the local language to how Kevin has to hide his tattoos, those tattoos in certain countries, including Japan, went in to use the spa and she goes, tattoos and I said yes, and she handed me flesh colored tape. Then I talk travel and diving adventures among other things with Phil Cogan from the amazing race and I just wrote down everything that I felt like I had all the time in the world to do, to get out, to go, okay, this is not a dress rehearsal. You can die, you will die. You don't know how long you've got before you die. And of course the incredible. Kevin Kelly and I get into our favorite travel tools and gadgets. What else do you have in your backpack, which is stuffed here in the back of our car right now?

Speaker 2:          00:06:58       So let's jump right in. Rolf Potts at Rolf Potts on Twitter has reported for more than 60 countries for the likes of National Geographic Traveler, the New Yorker, slate.com outside the New York Times magazine, the believer, it goes on and on and on. Sports illustrated, national public radio, you name it, his adventures have taken him across six continents and include piloting a fishing boat 900 miles down the Laotian or Laotian metcon hitchhiking across eastern Europe, traversing Israel on foot, bicycling across Burma, driving a land rover across South America. Sounds like a long, long ass trip. And traveling around the world for six weeks with no luggage or bags of any kind off is perhaps best known for promoting the ethic of independent travel and his book on the subject of vagabonding, which I mentioned before, subtitle an uncommon guide to the art of longterm. We'll travel has been through 28 printings and translated into many languages.

Speaker 2:          00:07:54       It is also, by the way, the reason I started the Tim Ferriss Book Club and produce an audio book of this book because it could not be found in. That bothered me when you can find out all about that@audible.com forward slash Tim's books if you want to see the other books in that selection. But backdrop, he won the 2009 Lowell Thomas Award from the Society of American travel writers and became the first American author to when Italy's prestigious coveted Chatwin prize for travel writing. Many people fantasize about travel, yet they never follow through. They never the book their trip and take those first steps. Ralf explains in what follows the concept of vagabonding and how it differs from just another vacation.

Speaker 3:          00:08:41       I like that you bring up the idea of fantasizing about travel because I think it's something that everybody does and it's one of those top three, if not top two or one things that people dream about that and you and you see it in the movies all the time. Um, and in fact, I this in vagabonding, you know, the heist movie where the whole goal is to have this complicated, um, robbery so they can have enough money to, to move overseas to a wonderful place. And as I say in the book, is that you don't need to rob a bank to do that. In fact, you can do that for a cost that is equal to, and sometimes less than your cost of living in a major American city. Uh, and so I think an important principle I bring up in vagabonding is saying, don't, don't put this off if you're dreaming about travel.

Speaker 3:          00:09:25       And most people do. And you know, and if you don't worry about travel, that's fine. But I really address these travel dreams, which are so common that don't wait until you get to tell you're too old because, um, you know, retirement isn't necessarily the best time to, to, uh, to do something like this. And in fact, a Henry David Thoreau, I think Walden Woods, the other book you'd, you took on your travels, uh, talks about how people, and I'm not quoting him directly, they, you know, they put off what they really want to do until they're too old to actually do it. And you know, that's a paraphrase. Um, and so if you are 18, 28, you know, 38, 48, whenever you're them about travel, put, make your goals soon and, and don't put off those goals because they're very attainable. And you know, I think there's a lot of fears that are tied in to confronting vagabonding, which you asked me if the, for the definition, it's not combining as longterm travel.

Speaker 3:          00:10:19       It's not just a vacation, it's not a week or two off. Um, that, you know, society gives you as a vacation. It's six months or two years or s you know, six weeks that you make for yourself to travel in earnest, not as a consumer experience, not as a vacation, but as a, you know, a more deeply meaningful life experience. And as a way to actualize your wealth of time. And I think this is an idea we'll come back to a lot and it's something that you write about as well as me as the idea of time wealth, the idea that your experiences are more valuable in life. Then the things that you accumulate and the things that are always being touted as the most important things in life. So travel is a great way to cash in on your time wealth. Um, and, and vagabonding just by definition is a more meaningful way of travel.

Speaker 3:          00:11:06       It's a way of slowing down and really discovering parts of yourself instead of just buying a lot of experiences, which is, which we've sort of been conditioned to do, uh, as American consumers. My first vagabonding trip was 20 years ago this year. Um, oddly enough and having an anniversary. Thank you. Thank you. It was just this time that I was, that I was straggling back to Kansas after having this amazing eight month trip around North America and it was a trip that I thought would be my last, I thought I would get travel out of my system so I could become a responsible American workaholic. And then maybe return to travel when I was old. But you, you mentioned the idea of fear and the fears I had going out were, um, you know, is this going to be expensive? It's going to, is this going to be dangerous, am going to come back and be compromised professionally.

Speaker 3:          00:11:55       And all of those sort of turned into the, into the opposite that it was a lot safer than I expected. It was a lot cheaper than I expected. And I came back and for 20 years I've been integrating, uh, travel, uh, with, with a professional life that continues to diversify. I continue to, to, to do other things to make money while at the same time having big swaths of time to travel. And I'm not suggesting that everybody needs to, you know, become a vagabond or for a 20 year chunk. And in some ways I travel a lot less than I used to, um, you know, 10 or 15 years ago. But it's something that you can do. It's an option that you can have and it's not an APP, an option that you wait for life to give you, you create it. Uh, and so I'm a big believer in the active, uh, aspect of vagabonding of saving your money.

Speaker 3:          00:12:43       But the lottery is another metaphor I use a lot in, in bag of bonding that people keep waiting for the lottery to reward them. Um, but as, as we all know, the odds that you're going to win the lottery is pretty low. But we've already won the lottery. We're born with time wealth and so it's just a matter of creating these travel experiences or these time rich experiences, uh, through things like simplicity and a, just the decision to make these sort of things happen. What type of sites or resources would you recommend to people who are trying to find a comparable folks? Let's just say people who will help them alleviate their fear of travel or just in general, what type of online resources do you recommend? Um, well Google for one. I mean if you just Google, you know, 35 year old years old, two kids, one year of travel, then odds are you'll find 20 blogs of people in that demographic who are doing just that.

Speaker 3:          00:13:41       Um, so, so really be the unabashed and very specific about googling you know, your fears or your demographic and just see who like you is, is out traveling the world. There's a lot of great traveler communities. I've been affiliated with boots and all.com, um, since the very beginning of vagabonding and part of their emo is just sort of creating community and, and uh, and, and support, uh, for people. And they have, they have blogs and resources on their site and there's other travel communities as well. It's boots, the letter n all.com, right? Yeah. B O t s n a l l.com. And they'd been operating out of Portland, Oregon for years. And I'm just quietly been doing very well. The nice work of reassurance and saying, oh, so you, so you're worried about it. Uh, and around the world flight, well, here's what, around how around the world flights. Look, you know, you're, you're worried about a certain situation, you know, here's, here are some resources for that. And, and they're not alone. I'm most familiar with them because we, we've been, we've sort of shared a similar mission for a long time, but there are big communities of travelers who, who are happy to help, uh, and, and sort of help new newbies feel better about these, uh, prospects have of longterm travel

Speaker 4:          00:15:00       for you in, and perhaps there are older examples, but you mentioned that you're, uh, you're too, you're taking a trip before we started recording, uh, and you're doing a home swap. Is that, is, would you mind perhaps elaborating on, um, how some of those options work, those that you're familiar with, because I think that many people who consider travel think in terms of one of their main expenses being, staying in a hotel. Right. Uh, and, uh, I'd love for you to share any of your thoughts on that.

Speaker 3:          00:15:32       Yeah. Well, it, it's shifted the way the travel world works in, in, in some ways that are delightfully convenient. Uh, and, and, and in some ways that are a little bit strange. I, I think that technology is one of those double edged swords that in some ways has turned us into insufferable micromanagers on the road.

Speaker 4:          00:15:52       Can you elaborate on that?

Speaker 3:          00:15:54       Yeah. Well, I'll, I'll start with the negative. Um, you know, I, I the tribal culture which I started in, which was 20 years ago, but really my more international traveler travels or more like 15 years ago. Um, it's about showing up in town and knowing that when you get there, um, the unexpected awaits you that you, that you're going to walk to the hotel district, you may have a guidebook with some hotel recommendations. Um, but you're going to shop for your hotel. You're not gonna find a deal online. You're going to walk in there, you're going to see the room. Um, you're going to haggle because in, in, in all throughout Asia, you know, basically any place outside of the industrial world, prices are up for grabs. And haggling in person is so much more, it gives you so much more leverage than haggling online.

Speaker 3:          00:16:37       Cause you can go and look at the room and physically leave, uh, if the, if the owner doesn't give you a price that you're, that you're into. And so these days it has become so convenient. Not always a bad thing, but it has become so convenient that people just assume that the best deals to be had are the ones online. And then pretty soon you've locked in your traveling for six weeks and you know where you're sleeping every night and advanced. And it really compromises the flexibility of travel and the serendipity of being inspired by a place and thinking, I'm going to stay here for a few days. Or Wow, I just met this traveler who told me about this great place up in the mountains and I'm, I'm not going to go to Varanasi, I'm going to go up into the Himalayas and spend my time there. This technologically enhanced micro managing cuts into that serendipity in a certain way.

Speaker 3:          00:17:27       And it also connects us to home and, and again, it's a two edge thing. Um, social media and the, and the constant connectivity that comes with smartphones, for example, allows us to really find things that we couldn't find before. But it cuts into the idea of wandering around and finding things by surprise, finding things organically and letting, letting it get destination reveal itself to us on his own terms instead of sort of finding that place as a consumer before we get there. Um, and a lot of technologies have eliminated things like loneliness and boredom, um, which sounds good and is good to a certain extent, but loneliness and boredom, um, can lead you to those moments that, that sort of force you into a new version of yourself. They force you to be more extroverted day. Totally, totally agreed. They force you to read the local newspaper instead of, you know, looking through your Facebook feed.

Speaker 3:          00:18:18       Right. Uh, uh, and so that's, that is what we're up against with this technological, these technological advances. And I don't want to be in the grumpy, older traveler because I remember being being 20 and listening to these, you know, baby boom era hippie sort of lecture me on how travel used to be, you know, back at a time when telephone answering machines and credit cards were seen as this decadent form of technology. Um, and, and so I know that there are younger travelers who don't know anything but the constant conductivity of travel. Um, but unplugging is important and we can talk more about that if, if you want. Um, and we can also talk about the pluses and there I have many recent examples about how technology has have helped this recent home home exchange. It's just a longtime friend who lives in Brooklyn. She's a writer, uh, and she wants a quiet place.

Speaker 3:          00:19:05       I have 30 acres in Kansas and so I get an awesome pat in Brooklyn for a week and she gets a quiet farm in Kansas for a time. Uh, I think in places and more expensive places like Europe, you know, the hostel was your go to. It was where if you wanted to save money, you would go to the, to the youth hostel. Um, and it was a great place to meet people. You get a cheap bed, you went, you, you would forego a few amenities, but you would hang out in the hostel. Well, I went to Amsterdam, uh, this summer, uh, I teach, I teach a writing course in Paris every summer. And my sister and my nephew came and visited me and we wanted to go see Amsterdam. And using Airbnb, I was able to get a full cottage, a 15 minute train ride outside of central Amsterdam for about half the price as a hostel for three people in the center of Amsterdam.

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       So instead of staying at, at at somewhat grungy, hostile, and the red light district, um, we were staying in this little town filled with windmills, uh, and we had our own house to ourselves and we could just walk down the street and get groceries. And so Arab, that was an airbnb hookup. Couchsurfing is a similar, has similar benefits. Uh, it, it just allows you to break out of not only that old hotel set of assumptions, but also out of the hostel set of assumptions. The idea that the cheapest option in any place is going to be a hostile, especially traveling in groups for the three of us. If I had been alone, maybe I, maybe the cottage wouldn't have been as cheap as the hospital with three of us where you're getting hostile one bed at a time. Um, we just got the perfect place to stay through airbnb.

Speaker 3:          00:20:42       Uh, and so those services and even social media, even going on Facebook or Twitter and, and I'm not a big believer of tweeting while you travel. I think that that really puts you into this home mindset and it pulls you out of the place where you are. And the point of travel is experiencing what's before your eyes and not what's coming across your social media feed. But before your travel, before one's travels, I'm a big fan of throwing, throwing out a tweet or Facebook post that says, Hey, look, I'm, I'm going to be in this place. What are some suggestions? Uh, and that is something that didn't exist 10 years ago, uh, and is not tied to a business or social networking thing like Airbnb and couch surfing, but it could just be that your buddy from high school has a friend who was in the military in Germany and they have an ex girlfriend who lives in Stockholm and suddenly you have a place to stay, uh, through very random circumstances.

Speaker 3:          00:21:37       And so that kind of, it's, it's the old model of sitting in the hostel or sitting in a guest house or a bar and an exotic part of the world talking to the sixth travelers who are there with you and them giving you advice on points further down the road. That principle has been taken to social media and through networking. That's another way that technology has allowed that, that that old hostel room is actually killed the, at the literal hostel room where people are now staring at their phones in the hostel room. But is it as expanded the virtual hostel room where instead of talking to the six travel or is your width physically, you can be talking to 600 travelers through your networks who might have some good advice for you.

Speaker 1:          00:22:16       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:22:20       This next segment was recorded in rural Japan. Late one evening with my friend Kevin Rose at Kevin Rose on Twitter, affectionately known as Kev Kev by those in the know serial entrepreneur rolled class investor in all around wild and crazy guy. We've been through a lot together and here we discussed Japan how to do it cheaply in many other things and the tips in this next segment apply to just about anywhere, not just the land of the rising sun and we are at [inaudible] is the name of the place and if you hear any waterfall like sounds in the background, that is because we have a natural onset bringing water into the rooms where there are wooden tubs that are effectively indoor, outdoor. There's an open wall, so you look out into a forest slash hillside and the steam pours out into the great outdoors. It is winter. So there's tons of fog and mist and so on.

Speaker 5:          00:23:17       It's just a magical place. Yeah, it's, it's absolutely beautiful. And one of the reasons why I chose this place to stay is one, I had never stayed in a Ryokan like traditional Japanese house before and I always wanted to do that. Um, and number two, when you're talking about it ons and like a natural spring, um, it's very difficult because in Japan if you have any tattoos whatsoever, you are forbidden from doing the [inaudible]. Like you can't go and baths public baths because they say that you're a yakuza. Yeah. It's associated with organized crime. So if you have tattoos as Kevin does, yes, my little pony on both delta, it's beautiful. I can see a long haired but the tassels and it'd be quite a breathtaking thing. It is breathtaking. And uh, you are not allowed to go to public baths or most of them also true in say hotels where they have beach front, you're not allowed to go on the beach if you have exposed ends who's also hotels when you're going to just use their kind of spa.

Speaker 5:          00:24:21       Cause I went in there one time, um, I was staying at a, I think it was a peninsula and um, went in to use the spa and she goes tattoos. And I said yes. And she handed me flesh colored tape. I got like a little square of tape and, and I have a few, I was like, I'm going to need the whole role. And it ended up not being, I didn't actually happen, I didn't go in so I would have been kicked out. But this is nice. It's in our room. So every single room here has its own little private bath, hot water being piped in and it's, it's been very relaxing. And that should say also, we're not going to talk about Japan the whole time. But I do think Japan is worth highlighting for a few reasons. I mean I was an exchange student here at age 15, which was really my first time abroad.

Speaker 5:          00:25:09       And that year completely changed my life. I lived with host families, I went to a Japanese school, I was the only American in my class photo, which is very easy. Where's Waldo all in school uniforms. So like crew cut, Whitehead, and then all Japanese gets about 5,000. And it has proven to be such a subtle and nuanced culture simultaneously. You can come here, someone who doesn't speak Japanese get completely lost, be completely bewildered. The English level is generally pretty low here. So it can be a totally alien environment where you can't read any signs and it's not dangerous. And the people will go above and beyond to try and kind of decipher what you're saying with your hands. Well, not only that, so why don't you tell the story of Tony and the earphones? Well, it, what are your phones? Your phone city dropped on the salt.

Speaker 5:          00:26:09       Oh yeah, yeah. So two days ago, well, there was two stories. Okay. So this is classic, uh, Tokyo for you. Um, and it's part of the reason why I love Japan so much is like the people here are just so friendly and I'm really concerned with your wellbeing. So Tony, one of the, the members that was traveling with us that is traveling with us, he dropped his, uh, his headphones and just, you know, we're talking standard kind of apple headphones, you know, white cord, whatever. And we walked into a coffee shop. And now just for context, this is on one of the busiest streets in a shopping district in Tokyo. Yeah. So there's people just, you know, I knew in New York City, yeah, just like all over the place. Just, you know, probably stepping on the headphones and whatnot. Somebody on the second floor of a building across the street was looking out the window, saw that these, these, these small white headphones fell out of his pocket, ran down the stairs, grab the headphones, it figured out which coffee bar we had gone into and then proceeded to enter in and hand back the headphones, which was just nuts.

Speaker 5:          00:27:17       And then on top of that, the exact same coffee bar I had gotten out of a taxi, left my cell phone in the taxi. And you know, of course when you're in the states you'd like, Shit. Like my, my cell phone's gone. I'm never gonna see it again. And um, so I use find my phone, you know, the, the apple built in features so you can see where the your phone is. I used it off of my wife's cell phone and you know, it's 2025 minutes away from where we're at in a taxi. And I'm like, God damn it. Like, how am I ever going to get this back? And I pressed the button too, which sends a signal to the cell phone. So it sends out an audible alert to the, you know, so anyone who ever is is nearby can hear that. All of a sudden I'm watching on GPS, the phone starts getting closer and closer and closer.

Speaker 5:          00:28:04       This driver drives all the way back. 20 plus minutes comes up the stairs to the coffee shop where you drop were I left him and then hands me my phone back. I try to tip him, you know, I'm thinking like in the states, you know, you give somebody 20, 40, 50 bucks, I thank you so much. He wouldn't accept my tip and was just so polite. Bowed to me and left. It's just like, oh man. It just, it makes you, when you live with, when you live in the states, you're just like, what, what happened with a few friends with us? And it also makes you feel like a, uh, in many, many, many instances and uncivilized Harry Savage. That's what I'm saying. Like you wake up, you know, you're going to be ashamed of at least 17 things that you do that day. Uh, but it's, it's a wonderful environment.

Speaker 5:          00:28:54       And one thing that I want to underscore before we move on, and I'm sure we'll come back to it, is that you don't have to have a lot of money or spend a lot of money to enjoy Tokyo. This is a common misconception. It can be extremely expensive, but it doesn't have to be extremely expensive. And certainly Japan as a whole doesn't need to be extremely expensive. When I was here at 15, I had no money whatsoever. And you can, for instance, find stores that you would recognize like seven 11 that are completely different from the equivalent at home. And you can go into a seven 11. For instance, and you can grab one of my favorite on the go bites, which is Onigiri. These are rice balls wrapped and dry seaweed and filled with various meats, vegetables or fish, say tuna whenever it might be, and those cost about 110 yen.

Speaker 5:          00:29:43       So let's just call that a dollar. And you can find those at seven 11 store called Sun Cus, s u n k u s or Lawson. It's packaged in such a way that you pull apart the plastic, which keeps the seaweed separate. It automatically wraps this rice triangle and you have effectively an entire meal right there for somewhere between one and $2. Yeah, well you know it's funny, I don't know if I told you this, but I was here with David Chang. I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with him, but he's one of the probably the top five chefs in the United States. Very famous Momofuku Mofo. Yeah, just like Bar, right? Yeah. Milk bar and a, we happen to be here on the same trip with some friends and he was ranting and raving about these seven 11 a egg salad sandwich. And it's like, you know, a multi, like, you know, it was, yeah, I think it has three Michelin Stars at one of his restaurant. I mean, I'm top of the world chef freaking out about a seven 11 different seven 11 the United States. Yeah. I mean, not high end food by any means. I mean a couple of bucks for this egg salad sandwich, but prepared with like my beer says prepared with pride.

Speaker 5:          00:30:51       Yeah. There's so much. A couple of other go tos that suggest in Tokyo, if you can get a ticket, go to the Jubilee Museum. G, H I, B l I museum, which is the museum. It's, think of it as the Disney Museum for the Walt Disney of Japan. And that's a Miyazaki Heiau. He did spirited away. My favorite movie, my neighbor Totoro a whole long list of blockbuster and kind of a genre defining anime film send it is, it is one of the most incredible, uh, museums I've ever been to. It's in the middle of what they call me. Taka forest, which is right next to her is, you know, cause she had a Koan and then, uh, a lot, a lot of things in Japan are also free. You can go to [inaudible], h a r a j u k you, where you can find on the weekends Elvis impersonators doing their dancing.

Speaker 5:          00:31:39       This has been going on for decades now. And you can also go to [inaudible] dot doughty, which is I guess tuck a stuff street or alleyway where you find dozens or hundreds of teenagers in high schoolers doing cosplay. So they wear these crazy outfits and walk up and down the streets or showing off the weirdest outfits imaginable or into that. A lot of people are into it. Like, do you, are you kind of like when you see a cosplay or you, cause it's like a sexual thing? Well, for, so I, you know, I think that for some people that might be part of it, but I think that it's just a form of, of hyper expression in a culture where a lot of people feel very repressed or overly polite. Most of the time. Yeah. And so then they blow it out on the weekends and they like put in pink contacts and white hair and 12 inch platform shoes and wear the wackiest shit imaginable.

Speaker 5:          00:32:31       Yeah. Maybe Walter, uh, in the, in the states cause plays like a bigger, cause they'd dress up like video game characters and things like that when, sure. You know, hey comicon and whatnot. Oh yeah. Well there are a lot of things that are, that's not really Japanese cosplay though. There are a lot of things that are regular and other countries that end up being adopted by weird niche groups in the u s and take on in some cases like creepy or weird or elements, right? Like tango in Argentina, normal tango in some places in the United States. Super Weird. And I'm just saying that as someone who loves tango and dances dances in many places, but primarily in Argentina, way back in the day. Same thing with Japanese stuff. It's like, oh Monga cool. And then you find like a little subculture in a given city in the u s and you're like, wait a second, it's all 40 year old guys who are like reading creepy half Porno Hentai Manga.

Speaker 5:          00:33:21       Okay. I don't think I'm going to hang out here. Right, right. Anymore. So a segue. Yes. How do we stay away from that? Uh, let's Segue, fall from hint, the hint that you're going to look up those people interested there. There are two books that have helped me review and prep for this trip in terms of Japanese that I'd like to suggest people check out if you're interested in Japanese, uh, very short. And I was able to get through these really quickly. The first is probably for people who speak more intermediate Japanese, so you'd want some basics first, but it is 13 secrets for speaking fluent Japanese. And this is by, I think it's Giles' or Giles, g. I, l. E. S, let's say Giles Marie and u R. R a. Y. So 13 secrets for speaking fluent Japanese. Very, very helpful. And then the second is maybe a bit dry for some people, but I like very concise grammar summaries that are quick reference and this is Japanese verbs and essentials of grammar and that is by Rita lamp can l a m P K I n fill Cogan

Speaker 2:          00:34:26       k e o g. H a n at Phil Cogan on Twitter has worked in television for almost 30 years on more than a thousand program episodes in more than a hundred countries. His work has earned him numerous awards including 10 that's right, 10 primetime Emmys. He has pressed best known as the co-executive producer and host of CBS is series the amazing race, but there's much more to fill story including unbelievable bucket lists near to the experiences and all sorts of other adventures. And misadventures. I was doing a story about a 22,000 ton shipwreck that had sunk in in New Zealand and it was down about 120 feet underwater and it was on its starboard side. 22,000 tons is like, it's as big as you know, a cruise liner that you see going around at the ports around the world. And big, really big and 120 feet, uh, is for people who've never done any scuba diving in. Unless you have special equipment. I mean that's not a lot of bottom time. Exactly. So most recreational divers get certified to dive to about 60 feet. The best stuff that you see underwater is

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       generally in the first 30 feet because once you get past 30 feet, the color, it changes you, you lose all the reds and everything becomes very blue. Um, so I always say to people, look, you don't need to go deep. And unless you're going onto a wreck or something, there's some real reason to go deep. The only reason to go deeper, as you know, if it is a wreck, you can get great diving in 10, 15 feet of water with the Carl close to the surface. The colors are brighter and so on. But this wreck was deepened. And, and, and as you said, the deeper you are, the faster you chew through air and you eat up air and that affects how long you can stay down. And the longer you're down deep, the more nitrogen you get. In your blood. And so it's, it, there's a real science to diving and you have to be super careful as you're a diver.

Speaker 6:          00:36:25       I am. Yeah. So you, you understand seeing people get nitrogen narcosis yeah. Ad At exactly 120 feet. I saw a guy start to tr, he tried to take off all of his gear and just drop it in a small group and he was stopped. But that was the guy that worked at Chippendales. I no, no, no. A different guy. Okay. No, but I, but people, yeah, I've seen the same thing to take the regulator out and they start having conversations with fish and it's not a good idea. No. It getting narked. Um, yeah. So that's all the more reason to get properly certified. So, um, I was with some very experienced divers and way more experienced than me. And they were, they were doing the salvage him. We were going to be the first people to shoot on the ship, get to go inside the ship and explore it.

Speaker 6:          00:37:09       And the cameraman that I was with, the also very experienced, but because there was a bit, because the, there's so much silt inside the boat and there was a current as well rolling through the book. We were, we, and we, in those days we were shooting on film. It's not like today where you could go down with a great group, a Gopro and some lights and you know, you could film for a couple of hours. We had a two and a half minute roll of film in a 100 foot daylight spool role that was in a little housing inside the kit. So literally that's the only amount of footage we had to shoot on film. That's how long I go back. So that the plan was that we would go into the ballroom of the, of the ship and big, big ballroom and then the crew would come in from another door and we would meet in the middle so that we didn't stir up all the silt going into the same entrances and we'd swim towards each other.

Speaker 6:          00:38:00       They'd get us coming towards them. And so we go down and what I know now is if you go into a wreck, you tie line on the outside of the rec so that you have something to follow out if something goes wrong. These guys were so familiar with the wreck and so experienced and knew the place so well they didn't tie align on and I just sort of followed them in not knowing that that was sort of what you should do. And you know, the other rule with diving is you never leave your dive buddy. So I'm following this guy and I was too scared to tell him because I was trying to be a man that before I'm really claustrophobic. So I go in this little doorway and it would've been like imagine a small window like two by three. We go through this little port hole and then we start weaving our way through the ship.

Speaker 6:          00:38:53       And I, as we go on deeper and deeper and deeper into the shipwreck, I'm completely disoriented and I have no idea where I am. My hand sweats just listening to the description. Oh yeah. And I started to breathe like breathe. But every time I sort of like was at the point of tapping him to go, you know, I gotta get Outta here. I feel panicky. He just kept disappearing deeper and deeper and deeper in another corner, another corner. And I thought, and he was moving quickly cause he's, he's used to being in this wreck. They're doing the salvage on this thing. So finally we come into an opening and then he shines a light around and there's this huge ballroom. Now the ship is on its starboard side on its right side. So all the tables on a ship, shipper, old, bolted to the floor.

Speaker 6:          00:39:35       So imagine the tables on a right angle to us. And then he gestures to me to hold onto the table. And then he told me on the surface that he, we were going to switch out the lights, uh, to save battery power cause it's called. And now we don't have a lot of, uh, and we've got seven Mil wetsuits on is pretty cold and you can feel kind of the current pushing through the ship. And that's why we were holding onto the table. So we didn't drift. And you know, through the room and now we're looking ahead, any sort of points at me and looks ahead and says that's where the crew is going to come out. And I knew that that's where they're going to come out. So I was like, okay, so we're waiting with the lights off in the dark and I'm processing all of this and starting to try to slow my breathing down and like stay calm.

Speaker 6:          00:40:16       It's okay. You know, you're with an expert, everything's good. And uh, after what seemed like, like minutes all I want it to turn my light on, but I also didn't want to do it cause I thought he'll think I'm a wimp. Like why am I turning off? I just want to turn my light on to see where I was like to have sent some sense of where I was. He flicks his light on. Like in Halloween, when you take your life, put it on the Chin and you make yourself look scary. Right. That's all I remembered. The light went on. It's pointing from his chin looking up. He looks scary. Then he gestures me with his hand, puts it out in front of me, like wait. Then he points at my hands on the table like and gestures for me to hold onto the table and then boom, he just disappears around a corner and I don't have my light on.

Speaker 6:          00:41:01       He's got his light on it and the light disappears and he's gone. Well in that moment I'm like, why is he leaving? Why did he just leave? So in my haste to find my light too, I've start flailing around, let go of the table and I feel myself drifting away from where the table is and moving, drifting into the ballroom and I just went into a mad panic and I couldn't find my light. By the time I found my light, I had silted up all the water around me. I couldn't see anything. And now I don't know where the table was that I was meant to hold on to. And I'm looking ahead. I can't see any lights, I can't see him. And I started to breathe really, really fast. And now you're a diver, you understand this. But when you dive in for anybody who's never had a regulator in their mouth, if you breathe too quickly, there's a little diaphragm that allows for exhalation and inhalation in the, in the regulator that you put in your mouth to suck in air.

Speaker 6:          00:41:57       If you go too fast, the diaphragm can't keep up with the speed of inhalation and exhalation and then you start to suck water. And then so I started like taking little bits of water in and I'm beating the, the, the, the valve and just panicking like mad, mad panic and I thought I have to get out of here and all your weight or you want to do is just get out. Right. But I don't know how to get out. I don't know where up and down is. I don't, the bubbles don't go up when the ships on his side like that and your deep down they hit the walls and then they run up the walls. They follow. We had pass and I thought, I have no idea where I am right now. I can't even see where the table is. And panicking, panicking. And I knew that someone had died in their, uh, someone had gone in there and got disconnected from a group and he had died and drifted off into the ship and died.

Speaker 6:          00:42:45       I also knew that one of the engineers never made it out when the ship sank in the first place. So, and just to set the stage also for people listening, I remember when I did a dive at the blue hole in Belize, which is about 120 feet. This is when this guy got narked. It takes so long to get down because you're equalizing. Yup. By the time you get down, I at least we were told at the time with the gear we had, you have eight minutes. Yeah. So all of this is happening. Yeah, very quickly. Very quickly, very quickly. And we, we weren't on nitrox. Nitrox as you know, is a, is a, is a mixed gas that you can get where it has more oxygen and less nitrogen so it increases your bottom time. So this is pre nitrox days and so yes, you're absolutely right.

Speaker 6:          00:43:27       We had a very limited window, which is why he must have gone off to find the crew because he realized we were eating up a lot of time. And where were they? Where were the crew? Well I don't remember exactly how I got from there to the boat, but this guy obviously came back to get me. And really it's all a blur between panicking, mad panic eyes like wide like sources to being on the boat, to looking up into the sky and seeing the most amazing blue I'd ever seen in my life. Like just look like totally surreal. And then, and I'm lying on the ground like breathing and I look up and all these faces looking down and it, Phil, you're good, you're good. I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Like trying to play like nothing happened but my heart is pounding, pounding and I was so like the feeling, the feeling of euphoria, the, the relief of being alive to know that I was alive was, was like nothing I'd ever experienced.

Speaker 6:          00:44:33       And it really was oldest stuff. It was as if my Iq went up 25 points in that moment. You know what I mean? Because I was like, how dumb we you that thought you were going to live forever? How dumb were you that you did? You've been doing all these dumb things in your life and you have real, really have no purpose in life. And I started to think about this is all happening while I'm having these conversations with them. But I'm like, I'm thinking, man, I, I love girls and I haven't even like really explored that whole world. And that's like the second or third thing that comes up. It was actually right out there. And of course in my sexual prime, I mean, come on right up there. I don't want to say it was the first thing, cause I don't want you to get the wrong idea about me, but it was up there and I was like, damn, you know, you've got a lot to do with your life.

Speaker 6:          00:45:28       So no, but there were all these things that came to me and a lot of them were very selfish. I was 19 years old. So, uh, I got myself together and I, I wanted to find a piece of paper and a pen and I just wrote down just everything that I felt like I had all the time in the world to do and that I had to get down on a piece of paper to get out to go, okay, this is not a dress rehearsal. You can die, you will die. You don't know how long you've got before you die. You better figure out what you're doing with your life and you better get on with it straight away. And one of the first things on my list was go back in the shipwreck seriously because I thought I cannot walk away from this fear.

Speaker 6:          00:46:12       I was so petrified of what had had happened and I, and I decided I would explain to the diver, you know, that I found it challenging. He knew that shuttling Djing, but I said it was like kind of like falling off a horse. I really felt like got to get back on, got to get back on. I have to go back because if I let this fear get on his time with some string or so, well I didn't actually go back with him cause I didn't even, I didn't, I didn't have time to do the lesson about this spring. Yeah. But I, but I went back with, by disclosing a little more by fear to the other diver and it was more honest. And, and then he, when he knew that and we had to get this thing shot, he was obviously more aware of, you know, he thought I was so, cause I was so gung Ho, like he didn't have any indication that there was any fear in me at all.

Speaker 6:          00:47:00       But then I kind of said, you know, listen to man, I really freaked out. He goes, oh no kidding. And I, and I said, but I need to go back. We've got to go back and do this. And we went back and we did it and we shot it. And that was the start. That was the first thing I'd ticked off my list question for you. So when you decided to go back down, you know, as you're descending petrified and getting ready to go through that tiny opening. Yeah. What was the self talk, I mean it's a long time ago, but what, what is your self talk like in a moment like that? Well, it's something that I've used a lot since then, which was instead of internalizing everything I looked out and what I realized was that this guy was super experienced and had been down on that shipwreck many times and come out of there successfully many times.

Speaker 6:          00:47:50       And if I followed his procedure and if I observed him being an expert, doing something and looked out at that rather than turning it back into my own head about what I didn't know and what I couldn't do, that I was in good hands. So ever since that moment and all the crazy things that I've done, I've taken a tremendous amount of comfort in being surrounded by people who I know are better at me at doing something, who have tremendous expertise at whatever they're doing. And to really observe them in that moment when they are in there, when they are using expertise than they are constantly. They have taken that has taken possibly at least 10,000 hours to get to and and to look at it in a way like, wow, how cool is that? I'm with this person, man or woman, whoever it is that is allowing me and given me the privilege to be with them to do what they do so well and there are specialist in there.

Speaker 2:          00:48:51       Good and so you would be explicitly reminding yourself of all these things if you're going into a situation that is provoking nerves and fear, is that the voice inside the head?

Speaker 6:          00:49:03       It is. It's, I made up a quote which I really, that I share with a lot of people which is focus on what you do have and what you can do instead of what you don't have and what you do

Speaker 2:          00:49:18       up next. Kevin Kelly at Kevin two Kelly the number two at Kevin two Kelly on Twitter might just be the real life, most interesting man in the world. He'll be my vote. I think maybe tied with another Jen who's going to come up in a second. Kevin is senior maverick at wired magazine, which he co founded in 1993 he also cofounded the all Species Foundation, a nonprofit aimed at cataloging in identifying every living species on earth in his spare time. He writes bestselling books, many of them like the inevitable subtitle, understanding the 12 technological forces that will shape our future. And by the way, he's considered an incredibly accurate futurist is predictions of pan out over and over again, even though he spends part of the year with the Amish. But that's another story. He cofounded the Rosetta project, which is building an archive of all documented human language and serves on the board of the long now foundation.

Speaker 2:          00:50:11       He alongside Stewart brand and others, Stewart brand might be the person tied with Kevin for the most interesting man in the world nomination. He alongside Stewart brand and others is also investigating how to revive and restore endangered or extinct species. The woolly mammoth. Yup. Jurassic Park stuff. But in real life I'd always wanted to travel with Kevin, uh, for, for 10 plus years. I would say I wanted even before I knew him to travel with Kevin and I finally got my chance and it is represented in this segment. We traveled through Uzbekistan together. Long story, Kevin touches on a lot of cool stuff and we had a blast recording it in the back of a car as it spread through the mountains. So I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

Speaker 7:          00:50:59       Hi, this is Kevin Kelly. I'm sitting in the back of a car crossing in a mountain pass about 2000 meters in the attention mountains in Uzbekistan. In a Spec of Stan is a central Asian country that's generally south of Russia, north of Afghanistan, and next to all the other stands like Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan sitting next to me as we crossed the mountains is Tim Ferriss, the legendary explored her and explainer of worldclass performances. And we're going to do a joint, uh, recording. Uh, Tim's going to tell us about his favorite for cool tools and we'll find out what he's up to lately. Tim, why don't you tell us about your first cool tool.

Speaker 8:          00:51:50       Okay. The first cool tool, if we're sitting in the back here, we have the bags around us, bottles of water, a bunch of different gadgets and objects piled in my lab. The first that I can talk about is actually in my other piece of luggage. I don't have any checked luggage and it is a check it that I roll up and travel with constantly. It's from a brand called now and a you, I believe it's based in Portland and you can think of it as a blazer or a riding jacket. And what what makes it unique is a number of different factors. A, and you can roll it up and throw it on to say a black tee shirt and you look like you're ready for a business dinner or a formal or semi formal occasion. So it saves me the trouble of packing a lot of collared shirts for instance.

Speaker 8:          00:52:38       And there are collared shirts that don't wrinkle, but they do take up more space than say, black tee shirt. So this now, and it could be, uh, I have, uh, several different models at home, weather resistant. Of course it was designed in the Pacific northwest, you would expect that which comes in handy. So that would be my first cool tool. Uh, plenty of pockets of, but there our lapels, so you can get away with murder, you could wear it in a light rain or you could wear it at a nice dinner and it, it is an incredibly flexible piece of clothing.

Speaker 7:          00:53:11       So one of the hazards for me anyway, if I tried to roll up a jacket, I never quite get the wrinkles out. So no iron shirts, you can kind of hang in your hot shower and it will dissipate. How does work in terms of

Speaker 8:          00:53:27       an wrinkling it or do you, does it just magically unwrinkled so this particular jacket has a number of features, I think that disguise wrinkles and that there's also that just the material science aspect, the, the fabric blends that are used tend not to wrinkle, number one. Number two, it has folds and pockets and the lapels that for whatever reason, make any wrinkles less noticeable. And then there's the color. So if you want to avoid problems with wrinkles, generally, at least in my experience, you want darker clothing so that under light you're not casting, you're not having shadows cast across or beneath the wrinkles. So this is a charcoal color jacket. It's kind of like your typical suit, check it length, or is it more like a outdoor jacket at the waist? I would say typical dinner jacket length. Uh, so it's not getting cutoff. Doesn't show off any midriff for those of you were looking for that.

Speaker 8:          00:54:30       You're out of luck. Yeah. Uh, so you'd be able to see your belt if it were on buttons in the front. Right. Okay. So that's, and it's very lightweight and about tell the readers about how big it compresses into if you were to roll it up. Well, and if you want to know how to roll up a jacket like that, well you could actually go online and look at how, say a judo uniform is folded. And, uh, if you roll it up, well you are looking at, let's just say the, the bottom three quarters, meaning it'll cover the very bottom, a fabric of a standard sized school backpacks are not thinking about a hikers backpack. Uh, so if, if I had to estimate, I would say we're looking at, I get it down to about a role that is 10 inches in length and about a three to four inches in diameter.

Speaker 8:          00:55:31       Well that's very impressive. I carry a lightweight down Jack if they compress this into something very small, but it's certainly not as fancy or, or you know, suitable for dinner jacket like yours is. And I mean a couple of other tips for folks and the by, I'm by no means say hyper minimalists and say Appalachian trail hiker or anything like that. But I also have for instance, a synthetic because I don't want to lose the uh, insulating ability if it, if it gets wet. I have a, a synthetic down vest that is also stuffed into this backpack, which I can put on top of that sort of a fancy looking jacket in the case that I need more warmth. Yeah, that's brilliant. That's a really good hack. So

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       again, that's called the now

Speaker 8:          00:56:25       check it and a, you know, no. Okay. And approximately what's it, what's it cost? Just give me a range. That's really good question. I bought it a long time ago. It's not a, it's not cheap, but then again, if you're comparing it to any type of dinner jacket or outdoor jacket, it's not horribly expensive. I'd say it's in the one 50 to three 50 range if I had to guess. Okay, good. That's fantastic. So what else do you have in your backpack, which is stuffed here in the back of our car? Right now my, in my bag of tricks, I have a uh, a logic tech Bluetooth keyboard. And, uh, just to put this in perspective, it is about the slightly larger than say a paperback book, like a five by eight inch trim paperback book is narrow enough that I will very often stick it into a journal to protect it.

Speaker 8:          00:57:21       Uh, meaning it's, it's probably the width of eight to 10 paperback pages, uh, and it holds a charge very, very well. So I use this oftentimes if I have any issue with my laptop, I can pair it to my iPhone, which is a larger sized iPhone and balance the iPhone or lean it against saying a, a glass of ice tea. And I can get any type of writing done that I need to get done. Also, if I feel like taking a day trip but not taking this backpack, which is one of my main pieces of luggage and stuffed full of stuff, it's kind of heavy. I can take the, I can take the keyboard and my iPhone and head off to some coffee shops saying 10, 15 minutes away without carrying all of my gear with me.

Speaker 7:          00:58:07       So I'm going to try to describe this a little bit further. It's very, very thin and very lightweight. It feels like it's made out of aluminum and it has kind of a matte texture, matte finish on it. It feels very velvety. Um, and it's uh, mostly charcoal color with white letters. And so this would serve as a keyboard with a phone. Uh, and, and the keyboard itself is pretty large in terms of your finger spacing, so there'd be no cramping. That is really cool.

Speaker 8:          00:58:42       Yeah, it's a great device. I've had this now for I would say two years and I have never had a technical fail. So as a form of backup, I find it to be very cheap insurance because as you can see in person, this is lightweight enough that I'm not going to get scoliosis for having this as additional piece of gear. I just stick it, stick it into a large format journal or even a magazine and I can travel with it. Yeah, that's really cool. And so it pairs up through Bluetooth, I imagine, right? That's right.

Speaker 7:          00:59:13       Right. So you compare it up to a, an iPad if you want it to as well as a phone. If you happen to be carried. I definitely, yeah. So, um, what's that again?

Speaker 8:          00:59:22       This is a larger tech Bluetooth keyboard. Okay. And we'll put the exact model in the show notes for everybody. And uh, next up we have uh, these, these all kind of traveled together. I've very rarely take these out of my backpack. In this case. This is Max earplugs, silicone your plugs, which unlike foam earplugs or not inserted into the ear canal and then left to expand, these are effectively smeared over the ear opening and you have in all caps, do not insert Justin uncover ear opening. These I found through swimmers in fact, uh, and they are very waxy, uh, and almost look like candies, some type of Caramel, but they're white colored and I find them to block sound much more effectively than any type of foam your plug, although there are some good ones on the market to be sure to use them just once or can they be reused or recycled or the last a little bit then you have to get grungy or what, what, what's the use?

Speaker 8:          01:00:35       I definitely reuse these. I would say if I had to guesstimate, I would say four to five nights and then they'd, they start to lose their adherence because they get, uh, they get less tacky over time. The most important feature or benefit that I don't want to overlook is that as someone who tends to rotate from back to side, so I sleep on my back and on my side foam earplugs won't very often hurt. They'll get pushed into your ear when you roll onto your side. That is not the case with these. Uh, so, uh, it's over side sleepers. This, these aren't real, a real cool tool because it allows you to sleep on your side while you have these earplugs in. Definitely. And even as someone who kind of tosses and turns, in my case, I don't tend to wake up on my site, but I'm constantly going onto my side and foam ear plugs off and will wake me out.

Speaker 8:          01:01:29       Okay, cool. And is this mostly just used for sleeping or could you use these, do use these for other sorts of sound, but maybe these, these earplugs, uh, live in each of my bags that I tend to travel with. So I have, I have redundant caches of earplugs, one in this bag, one in my other bag. And sometimes I'll even have them at jackets, mostly for sleeping, mostly for sleeping, definitely heard who's sitting on an airplane and you're trying to read and just want to drown out the sound. Then you can use it as well for sure. Or you're swimming and you want to avoid swimmers. Okay. Right. Cool. Okay. So, um, what's your fourth? A cool tool. My fourth cool tool, and I might, I might, I might go over slightly here, but by my fourth cool tool is a neck pillow. And I want one of those.

Speaker 8:          01:02:22       I've tried many different neck pillows. Yeah. Most of them are very uninspiring and even less effective for helping me sleep. Uh, this, and I'll do my best here. Cabo cut by, I believe his, the presentation, C A, B, e, a u and it has evolution pillow written on the side. You can see that it, it's compresses down very nicely size of a cantaloupe, like a small, like a small cantaloupe or a large grapefruit. Now you can certainly compress it more, uh, in the actual bag that it comes in, allows you to wrap it up and then compress it down to a smaller size. And it was just very nice in essence, memory foam, neck pillow that also clips in the front. And what I've found is not only does it help me sleep if I'm sitting upright, but it's also very, very helpful for getting to sleep when I'm laying prone, whether it's on an airplane or even in a hotel room if the pillows are of dubious quality.

Speaker 8:          01:03:22       And do you have to inflate this, uh, with like pumping Erin blowing air into it or is it self expanding, its self expanding? Uh, so it, you could think of it almost like a sponge, like material that you can compress down and then when you release it, it's uh, inflates or I should say rather expands automatically. It is one of those horseshoe shaped items or is it a, just a little kind of weds assists behind your neck? It is a horseshoe shaped, uh, if you imagine a horseshoe being hung or around the back of your neck, uh, that is the shape can clip in the front. And the design is such that there's a ridge that supports basically the ACIP it'll area the fact that the base of the skull, so it's very, very ergonomic. It's, it is. It's the most comfortable neck pillow that I have found.

Speaker 8:          01:04:15       And so I am pretty light. It's a little bit bulky, but it's pretty light. Yeah, it's, it's lights. And as far as neck pillows go, not very bulky at all, but if you're going to have a neck pillow, generally speaking, in my experience at least it's going to be inflatable and quite uncomfortable. Or you're going to end up with this type of compromise. And this is, this is the best I found, right. So it does, it'd be you could pretty easily disappeared Joe daypack. Oh, I think it absolutely could. And certainly if you wanted you could lash this to the outside of a pack. I happen to have enough space in my bag so I include it, but you can lash it or hang it on the outside. Okay. One, one other cool tool that you have, which is more common here than I would have expected, but in retrospect, I shouldn't be surprised. It is very, very hot here. It can get very, very hot and the sun is extremely powerful to the extent that we visited a solar furnace not long ago, that can be used to melt various objects, absurdly high temperatures. Thousand degrees centigrade. Yeah, exactly. Uh, and uh, you have, well our guide has our esteemed guide as an umbrella smart move to create shade wherever he wants it. And you have an umbrella, but you made a modification to your umbrella. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:05:36       So I just had an ordinary, cheap Chinese black really compact umbrella that I carry in my little camera bag all the time and I spray painted the top of it silver so that it reflects the light and it makes it a little bit cooler on the inside because just with the black umbrella, it tends to absorb that infrared and reradiate it back down on your head. Um, having a silver reflective layer announces at least 60% of that packet to the sky and it's a lot cooler. And, um, there are versions of the silver umbrella. They're extremely lightweight. They're not as collapsible as the ones that have what they're made for hiking there, there, there, I think, just call it the silver dome, if I'm not mistaken and are way only a few ounces. Um, and people out west, if you're claiming even at the high altitudes, um, a lot of the long distance hikers now carry and an umbrella portable shade and they walk along hundreds of shades shade files in. Um, and it really makes a huge difference when you're backpacking because you can really work up a sweat and the hat doesn't allow your head to cool off. But the umbrella does
