Speaker 1:          00:04:51       Sophia, welcome to the show. Hi Tim, how are you? I am, I'm fantastic and uh, we've had such an adventure putting this together and getting all the tech to work, but I'm stoked to be chatting with you. I've wanted to have a, a, a jam session with you for so long and I know we've met very briefly before, but, uh, let's, let's start with some basics for people who may not be familiar with you and, and I know your role has changed in the last, uh, year or so, but when people ask you, what do you do, how do you answer that? Now. And how did you answer that two years ago?

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       If I don't know them, I just say like I have an online fashion business and I try to leave it at that and if they ask, it depends on who it is. Um, but I started a company called Nasty Gal in 2006 as an Ebay store selling vintage clothing and you know, whatever, like all a lot of entrepreneurs just did everything myself. Did what needed to happen. Just ran a little ebay store but it wasn't little for very long. Um, left Ebay about a year and a half later and launched nasty gal.com which is now kind of a full on fashion ecommerce, commerce, a destination. We carry brands, we design our own product and we still sell vintage. Um, and I guess I'm an author, so there's that too. I wrote a book last year that spent a bunch of time on the, on the bestseller list and it was called girl boss. It's called Hashtag girl boss, but thing Hashtag out loud. It's kind of weird.

Speaker 1:          00:06:25       I mean you're a multihyphenate, you've done a lot to to put some numbers or stats to it. Uh, and I'm reading off of a, just the reading that I've done, so I'd love for, feel free to correct me, but it sounds like company has customers in more than 60 countries. It was the fastest growing retailer in 2012 according to ink magazine. Uh, and I guess at one point at least it sounds like, and again, I'm reading from online, so who knows how verified this is. But, uh, I guess in 2011 when it was started in 2006 and by 2011, revenue is like 24 million or so marking I guess in 11,000 plus three year growth rate. So very impressive stuff. Uh, very impressive. Uh, and the, uh, I have to, I cannot resist asking about some of these bullets before we get into that whole story.

Speaker 1:          00:07:23       I apologize in advance. So for, for those who are wondering how this podcast gets put together, uh, I usually like to, not not rehearsed, but send some prompts for guests are on the show. So one of the sentences that I send out is can you please send some bullets with a handful of topics and are questions that will lead to actionable tips, advice, comma, funny stories, comma or resource and how to recommendations. So funny stories. The first I just went straight for funding. Oh No, it was awesome. So I'm just going to read the first five and then we're going to dig into one. So bullet number one, I once poop my pants in high school. We're going to come back to that. Number two. I have three poodles that are all related. Number three, and I'm paraphrasing here, I lived on a street called called orange blossom twice in different parts of California.

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       I love Karaoke and the then the, the last bill it, I'll read it. I'm a big supporter of reality TV because it's cheaper and healthier than weed or alcohol. So people love the embarrassing stories. I woke up this morning for the first time, I just adopted a rescue puppy about six weeks ago. She's five months old. I woke up and she's never pooped in the house and woke up and she, she's been crate trained and looking at the crate, it looked like someone had taken a handful of mud and throwing it into a Cuisinart. She somehow managed to diarrhea in every direction, including on the top of the cage. I don't know how this is possible. Yeah, yeah. Unless you're like a Cirque de Solei athlete who's had whatever,

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       a two I should drink. But in any case, so this is on the mind, obviously, it's all clean up. She's fine. She's chilling. Molly's good. But tell me about this, this high school incident. I, uh, I have to, I have to ask since it was sent over.

Speaker 2:          00:09:10       Oh my God. Well, um, I was at this guy's house. I was like 16 years old. I was at this guy's house who was like, it's amazing basis. He played this thing called a war guitar, which is base. It's like a, it's like a base with, I don't have a ton of strings on it. And you, it's, you basically just play the fret board. And he was just thinking, it's weird. Like proggy musician and I thought was super cool. Um, and he was like, I don't know, maybe he was like 19. I thought that was amazing. And, um, I went to his house, he like lived with his dad and got there like, I don't know, after like 15 minutes and my stomach was just like, uh, oh. Um, I had eaten some, some pepperoni pizza. I think like the kind that has cheese that you can almost drank, like not, um, not the, not like, you know, not like Boutiquey La Pizza or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       It's like, it was like, it was like gnarly pepperoni pizza, just like mouthfuls of cheese. Anyway. Um, I was like, oh no, I don't want to use this guy's bathroom. I'm not sure what's going on here, but I should probably leave. So after like 15 minutes at his house, I, I left, um, and I started driving down the street. It wasn't like, oh Geeze, well if I find a toilet then I'll be happy about it. It was like, oh, I really need it toilet. Um, and I stopped at this liquor store and walked inside and I was like, do you guys have a restroom I can use? And they were like, no, sorry. It's for employees only. I thought age, it would have been confusing if I had like lied and said I was pregnant.

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       I've done that before. Um, oh, you won an awful person. Oh. Um, and then so I got back in my car and drove, I was in like 1991 Honda civic with a little like, like a little like, like a racing steering wheel. It was pretty funny. Um, and I drove it on the street and stopped at a gas station and got out and it was like step step, frankly, just like, oh, I didn't even make it inside. And it was just like, you know, when something like that happens to you, you wonder if you're going to spend the rest of your life doing that like uncontrollably because it's just so, it's so shocking. Like it, it just shouldn't happen. Um, and, and I, I just like I had to get back in my car and like finish, like finish. And then I had to drive home and, and you know, sitting in my, in my,

Speaker 5:          00:11:32       I'm sorry. That's, that's, that's, that's my pitch. I apologize for that. But so you see

Speaker 2:          00:11:39       same story

Speaker 5:          00:11:41       and uh, so I have number of friends who swapped the stories. Sorry, my dog's freaking out guys. Ah, okay. This is a podcast verite. Uh, are you there? Yeah. Okay. Coming back to the topic at hand. So I have a number of friends who are athletes and I've been competitive athletes and guys take all sorts of disgusting preworkout products and so on. And these guys trade stories of what they call fouling out. So what happened to you? They would call fouling out and, Oh my God, I'm not alone. People are out there. No, you're not alone. And, um, so I'll, I'll trade of just a really quick one because I think that most guys who've tried to gain muscle and taken a lot of horrible supplements will somehow identify with this. So I was on my way driving on my way to Sfo, right? Driving to the airport. And I had had a bunch of creatine monohydrate, a bunch of coffee, and then I think what's called MCT oil, which is the ultimate recipe for disaster pants. I now realize in retrospect, but got halfway to the airport, I'm racing to the flight deck and had the exact experience that you did like just viciously shat myself. And so I,

Speaker 2:          00:13:01       it's like throwing up, it comes in waves.

Speaker 5:          00:13:03       Oh I was the worst. That's like throwing up. It's so true. So then I had to basically like clean myself up with my own boxers, like running to the airport, get through security and then go deal with myself. But so for those people out there who've had this experience, you're not alone. And that what you said also like the steps kind of like steps, step, Bang. It made me think of like San Francisco Doula midwifery and whatnot because they're like, oh, when you're trying to have a natural birth, if you're doing it at home, you can have a pregnant woman like walk on a curb just like one foot on, one foot off. And that's a one way to like kind of pop the baby out. So wow. You know, all kinds of stuff. Well, yeah, for our baby before baby sounds like a horrible tragedy. Uh, but uh, how did the business start in yet? And I think a lot of people know, they know you, they know your photograph, they've seen the book. Uh, they're very familiar with the company as it exists now. But like what was the, what was the moment in which you decided to start selling clothing?

Speaker 2:          00:14:15       Yeah. Um, I'd never worked in a club thing store and it wasn't, you know, this is the, Ebay was definitely not my way into the fashion industry. That was not my intention. I just was kind of flailing. I want it to be a photographer, but I figuring out how to like schmooze in the art world or talk about my photography and make stuff up about why it was important or all of that stuff just seemed like now, right for me. And not like people were inviting me to do shows, although I did have a show at Adobe books before they went extinct. Do you ever go there?

Speaker 5:          00:14:47       No, this is, this is here in the bay area.

Speaker 2:          00:14:49       Yeah. It was a super cool book store in San, but I don't know, I was like working at the Academy of Art University in downtown San Francisco. On how, how old were you at that point? I was 22. Okay. Got It. And I got that job because I needed to have a hernia fixed. I don't know how I got a hernia, but I had no health insurance. I had to get a job so I could get health insurance so I could get my hernia fixed. And I had to work at this job for three months to get health insurance. So I did, but I was working in the lobby just like checking student ids and sometimes worked like late at night and was [inaudible] had time to kill on the Internet. Um, and was getting friend requests on my space. I'm not sure if anyone remembers. I'm kidding. Um, and so I was getting friend requests on my space from Ebay sellers that were promoting their businesses on my space and I wore almost entirely vintage at the time and I knew where to find it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:47       And I saw the prices that these vintage pieces were fetching on Ebay and said, hey, you know, I can find them for way cheaper. Um, I know how to take a picture. I'm pretty sure I know how to use the Internet. Um, and Ebay, Ebay was a great place to start. You know, there's a kind of like a framework for you to sell online. It's really easy today. But then building a website like a web shop wasn't, you know, it wasn't as easy. So I started with Ebay and you also have a built in customer base there. You put something and you can test, you can test like what works or if people like your taste, your taste or what you have to bring to the table. So I bought on Ebay for dummies and uh, had a friend model for free, you know, and just found some vintage, sold some of my stuff. And it was very, you know, you can get a read on what people like really, really quickly on Ebay because they watch stuff. Right. There's something called watching, which is basically like you're, you're like monitoring it. Are you adding to your favorites? You want to see what happens with the auction over the course of the week or 10 days?

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       How did you know where to find vintage clothing?

Speaker 2:          00:16:55       I, it was like all I wore, so I just, I had spent, I've just spent my youth in thrift stores, like discovering, just unearthing stuff that no one else wanted, that I thought it was really special and I made a, made a career out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:17:09       Did you have a favorite thrift store at the time? In the bay area?

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       Um, let me think. Uh, at the time, I don't know. No, none of them are just, none of them are a real like gold mine anymore. I like to state sales a lot because you can encounter people who have no idea what they have that's becoming rarer and rarer. And thrift stores are like onto vintage being valuable. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       how would you find at the time, how would you find the estate sales? Just look in the newspaper or like a craigslist. I'm nothing man. I'm chilling.

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       Yeah. Craigslist and the newspaper. Yeah. And I like line up with all these people that were, I don't know, way older than me at like 6:00 AM to be the first people in. And I just run straight for the closet and hope whoever died had great style.

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       I saw the end. I didn't watch, I didn't see the entire thing. My girlfriend is watching it at the end of this documentary about a, I want to say a fashion icon named Iris who's now or when it was recorded or filmed in her nineties 93 and she has awesome style, but I think it'll be hard to get to her estate still. I, yeah. So you got, you get Ebay for dummies, you know where to find the vintage clothing. Um, take a picture. No, I how to take a picture and you're getting an indication of what works or what people are at least interested in. Right through the watching. What was, do you remember your first sale or your first day of sales?

Speaker 2:          00:18:45       Yeah, it was like, well it was, uh, it was, it was a week of auctions. So I watched what happened over the course of the week. And at the very end, some stuff goes crazy because people swoop in at the last minute trying to steal it from whoever was in the lead. And, you know, sometimes nothing happens, but I learned really quickly what, you know, what was working and what wasn't and tweak that, you know, every, with every auction, with everything I, I bought and I watched my competitors and I watched what they were doing and I just, I tried to do a better job and I don't know

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       what, what, uh, what are some examples of maybe some of the things that you noticed in those initial tests and that you could be better at?

Speaker 2:          00:19:27       Yeah. Um, well the thumbnails are the thing that attract that Amy, you, you evaluate everything as you browse Ebay, buy a thumbnail and the title of the item. And those are two things that you can optimize just to kind of infinity. I mean there's a limited amount of space, but I knew that using images that were really bright where you could see the silhouette of the item, Ebay thumbnails had gotten a lot bigger, but at the time they were teeny tiny, teeny tiny. Um, so making it really obvious what the, what the item was and even showing, you know, I had a, uh, I would split the image in half and have half of the thumbnail be a full, like a full length shot of the item. And then I'd have like a detail shot like on the maybe the right hand side and the description. So I mean, the selling vintage is, is such an incredible way to learn perceived value because unless you're selling something that's like a designer, like a Chanel jacket or whatever, you're buying stuff that you're buying it for the style and you're buying things that have no inherent value, that could be, that are really are someone else's throwaway and exalting them to a level that makes them worth more and, and worth more.

Speaker 2:          00:20:41       I mean, Eva was the customer who determined the price. They started everything at nine 99 and let them choose, I'll let them fight over it, but only they only thought over it because I turned it into something really special. Um, and I breathed new life into these forgotten about things.

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       And what were, I mean, as a, as a copywriter, how did you accomplish that? Um, and maybe that's a nonspecific question that's unhelpful. I'm just first for instance. I mean a lot of people bring up, uh, I think it's influenced by Robert Kel Deni and they talk about, say you'd get a scarcity time, restrictions, et Cetera, eh, as sort of tools of persuasion that can be used for, for good or ill means. Um, but there, what did you, how did you learn to write persuasive copy?

Speaker 2:          00:21:33       Um, I don't know. My mom was a writer and write it. Reading and writing was always, I mean, it sounds like so, so basic, but it was just something that she always took a lot of pride in. And, um, something that I really cared about and I guess I had a voice. I didn't realize that until later on when I re, you know, when I realized it was building a brand because there were so many specific things that were, had become part of the nasty y'all DNA. Um, but you can take something that may be like an eighties, like big ass, you know, coat KP thing that, you know, some, you know, overweight lady might've bought. Um, and turn it into like this, like avant garde. I mean, you can use a word like avant garde for something that could be perceived as like outdated and funky on the wrong person, like a lady with a perm or just like the coolest thing on some like kid with a weird haircut, you know, on the sidewalk. So it's all about context, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       So a couple of things. Um, the, the first is thumbnails. We're doing this over Skype, uh, for those people who always ask me, I'm using he cam call recorder to record this and the Audio Technica Atr 2100 Mike, which is about 60 bucks on Amazon. Uh, but your thumbnail for Skype is this rad looking chick. I don't know who, she is a hoot. It's a bunch of bikers, naked female bikers and one of them has, it looks like a tattoo of flowers and something over one breast and she's holding a knife. I can't really tell exactly what's going on.

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       Yep. That's pretty accurate.

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       Where is this from or how did you,

Speaker 2:          00:23:21       um, so I'm, I'm working on, I'm working on my second book. Um, and I've been like pulling images. There's all kinds of inspiration. Some of it will be used in the book. And this is actually an image from a movie called girl boss, Girl boss, gorilla

Speaker 1:          00:23:39       gorilla, g. U. E. R.

Speaker 2:          00:23:42       Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So that was a film that I saw a long time ago that was kind of the inspiration for the name of girl boss. And very few people know that there's a whole genre of Japanese, um, like cinema called pinky violence or just pinky films. And it's pretty much like all female revenge and like girl gangs and they're so cool. Like they're super stylish and Terentino's ripped a lot from them. Um, and this, this one, this is from girl boss gorilla,

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       I think battle royale, I want to say is one of those comic books, one of the most violent.

Speaker 2:          00:24:20       Uh Huh. I've seen it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:21       Violent things you could possibly imagine, which makes you then think of some of say the fight scenes in like kill bill in some capacity. But coming back to the writing for a second, let me start with a question that I always ask and we'll go from there. What is the book that you've gifted most to other people?

Speaker 2:          00:24:40       So the book that I have gifted most to other people is uh, the richest man in Babylon, which I talk about in girl boss and it's was written like a hundred years ago and it's written as though it was written in biblical times or something. A parable.

Speaker 1:          00:24:55       Oh yeah, it's a parable or, yeah, it'd be a parable. It'd be like the alchemist.

Speaker 2:          00:25:00       Yeah. It's like, it's basically parable set in ancient times describing someone who goes about this guy who goes about, I forget his name, trying to find out how he can make money. How can you, you can make a life for himself and his family and he encounters all these different people and lessons along the way. Um, and the advice is very, there's some really simple advice like save 10% of everything that you earn. Don't take advice from the baker if you want to be a cobbler, you know? Um, and it's something that anyone can read and understand. It's like a, it's like a one hour or two hour read. It's the tiniest little book and a hundred years later all of the advice still holds up, which I find really great. Um, and it's like a, it's a, it's a cheap book and I'm a cheap giver, so I'm kidding. I'm kidding. So it would be that, it would be that in my book, I guess

Speaker 1:          00:25:52       the richest man in Babylon. And what, uh, what other writers, just from a writing perspective, so you said your, uh, you said your mother was right or your father, my mom. What type of writing did she do?

Speaker 2:          00:26:05       Well, she sold houses for a long time and then kind of quit doing that and started writing about real estate. And now she writes about all kinds of stuff and she's working on her own book. Um, but yeah. Wait, what was the question?

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       The question was, I was, I was stuttering and stammering my way to the question, which was what do you have any favorite writers or writers that you admire have influenced you? Any of the above?

Speaker 2:          00:26:33       Yeah. So, uh, Rainer Maria Roca, I think it's just such like, great. Can you say that one more time please? I think it's Maria Rilke. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, so on love and other, what's it called on loving other, um, maybe it's just on love. I don't know. Everything I read almost like everything that I learned from actually reading things or, um, on earth thing culture happened before I started the business because after, basically, since I was 22, so it's been almost a decade. Um, I feel like my personal, I dunno, my quest for, for for knowledge was fulfilled by all this shit, all the challenges that come with building a business. And so things like books that I read for fun and not books that I read to learn stuff kind of went out the door. Right. It's like all nonfiction.

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       The discretionary extracurricular just kind of got consumed, are displaced by the work

Speaker 2:          00:27:40       kind of. Yeah. It's like I only read things that I can do something practical with now. Just, I don't know, not, not, not something that makes for a lot of relaxation, but

Speaker 1:          00:27:50       fun. So Rainer Maria, Rilke, uh, if that's, I'm sure I'm pronouncing that incorrectly, but he's come up actually in my life in the last 48 hours of a two separate people recommend reading. And I did read this long, long time ago, but letters to a young poet. Yes. From 1929. Uh, so what did you do? You said it's not relaxing and I know we're hopping around a lot, but what do you do to relax? Let's just say, looking back at some of the either tougher periods or fastest growing periods in your company, what did you do to decompress? I mean, when you felt overwhelmed or burned out, what did you do? How did you manage that?

Speaker 2:          00:28:29       God, sometimes you just kind of explode and hopefully no one else is around. Um, when I was like, I was like crying last night. Uh, also,

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       why were you crying last night? I can't let that go.

Speaker 2:          00:28:42       Oh my God. I don't know. Just because, because running a business is really hard.

Speaker 1:          00:28:48       Um, and what do you mean? What do you do? I mean, do you cry for like five minutes and you're done? Do you cry for longer than that? Do you?

Speaker 2:          00:28:54       Yeah, I cried for like five minutes and then I was done. She was kind of like, this feels good, so I'm going to just let it happen for a second. Yeah. Um, yeah. It's just like, fuck it. It was just one of those was the long day. Um, yeah. But right now, the thing that relaxes me the most is to tuning in and turning off with reality TV. Hmm. Uh, I don't know. I just finished watching the entire season of the worst show. It's not, the people are not even compelling. They're like not funny. It's, it's, it's so bad, but it, you can't stop watching it. It's called dating naked,

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       eating naked. Oh my God. I've seen, I remember I saw a few minutes of this in like a waiting room at a doctor or something. And I was like, that is the most ridiculous

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       premise I've ever seen, but I couldn't stop watching it.

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       So dumb. So, um, but I can't, you can't stop watching it. You're like, Ooh, they're buds. And you're like, but I'm like watching this show. I Dunno. Um, yeah. What else do I do to relax? Hang out with my dogs? They're cool. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:30:01       these are, these are, these are the three poodles that are related.

Speaker 2:          00:30:04       They're all siblings. Yeah. And they're different ages. They're like from different letters, but their parents like, yeah, their parents have been busy.

Speaker 5:          00:30:13       What are their, what are their names?

Speaker 2:          00:30:15       Um, Donna summer is the oldest one and she was like three and the next one's cozy dozer and cozies like, I dunno, maybe just over a year old. And then there's one named Gino who was named after my husband's grandfather. Um, and he's like, I don't know, maybe eight months.

Speaker 5:          00:30:38       That's that. Gino, I want to talk about naming cause naming and titling is really, I, I've, I've enjoyed reading about how you've gone about it in a few cases. So the girl boss gorilla, I had no idea. So that's new and I need to get that made into a poster in my house cause it's amazing. Uh, second. So Gina's, after the grandfather would have with the two other dogs, how did you come up with those names? Or how were the named,

Speaker 2:          00:31:01       I dunno. Donna was just like, well it was kind of like, can we name her Donna bummer. And then it was like, but that's not very nice. Caleb's name. They were Donna summer. I Dunno. I Dunno why. So it's like she's a cool haircut and then a cozy, it was just like super sleepy. And you know, when we brought Donna home, she was like screaming her head off, just like don't take me away from my parents. And we were like, oh no, we're awful. And then we brought cozy, homey and cozy, just like kind of slapped. There's no, it was just like, I'm cool and she's still like that. So it was just like, let's, let's name our cozy dozer

Speaker 5:          00:31:37       cause he does her now. Nasty Gal. [inaudible] this is Pete. A lot of folks don't know the origin. Where's the name from?

Speaker 2:          00:31:46       So the name Nasty Gal. Um, so I used to work at a record store in San Francisco that's no longer around, um, and Noe valley called street light records and spent a lot of time, I think music was probably like my first love way before fashion. I'm not even sure if I'm in love with fashion. Um, and this, I'm not sure if it was just reissued at that time, but I somehow on covered this album called a nasty out by a woman named Betty Davis, who I think is becoming, become more well known. But, um, she is the ex wife of miles Davis and she's just like super outspoken funk singer with a really great band behind her and just the Super Raunchy like awesome lyrics and she just doesn't give a fuck. Um, so when I was choosing a name for my Ebay store, which I never thought I'd be, you know, I never thought I'd be talking about it this much, you know, nine later you just fine. I still like the name. Um, I thought I thought nasty gal would be good because there were so many other ebay sellers who, whose business names were like lady standing in the desk or you know, like, or like lady in tall grass or like Boho, just like so like Bohemian and kind of like expected. And I was like, I'm going to name it nasty Gal. I Dunno. I'm just like, I'm an m antagonistic and I don't know I'm at work.

Speaker 5:          00:33:07       What uh, looking back at Nasty Gal, I guess a couple of questions. One is I've read in different places, well different accounts of this. Why Levy Vba? What uh, what? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:33:22       one second. Did I actually say that she has an album called nasty gal? Because I think I didn't, cause I think I just talked about this lady named Betty do.

Speaker 5:          00:33:30       Ah, all right, well that, that's helpful to have that tidbit then. So the album name is nasty gal. Hence yes. Bang. Okay, cool. Uh, the transition off of Ebay, how did that have that happy? What's the, what's the story behind that?

Speaker 2:          00:33:46       Well, it wasn't much of a transition, you know, I like to make promises that I'm not sure I can keep and then figuring out how to keep them. It's happened a few times in my life,

Speaker 5:          00:33:54       um, that we will come back to that.

Speaker 2:          00:33:57       Yeah, it's good. I think you can like will things into happening by just like committing to them sometimes. Um, and so I was started, started to promote the idea of this, you know, coming soon. Nasty Gal, Dotcom, Nasty Gal, vintage.com was actually the first URL I had to buy nasty gal. Dot. Come from, you can guess who? Um, but I, I had started to leave feedback from my customers

Speaker 5:          00:34:24       second. All right. I actually kick guess. I'm like, Bet Davis. I can't imagine that's no. Who did you have to buy from one of the boring company? Yes. All right, got it. Can you do that through a broker? Do you to reach out to them directly or how did it

Speaker 2:          00:34:41       and did it through a broker.

Speaker 5:          00:34:42       Got It. And where does someone find such a broker to help them if they want to do that?

Speaker 2:          00:34:46       I don't remember. Someone introduced me to this guy and it was like, it was $8,000.

Speaker 5:          00:34:50       Nice. That's a good investment right there. So sorry to interrupt, but I had to, my head was spinning with all these incorrect answers so, so you get the domain you've put up coming soon.

Speaker 2:          00:35:03       But at the domain domain. Yeah, coming soon, you know, nasty gal vintage. And I had started to leave feedback for my customers on Ebay saying like, hey come come the coming soon as y'all vantage.com. And I was like, Oh shit, I better build a website. Better actually do this. So I figured it out. I launched the website, um, and when I launched the website, Ebay decided to suspend me at around the same time. So it was not a transition. It was literally like, I'm going to try this website thing. I hope I can go back to Ebay if it doesn't work out. But it'd be, it was very, it became apparent pretty quickly that that wasn't going to be an option. I got suspended for leaving a URL in the feedback for yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:35:43       Ebay,

Speaker 2:          00:35:43       if it doesn't want to send, they don't want you sending traffic off their website.

Speaker 5:          00:35:47       Yeah. [inaudible] on the stealing our customers a from there. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:35:52       nay on the Ebay.

Speaker 5:          00:35:55       Right, exactly. Uh, so the, so what the hell did you do? I mean if, if suddenly Bam, that entire ecosystem is turned off. What happened in the next kind of like 24, 48 hours?

Speaker 2:          00:36:10       Um, I had, well some people, some, some editors had heard or seen on the my space profile that I was going to watch your website and they did a little coverage. I bet when they, when it, when it launched and it launched, it was his kind of like, there was a lot of pent up demand I had, I didn't know I would have any traffic, but the website sold out just instantly. It was like an hour and there was maybe 150 items on the website when we launch, but there's only one of each of those things that are just one of a kind of, you just 150 orders still seems like a lot for your first day of doing business. It was just like, I had like Kelly Ripa stylist calling me asking if I had another one of those like extras though, isn't it like vintage jacket and an extra small? It's like, no, it's one of was crying and I don't know, it was, it was very serendipitous that it, that it worked at all and that, you know, I, I was able to not have to go back to Ebay is even a sentence somehow.

Speaker 5:          00:37:06       No, I think we, I think we can work without punctuation in this conversation. Okay. The, uh, especially since I've had enough enough tea now, uh, and uh, butter and coconut oil two to last me for like a Siberian trek, but I'm digressing the Ebay transition slash booting off of slash jumping, jumping headfirst and growing wings on the way down. That was how long after you started selling on Ebay

Speaker 2:          00:37:35       that was a oh gosh, a year and a half.

Speaker 5:          00:37:39       And at the, at the point that you launched your site, what we did sales look like on Ebay for you, if you recall?

Speaker 2:          00:37:47       Yeah, so the first year on Ebay was like 75,000 in revenue, which, you know, I wasn't paying myself. I mean I didn't need stuff. I lived in a pool house for $500 a month. Like I drove an 87 Volvo. Like I didn't, I hate Boston market and subway, you know, like all the time. So it was, that was like winning a lottery.

Speaker 5:          00:38:06       Yeah. Oh for sure. I think Boston markets underrated. I used it kind of, that's like trader Joe's and Boston markets. Like don't knock it until you try it. Uh, and then you start getting these inquiries from say Kelly Ripa style. She is extra small. Um, having been on that show on, she is tiny, such great shape. She is an amazing shape. Uh, how did you develop those

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       relationships with editors and so on? Or was it all out of the blue? I mean, did you ping them? No, it was sitting here

Speaker 2:          00:38:43       like totally inbound at that point and there wasn't like a giant, you know, there wasn't a ton of news embryo. It was daily Candy, um, you know, rest in peace and uh, who, what, where and they just kind of, they had, they followed me on my space, they heard about the launch and they decided to talk about it and the kind of coverage I got with stuff that brands like car, we'll pay, you know, tens of thousands of dollars you know, for. But when you're doing something cool, people want to talk about it. And I guess it was cool. I mean I hate saying that I'm cool, but

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       no, you can say it was cool because if you were like, let me tell you how I'm cool, it would be one thing. But you're talking about how the, how the, the launch was cool. That's fair. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       They liked it. So they talked about it. If you have something great, people will talk about it. I think that's just kind of like a rule of the Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:39:32       And if, if someone were launching now, not necessarily fashion or anything like that, but they say, I have this idea for x, let's just, let's, we can think something up like a vintage toy cars, let's just say I'm sure it's been done, but, and they say, you know, I would like to figure out, I would like to build a business based on this. What, uh, what advice would you give them in terms of kind of testing or de-risking or testing the waters in any way? Um, or you can answer that in any way really that you'd like, but if you had that conversation with someone, and I'm sure you have had probably ad Nauseum, these types of conversations, but, uh, assuming they're pretty smart, they're willing to do the work, they're detail oriented, like what would you say to them?

Speaker 2:          00:40:20       I would say it's, it's really great to test your product. Um, I'm, my mom is like, I'm going to talk about something before I even launched it and make a big stink about it. The thing that I'm not, you know, who knows if it's gonna work out. And that's just, just me being kind of like short attention span, um, instant gratification. But I really think there's a lot of value and, and being patient and testing things with like a small group before you go out there and tell the world today, you know, here I am fully formed, you know, buy into my style, you know, buy into what I'm doing. Um, I think there's just a lot of resources for, I mean it's, as far as selling online goes, it's, I mean, it's like having a lemonade stand at this point. So it's incredibly easy thing to do. Your product should be really differentiated and the way you talk about it, um, should be unique and really thoughtful and regardless of whether you're selling, you know, use diapers or use toy cars, um, sorry, um, you, you should, you should, you should really, really invest in presenting yourself well, and there's websites like Squarespace obviously, that, that make that so easy now, um, so much easier than it used to be. Finding a graphic designer that can make something look like what you can plug into now for almost no money is, is incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:41:41       Yeah. No, the, the infrastructure, I mean the, the rentable infrastructure per se, whether it's a Squarespace or a wordpress or someone else. Uh, I mean you can, you can have a site up and running within an hour or two and then you could use, you'd, I've mentioned them in the four hour work week, but even the marketplaces that exist now for things like designers, writers, illustrators, like in 99 designs or Fiverr or something like that. I mean, I'm having no illustrations done for a book right now. Um, with the non Spec version of 99 designs, these kind of one on one projects and the quality is obscene. Lee High, I mean, I've been very, very impressed. So it is a lot easier. Uh, in particularly with things like Kickstarter, I think you have also the ability to see how strong your pitches right before you buy inventory or manufacturer things. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       yeah. No one cares. You don't have a customer. It's like you got to see if anyone cares.

Speaker 1:          00:42:38       Burst. Yeah, exactly. And if they're willing to part ways with their dollars. What were some books or resources that helped you in the first few years or overall build in building nasty gal

Speaker 2:          00:42:53       early? Um, I would say, I would say in the dummies guides or not. I mean, they're fine. They're really fine. When I went to raise venture capital, there's one called, I think it's something like how to be smarter than your venture capitalists, like literary something like that. And I I that and I was like, you know, I've raised $70 million. So I guess I figured that out. Um, and there was a book called no man's land that I thought was really good. It was about just that period of time or you're too small to be big and you're too big to be small. And most people, higher middle management, but middle management have never seen the top. So then you hire more senior management. And I've done that. And even that's challenging. So, I mean there's no silver bullet, but reading other people, reading about other people's experiences of growing and struggling with scaling a business always makes you feel better.

Speaker 1:          00:43:44       Is the book that you were thinking of venture deals be smarter than your lawyer and venture capitalists?

Speaker 2:          00:43:49       No. It's, maybe it's called like how to outsmart your venture capitalist or something. How to train your venture capitalist. Yeah. Basically. Um, how to be smarter than your venture capitalists. That's what it's called. At least that's what's coming up in the search results. Let me see how to be smarter than your venture capitalist. No. Oh, venture deals be smarter than your lawyer, I guess. That's it. Yeah. Okay. All right, cool. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:15       Venture deals for people interested in this world is a, is a great book. That's Brad Feld and his partner. Um, very, very good investors. Uh, what, what were some of the biggest challenges for scaling an ecommerce business? What were some of the harder things that you guys, that you had to contend with? Let's just, let's just keep it focused on, on you. But the company of course, as it's growing, um, and I've spoken with people like Phil Libin of Evernote on the podcast and he's like, well, like this, you know, Gent who runs Rakuten. He's saying you should always plan on like what if it's three times bigger? What if it's 10 times bigger? They're sort of these phase shifts where, where systems have to be completely redone. But for, for you in growing the company, what were some of the, what were some of the hardest periods for you?

Speaker 2:          00:45:05       Yeah, I would say I would, scaling is really hard. So I would say infrastructure, so systems and we still don't have the systems that we would like to have to be able to plan our business and evaluate our business and talk about it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       What would be some examples of what systems?

Speaker 2:          00:45:24       I mean it's really kind of like unglamorous stuff, like an Erp system, like enterprise resource planning, which basically connects the dots between, uh, you know, different departments like finance and, um, you know, merchandise, whatever. Austin. Right now, everything that we do is living in kind of disparate systems that don't talk as much as they could. Right. Um, so that's, that's a struggle today. Um, what else? I mean, I would say people, I would say like, you know, being, having never really been a manager prior to starting the business that has asked to gal. Um, you know, my dream scenario at one point was, you know, it was not getting out of a bathroom and eating Boston market, like, you know, with my hands and then, you know, and then, and then encountering, you know, hundreds of, uh, you know, a team of hundreds who are looking up at you. That's like a really scary thing. And they all assume, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:46:24       I thought you meant your dream was walking into the office of hundreds of people in your bathroom. And it's like, that's very wolf of Wall Street. Like, oh wow. I kind of liked that visual, like eating lobster tails while you walk through the office.

Speaker 2:          00:46:34       I would totally, I would do that, but I have, um, should I start over because I didn't make it?

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It does make sense. I be how, what did you view your, now you are, you are no longer CEO. Is that correct? No. Yes. Correct. When you were Ceo, what did you view as your job? Like

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       as entrepreneurs to you? It's really tough because there's so many things that I've been a part of and done over the course of the company's history. And I'm also kind of the brand, the brand cop. Um, and the brand is my voice. Um, and the vision has kind of grown out of the, the beginnings, the DNA of what was nasty gal origin story. So there's never been a point where I could just be like the cut and dry. I'm the CEO kind of person, you know, I'm the cultural leader and the, all of these things, it was so things, um, so you know, when, when you're, when you're growing a business, it's really hard to say, no, I'm not going to plug that hole. I'm not going to edit the photos. I'm not going to, you know, companies spring leaks and when you have, when, when you've done so many different things, it's, it's easy to sprout arms and fingers and just start like, you know, over extending yourself by filling in the gaps as they present themselves, um, over the course of, you know, so it was, it was not, I don't think I got to choose my, what I did as much as I perhaps would have liked to.

Speaker 2:          00:48:05       And I'm even today, I'm not, I'm not sure if I have that privilege because you kind of have to do what the company needs you to do for it to continue operating or to be its very best. And nine years of that is a really long time. Um, and I th I think my greatest strengths are with the brand and with, with marketing the brand and with the creative and um, the things that in the beginning built built nasty gal. And that's what I'm hoping I can focus on today.

Speaker 1:          00:48:37       How do you, how do you keep, try to keep the team on the same page so that that sort of brand aesthetic and spirit doesn't get fragmented and turn it into some Frankenstein monster where you've become brands that you loathe or whatever you get there. How do you, how do you try to do that?

Speaker 2:          00:48:57       You're going to really quickly become a caricature of yourself. I'm like, yeah. Um, uh, yeah, like a spoof of like what you've done best. And I think it's a, it's a matter of talent but it's also coaching. But at the end of the day I think you really need to have tools that everyone can rally around and say, Hey, this is what it is. This is what the brand is, this is what we're all signing up to do. Not this is my idea versus your idea versus your idea. Cause I think culture like in a, um, in a, in a, in a business that people really excited or excited to work at culture can be used as a weapon. I think the brand can be used as a weapon. I think there, you know, there have been times where people who are really cool and actually do get yet what the brand is, find themselves really frustrated because not everybody gets it the way did they do.

Speaker 2:          00:49:47       And they start to say, well, Sophia, Sophia said this or Sophia wouldn't like that. And it's like, I don't want to be, don't sling me around. Like that's not cool. Um, and so we've been spending the last several, several months actually working on some what of a brand bible, but also just filters for how we make decisions about what the voices and how we, how we take pictures and you know, the, the world that, that is a nasty gal world and what the, you know, what the guard rails are that people can explore within. We always want to leave room for people to be creative, but it takes out a, it takes out the, uh, the objectivity, uh, or wait, yeah, the, all the subjectivity. I'm like, God, my brain's not working. Basically it makes it not personal.

Speaker 1:          00:50:37       So it makes it makes it more objective or depersonalized.

Speaker 2:          00:50:40       Yeah. So it's easy for it to be like, oh, well that's not on brand because I said so. It's like, Oh hey, we're all trying to do the same thing. Let's look at this thing that's just sits outside of us and our tastes, our ego, whatever. Let's talk about what it is rather than what we think it is. So you have to have those things defined for people to have conversations about. And that's something I'm really excited to have.

Speaker 1:          00:51:03       There's a, there's a really cool handbook. Um, I think it's just called the handbook for new employees for a company called valve, which is a software company. Uh, it's one of the coolest sort of employee orientation handbooks that I've ever seen. I had a chance to meet because it was Gabe Newell at one point in Seattle and I was somebody else then recommended. I see this handbook. It's really cool. You should check it out. I think he might enjoy it and people listening might get something out of it. You can find the free pdf if you just search valve employee handbook is pretty sweet.

Speaker 2:          00:51:39       I think I've seen that. It's really beautiful. It's this teeny little cool thing.

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       Yeah. Yeah. It's really well done. Great illustrations. But, uh, lays out the basic ground rules, right. For working within this somewhat unusual culture, uh, that you mentioned the, before I derailed us with the wolf of Wall Street analogy and you walking around in a bathroom eating lobster tails, which actually I have two quick, uh, quick anecdote. So when I was in college, one of my buddies and I was in, I was in New Jersey and one of my buddies ends up calling us from Atlantic city and he's like, there are limos coming to get you. You have to come to Atlantic city. We show up and he's just been on a bender and made like $200,000 blackjack and proceeds to spend it all in the next 48 hours. And he was walking around the casino in a bathrobe eating any ordered lobster tails for everyone on the, on the like blackjacks floor. Wow. It sounds kind of imagining like you could, you could be that person, but with like a Martini glass,

Speaker 2:          00:52:45       I love absurd, just doing absurd things like that can.

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       Uh, so I was going to ask you about, I was going to ask you about managing and I will, but absurd things. What are some absurd things that you've done?

Speaker 2:          00:52:58       Oh my gosh, I'm getting on a bus to call it that. I'm calling a girlboss Hashtag girlboss and well it's like later at the end of this month and we're, it's just the paperback. It's the girl boss paperback and it has a new introduction and it as the introduction to the introduction, I guess just talking about what's happened over the last year a little bit. And we're going to like 10 different cities on this crazy tour bus. It's like I'm a spice girl or something and you know, throwing events at different venues and some bookstores and it's just like, it's really absurd to be riding around like Hillary Clinton and I'm like a campaign bus basically. But Penguin, penguin wanted to do it and I thought it was just like too good to pass up. And it's, it's really funny to have your face and the cover of your book. Like, he likes, you know, slathered across the side of like a giant were us.

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       Yeah. But I would imagine. What about um, managing, let's talk about that. So the managing of people, you had no experience prior to nasty gal. Now it's grown of course tremendously. Um, what were, who were the mentors or what were the things that helped you learn to manage to the extent that you were able,

Speaker 2:          00:54:17       oh my God, I think I'm still learning. Um, wait, say that again.

Speaker 1:          00:54:22       Yeah, that was, but that was a word salad question. Okay. Who are the mentors or the, the resources that helped you learn to manage other people? Because I think that's a weakness of mine quite frankly. I'm good at defining systems, but I'm not always a, for instance, I mean I was raised by, are not raised by us. That's weird. I was coached by a lot of athletic coaches who were always kind of very short with praise. They would, they would not, they didn't do a lot of head pats, but heavy on criticism and very meticulous. And so I am often very bad at providing praise when I probably should because I don't feel like I was ever given it. Therefore it's not really necessary. Uh, I think I'm the same, but that causes all sorts of problems. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:55:15       We don't feel appreciated. And it's like, oh my God, I totally appreciate you. But like I respect your intelligence enough not to like be like, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:55:24       Yeah, it's tough. I mean, because I've always been told by the good stuff, the good stuff. I remember I had a VP of sales at one point when my first job out of college and he said, you know, I, I would give him all the story and the backs or tell him all this stuff about a reclined. He's like, Tim, I don't need the story. I just need to know next steps. And second, I don't need to know the good news cause that takes care of itself. I need to know the bad news. And I was like, oh, okay. And so I've kind of adopted that. But you end up in a position where people can get very demoralized in, in a culture where people aren't getting uh, the, or don't have the ability to celebrate little wins and so on. Who, who has helped you to become a better CEO when you were a CEO or a better manager?

Speaker 2:          00:56:02       I've had some executive coaches along the way. I think knowing the difference and then actually living the difference are two different things. And I think I'm pretty aware of the things that I'm, what my shortcomings are as a manager, as a leader, as a fill in the blank. Um, I'm not, you know, I think I experienced the same thing when you are, especially if you're entrepreneurial, which I think we like, we can both like safely say we are. No one's giving you, no one's giving you those pats on the back. And when you find yourself in a position to be doling those out, you don't, you don't really relate because that's not something that you ever required. I'm an only child. I had a really mean dad. I mean, he's often now, but like it was criticism after criticism and it makes you self aware enough to, uh, to calibrate on your own.

Speaker 2:          00:56:52       And a lot of ways, even though I'm totally open to, I love, you know, criticism and I love, but I think when you, when you're like a solo act at any point in your life and have to manifest things without, without the team, without the amazing team that we have today, you become really good at being your own critic and your own and also your own pat on the back or you're motivated maybe by different things. And that's a hard thing to relate to as an entrepreneur who's leading, who's leading people. And I think that's definitely been one of my shortcomings. Um, but I've, I've, I'm always like seeking advice and I'm always seeking to better myself. I think leadership management chops, whatever you want to call it, is something that comes over time. A lot of things are just learned over time with repetition. And that's something that I have, you know, I've been, that's one part of the job that I've had is managing people or leading people, but there's been a million other things that I've done, uh, over the course of, you know, nasty Gal's trajectory and having someone like Sherry, our CEO who has a lifetime of those chops behind her who wakes up every day inspired, not just inspired to lead people but knows how to do it in a way that will work is such a real, it's such a cool thing to witness.

Speaker 1:          00:58:09       When you were in the CEO role, who were the other CEO's out there alive or dead that you admired and really looked to as role models?

Speaker 2:          00:58:20       Hmm, good question. Um, I mean, I've always admired Natalie Massenet who founded net-a-porter. Um, and she hasn't been the CEO for a long time, but she's, she's just like an incredible woman. Um, why she incredible. Um, she's, she's a mother of I to, uh, she started a company a long, you know, like she started an ecommerce business long before most of us had the idea to, um, she's been told, you know, I mean, I think people like Kinda scoffed when she, you know, she said, I'm going to sell a $30,000 handbag on the internet or sell shoes on the internet or these things that have become really common place. And she's also just a super duper down down to Earth woman who's funny and sweet and gives great advice and who's seen a lot. And um, there's not, there's not a ton of examples that I think are, are similar to hers. Mickey Drexler's also an incredible like CEO

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       Mickey Drexler. Yeah. Do you know who Mickey Drexler is? I don't, I'm embarrassed to say, but I shan't tell the lie. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59:29       He's the, he's the CEO of j crew right now and he used to be the CEO at gap and he's kind of like a retail legend. Um, he's, I think he's called like the merchant prints or merchant king or something like that. Cool. Cool. Nickname. I know, right. I know he's just, he's someone who's given me advice along the way, just really great advice and connected me to people that I've ended up, you know, great people be, get great people. And you know, it's just when you meet someone awesome, you've eats off. It's, it's, it's common that I find the people that they surround themselves with, the people that I also like. And that's, it's just such a cool thing. It's like a, I dunno. It's like you don't have to, it's like, it's like going to, nevermind.

Speaker 5:          01:00:14       No, no, no. I want you to finish that thought. That was good. That was interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:00:17       I was going to start babbling like about Yelp reviews and it's like, it's like a Yelp review for a person. It seems like it wasn't that, it was not an intelligent thought. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:00:24       So I brought up, you know, I should learn to do that more often. I would embarrass myself a lot less. Uh, what were, what, what was some of the advice that, uh, Mickey has given you that to, that has stuck with you? It doesn't have to be specifically business. Could be anything.

Speaker 2:          01:00:42       I mean, his advice was to stay CEO, which is really funny. It's definitely stuck with me, but I ignored it. Um, let me think.

Speaker 5:          01:00:56       Oh, I get, I can give you an escape hatch for this. My memory blows. We can, we can I get an a, I can give you a whole slew of, of pills and potions for that. Uh, but, uh, we, we will do that separately. The, have you met David Cho? No. You haven't? Okay. Somebody asked online what you, what you learned from him? Yeah, yeah, yeah. The, uh, the, the graffiti artists slash artist who ended up, I guess worth 500 million after Facebook, I believe I'm saying his last name.

Speaker 2:          01:01:29       Oh, cool. What did I learn from him? No, I didn't. I, that's cool.

Speaker 5:          01:01:33       But you haven't met him.

Speaker 2:          01:01:34       What I learned about him was everything that you just told me.

Speaker 5:          01:01:37       Okay. Okay. Got It. I've been hoping to, I find his story fascinating, so I'm hoping to connect with him at some point. Yeah. He's just made some really fascinating creative decisions that da I'd love to love to dig into. But, uh, anyway, that's a whole separate story. Uh, the, uh, what, what do you struggle with the most and how do you deal with it?

Speaker 2:          01:02:04       I struggle with doing it all most. I struggle with feeling like I don't have time for everyone who I want to have time for and who I, I assume once my time, um, for, for my friends and for my husband and for my parents and for my team. Um, it's just time is a really finite thing and prioritizing it so that you can, you know, so you can be your best so that you can, you know, have real solid time with people so you can also find time to be alone or to take a vacation. It's just, there's not enough time. Um, so I, I'm always feeling like I'm letting someone down or I'm just, you know, it's like, it's like my calendar is booked up for the next month and a half now and it's just, I, I, it's, it's not always like that, but to look out at the rest of the year, it's kind of like, it's over like the years, you know, years over. That's, that's something, I dunno if I, you know, I kind of hoped that my life isn't always like that, but there's gotta be great things if you're planning that far out. I guess, you know, I feel very lucky for that. Any answer to your question really is, is you're feeling like I don't have all the time. I wish I had to spend with all the people that I wish I could spend it with and how do I deal with that?

Speaker 5:          01:03:20       Yeah. How do you deal with it? And let me ask, uh, just uh, in combination with that, and this is maybe a very silly question, you obviously are very driven and that is sometimes leads people to find it difficult to hit the pause button or downshift. But you've stepped out of the CEO role I would think as an outsider looking in, uh, of course you're still going to be very involved as, as a chairman is chairman. But why can't you create more time? Why can't you block out time?

Speaker 2:          01:03:53       Cause the company still needs me for my things and I still partner with my, my CEO and still spend a lot of time with her. You know, I'm drumming up opportunities for the business, whether it's a collaboration or um, you know, weighing in on, on something creative. You know, I still spend time there. Uh, you know, I've, I've signed up for more things that then I probably should have, but you know, I, I, I, everyone should be. So I don't know. I feel, I feel like saying no is just, it doesn't create opportunity. So I'm throwing all that I can into the air and just to see how much I can actually handle. I think, I don't know. I'm a glutton for punishment. Um, so, you know, it's like I'm launching a podcast next month. I'm like promoting this paper paperback. I'm Finna, you know, I'm working on another book.

Speaker 2:          01:04:42       I'm like, who knows. I mean, I want girl boss to become its own thing. Girl boss should be, is, is so much more than a book. It should be a business. It should be, it should be conferences. It should be. It shouldn't be so many things beyond what it, what it is. It's just a matter of of doing it. Um, as of making, making the time and finding the team and Oh my God, what am I going to start another business. I'm not sure, you know, but just doing, doing all I can with all that I have and connecting things that shouldn't connect is what really, really gets me excited because that's where you would, that's where invention happens and that's, that's where I get, that's where I just get like really, really excited about things. So

Speaker 1:          01:05:23       what, what were some of the key inflection points for, uh, for the company? So if you look back over the last 10 years or whatever it is, um, what were some of the key inflection points that allowed nasty gal to become what it is right there? Cause I can think back, for instance, with the four hour work week, I can think very specifically to like the day that Robert Scoble at the time put something on his blog was a clear inflection point that was a clear inflection point. The appearance on Doctor Oz clear inflection point. So a meeting certain people getting advice from say, uh, Michael Gerber who wrote the e myth revisited. And before I even wrote the four hour work week, he said, if you're gonna write a book, write a fucking book. Like don't half ass it because a mediocre book is more of a liability than a help and blah, blah, blah. Right. So, so I can point to very clear introductions, meetings. What are some of those four for you and nasty gal?

Speaker 2:          01:06:25       Yeah, I would say it was launching, I mean the first one would be just launching the Ebay store. The next one would be selling a Chanel jacket that I bought for $8 for a over a thousand. Um, so the next one would probably be launching, launching the website and having it sell out just overnight. And then pretty soon after that, hiring my first employee, um, after that it would be buying things that weren't vintage. So buying a small, medium and large of something from a trade show and bringing in new brands and testing and seeing if our customer had an appetite for more than just vintage, um, which they did. And then it was like, I think just didn't just, you know, scale scaling isn't, that's not a, that's an inflection point. But what happened? We outgrew our space and Venetia, I mean, we've moved so many times, but I would say after that it was raising $50 million from index ventures. Um, for me personally, it was four pages in Forbes in 2012.

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       How did the four pages in Forbes happen? Because there's often some backstory, right? Not, not all of them are just gifts from heaven that get dropped in your lap. And maybe this was, but how did that come together? I mean, that's a, that's a significant weight. How did one drop in my lap? No, how did it come together? I'm not saying it did jump in your lap. Forbes. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:07:55       Um, oh my God. The way, the way media works as well. It was, it was, it was someone who I'd met through index, her name was Julie Soopat. And she was friends with someone who wrote it, Forbes and they were getting brunch. And she mentioned me and this, the reporter, um, got interested. And then I had no idea what I was and never talked to the media before. And then Julie, Julie used to run, um, like PR at Youtube and she's, she consults for, for startups and she's kind of like a master of all things, uh, publicity. And she was like, well, now that you have someone writing a profile on you in Forbes, you, you probably need my help. So I don't know if she did a great job and you know, so I hired her and she helped me, helped me, just coach me through it.

Speaker 2:          01:08:45       She was like, they're going to want you to look like a billionaire. That's, that's there. You know, we've had to reshoot other stuff that I worked on with Forbes because they didn't think that the entrepreneur and his hood, he looked like a billionaire. So it's so funny. It's really funny just how all that works. And so now I show up at photo shoots and I'm like, what do you want me to be? Okay, I'm bringing it, you know, it's like so Dorky, but you know, it's like whatever. He just tried to do your best, you do your best. Um, what was that, what was that like? That was cool.

Speaker 1:          01:09:12       That was was, what were some other pieces of advice that you got a, or things you've learned about interacting with media?

Speaker 2:          01:09:19       Um, God, I've learned so much. I feel like I could do it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:25       Give one, always do fact check corrections via email and not fun. Yeah, you need a paper trail of that stuff. I've been missing misquoted so many times. Really? Ah, yeah. And then that will sneak its way into Wikipedia and then it's a big, big quagmire to fix.

Speaker 2:          01:09:44       Hey, I mean, I think it's just that like the media always wants something to talk about and um, they can, they can skew things or their own, you know, for their own fun. And it's, you know, there was a time where I think I believed a lot of what I read out there and I still believe a lot of it, but when there's controversy it's often just to serve. Um, you know, it's clicks and you know, get, yeah. I don't know. It's like I don't know what I'm just kind of babbling, but be careful with what you say. Um, and if you don't have anything to say then just don't say anything. I think it's okay to say no. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:10:25       definitely. And also, I mean one thing that I've learned, cause see if you take something out of context, like one sentence out of a paragraph, it can make you look like, you know, a hero or a complete ass or a misogynist or an asshole or any number of things so that the context is so important. You know, what I've been doing for the last couple of years, if I send a response via email to journalist, I'll just say thank you for using this in its entirety. I do not give permission to slice and dice this if it's going to be cut down. I need to give you permission. And A, not everybody responds well to that, but usually the ones who respond poorly to that, if it's diplomatically worded or the people who already had an agenda to slant something and it really controvert unnecessarily sort of, uh, Cindy Arie waves

Speaker 2:          01:11:11       and even like the most, you know, the best. Some of the best journalists I worked with, they'll write a really positive story and then their throat, they'll throw in some shit just for their own credibility to make sure they don't sound like some big fan. Yeah. So there's always going to be some shit that they like say that you're going to be like grumpy about, but it makes them credible and you just kinda have to like stomach it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:11:33       And you can actually, I mean, you can help them. Also, you can facilitate things by saying like, here are two or three of my detractors, but that'll, that can also give you, um, as long as they're safe, factual attackers. Does that make sense?

Speaker 2:          01:11:49       Yeah. One you walk like an ogre and heels and it's like, no. Like, I'm like, go, go, go dance in public in fucking heels. I'm pretty sure I can. It was just like, no, like, it's fine. But like of all the things like I can walk in heels, you know, like, um, just like pick something, just, there's plenty of things to criticize Jesus. If you, if you catch me in like a, you know, it's in the corner. I'm probably picking my nose. Like, you know, it's just like find something real fun. Hey,

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       uh, when, when are you, when are you happiest?

Speaker 2:          01:12:24       Oh, God. Um, I'm happiest when I'm like running down a trail in big Sur downhill, a little, just a little downhill, like any, any jump and you feel like you fly, like 20 feet is almost like a dream. Um, I think that's the best feeling is being like, I'm in a video game, but it's real. Like this is real life. And I'm like, yeah, I think just like running down a trail in the forest is like maybe the best feeling ever.

Speaker 1:          01:12:55       That's such a good answer. That's a cool, uh, do you, side note, if you come back to San Francisco and I'm sure that'll happen at some point, there's a place called house of air, which is basically a humongous building full of trampolines at different angles and you can feel like you're in the matrix. It's amazing. Uh, do you struggle with depression or anything like that and you don't have to not oh, totally.

Speaker 2:          01:13:23       I just struggle with depression my whole life. I've been in an hour therapy my whole life. They tried to tell me I had add and give me some stuff in high school and they tried to give me the stuff for depression. It's make me, made me feel super wired. Um, I, I think when I got busy that went away. Um, more than anything. I think I started with anxiety so I, I can hit the ceiling by like 11:00 AM. Um, if something just doesn't go right, I mean, I don't like yell or pound my fists. I'm not like a person in the office who throws things. But if I'm like, if I'm not happy, ain't nobody happy. Like in the room, basically. It's just kind of like, it's not, so I don't, I'm not good at hiding my feelings. It's, it's unfortunate. And then there's people who value it and I try to keep those people around. Um, but um, yeah. Had Depression. Depression's like a gnarly, gnarly thing.

Speaker 5:          01:14:17       How do you, how do you contend with that? Uh, and I ask as someone who has similar ups and downs and has for as long as I can remember, but what, what are you, what are your coping mechanisms?

Speaker 2:          01:14:29       Um, if it's, you know, I, it's easy to point at things in your life that are out of your own control. Like I've pointed at who I got married like three months ago, but I have, there's been times where I pointed at Joel and I was like, you're the problem. It's like, no, you're just not, you're not solving your own problems. Like I think you can just look everywhere outside of yourself to fix your problems. And thank God I'm not like, I don't know. It's like addiction issues or anything. Cause I'm totally, if that was, if that was it that ran in my family, I'd be a total mass. I think. Um, um, I, I know that I've been, I'd taken antidepressants at different times, um, and some are better than others. Um, but I just, I generally like to stay pretty kind of, I know alcohol, alcohol can help. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:15:17       Wow. That's so, yeah. I'm not sorry,

Speaker 2:          01:15:23       alcohol reality. I'm telling you I'm playing, I'm playing not to lose more now though, but, um, I mean I can have one glass of wine and I'm like the happiest, most like, uh, like charismatic, like, you know, just fun person when and if uses. Yeah. And when I'm not drinking, I'm like, you don't want to walk up and talk to me. Like I'm not friendly. Like I'm not unfriendly, I'm just not open, you know, I'm just Kinda like stuck in my head, you know. I Dunno.

Speaker 5:          01:15:53       What, what's your go to wine drink or your go to?

Speaker 2:          01:15:58       Yeah. Um, I, I like white wine. A lot of bars don't have white wine, but it would just be like, uh, I don't know. I started drinking chardonnays. I like those. Oh, I got to go. Verts demeanor, which is really good. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:16:16       It's really good. Yeah. Good

Speaker 2:          01:16:18       one is the cliff family, the cliff bar people. I went to this thing in Napa and my God, it's so, I sound like so cool now, but I took a, I I like went on a, on a bike ride was basically my, my investors have a retreat every year and all of the entrepreneurs and they're in the, in the, the, um, the partners at their firm get together and this is at the cow at cal state grants, which is like a really beautiful place in Napa. Gorgeous. Super. Should be pretty schmancy. And then they have these activities, you know, so you don't hear people talk and there's really cool people. Like Jerry Yang spoke at the last one and um, just, it's really interesting. And then they have this, you know, this, these, um, activities. And one of them was, um, you know, road biking and road biking up to a winery and then having a glass of wine. I was like, yeah, I'm getting in shape for my wedding. Like I'm going to drink wine. I should get on a bike first. And Oh my God, these all these guys, they're all European for one and they're like, you know, they're like wealthy guys who like have their own shoes and like all the clothes and like

Speaker 5:          01:17:21       do this. They like to do it as a thing. You know, they're like those guys who've had the cycling so that they're like $5,000 I just thought it was,

Speaker 2:          01:17:28       I thought it was like, I was just like going on a bike ride for fun and I was just, Oh my God. It was the only person that didn't finish it. I did get in the car and like get a ride to the top of the hill anyway, and the top of the, at the top of the hill was cliff family winery. I don't know why I'm like, I'm like, I don't know them. I'm not, I'm trying, I'm not trying to plug anything. It was just like a, I'd never heard of governor [inaudible] and I bought a few bottles into and had it shipped to my house. And um, yeah, I guess, I guess a white crispy wine.

Speaker 5:          01:17:57       Yeah, super. That's super tasty stuff. Uh, sons, Sarah's pretty good go to for a lot of folks. The uh, I guess I usually do it a gin tonics of Hendrickson, Hendrickson soda is kind of my go to if I don't want to have a nasty, nasty headache or Tequila as you've seen

Speaker 2:          01:18:18       really,

Speaker 5:          01:18:20       you have to, you have to go with the good stuff if you're going to do Tequila. So the costs of that are going to, is very expensive but very tasty with that no head. I mean, you saw me, I had a fair amount to drink, but a no headache the next day. No cognitive disfunction felt just fine. Uh, the, uh, when you think of the word successful, and I know that's a gnarly dicey word, but who's the first person who comes to mind for you?

Speaker 2:          01:18:46       Yeah, successful. The word success is really conflicted for me because it sells people this idea that there's like a destination. I think there's people who can, man may have manifested things in the world that make more noise than other people, but success can just be as being a stay at home mom if that's your dream. Success can be, um, having a small business and keeping it that way and keeping in laying low because that's what you want and that's the life that you want. Um, I really want, you know, and as someone who's public, it's kind of like a, it's a, it's a, it's a hairy thing because I'm out there and I'm, I'm, I have a book and you know, I have a business and I sell things and whatever, but it's, I just really want people to remember that they're capable of doing everything that the people they admire or doing.

Speaker 2:          01:19:39       Maybe not everything, but if your own don't be so impressed. I guess that's where, you know where, where my head goes is, you know, there's no reason that you can't have the things that the people that you admire, that you admire have. And so it like access just sells this kind of like ultimate destination when even though I've accomplished something and you've accomplished something and whatever, it's like you, I, I told you I was crying last night and it's not like we who like my, you know, I'm done. I've, I've arrived or anything like that. If you have any amount of hustle and any amount of humility, you know, that it all can go away tomorrow and that you should do everything you can with what you have today. Um, so I guess it's a very philosophical way of saying, when I hear the word success, I don't know what Warren Buffett, I don't, you know, it's like, I dunno. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:20:35       it's tough on you. You said don't ask the cobbler if you're a brick layer or whatever. Yeah. I was thinking of Warren Buffett when you said that because he often says, don't ask a barber if you need a haircut. He's full of those. Totally. Uh, the, let me ask you just a couple of a rapid fire questions. You don't have to have rapid fire answers, but, uh, just because I know that people will ask me why I didn't ask them if I leave them out. What is your favorite documentary or movie?

Speaker 2:          01:21:06       My favorite movie might be I phone called the color, the color of pomegranates and that's by, um, this guy served Sergei Haragei snob. I'm not even sure if I pronounce it correctly. He was like a Georgian, um, filmmaker and it's basically a moving painting. It's just one of the most, there's almost no dialogue. It's just one of the most beautiful songs I've ever seen. And um, I've been, you know, I grew up Greek Orthodox and I'm just still kind of enchanted with the, with Eastern, um, the visuals of like Eastern Europe. Um, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:21:42       Sounds, sounds gorgeous. Yeah. I need to sort of fill up my roster so I'll add that to the list. Uh, what are you world class at that people might not realize or what do your friends know you're world class at that the rest of world doesn't know about it.

Speaker 2:          01:21:56       Um, wait. Um, what, what did I put on my thingy?

Speaker 5:          01:22:01       I Dunno, I didn't read it. So for those people listening, I, um, I send, I could look it up. I, I send some of these questions in advance just so people don't get totally stumped. Um, which happens, uh, but I didn't look at the answers because I want it to be fresh for conversation. Uh, I could pick it up. I can look it up. Uh, bear with me a second. I'll pick it up.

Speaker 2:          01:22:24       Oh my God. I can use my brain. Hold on.

Speaker 5:          01:22:27       That's okay. That's okay. It's a, so let's see. We got a plane catch.

Speaker 2:          01:22:35       Oh my God. Yeah. Um, yeah, I guess playing catch. Yeah, no, I, I'm like, I, I can have really good coordination to the point of it like being freaky. Like if I dropped something, I can be like looking the other direction, like scratching my arm pit with one hand and then like, like swooping and like cat, like reflexes like that happens sometimes, but it always even surprises me. And also I'm good at playing catch.

Speaker 5:          01:23:08       Did you play athletics or sports growing up or no?

Speaker 2:          01:23:12       Um, yeah I played soccer. I mean I played basketball, I played softball when I was like in third grade and then I played soccer a lot. Um, I snowboarded a lot. It never hacky sack.

Speaker 5:          01:23:27       San Francisco awaits. Okay. We can have a, if we can do some like Hula hooping devils, teach me how to break down. I could teach you, I can give some basics. We can do six stepping next time you, you've come along. Uh, what are the most common misconceptions about you?

Speaker 2:          01:23:45       Um, oh, I think people, well I met some people yesterday who thought they were like, I was like, what is, what it's fun surprises. He mass. We spent some time and they, I showed them the office and talk to them about my business and it was like, well, you know, what do you, what surprised you? And they said, well, you're, you're, you're not as egotistical as I thought. You'd be like, wow. I mean, that's not insulting you from any outside. You know, you put yourself on the cover of a book with your hands on your hips and you know, whatever. And, and maybe you expect something different. But that was, that was, that was pleasant.

Speaker 5:          01:24:20       Yeah. It's better than the other way round. Like, wow, you're so much were mega maniacal. And I couldn't, God get me away from you. Uh, if you could have a billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would it, where would you,

Speaker 2:          01:24:36       I could have a billboard. I put nothing on it and I put it everywhere.

Speaker 5:          01:24:42       Just an empty, you know, I'm going to cheat here. I'm going to go back and see if there's anything else that you'd stop telling women to smile.

Speaker 2:          01:24:54       Yeah. That's just like such a grumpy billboard. The right teams. My mind, I'd rather have nothing. You project what you want them to their billboard.

Speaker 5:          01:25:02       But that's, that's, and since I've given you this, this imaginary billboard, you're entitled to do that, but I want to hear the backstory on stop telling women to smile. What's the, what's the, what's the store? Baxter? Well,

Speaker 2:          01:25:15       it's something that I've said. I mean, I've said just like, stop, don't tell me to smile or like, I mean, if you're a girl who's not, like who, who a guy wants to talk to and you intimidate them because you aren't like giggling or whatever, they'll like take a, it's like you're, you're there for, you're there for your pleasure or I don't know what it is, but it's happened to me from as early as I can remember. Just like, you should smile more. Just like, Oh, you look really pretty new smile. And it's like, that's nice. Thanks. Um, but there's something that's like, you're, you're here for me, so can you just smile if I have to like look at you. You know, cause you're making like a woman, a woman evaluating me just makes me feel like emasculated or something kind of, you know, like they just like don't know how to handle it. And it's really frustrating and honestly pretty insulting. And then I found out that there's a woman named, what is her name? I mean she has like this, she's an artist, I think she's in Brooklyn and she started something called stop telling women to smile and someone's telling me about the other day and her name is Tatiana Fuzz. Lee's Foz La [inaudible]. Oh my God. Foz Law leads a day.

Speaker 2:          01:26:26       Yeah. It's just real long name. I'm, I'm embarrassed of how I did that. But um, she has like a like wheat paste posters and like kind of like a campaign, like stop telling women to smile. Like I'm not your baby. That kind of shit. Which is just, I wouldn't put, you know, if I could put one thing on a billboard, it would probably be nothing, maybe nasty gal if it was free, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:26:50       Yeah. What was your, what was your thinking process around, um, stepping down? Stepping out of the CEO role?

Speaker 2:          01:27:01       Yeah. I just, my the things that I find myself that I think I'm good at or not the things that a CEO wakes up everyday to do, I'm running an executive team of sea levels who have more experience, you know, then I've been in, you know, that I've been in business for or, um, it's just, it's like there's a, like I said earlier, there's just a totally different skillset that comes with leading, leading people and um, and giving praise and repeating what you're there, what we're all here to do. There's a lot of repetition actually, and I'm the kind of person that's like, what, you didn't hear me the first time, which is not, I'm not saying I'm proud of that. Um, I just think that's kind of how I, that's just how I roll and I, you know, I, it, it's a whole, if there's an art to leadership and, um, yeah, I wanted, I wanted to focus on the creative parts of the business, you know, I want, you know, the book kind of had its own it be, it kind of made me the face of the company, which I wasn't prior.

Speaker 2:          01:28:06       And so there's things that come along with that that, um, are good for nasty Gal, but take my time and take me out of your office. And there's nothing worse than feeling like your, you've abandoned the people who are reporting to you who need your time. It's just a matter of choosing. Um, so I, you know, I chosen, it was something that had been, that I've been thinking about for a long time. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:28:30       what was, what was the first day like or a night after you made the decision and it was

Speaker 2:          01:28:38       okay,

Speaker 5:          01:28:39       you'd finally kind of made the call and knew that you are no longer going to be CEO.

Speaker 2:          01:28:44       I think it was just a lot of relief, a lot of relief and just feeling like I had done the right thing. I was really happy for Sherry, my CEO, and it just seemed kind of like a non event to our team. I expected more of a reaction, but they were like, what's the difference? Sherry's in all of the all hands meetings and she speaks and we don't know who she is. What's different? That I don't think it was a huge change for most of our team, which felt good. Yes. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. I expected a lot more questions and I was kind of bummed that people weren't, they weren't like, they weren't like, they were like freaked out and they're like, okay, cool. Got It. We've been waiting for you.

Speaker 1:          01:29:29       Don't let the door hit you on the way. I'm just kidding. Uh, what a $100 or less purchase has most positively impacted your life in recent memory?

Speaker 2:          01:29:40       Um, I had a hamburger yesterday. Amber,

Speaker 1:          01:29:46       what kind of have, what kind of hamburger and we're, I mean, was it a particularly early? Huh?

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       Interesting hamburger or I no, no, I mean the one thing, I mean I could, yeah, let me, I can think harder on this, but I,

Speaker 1:          01:29:57       yeah, no, it's basically just inexpensive stuff that you get a lot of value.

Speaker 2:          01:30:04       I'm looking at my, I mean a manicure manicures are like pretty, they're good. They're like, they make you feel better, but they cost like, you know, I get Gel so I don't know, maybe they're like 20 or 30 bucks. Then. Um, you're, you don't hit your hands as much. I don't know what else. Um, under $100 not a lot is under a hundred dollars. It's like a hamburger or you know, probably, I mean probably a glass of lion. Oh God, that's the theme here.

Speaker 1:          01:30:37       That's a glass glass wine. It's good. I actually bought one of my favorite bottles of wine I've ever had. A I bought from trader Joe's. They have great wine service that people really know what they're talking about. It's for $4 for a bottle of white wine. And if you want to upgrade that, you get the, um, I, I really like Rombauer. Sure.

Speaker 2:          01:30:57       Oh yes. Ron is good.

Speaker 1:          01:30:59       Yeah. 2004 I think I had, which was amazing. Uh, and uh, not that expensive. That was the first white wine I ever bought a case of. I thought I would never buy a case of white wine ever. I've always been a red wine guy and Rombauer Chardonnay was the one that made the difference. Um, what does, what does the first 60 minutes of your day look like? Now I'm going to ask that a little retrospectively. When you were CEO of the company, uh, on a, on a, on a, on a day where you look back and you're like, fuck yeah. Kicked ass today. What did the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like? Or what were your morning routine?

Speaker 2:          01:31:37       Yeah, I mean I usually, and a day that ends wells one that started with exercise, that's for sure. Um, yeah, so cute. Um, I usually eat, you know, for breakfast, so I wake up. What time, what time do you wake up? I Dunno, like six 37. Um, most people are like exercising at six 30 or seven, but I'm just, I don't know. I stay up, I'm like, I keep, I, I just keep weird hours. Um, so I wake up, I take my Invisalign out of my mouth because I sleep with these braces in basically. And before that it was a mouth guard cause they clench my teeth cause I'm a freak. But I recently botox my jaw so that I can't clench my teeth as much.

Speaker 5:          01:32:19       Whoa, sweet. You injected fat.

Speaker 2:          01:32:24       Just something that basically makes your muscle weaker so that you don't aren't such a, I'm like, I'm like hulk smash. Like I've clenched my teeth like the fucking hawk.

Speaker 5:          01:32:35       Oh No. I, I sometimes wake up with blow, my God, why don't you call this way looking at your face. That's what I like really over developed jaw muscles. Like a pitfall I do. Let me look at, hold on, let me look at, I'll just go.

Speaker 2:          01:32:51       Okay. Right now. No, but it does, that's what happens. You know, I have a jaw muscle that no, you don't have a strong job, but when you're a girl that is like a kind of a masculine thing, whatever. But yeah, I'd also just, you wake up with a headache. So I did that. That I think that's helping actually. Um, yeah. And then I wake up, I probably, I might pee. Um, I chug water. I'll try a bunch. I tried to check a bunch of water but it don't always, and then I drink coffee with heavy cream in it. Um, yeah. What to, how do you make your coffee? We have a thing called a Jura, like j u r a some company and it's just like basically put the beans in. It grinds them and it's just a coffee maker I guess, but it's like a fancy coffee maker and it does it give you ra? Yeah. Um, and, but I put, I put hot water in the glass. I filled that, filled the mug up about halfway with hot water and then I put the shots of costly. I guess it's a suppressor. I Dunno. Are coffee beans and espresso beans the same thing?

Speaker 5:          01:33:51       Uh, they are often roasted slightly differently. Um, but my understanding is you're just using kind of more beans for the volume in the case of espresso. But the darker the roast is, my understanding is the lower the caffeine is interestingly enough. But uh, but yeah, you're making, you're basically making an American, we use David Lynch, David Lynch, like are you serious? He not, he not only has trends, it'll meditation foundation in schools for at risk at risk youth. He also has his own. Wow Man. I'm really lisping now, but he also has his own coffee.

Speaker 2:          01:34:33       Look up David Lynch copy. I just did. It's pretty good. Um, that's how my husband found it. But um, and then

Speaker 5:          01:34:41       so how can I see, so you have your coffee with h, why heavy cream? I don't know. Someone, I'm a big fan of him.

Speaker 2:          01:34:47       And now the whole thing is that like fat's good for you? So I carry the last, but I already knew that, so. Yep. Um, and then I'll have, um, one of maybe three things. I have rolled oats with, um, a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk and a little bit of salt was raisins usually, um, just made on the stove top and that, or I will have, um, a pancake that I make out of rolled oats. So I crack four egg whites into a bowl and then I put two cups of dry rolled oats in, and then I stirred around and the eggs kind of help the oats congeal and then, yeah. And then I shape it into a pancake in a pan. And then I cook, I like heat it up a little bit, and then I put it on a plate and I put apple sauce on it and a little bit of maple syrup and I eat it. And it's really good. Um, I mean, but it's two ingredients, which is crazy. Um, and it's, it looks, it doesn't look as good as it tastes. It's pretty decent. It's, um,

Speaker 5:          01:35:52       yeah, I bet that'd be really good with like some nuts.

Speaker 2:          01:35:55       Yeah. Or I eat, drink like a white smoothie, which is like a, has apple and Greek yogurt and some cinnamon. Um, and it's just like a pretty simple, but so some of that stuff, some of those recipes came from this guy that I trained with named Harley Pasternak. Have you heard of him?

Speaker 5:          01:36:13       I have heard that name. Yeah, it isn't. He trains with UFC fighters probably. Probably.

Speaker 2:          01:36:18       He's like a celebrity trainer type and he has people that work for him and I mostly,

Speaker 5:          01:36:22       oh, you know what I'm thinking about? Mike Dolce is okay. Instead of Harley. Yes, yes, pastor. But pastor neck

Speaker 2:          01:36:28       Spock's and stuff, he's awesome. And I've just gotten some cool recipes from him. So those are his recipes. Um, and then I'll, I don't know, I guess I shower, you know, and then I'll, I'll go work out, you know, depending, sometimes I do, sometimes they don't. And then start my day. Sometimes I'll roll out of bed and have a phone call and you know, I've, you know, it's like we have a call, we're on a kind of like a call now and it's like, I haven't showered. I don't know. I'm at home. Sometimes I'll have calls for a while before I go into the office. Sometimes I won't go into the office because I'm working on something that I need to focus on. And that's hard to do in the office. And I remember every day is different, but they all start pretty much the same.

Speaker 5:          01:37:06       When you work out, what if you could only choose a couple of exercises for the rest of your life? What would they be? And the reason I'm asking is I saw this photograph on your Instagram account, um, which, uh, which I thought was hilarious and it was, it was you on this, I'd want to say an elliptical. And it said preparing the center for her wedding day or something like that. And because you have a very well, a very well developed and pollutes, uh, put it that way. Very, no, this is purely anatomical speaking as a, as an exercise physiologist. And so those don't look like they came from ellipticals or is that just a god given? That's, I like,

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       I can't cause when I think now you're Greek, Greek, Italian and Portuguese.

Speaker 1:          01:38:02       Oh, all right. That explains it. Okay. So I, I, I knew only about the Greek part. I'm like, not usually, like if it was like, yes, I'm 80% Brazilian, I'd be like, okay, that makes

Speaker 2:          01:38:12       no, and people actually like get surgery and make their butts. It's like, yeah, if I wear a dress like the top fits, but then the Bot, I can't get the bottom over my hips or, and then, or if like at the hips fed and like the top is too big and I'm not gonna like, I don't know. I don't, I don't, I don't want big boobs. And then like if I wear pants, it's just weird. It's not, it's, it's like, it's, it's weird that like our culture is like into bots because I think they're kind of gross, but, okay.

Speaker 1:          01:38:42       Well, I mean I think you just have to watch like discovery channel for 15 minutes and see like presentation, posture and all that stuff. And mammals have that fixation I think. But, uh, the, uh, hmm. Not My intention to go there, but the exercises, so if, if you're exercising before you get started with the day and you could only pick a couple of exercises,

Speaker 2:          01:39:03       I mean, you basically asked me why. I have a big butt, like that's what it is. That there's no, no, no, no, it's fine. I'm not, it's funny. Um, no it's not. It's not just you do, what do you do? Well,

Speaker 1:          01:39:14       if you had to only choose a couple of types of exercise, not just for the bud,

Speaker 2:          01:39:19       not having big, but is that like, I can go to hell really fast. So you have to, you kind of have to exercise. Um, uh, I do deadlifts for my bat or just in general. I do dead lifts, dead lifts or, um, I do a lot of lunges. I do some walking lunges and like some, I dunno, we just go out sometimes. Um, I'll um, like resistance training. Um, well, no.

Speaker 1:          01:39:49       When you do dead lifts, are you doing sumo stance with your legs wide? Are Your legs closer together? Kind of like,

Speaker 2:          01:39:55       um, there are a little beyond shoulder width and like slightly bent. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:40:02       Indeed. If you had to choose three types of extra says just for the combination of like enjoyment and benefits for you overall, what would you choose?

Speaker 2:          01:40:12       Um, probably like squat jumps, box jumps and um, let's see, like shoulder presses. I Dunno. It seems like you could get a lot. He's like a lot of different things happen with those three exercises.

Speaker 1:          01:40:33       Right. And then you have the mountain, you have the trail running at a slight, if I'm in big Sur for the flying effect, uh, well I only want to ask a couple more questions then I will let you get back to your day. But this is, this has been very fun. What did, what advice would you give your 30 year old self?

Speaker 2:          01:40:52       MMM, it

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       doesn't get easier. Uh, I need, tell me more.

Speaker 2:          01:40:58       Oh, I don't know. I mean, I think, I think when you're, you're like, yeah, I'm like onto something. My business was grinding and I, this is so cool. I can't wait for a time when you know, I can just like, you know, let go or a time where I can, oh man, this is just going to be running itself someday or I'm going to, I dunno. Like, or just you think, you know, as you get older, I mean, yeah, you know more. You can handle things better, but it's the same. It's the same, you know, it's just, it's, it's just different stuff I guess. And the challenges are bigger with bigger things. Um, and you know, I think, I think if it's easier to sell yourself or for maybe other people to sell you that it's just like one vacation after the next and hey, I have a great life. I really appreciate everything that happened. I've taken some great vacations, but just that, like the, the, the hustle never ends, you know, that it was just a year ago is 30 a year ago. So, hmm. It would be like hi. I don't know.
