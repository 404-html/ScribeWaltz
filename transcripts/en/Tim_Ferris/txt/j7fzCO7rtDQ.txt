Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. You posted a question. I'm a cybernetic organism, living tissue.

Speaker 2:          00:00:23       This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way, set it and forget it. Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than two and a half billion dollars under management. In fact, some of my very good friends, investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. So the question is why? Why is it so popular? Why is it unique? Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only pay pennies on the dollar for them. And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations, bloated sales teams, et cetera. And I'll come back to that in a second. I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their advice, run with it, do it yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       You can do that or as I would, you can set it and forget it and here's why. The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't great investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax loss harvesting, rebalancing your portfolio, cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large amounts of money over longer periods of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned, since it's using software instead of retail locations, etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely impossible right off the bat, you never pay commissions or account fees for everything. They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for free. If you use my link, wealthfront.com forward slash Tim, that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.

Speaker 2:          00:02:12       Now, normally when I have a sponsor on this show, it's because I use them and recommend them. In this case, it's a little different. I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal. They wanted to sponsor this podcast, but because of sec regulations, companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials. So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast, but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant amount of my own money, at least for me, uh, in the team and the company itself. So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client. Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener, you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account. But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you. Take two minutes, fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash. Tim, it's fast, it's free.

Speaker 4:          00:03:57       Oh

Speaker 3:          00:03:59       he, she booties on the, uh, my friends. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers, whether they be from the world of chess, entertainment, sports, military, or in this case, generalized Human Guinea pig. And that means my guest is a comrade in arms of sorts in this wacky world of self experimentation. Aga Jacobs, one of my favorite people out there at Aga Jacobs on Twitter and elsewhere is the author of four New York Times bestsellers. And he chronicles all sorts of Shenanigans. His books include the know it all, which was about his quest to read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica and learn everything in the world. And, uh, in case you haven't picked this up yet. He is a hilarious, hilarious human being. The year of living biblically about his quest to follow all of the rules of the Bible as literally as possible.

Speaker 3:          00:04:56       Fantastic, fantastic book drop dead healthy about his quest to become the healthiest person alive, uh, in which, uh, with many a ill advised and sometimes well advised experiments. I was involved as one of said advisers, the Guinea pig diaries collection of various mishaps but also insightful quests like outsourcing his entire life and radical honesty. It's all relative. We're just coming out in 2017. So that has to be read about a quest to connect all of humanity in one family tree. He is also the host of the new podcast twice removed by gimlet media. Of course, they are the blockbuster factory. The podcast that is twice removed is about finding connections. Aja takes a celebrity guests and at the end of each episode of introduces them to a surprise cousin they didn't know they had. So it could be one of their heroes and old friend, a teacher, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 3:          00:05:48       AJ and I talk about a lot in this episode. We talk about some of his habits, what he's learned from many of these experiments we talk about his creative process has writing certain tipping points in his life. Uh, how he learned to love marketing as an author who distinct it for very, very, very long time and a lot more. We cover a lot of ground and I think you will have a blast. That's my hope. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed chatting with Aja. So without further ado, as I always say, please enjoy my wide ranging conversation with a Jay Jacobs. Aja? Good sir. Welcome to the show.

Speaker 5:          00:06:27       Thank you Tim. Delighted to be here

Speaker 3:          00:06:30       and I thought we could start maybe at the beginning. How did we meet? I remember specifically where I was sitting. We had our first conversation, but how did I reach out to you or was it through the website?

Speaker 5:          00:06:43       It was great. Yes, it was either an email but then we talked on the phone soon after and you said, I'm a first time writer. I'm writing a book. At that point it was called drug dealing for fun and profit. And you said you had read an article I had written where I outsourced my life to India, so hired a team of people in Bangalore to do everything for me, like answer my email and argue with my wife. And you said that you were writing a book about a similar topic of trying to find ways to hack work and could you talk to me about it and could you reprint that in your book? And I was like, well this guy, like he's writing a book about drug dealing, I don't know, should I trust him? And I'm like, you know what the hell. So it, it came out and then the vast part was a year later, like I had forgotten about it and I got a call from you and you're like, my book's coming out in case you want to check it out. And it's number one on Amazon. And I'm like, you mean number one in like 20 something career advice. You're like, no number one on Amazon, you are a genius. How the hell did you do that? The first time writer. So now I'm like, uh, yeah, and now you are my mentor in publishing. Like you called me for advice and now like I need to, a year later I needed to call you for advice.

Speaker 3:          00:08:11       This is my chance to ask for more advice. Aha. Because I realized that we talked about your writing at the time and we're going to get into all sorts of experiments. But since, since we were talking about writing, a number of people in my fan base asked about your writing process and so we've talked about your writing, the subject matter of your writing, but I don't know if we've ever talked about your writing process.

Speaker 5:          00:08:36       Yeah, I'm happy to talk about it. I think we actually did because when you were, you were researching how to write a book.

Speaker 3:          00:08:43       That's true. I asked him, I asked you a little bit about structure. Yeah. And uh, but I don't know at the time I remember I was in Argentina, I was in Buenos Aires. So sitting in a coffee shop, drinking a Cappuccino, which was a double espresso. This must have been around, uh, late 2005 or early 2006 near this place. Well, it's a large cemetery and in near plus a fancy, I remember exactly where I was sitting when we had the conversation. Could you describe for folks, like I said, there are two questions about writing process. One is micro on say a daily basis when you are writing a book, what that day looks like. And then there's the how do you decide what to write about. So,

Speaker 5:          00:09:29       which do you want to tackle first? Whichever you would like to tackle first. Well, let me take, tackle the micro really quickly, which would be, mmm. One thing I like to do first a little, uh, mental calisthenics before I start writing. So, uh, just to warm up my brain, so I'll, I'll brainstorm. Maybe it's about the book event itself or an article, but it could just be random stuff. Like it could be like, you know, ah, I saw snow, man, what can we do with that? Maybe we could do a, uh, uh, Snow Tran, ginger person or us know neanderthal like, and 99% of the ideas suck as you can tell. But the idea is just to get your creative juices flowing. You get writing those down or are you just doing them and said, yes, I'm typing them down. And you know, as I say, none of them, very few of them are ever see the light of day.

Speaker 5:          00:10:24       But that's just to get my fingers typing is another thing. I feel just the movement of my fingers on the key gets me revved up and gets me, uh, so that uh, I'm, I'm more comfortable typing. The other thing I like to think about is I know that the first half hour of of actual writing my book that that is probably going to suck. And so I just have to accept that and be okay with throwing it out. But you got to do that half hour before a year, your brain clicks in. So, so that's what I do. I do need, I do need like three solid hours. I am not one. Some people can do it where they can write in spurts of 20 minutes. I am not one of those.

Speaker 3:          00:11:12       I can't do it either. Yeah. And I remember I got some very good advice a few years ago because I was getting very frustrated by the, in my mind wasted half hour that you mentioned. Uh, and someone said, well you have to realize that if you write 10 pages and you only get one really good page at the very end, those nine pages are not a waste of time. You needed those nine pages to get to the 10th page. Yeah, exactly. Okay. I prefer to have a better ratio. I'll take it.

Speaker 5:          00:11:42       No. Yeah, there is some warm up. Uh, yeah. I wish it could be more like high intensity interval training. You're Indian, you're out. But it is more like stretching. And

Speaker 3:          00:11:51       do you tend to do it first thing in the morning or when do you I do,

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       well, I have kids so that, that makes my life a pain in the ass. So I have had to train myself to tie it to write at all hours. So sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night. And uh, do you drink coffee? Do you drink coffee? Um, I also, I have to say I enjoy my white wine. Uh, mostly mornings I am a day drinker. I actually prefer drinking during the day. Um, but yeah, you know, there are studies that show that you're slightly more creative after like I think after one glass, like after two or three glasses, then it all goes to hell. But one glass, it sort of loosens up the, uh, the frontal cortex allows you to make more connections

Speaker 3:          00:12:39       or it convinces you that you should be more loosened up and you have the placebo effect benefit there. You Guy, and you said, you sent me over a quote and I don't know if this is a quote of yours or if it's tributed to someone else, but I really enjoyed this and I think it applies to a lot of what you do, not just your writing, but it, here's the quote quote, it's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than to think your way into a new way of acting. Can you elaborate on that or provide us some more context for that?

Speaker 5:          00:13:11       Yeah, I love that quote and I think it applies to both of us. Definitely applies to both of us. Yeah. I think a lot of what your work and yeah, I wish I could say I made it up. It was the founder of habitat for humanity whose name escapes me right now, but it was a wonderful, and the idea is just, you know, uh, when you is, it's basic cognitive behavioral psychology. When you act in a certain way, then your brain will catch up. But that's a lot of insight in terms of change. I find that much easier. Like I wrote a book about the Bible and living by the Bible and one of the things was you had to be more compassionate and a, so I had a friend in the hospital, I hate hospitals, hate them. So I was like, I'm not going to visit that guy. But then I thought, what would a compassionate person do? And I acted as if I were a compassionate person. I forced myself to go to the hospital and visit him. And then in my brain I'm like, oh, you know what, I am kind of compassionate. You sort of trick your brain, your brain catches up. Uh, and, and I've done that and especially with optimism and confidence, you know, I don't think I'm a naturally confident person, but I act as if I'm confident and eventually you become more confident. So what

Speaker 3:          00:14:28       in the realm of confidence would embodies confidence for you? It's like what are the ways in which you act?

Speaker 5:          00:14:34       Well, for instance, when I wrote a book about health, it was a sort of my um, my uh, attempt at the four hour body, uh, and uh, Aye I was so overwhelmed because it's such a huge topic and I was trying to be the healthiest person alive aside from Tim Ferris. Uh, and so there was such a, it's such an undertaking because there's so much their sleep and their sacks and there's food and exercise. So I was all stressed out, but then I acted every morning I would wake up full of despair, but then I would act as if I was confident. So I would call my publisher and say, okay, when we have the release party, let's have a Kale Martinis. What do you think of that? Uh, so I was acting all cocky as if you know, this is going to come out and be a big hit. And after two or three hours your brain catches up and I actually felt more confident and I really find it so helpful.

Speaker 3:          00:15:30       So I've, I've been thinking about this a lot recently, uh, because there's so much talk of, of mind over body. And so this is I guess a corollary to this quote, but I've been thinking a lot about, uh, body over mind. And this is something Tony Robbins talks a lot about. If you want to change your psychology, changing your physiology first, and it's a lot easier also in the sense that if you haven't reasoned yourself into a position of say, lack of confidence, or at least you haven't done it consciously, it's very hard to reason your way out of it. Uh, so you just have to act as if,

Speaker 5:          00:16:07       oh yeah, I absolutely, I agree. And it's in every part of my life. Like I did one experiment where I, I tried to be the best husband ever, and, uh, I forced myself to buy a present for my wife every day, like just a little trinket. Uh, even if I was totally pissed at her and like you want to, nothing to do with her, but just that act of giving it to her, it was like, oh, I'm giving her a present. I must love her. And it really changed my view. So I am a big fan and there, and we're not the only ones. You know, I, I read about Teddy Roosevelt when he was a, he for a while, he was trying to be a cowboy. He was actually in, I think it was Montana and someone asked him, aren't you terrified? And he's like, of course I'm terrified when the bullets is coming at me, but I just act as if I'm courageous and they become a little more correct.

Speaker 3:          00:17:00       Yes. So it sounds like, and I read this comparison on I think 99 you, uh, one piece, maybe method acting, although I know nothing about it. I'm just using the label. Uh, and then there's the second component, which is something that, uh, I, I didn't, I, I like this phrase and it's capital d capital owed delusional optimism. Uh, can you, can you elaborate on that? Cause it seems like there they go together.

Speaker 5:          00:17:31       Yes. I am a, I am a fan of delusional optimism, which is very similar to what we've been talking about. Uh, I think it's nothing would get done without delusional optimism. And I actually, one example as I interviewed George Clooney once for a Esquire, who by the way is as charming as you expect George Clooney to. He gave me a, a unsolicited, a shoulder rub, shoulder massage, so that like, I'll always have that. Uh, but anyways, so I asked him about his, whether his secret to success and he said one philosophy he has his, uh, he used to be a baseball player in high school and when he got up to the plate, he would, he wouldn't just say to himself, am I going to hit a home run? He would say, not only am I going to hit a home run, but the only question is am I going to hit it over the left wall or the right wall?

Speaker 5:          00:18:27       And I loved that just like, and of course, most of the time he did it, most of the time he struck out, but it raised the percentage of times that he did hit a home run because he had that delusional optimism. Uh, and I love that. And you have to be careful. I mean, you don't want, it can lead to terrible things. So you have to have some, especially if you're in an organization, you want the CEO to be delusional, he off to a optimistic and then you want someone else to be sort of the bean counter and be like, I don't know about this, a balance. But you really do, I think, need that delusional optimism to get things done.

Speaker 3:          00:19:03       And if we're then rewinding a little bit and going from the micro book process, book writing process, uh, actually before we leave the daily writing process, I've talked to a lot of my friends who are typically journalists that in newspapers and they drive me crazy and they make me very envious because they talk about how writing or writer's block doesn't exist and they can kick out 1500 beautiful words every few hours and they seem to be able to do it. A lot of my friends who've worked at different papers do you have, do you experience blocks or extended periods where you're just stuck on projects and if so, what do you do to help get yourself out of those folks? Yep. Yeah, blocked

Speaker 5:          00:19:49       all the time. I actually wrote an article once on, uh, on writer's block and the way that great writers have overcome it. I remember, uh, I think Ben Franklin wrote in the nude, a lot of writers wrote standing up like a Nabokov wrote, standing up. There is a philosopher and German philosopher named Schiller, who he needed rotten apples to inspire him. So I tried them. I've went, like Tim Ferriss, I, I tried them all like at the same time, like standing up naked with rotten rotten apples. I don't know if that was successful, but I will say one of them is similar to what I said before where you just start writing and it doesn't have to be, as long as you accept that it's going to suck, uh, it lowers the pressure. So I'll, a lot of times if I, uh, if I'm stuck, I'll just start writing, you know, about the, the, the Coffee Cup or the on the window sill are, you know, how, um, my elbow itches and just, just the fact of moving your fingers, like we talked about how much your body affects your mind, moving the fingers gets you going, uh, and helps.

Speaker 5:          00:21:03       But yeah, I, it's a problem. It is a certainly, uh, people who say they don't have writer's block, they, they drive me crazy. And uh,

Speaker 3:          00:21:14       you mentioned this is going to jump around because it's the style of my mental like brain. But you mentioned, and this is a question that came up from quite a few, uh, listeners to the podcast, the year of living biblically, which was, uh, one of my favorite books. Yours. I really, really enjoyed it and I've told you this before, but I learned more about as someone who developed a, an allergy to organized religion pretty early on and therefore it never learned much about it. It was a fantastic Trojan horse for me through the entertainment value in the humor of the book to actually learn a lot about a number of different religious traditions. Well bless you. Bless you Tim. Thanks. So while that, bless you, that leads me to the question, which is, uh, what are the things that have stuck with you?

Speaker 5:          00:22:01       Yeah, that and

Speaker 3:          00:22:02       because there's one that stuck with me, which railings a while you talked about wearing white. Ah, yeah. And so maybe you could, you could, you could explain what that means, but it's actually something that I've ended up doing on a fairly regular basis since I run me. Although you're wearing dark blue and wearing dark blue right now cause all my wife's stuff is,

Speaker 5:          00:22:19       imagine how much better this interview would be. And, and I was wearing light. I'm wearing white socks. Uh, yeah. Well this book, just to give a very quick background for those who don't know it was, um, I grew up with no religion at all. Uh, as I say in the book, I'm Jewish, but I'm Jewish in the same way. The olive garden is Italian, so not very, no offense, but I thought one way to learn about religion would be to dive in and actually follow every rule in the Bible. So the famous ones like the 10 Commandments, uh, and, but also the last famous ones, like it says you can't shave the corners of your beard. I didn't know where the corners were, so I just let the whole thing grow. And I had this huge topiary and I got stopped at airport security. So it was, hey, uh, it was a, it was a crazy year, but one of the rules, the robes probably didn't help it.

Speaker 5:          00:23:08       Airports and the sandals and the walking stick. Yeah. Has He say, you know, getting into it physically really makes a difference. And one of the rules in the Bible, and I think it's Ecclesiastes, he says that your garments should always be white. So I took that literally, and I only wore white pants, white shirts and white robes. And it was weird how it affected my, uh, my mind as, you know, like, it made me feel lighter or more energetic, uh, and I felt like, you know, it's, there's just something wearing white, like I'm going to, you know, uh, p Diddy's Hamptons party or I'm gonna play Wimbledon, you know, it's, it's, it's got positive associations. So I fell. And here in New York, people wear dark clothes all the time. And I think door, yeah, it affects your, your mind have, you can, is that continued to be a piece or what have continued to play a part in your life from that book, from that experience?

Speaker 5:          00:24:13       I do like the little brighter clothes, more than I used to. I, I would say, you know, a lot of it I, I gave, I did shave the beard, um, because my wife would not, she wouldn't touch me with that thing. Uh, even though I kept very clean, I like moisturized, conditioned it. Shampooed but in terms of stuff that I have actually kept, uh, I would say one thing that, that really has stuck with me is that the Bible talks about that you should be grateful all the time. He says he should be thankful, say prayers of thanksgiving. So I, when I was doing the, the book, I would, I, I took that literally, so I would be thankful for everything. So I would press the elevator button, I'd get in the elevator, I'd be thankful it didn't plummet to the basement. Uh, I, uh, it, you know, I get it, press the elevator button and I'd be thankful the doors opened and I got to my floor.

Speaker 5:          00:25:13       So it was like hundreds of little tiny things a day. And it was a weird way to live, very time consuming, but it was also, there was something wonderful about it because it made you realize very concretely, there are hundreds of things that go right every day that you totally take for granted. And at least I used to focus on the three or four that went wrong and just stew on them. So I've tried to keep that radical shift in perspective of being thankful for all the tiny little things that go right. And it has made me happier. It, it's definitely had an impact. So I want each of you, if you wouldn't mind, describe for people, uh, one of my favorite stories in the book, uh, stoning adulterers. Well, yes, I was doing a lot with the Old Testament, the Hebrew scriptures, and it says over and over again you have to stone adulterers.

Speaker 5:          00:26:02       So I thought, all right, let me try to get this, check this off the list. So I was, uh, uh, one day I was in central park and I was wearing my whole, I had my, I had to get up the sandals and a man came up to me and he said, why are you dressed like that? And I said, well, I'm trying to follow all the rules of the Bible from the 10 commandments to stoning adulterers. And he said, well, I'm an adulterer. I ain't going to stone me. And I said, well, that would be fantastic. Thank you for the offer. So kind. So I took a, uh, a handful of stones out of my robe pocket because I had been carrying around for weeks. Hoecakes because there was no specification

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       in terms of the size of the,

Speaker 5:          00:26:46       exactly. That was the key. I showed it to him and I'm like, you know, there's small stones and you know, I can check it off the list even if they're small stones. And he was very aggressive adulterer. He grabbed the stones out out of my hand and threw them at my face. So I thought an eye for an eye, I can chuck one back at him. So that's how I chucked it off. I checked it off the list and yeah, I didn't continue that. There were quite a few. Uh, I did not continue including if you follow Leviticus really strictly, you can't touch a woman when she's menstruating cause she's impure. But if you take it really literally a woman, if she's meant joining, if she sits on something, a chair, that chair becomes impure. And my wife found that offensive so she sat in every chair in our apartment and I had to stand for most of the year. Which as you know, is probably good for you. Good for your health. Well you had a travel stool, right? It was one of those exact sporting event. Yeah, those are great. Yeah, they were, um, you know, they're usually used by people who are either 83 or 600 pounds, but I found it very useful,

Speaker 3:          00:27:58       suited a number of folks. And then we're not going to get too deep into the audience questions right now, but we quite a few questions about your wife and how you manage your relationship with your wife, given all of these odd experiments. And do you, did you, did you in some indirect or subconscious way select someone who have a high tolerance for all of this? Great question. How do you, how do you repair damage when damage is done?

Speaker 5:          00:28:33       It is, it is interesting. I mean there are, first of all, she has veto power. So there are like, I'm sure you get this all the time, readers suggesting ideas. One suggested, uh, become the greatest lover in the world and do all the positions in the Kama Sutra, which you kind of did in the four hour body. Uh, but you know, I've been married for 12 years, so that was not going to happen. Um, I did pitch it to her and she, and she's like, no, that is, and I have to say I was a little relieved because I, I don't think I can bend my back like that anymore. Uh, so, so she has veto power. That's rule number one. Um, and to I think she does get, she gets a lot of reader feedback about how she's so patient that helps. So please keep sending those in positive reinforcement.

Speaker 5:          00:29:25       Um, I will say probably the worst one for our marriage was, uh, you know, the, the lifelogging movement where you, you, you take keep track. It's like, yeah, and record everything. It's like the self tracking, quantified self taken to the extreme. So you, I wore, I had a little tiny camera like smaller than a Gopro on my ear and I recorded every moment of my life for about three months. And it was fascinating. It really, you know, and I think it's a glimpse of the future. I think we are all going towards that for better or worse. But one of the things was I was like, you know, 70% of my arguments with my wife are about where she says, you didn't tell me that. And I'm like, yeah, I did. I did tell you that. So now I'm like, you know what? Now we can rewind and we can see what we actually said.

Speaker 5:          00:30:19       So we had a huge argument about something, whether I had, she had asked me to order Mexican food, something ridiculously small and trivial, but it blew up and I was able to, I was like, the next day I'm like, okay, let's rewind and watch the argument. Um, and it was so terrible for our marriage because it's like, I can't remember. I think I might've been 60% right, but the net was that I was 0% right because she was so upset. And you don't want to show someone yelling or angry. It just is not, I don't recommend that as a, a way to navigate a marriage. In fact, there was a black, you ever go see black? There's a great episode, I think it was in the first or second season, the UK edition of Black Mirror tastic episode. It was the same exact premise, very similar premise, but you record through your eye.

Speaker 5:          00:31:18       It was great. I loved that show. And that was an in the episode, you know, things go horribly awry with his marriage, I think is probably also likely to happen. Exactly. It becomes ubiquitous technology. What did you learn from that experience aside from not to replay the Mexican takeout debate? I think, well one thing I learned is to, um, I of course I have hundreds of hours of material, so, uh, I'll, I'll never be able to watch it because, you know, it's just an infinite loop. But I think one is to enjoy the small moments. You, you know, if you do watch it, he just realized that 90% of your day, as you know, when I'm getting my kids ready for school, if you are annoyed during those half hour because it's a pain in the ass, that's a half hour of your way, a life wasted. Like you have to realize this is it.

Speaker 5:          00:32:20       Like this is what most of life is. So try to enjoy that as well as the, when you know you're playing laser tag or whatever, cause that's very rich serving kill Martinis at your launch party. That never happened. Uh, so that was one, I mean also the implications for the future of fascinating, you know, how's it gonna Affect Crime? Like, how will anyone mug someone when it's all being uploaded immediately to the cloud? So it will, I think help crime, but it'll be terrible for marriages. And you know, I, I feel for a future adulterers, my heart goes out to them because I can't imagine how you're going to get away with sneaking around when everything is fully recorded. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:33:08       well, I mean it will also on the flip side and it will clarify a lot of crimes that are not committed where people are wrongly accused. Well, you have the flip side also

Speaker 5:          00:33:20       true. Yeah. It'll be, um, and I think it'll also, it might make us more tolerant of people's mistakes because we all do something, you know, every, the youtube video of people melting down and, and acting like idiots. Everyone will have one of those. Yeah. So we're all going to have no one's purple. We're all going to have our flaws right out there on display. So we have to accept those and ourselves and, and be a little more tolerant of others. So it'll be, it's going to be a weird future, I really believe. Fascinating but weird.

Speaker 3:          00:33:56       Yeah, it's a, I mean, the question for me is who in all these cases, you know who, who are going to be the dominant owners of this information and controllers of the bits and bites right there represent all of these videos. Yeah. Uh, but I want to come back to tolerance and I'm not, I'm not sure this is a perfect segue, but I'm going to force it a radical honesty. So you wrote a piece, believe it was titled, I think you're fat. Uh, that is about radical honesty. Could you describe for people, and then I want to come back and I'm going to ask you about your thoughts on marriage and parenting, but I want to talk this, this ties in, I think on some level, so radical on safety. Could you describe absolutely the, the origins of this experiment and what you did and, and where you ended up, which I don't think we've really talked

Speaker 5:          00:34:51       no. Well, and to be radically honest, thank you. You tweeted about it a few weeks ago and as per usual, like your endorsement class, mentor readers,

Speaker 3:          00:35:03       one tweet. Then I get like, you know, from months trying to publish they space. I love the piece smiling.

Speaker 5:          00:35:11       Thank you. Uh, yeah. This piece came about because I was, I read about this guy in Virginia, a psychologist named Brad Blanton. Fantastic character, one of the greatest interviews in my life. And he believes that you should never lie, but he goes further. He says, whatever's on your brain should come out of your mouth. No filter like Jim Carrey and liar liar. So it is insane. And I was like, well, let me try this and see what happens. How maybe he's right. Maybe it will make my life better. Uh, despite the challenges. So I did it and all my God, it was the worst month of my life in many ways. In some ways it was wonderful, liberating, terrific. In other ways, it was just dreadful. And to give you one of the dreadful ones, there was like, we would go to a restaurant and we would see my wife, friends of my wife's that she hadn't seen since, since college and they'd be, they said, oh, we should all get together and have a play date with our kids.

Speaker 5:          00:36:15       And I had to say what was on my brain, which was, you guys seem nice but I have no interest in ever seen you again. Cause I don't have time to see my own friend. And they were just looked at me aghast. And my wife of course was furious. And I mean the one thing is we never did see them again. So in that way it was the fact that I felt terrible and I still feel, you know, it was totally terrible thing to say. So there was that. Um, uh, but it did affect me in that I still, I'm not radically honest, like, cause he's crazy. He's like also, you know, if you see a beautiful woman on the street, you say, hello, I'm very attracted to you. I would like to sleep with you. Uh, which I got weirdly a lot of people and you know, 20 something guys saying they were using that as a through masterful pickup line.

Speaker 5:          00:37:10       Exactly. And they said, you know, the rejection rate was like 95%, but if you're okay with that, then 5% of the women were like, hmm. Interesting. Just in preposition, I was like the confidence slash Asperger's. But uh, so what I have kept from that is I, I tried to do what I call a radical sustainable honesty or, or positive radical honesty because I don't need to tell people, you know, uh, I'm staring at your mole. Like that just doesn't help the world I think. But for instance, one of the things I did was when I was doing that, I would be thinking, you know what, I really liked that boss of mine when I was 22 at the small newspaper. He had a very nice influence on me. Let me call him up and thank him. So I would call them out of the blue.

Speaker 5:          00:38:04       And it was very awkward because men are not supposed to express emotions like that. But I would tell him how much he meant to me and it made me feel so much better and I hope, I think it made him feel better. And so I feel that that's something I've tried to keep. If I have a positive thought, then even if it's embarrassing or weird, then I will, I will say like, I love you man. That kind of thing. Uh, and I think that has made my life better. So I was given a similar assignment

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       by an ex girlfriend a number of years ago. I was having trouble, and this is no secret to people who've read certainly a few of the chapters in tools of titans or in other places that I've had had my ups and downs in my managing of depressive periods and whatnot. And she said, well, if you're having trouble making yourself happy, maybe you should identify one person every day. You can send a short thank you to or call to give a thank you. And specifically people from long ago or people you used to be close to or who had a huge influence on you that you are no longer close to. And so I started doing this and calling teachers I had in high school or childhood friends and it was a, it had a hugely uplifting impact on me. I did it ever go wrong? Did ever thumb, no, it never went wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:39:23       And sometimes it wasn't even about speaking in person. So if I got a voicemail, just leave a heartfelt voicemail. It never went sideways for me. Uh, and uh, in fact it re re invigorated I guess are resurrected. A few childhood friendships and now I'm back in close contact with a number of these guys I went to grade school with and used to play with on a daily basis on BMX bikes or whenever the hell throwing, throwing dirt clods into each other's eyes in the middle of the forest or whatever we were doing at the time. So it's been great. It's been really, really great. I love that. Uh, how do you, if, if you're, if you've dismissed the option of being able to say to someone, you seem very lovely, but I don't want to ever see you again, which in a sense is, is fantastic because you're able to cut down on all of this.

Speaker 3:          00:40:12       There's all these social expectations and commitments. I think a lot of people are just drowning and coffee, invitations, cocktail invitations. Let's do this. Let's do that. If you're, if you're trying to practice this more, a moderate honesty, uh, how do you think of handling in a place like New York City in particular, where you have endless options? I need your advice on that. I am, I am terrible at it. I mean, I will tell people the truth, which is right now, I am so overwhelmed that I don't have time for basic hygiene and that they wouldn't want to hang out with me anyway because I smell and I've got yellow teeth. So that the, and that is the truth. So maybe that's, that's my best answer. But yeah, it's a tough one. The Best I've been able to figure out. This was actually something I borrowed from, I'm not going to mention him by name because I don't know if you'd want this to be public, but a very well known a tech investor, billionaire tech investor in Silicon Valley who's always been very generous with his time.

Speaker 3:          00:41:13       And we'd met up a number of times and I asked him if he'd be open to grabbing dinner. No, I wasn't vague about it because I think at this point in my life, I've learned like let's hang out isn't good enough for someone who has that so many demands on their time. So it was like, I'd love to meet up to chat about this, this, and this only if you have time. But we'd had dinner a number of times in the past and he said, I would love to, but I'm on, uh, uh, I'm taking a meeting vacation. And so I started applying this to everything. I was like, oh, that's brilliant because it's not personalized. It's not, I can't do it. Tim Ferris, because I don't like you. It's no, I'm not doing any meetings. He said, I'm not doing any meetings. I'm actually doing no phone calls.

Speaker 3:          00:41:52       I'm just responding to things via email because that's the only way I can manage my schedule right now. And it was so generalized that I felt totally fine with that. So I started applying that to anything I didn't want to do. I'm taking a conference called vacation, I'm taking the meeting vacation, I'm taking a fill in the blank vacation and also began putting that in my autoresponders so that I didn't feel obligated. A couple of those you've most certainly, everyone gets a lot from me. I love that. Uh, angry when you're taking a vacation. Everyone needs a vacation, a vacation. Well, and it is interesting. I, um,

Speaker 5:          00:42:28       uh, yeah, another thing that I do is a,

Speaker 5:          00:42:32       and, and some people don't improve this. You may not, but okay. If I'm totally swamped and someone asks me out to lunch, then I say, uh, what would you think about a Skype lunch where we both order in food and we have lunch and we get to talk to each other. We get to see each other, but we don't have to Schlep, we don't have to like waste time. We don't have to get, you know, ask the waiter like for the, for the check and you know, I'd say 30% of people are offended, but 70% are willing to try. And I found it very useful. Skype loads, type lunch, dinner, Skype, breakfast, whatever you want. And I did it once with this guy who was tech savvy and he like had a background of us in a cafe like in Paris. So it was very nice.

Speaker 3:          00:43:23       A CID or on a lady in the trip moment virtually. That's fair. That sounds very, I don't know whether I was lady or the tramp or both. You can be both. She's, there were a couple of bullets we in preparation for this because I've, I've, so I'm very familiar with a lot of your work. I've read, I think all of your books up to this point and just, yeah, it's, so you set a number of bullets that I, I didn't, uh, expect or I wasn't familiar with. So I wanted to talk about a few. I, and I feel like some of these, uh, we have maybe touched on briefly, but I wanted to revisit being kind to your older self. Can you explain what this means? This was,

Speaker 5:          00:44:07       uh, I learned this while doing the health book and the idea was, um, I think it was, it was a Yale professor. Uh, I forget his name, but ego nomics I think is the, what he called it. And the idea was when they do experiments and they remind people of that, that they are going to be around in 20 years, people make more responsible decisions. Like financially they invest more in their four zero oneK and also health wise they act more responsibly. So I thought this was fascinating. So I took it and I took a, uh, just a selfie of an, I digitally aged it on one of those apps. And so I now look, I've got this weird, I looked like I have a skin disease, but it's me at like 82. And I put printed it out and put it over my desk. And that older age a is always looking down and saying, you know, treat me well treatment, remember, treat me like you would treat a friend and you know, just don't eat that fourth oatmeal cookie, you know, just get on that treadmill. So I find that, I find that very inspiring and motivating.

Speaker 3:          00:45:23       And does it something that you're able to continually notice or do you tune it out after a while? This is a challenge that I've had with certain reminders. So I have a quote for instance from, uh, Marcus really is on my refrigerator in San Francisco and it's about not being, trying to regain the harmony as quickly as possible, et Cetera, et cetera. It's one of these very Marcus Aurelius type quotes. Uh, there, there are a number of them around my house, but I will occasionally schedule rotating of the quote or even location because otherwise it just becomes part of the scenery and I don't notice it. So

Speaker 5:          00:45:59       that, and I was, I have the exact same thing. Like if you leave it in the same place you're going to forget about. What I do is I make it part of my rotating screen saver so that, okay, this makes sense. So that it pops up every, you know, couple of days and then, oh yeah, I should, but you're totally right. We are so good at tuning things out that have been there

Speaker 3:          00:46:23       necessarily. Right. But I mean, it's evolutionarily, it's like, all right, if there's a piece of furniture, I don't need to have some type of acute fighter flight intensity level observation of it. Right. Because it's clearly not having a direct impact of my survival. Uh,

Speaker 5:          00:46:37       and, and I had that same experience with photos. I had a screensaver that was a photo of my family, totally tuned it out after three days. So I started rotating photos to remind myself. Oh yeah, we did do a fun thing there. And you know, it's not all, uh, tantrums, tantrums and debates over Mexican food. Exactly. What, uh, what else have you continued to do from drop dead healthy? I still do love, uh, treadmill desks. I made my own, I didn't buy the fancy one, but I do find it energizing, you know, and I, I only walked like one and a half, two miles per hour when I'm writing a or answering emails. But, uh, I find it if I'm sitting in front of a computer, I am tempted to just like rest my head on the space bar and fall asleep. So I you can't do that when you're on a treadmill. So I do like that. And I also still like, uh, the, the competition. Some people are not motivated by this, but I am like getting friends, uh, making sure that I get to 10,000 steps or my friends can mock me, that they can see there's like a leaderboard and that they can, would,

Speaker 3:          00:47:58       would you use for that right now in terms of sharing that with them?

Speaker 5:          00:48:02       I have been a use, I like hooked up my fitbit to my apple health. It was complicated. It took, it took a while. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:48:12       And how do you encourage your friends to mock you if you don't get 10,000? Are they the type of friends who don't need much instruction in the market

Speaker 5:          00:48:18       apartment? Yeah, I'm trying to think. I used to, it's been awhile, but, um, the, this great writer who wrote the, uh, the seek, the Henrietta lacks book. Uh Oh, right, sure, sure, sure. Anyway, she is, she is great and also very, so I think he just got to find the people who, uh, are most adept at mockery. I am motivated by mockery. Uh, some people are not.

Speaker 3:          00:48:44       So there's a, there's a story that I've told quite a bit because I think that it's very practical in a lot of ways and that there are variations of this. But I'd like you to tell probably the more accurate version because I feel like I get details of this wrong when I retell it. Blackmailing yourself. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:49:03       Sly with cell on it. I went to, let's talk about the cake that's talking about the gay, Gay, Gay, uh, which I do not support just to get that out there right up front. Uh, but I launched, I've watched many of your talks and and in a couple of them you mentioned that very flattering. Thank you. Uh, this is an idea by that same Yale professor and the, his idea was if you want to quit something or you want to stop doing a terrible behavior, then you can blackmail yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:49:32       Is this the same Yale professor ended up leader or currently being involved with stick.com? Yes, that's right. S T I C K k.com. Where this is built into sort of the mechanics of how the site works. Exactly. Okay. This is where you choose the anti charity. It's the anti charity. It's sort of motivated. You took it to the next level. Well I was,

Speaker 5:          00:49:55       excuse me, I was and I'm doing the health book and I was eating all of these dried mangoes cause they sort of have the veneer of health cause they're, they're fruit but, but really they're just sugar. I just so much sugar. So I knew I had to quit. So I arranged it. I said to my wife, if I eat another dried mango, then I'm instructing you. Now you have to do this, you have to send a $100 check to the KKK. And I, it was so effective. It was crazy because just the thought of that check going out made me physically ill and I was able to quit cold Turkey. So, and he talks about people smoking use this, uh, strategy and yeah. Have you ever tried it?

Speaker 3:          00:50:45       I have tried the anti charity and it's incredible. I've also done this with bedding because I think that for instance, if you have a betting pool with five people who have a certain goal, let's just say that's body re composition. So they're each getting, this is actually a real example from a friend of mine who recently lost 40 or 50 pounds. They're each getting dexa scans. So these scans, it'll indicate body fat percentage and muscle mass. And so on, every, let's just call it two weeks or something like that, which is actually surprisingly inexpensive. It's a big 30, 40 bucks. Hmm. And uh, whoever has the most successful recomposition of their body by the end would get the pot and each person, I think it was putting in $100 and so it was $500 total, but people will, I don't think it's the $500 that gets people to lose the weight in this case lose fat.

Speaker 3:          00:51:35       I think that it is the two things, the the social mockery and a at grab asking and ball busting in this case is five guys and it is the losing of $100. It's the loss aversion I think more than the prospect of gain. And so this is one of the many issues that I suppose I take with the 43rd place gets a gold star ever. Everyone's a winner. We should only focus on positive reinforcement, a sort of fetishizing of the patting on the head in the u s at least where I think the, the s the stick instead of the carrot and the like the shame and humiliation and all of these, all of these things that are thought of as, as negative actually really, really useful tools if you recognize how, uh, how ingrained they are as incentives in human beings.

Speaker 5:          00:52:29       I find that very useful. I mean, you've got to be careful not to crush someone's ego so they curl up in a fetal position. So it's a fine line. But, uh, but good natured, uh, sticks, I think, you know, like a soft maybe, uh, you know, nerf sticks I think are, are incredibly helpful. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:52:50       so this is one that I may have read about. It didn't ring a bell. Uh, the, uh, trip to Jerry Falwell's church. Oh yeah. Yes.

Speaker 5:          00:53:01       This is when I was writing the Bible and I sent you this in the context of just the joy of being a mentor. Uh, and I can say that because this guy, my mentee, my protege has far surpassed me in success. His name is Kevin Reus and he was a writer for the New York Times in New York magazine. Now he's at fusion and he's written a couple great books, but he, I met him because I was writing my book on the Bible. He was a freshman at my Alma Mater Brown University. And he wrote me a very funny letter saying he wanted it to be a writer. So immediately that's a good lesson. Like just the Chutzpah, I call it a strategic Chutzpah, just writing out of the blue instead of going through alumni relations, he just wrote me out of the blue, I want to be a writer, I'll work for you for free while I reason for it.

Speaker 5:          00:53:55       So that I was like, you know, I was already impressed and at the time I was trying to follow all the rules of the Bible and the Bible actually in the Old Testament, slavery is, is fine. So I was really struggling with how do I deal with that in my life because obviously slavery not so fine, not so legal. Thank God. Uh, so I said the closest thing to slavery, uh, in, in my life isn't an into an internship. So if you can come and be my intern and uh, and let me call you my biblical slave, then let's do it. So He's like, I'm in and he was great. So proactive. And then as a thank you, I took him on one of the trips I made for that book where I was going around trying to see how different people interpreted the Bible. Literally. And I took him to Jerry Falwell's church and he was, he was fascinated.

Speaker 5:          00:54:50       He was like, this is amazing. This is like an alternate universe. I live in a bubble. I want to, what if I transferred from Brown, the most liberal college, uh, in the United States to Liberty College, which is one of the most conservative where you can't watch an r rated movie. You get in trouble for, you can't like holding hands with someone of the opposite sex is like, you know, that's for voting. So, uh, I was like, that's an interesting idea. And I said, encouraged them to write a proposal and I helped him a bit and hooked him up with an agent and he did it and he went and got the book contract, wrote a great book, which is Great. Not just because it's interesting, but because it's very nuanced and he's, he shows that these are people and that there are benefits to this way of life. And, uh, so it's not, he didn't villainize him. Uh, and anyway, uh, I thought that that was a fantastic, so just this idea of like being a mentor gives, gives so much pleasure. I think it's, uh, you know, in one way it's a waste of time, but in another way it's just, and it's also from a very practical point of view, it's paid off. Like now he's so much smarter than me and more connected with the Internet that he can help me.

Speaker 5:          00:56:16       What if we look at, uh, your toolkit and set rules that you have

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       done a lot of experiments for many, many different things. If, if you were trying to give someone who is saying about to get married, recommendations for marriage and parenting, if you, if you had to be as not summer, but as, as, as serious as possible, what, what, what, what would, what would, what would the real advice be?

Speaker 5:          00:56:50       Well, a couple of things come to mind. One is, you know, the Cliche, don't go to bed angry. I fully disagree with that. I go to bed angry all the time and I find it so helpful because my wife gets cranky at night. If I tried to argue it out with her, she would be furious and neither of us would get sleep. It would be a disaster. He go to sleep, you wake up in the morning, you have a fresh perspective, you can talk about it rationally. And I do that with my kids too. Like we start to get an argument. I say, you know what? Let's cool down. Let's think about this. I'm not forgetting about this argument, but let's reconvene in in a few hours. So I actually, I do like that. So don't go do, go to bed. Angry is my first, uh, another one is from my wife's a Stepdad who died recently, but he said when we were getting married, I thought he gave very good advice.

Speaker 5:          00:57:43       He said, you both think Europe, both gonna think that you're doing like 70% of the work in the marriage and you're both wrong, you know, so just be aware of how much the other person is doing and you're taking for granted. Uh, and, and for one of my experiments, the one I said where I tried to be the best husband, I was one of the, one of the things we did was we wrote a list of everything she does in our lives around the house and everything I do. I honestly thought it was going to be about 50, 50, and it was like 80 her and 20 me. So it was very humbling experience. It was in one sense, terrible because now she realizes too how little I did. So it's made my life worse in one sense, but it's also, it was very revolutionary and I got to see, you know, like the, the little um, liquid soap thing. I, I just figured they refilled themselves. It was like a self cleaning oven or something, but I was like, oh yeah, someone has to do that. So be aware of how much the other person is doing. Even if you, you don't see it, you know, it's the, it's the conference, you know, what the whatever biases, you're not seeing it so you're not aware of it. Well, can I just pop that back at you and ask you what, what you would suggest to someone

Speaker 3:          00:59:10       going into a relationship? Ah, I think this is probably above my pay grade. I have not yet decided how I feel about marriage or gained much clarity related to, uh, to marriage. But you know, I think I would, I would give the advice that Amanda Palmer, the musician received from a mentor furs and for any type of conflict resolution, say less. I think that would be the starting point. Just say less like that because my inclination and I think that my entire families are much of my family is this way. Certainly my brother's this way. The desire to be right sometimes overrides the pragmatic road to being effective, at least with uh, my brother and I can both get kind of righteously indignant and that does not help with conflict resolution. It turns out. So I would say say less. I've become better at it.

Speaker 5:          01:00:14       I love, and that there are a couple of things that come to mind. Phrases like I've heard you can be right or you can be married but not both, which I think is a good one. And then I asked some 80 year old guy who would have been married for 50 years, what his secret is and he said, okay, tooth marks on the tongue. That's the secret to a happy marriage. Just bite your tongue, bite it by the bite it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:39       It's funny, there's some, there's some funny bits of advice that I've heard thrown around. I'm not saying this is the advice I would give. I also talked to a friend, he's soon to be, who was it? It was not as father in law. It was not as direct father in law. It, he was about to get married literally the day of the wedding. And I think it was the grandfather from the old country, like Poland or somewhere grabbed him and he's like, let's take a walk. Took him for a walk and he said, this is all you need to know. He goes, only professionals only on the road. So I'll let people figure that out for themselves. But yeah, some, some credit relationship advice out there. Other advice I would give would be no. What you need to work on and ideally find someone who's really good at what you need to work on.

Speaker 3:          01:01:27       Um, because I, I do think, at least for me, the, there's a complimentary polarity that needs to exist for a relationship to have any longevity. And uh, it's, uh, it's a complementary set of skills, but those could overlap very much with attributes, just God given or nature given predispositions. Uh, and then the, you know, something that I don't know if I've ever written about, but I've noticed for a lot of relationships, and this goes for Hetero normative or homosexual goes for anything sexual as far as I can tell, uh, at least in, in many cases that if you were to imagine a sliding scale and you have 100%, and this, this is going to get people up in a tizzy, no matter I phrase it. So I'm going to try to state it simply, uh, 100% what we would consider feminine attributes on one end of the scale, and then 100% masculine attributes at the other end of the scale.

Speaker 3:          01:02:29       And in the middle you have perfect Androgyny, just a complete perfect 50, 50 androgyny in all respects, physical, mental, emotional, and otherwise that wherever you are on the slider, you will be most attracted to and have the most longevity. Well, actually I should not say longevity. You'll be most attracted to and perhaps most compatible with someone who is the opposite. So if you are, say 70% male attributes or a masculine attributes, 30% feminine attributes, then you will be most rejected someone who is 70% feminine attributes, 30% masculine attributes, and that that sort of equal polarity from the center 50 50 proof androgyny seems to work pretty well. And that when you find someone who generally, and this is just very abstract speculation on my part, but it seems to be the case when you see if people who are say overlap too much in on one side of that spectrum, very rarely works.

Speaker 3:          01:03:38       And from what I've observed, very, very rarely, uh, so that, that's not so much advice, but maybe I conceptual framework for thinking about, yeah, that's interesting. I was trying to apply it to my own merits to theater. Uh, and if I lined up and I think actually 70 30 is, is about where I am. Salmon maybe. Yeah, maybe 65 35 and I don't know if different people would say lower. So those are, those are the, some of my passing thoughts. Um, Bilin ones working on it. Yeah. This is something I'm working on a lot. I'm hoping to have a number of people on the podcast to discuss these types of questions as the Perella would be one there a handful of others. Have you had Dan savage on the, I haven't, you know, he would be another, he'd be, he'd be another mind to pick on this.

Speaker 3:          01:04:25       And uh, he's been recommended to, to quite a few, uh, by quite a few listeners of mine as well. Uh, so it's, it's, uh, so I was chatting with a friend of mine, I don't know if you've spent any time with Neil Strauss before. All right, so back, so Neil, eight time New York Times bestselling author, he's one of those guys who never gets writer's block. It makes me crazy. But he wrote a piece recently, I think it was for rolling stone and just like the age of fear. But the point, I might be getting the headline wrong, but it, the basic premise was that we've never lived in safer times and yet everyone is more afraid than they've ever more fearful than they've ever been. So for a while you wrote a column for, I guess it was mental floss. Yes. Can I just say one thing about Neil Strauss that I love is that he is so generous with his ideas. And this is something

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       I've come around to like, uh, you know, he, he gave me two or three book ideas. I never pursued them, but they're good book ideas. Like he had one where he said, you should just,

Speaker 5:          01:05:30       you know what, it's kind of similar to your podcast. You should find the best, the Michael Jordan of everything and learn their secrets and then write a book. It's kind of tools for titans kind of exactly what I did. That's hilarious. I didn't realize that. But I love the idea of being generous with your ideas. Cause when I first started my career, I was so paranoid. I wouldn't, people say, what are you working on? Oh, I can't tell you. Even though it was like, you know, it was probably some lean thing that no one's going to steal. And if they did steal it. So what? It's all about execution. Uh, so I, this is a crazy story. This is, I'm much older than you. So when I very first started, I got out of college, they were still libraries and that's where you would go to research things.

Speaker 5:          01:06:14       And I was doing a book on, it was like a joke book on the eerie, similarities between Jesus and Elvis because Elvis had said that he was, he believed he was the second coming. And I was so paranoid that I went to two different libraries. So I went to one to get books about Elvis and wanting to get books. Anybody to put two and two together. Yeah. Is that an insane level of delusion? They're like, who cares? And then now I feel telling people my ideas at the positives outweigh the negatives that you've, you meet people who are interesting, who can help you or expand the idea. Um, I dunno if you know Adam Mansbach, uh, who wrote go the, I don't know. Are you loud? Do you want the e on this or no? Go the F to sleep. Oh No, you. Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 5:          01:07:02       You don't know. We have lots of cursing, so deliberately not, uh, Falwell compliant. So yes, go the fuck to sleep. Really. Yeah. And he really, it's brilliant, which became a huge bestseller because it got leaked as far as I can tell as a pdf among people in the publishing world. Oh, that's so interesting. Part of how it became a huge bestseller. Well that's similar to because he had put it up as a Facebook update and like as a joke, he said, I'm going to write a book called go after sleep and, and people are like, you should do that. So the idea of sharing and being out there with your ideas, um, that's, I've been a big change in my career.

Speaker 3:          01:07:40       So just to touch on that because I think it's really important ideas. Uh, Neil Strauss does this all though, when he is working on something, he is tremendously paranoid about it. And when he's already committed to writing something, I've known Neil forever and he's still will not, he's afraid of letting out the meme now. But I do think these are two different things. Once you fully committed to doing something and when you're testing the waters I think are two distinct phases. But I remember when I was proofreading his book, emergency number one, the only reason he let me write about it or rather a read it was because he wouldn't tell what he was writing about. He wouldn't tell me, he wouldn't tell me. And I just threw out this hail Mary and I said, what is it? Some five flags stuff, which is very sort of insider terminology for all sorts of kind of prepper survivalist, multiple passport communities.

Speaker 3:          01:08:30       And his eyes got about the size of, of, of, of uh, of a dinner plate. And he said, what have you heard, what have you heard? And then he would give me printed out like 15 to 20 pages at a time to proofread. And then I would have to give those back before I could have the next set. I love it. Where are they color coded? I color coded, although the, I'm sure knowing the, Oh, there's probably some type of identification like serial numbers on them, but uh, but he, he is very generous as ideas. Until he decides where he's going to go all in. And Kevin Rose, very close friend of Mine, serial entrepreneur, extremely successful investor, does the same thing. And the Kevin Kelly founding editor of wired, one of my favorite people out there, I think he's, he's probably the real world, most interesting man in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:09:20       Uh, you know, a technology futurist who spends time with the Amish almost every year to determine how they, how they accept and vet technology. I mean, fascinating guy. He also tries to give away or kill as many of his own ideas as possible and if he can't give them away, he can't kill them and they stick with him and uh, he, you know, he alone then those are the ideas he conceived, he considers pursuing. So in a way, giving ideas away is one of his filters for determining what he should work on because he is, he's a man of a lot of ideas. He might have 20 different projects, right? The ones he can't give a give away. Uh, when that group overlaps with, or I should say, rather, when you combine the ones he can't give away with the ones that, uh, he can't kill because he can't find flaws in them, some fatal flaw. Those are the projects ends up.

Speaker 5:          01:10:13       That's so interesting. I love that. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:10:15       So we were, but we were, uh, we were, we were talking about earlier on being grateful for the little things. And then Neil came up because he wrote this rolling stone piece on the, the age of fear and how everyone's terrified and thinks that the world's going to hell in a hand basket and every possible respect. But objectively, things seem pretty good.

Speaker 5:          01:10:35       Oh yeah. I totally believe that. And, and there's that great Steven pinker book, the better angels of our nature, which traces the history of violence and how we are in the safest time ever, even with the horrors of the 20 20th century wars. And, um, yeah, and I, uh, there was a great magazine called mental floss that just folded a month ago, but they still have a web presence. And I wrote a monthly column. Uh, I can't remember. I want it to call it the good old days sucked. But I don't think it ended up being called that, but, but the premise was we all, we have this powder and problems. Oh yeah, exactly. Modern problem. There we go. You are, let me see. You're better than me. Uh, I just happened to read your Wikipedia more, more recently than you. Uh, yeah, so the idea was every month I would take a different topic and shell how horrible life used to be and, and how grateful we should be.

Speaker 5:          01:11:31       You know, not all of us, there are still people in other countries and even in our country living in horrible conditions. But uh, if you're lucky enough, we live in by far the best times. And there are so many examples I did. The first one I think was on medicine and the one that came, uh, the one I talked about in the first paragraph I believe was the, uh, the smoke enema, left tobacco, Anima, which is, you know, the phrase blow smoke up your ass. Like that was a literal thing. It came because they would have a hose and a and a pump and they would shoot tobacco up your butt, uh, because they believed that it was good for your stomach and good for your health kid. This might explain something that I've been trying to figure out for years now. So a friend of mine sent me a photograph of the menu of a whorehouse in like the early 18 hundreds and it was like blow job, $2, you know, whatever.

Speaker 5:          01:12:34       This type of sex, $3, this type of sex, $1. And then it had smoke up the ass $30. And I was like, wait a second, I want to know what the smoke up the ass is about. I was very curious because it's like what was the, but maybe this was actually like the medicinal option of the venue. Exactly. It was like, that is fascinating. How did something not so highly prized come to be associated with a deceitful flattery? Blowing smoke up your ass. It is, it's a weird, a weird segue. Uh, I don't know. Let to make, all right, so the tobacco enema back in the day. So yeah. Uh, I'm sure you can still find it. I'm sure there's someone out there. If you Google it, uh, oh, you know what else to be thankful. If you era for feeling down, uh, I would Google the words surgery without anesthesia and uh, and read the first person accounts of people who had surgery and it is just, Oh my God, it is just, does not sound appealing or pleasant in the least? No, it was cray. Yeah. This one woman wrote one and it was just, you know, I couldn't sleep for days, so even when I'm going to the hospital for a procedure, I'm like, all right, at least we got anesthesia so it has made my life better. This idea and, uh, people out there. You can definitely find Neil's piece on this as well, which I think is a good two good recalibration. Yeah. I remember something was really bothering me. Uh, I was maybe I ran across something about isis, drowning people in cages or,

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       or burning people alive, both of which are of course, horrible, horrible, horrible things. And I was having a conversation with someone I won't mention, but very, very famous and successful technologists. And he said, well, he's like all terrible, but thank God we're not in the Middle Ages. He's like, broadly speaking, humanity would be much worse off than we are right now with, with these edge cases.

Speaker 5:          01:14:33       Absolutely. And on that theme you can also Google Louis C K on Conan. I think it's something like everything is great and everyone's miserable.

Speaker 3:          01:14:44       Yes. All right. So as far as long as you're doing stand up, I was, I was, I was not going to mention this, but I will because I think it's so hilarious living in San Francisco. I get a overdosed on San Francisco sometimes and there may be a place for this. So people out there who are aficionados try not to freak out and just laugh at, uh, yourselves or laugh at this because I think it's pretty funny. Patton Oswald. So one of my favorite comedians has this piece, uh, where he opens in effect saying, you know, if, if one of my whole foods friends lectures me one more time on home birth, so I'm going to punch all the soy and the planet and he goes on to talk about, and I'm not going to do it justice, but he's like, you know what women were dreaming about on the frontier when there were like squatting on the mud in a shack, giving birth hospitals, these amazing sterile environments where you didn't have to worry about the wolverines sneaking in and stealing the afterbirth. And He, I, I want people to listen to it cause I think it's so good. I love that. Uh, yeah, it's easy to Romanticize it itself and the good old days when in fact the good old days are very frequently terrible, terrible. The terrible old is

Speaker 5:          01:15:51       fat. And actually that brings to mind when I was researching the Bible, uh, there is a line in the Bible where God says, because of Eve eating the apple, uh, women shell have pain in childbirth and when anesthesia for childbirth was first introduced, there were some, uh, super religious people who are like, oh no, we can't have that. Women have to suffer. And a, so thank God I and my wife, she was like, gimme that drug Kimmy, give it to me now. It was no chance she was going to do it naturally. How did you choose,

Speaker 3:          01:16:29       use your [inaudible] projects? I mean these, these are big projects, book projects, very time consuming. What are, what are some of the, and maybe this is a way to to edge into it. What are some of the ideas you came close to doing that you ended up not doing it?

Speaker 5:          01:16:47       Uh, yeah. Well, there was the, the Kama Sutra, which my life up vetoing the Bosch on. Uh, I think, uh, the answer and maybe not the most surprising, but I have to be totally passionate about it because, uh, it can't just be something that I think will be popular and has to be something that I am super excited about. Cause like you, uh, you know, I commit to these things and maybe not to the level of Tim Ferriss, but I do, I go in, I go in hard and I try, I try to be Tim Ferris, he or my, I am the less successful, less famous Paris. Uh, but how many best sellers should bad for you're ahead of me bow not in tonight in terms of quantity. Uh, but yeah, I would say there's that. And if it makes me laugh, I once talked to a daily show writer, uh, about his writing process and he said one of the most important things to him was that he could surprise himself while he was writing.

Speaker 5:          01:17:54       And I love that idea. Just being able to surprise yourself. And I feel that same way about big ideas. You have to the like when you come up with the idea, you'd be like, Oh man, I love that idea. I like you. You amuse yourself or just going like, hmm, when that happens, I've tried to become better at that because I've noticed a Bj Novak who's a fantastic writer and a excellent of course actor and everything else, producer, well known for the office and many other things. But uh, he, Scott Adams as well, creator of Dilbert really pay a lot of attention to the kinesthetic sort of body response to what they're writing. And so I've tried to really, really hone in on paying more attention to that as I'm writing or drafting or brainstorming or anything that's only making a note here that, cause I've never talked about this, but when I'm writing and I write something that I, I think might be funny, I can tell there's sort of a little ping in the back of my head, like a little dopamine rush and yeah, I do try to pay attention to that.

Speaker 5:          01:19:01       That's so interesting. I never, never verbalized it. Um, and then just the idea I do love, like I think you do is taking, uh, an idea and just pushing it to its logical extreme just to reductio ad absurdum. So like, you know, when I first read about outsourcing and I was like, well this is cool, how can I push this to the extreme? How can I outsource every single thing in the world? Uh, and that's how I came up with the idea for, for those folks, beauty of Reductio ad absurdum also underestimated and I think its power and its humor. Uh, why so you were saying I have to be really excited about it. I have to on some level maybe find a funny why genealogy. Well then not something that people generally think of as the slapping. It's true. Well genealogy is a dean.

Speaker 5:          01:19:53       Yeah. I try not to use that word. I say a family history that sounds, but there we go. Really connections or, uh, but this came about because a couple of years ago I was, uh, at my desk and I got an email from a guy and he said, you don't know me but your 12th cousin. And I thought, okay, next comes, he's going to say please, why are $10,000 to my name Nigerian bank account? But he didn't. And I looked into it more. And he's one of this group people, they're researchers and scientists, uh, and geneticists who are building a family tree, the biggest family tree ever, the biggest possible family tree ever of every human on earth connecting everyone on earth in one family tree. And I was like, that is a bold, crazy idea. I love it. So that's how I dove into it. And, and it's crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:20:43       You know, as I say, there are two ways you do it with DNA, but one way is on the Internet where you almost a Wikipedia like model where thousands, millions of people are working on the same big family tree. So I'm on this tree, which now has 100 million people. And one of the fun things that will take up like a week of your life as he can figure out how you're related to almost anyone else. Like Barack Obama for instance. This is true is my fifth grade aunt's husband's brother's wife's seventh great nephew. So, uh, so we're pretty close. I'm sure when he's out of office soon he'll be hang in with me. So I loved this idea. It's like six degrees of Kevin Bacon, but everyone is Kevin Bacon. Uh, and, and I became entranced and I decided this is my next book. And for your listeners, actually it has very practical implications because you were article here on the Tim Ferriss show.

Speaker 5:          01:21:39       Yeah. This is, uh, this is a, this is a tool I believe four titans or, or non titans. But it is, it's like the greatest social network ever. It's like linkedin on steroids because I was trying, I threw an event of trying to hold the biggest family reunion ever and I needed publicity. So I would find a reporter or a TV producer. I would figure out how I was related to them. I would send them an email and say, listen, this may sound weird, but you are my, uh, seventh cousin, three times removed, husband's son. Uh, so we're, we're family. Would you do a favor for a cousin and write about my project? And I'd say, you know, 20% of the time they were freaked out and like, you know, stop stalking me. But 80% of the time they were intrigued. They're like, really? We're cousin.

Speaker 5:          01:22:34       Oh, that's so interesting. And, and I got more publicity that way than anything. So what was the subject line? Do you remember what the subject line it might've been? Uh, I think it was from Asia. Your relative? Yeah, from Adj, your distant cousin. I wanted to, for my book about it, I wanted to interview George h w Bush. So, you know, cause he's like, got this huge family. So I emailed his chief of staff and is like, you know, uh, and she said, oh, we're where he's not doing interviews. And I said, well, but I am a cousin. She's like, oh, well your cousin, I guess we can make an exception, probably go down and interview them. So until for, for another like three years, this will work and then everyone will realize, oh wait, everyone's cousins. So, uh, but I highly recommend it as a strategy for now.

Speaker 5:          01:23:25       Gotta make it gotta make it count while you can. Right. Uh, why did you decide to do a podcast? Yes. I am now a number of fans, uh, of yours and mine said they'd love to your audio books. Ah, that's nice. And have you, God, you know, this went in a need to edit this out if this is not the right anecdote, but I could swear that you told me at some point that you went into record your audio book and the People at the studio, I want to say this was you. They said, well, you seem to have a cold, so why don't you come back when you don't have a cold? Is this, is this the right story? Oh, that's hilarious. But I, you know what, it might well have been, I don't trust my memory. So I have a, one of my friends at least who, who has gone on Abe's, you or somebody else.

Speaker 5:          01:24:23       And he, he went into record his audio book and he was so excited when they went on to be hugely successful. And the Andy, he recorded for a 10 minutes and the producer and the students like, you know what, let's, let's take a break. And, uh, when, uh, what we have, you come in in a few days when you're cold is over. And he's like, no, I don't have a goal. This is just what I sound like. Love it. I know I have an odd voice. I have an invoice. It hasn't, uh, it hasn't hindered me to my own. I'm not saying you have an odd voice. I was bringing it up because I thought that it was from you, but I love that. Well, I will tell you when I had recorded my audio book, I, um, I apparently had a very active stomach. I, and so it was growing a lot.

Speaker 5:          01:25:02       Uh, so I had to do a lot of rethinks and I was apologize and the producers and they said, no, no to everyone that have with everyone. And they in fact had a file of all these famous authors like body sounds like, like Susan Sontag's farts or whatever. Uh, and I was like, you got to put that out. Like that would be the most awesome album, famous people's bodily functions. Uh, but I don't think they did. So anyway, the podcast, so I took us off the rails podcast. I'm very excited about. It's a, it's called twice removed and it's sort of an interview show mixed with hardcore history mixed with a game show. So it's an odd mix. And the idea is we take a notable person and then we go through their family history and find the most interesting inspirational stories and then talk about those.

Speaker 5:          01:25:56       And then at the end we introduced them to a cousin they didn't know they had. So it's sort of this like surprise ending. And it could be someone like that bear their hero, maybe their mentor. It could be a, you know, an ex girlfriend. It could be. It could be anyone. And we don't, we haven't done that yet, but, uh, but yeah, exactly. You, our wives, we all our cousins with your spouse. Uh, but yeah, no, I, and it's being produced by Gimlet who start up, uh, which I'm sure because you're friends with Chris Saka and so, uh, yeah, uh, startup, which is, as you might know, your listeners might know. It's like, uh, it was a podcast about starting a podcast company, very metta. Um, so they are doing it and they are amazing because they are, they're all like this American life, uh, alumns.

Speaker 5:          01:27:01       And so they are just so good at editing and crafting the story and music. And I, I know nothing about it. So it's been a fascinating learning experience and learning also how to tell stories in an audio way, which is just different. And, uh, so I've, I've found it, uh, it's fascinating. Uh, it's been, uh, uh, we'll see. We'll see how it does, but I'm, I'm excited. Yeah. They have a really good team. I mean, Alex Bloomberg, he's actually, he's also in tools of titans. Really, really good at asking questions because he's, he's, he records really long tape and is good at eliciting emotion and stories specifically like you said, from interview subjects. And he, uh, he gives me, I'm sure I, since you interviewed him, like, yeah, the silence. He's like brilliant at using the silence. Just like waiting on, getting the silence, do the work.

Speaker 5:          01:27:52       Oh yeah. He's really, really good. And they've had a whole string of really successful shows me and reply all mystery show. They've had a very, very consistent hit rate. So, uh, cost. I will be certainly checking that out. And uh, and we actually had one that's sort of related to some of the stuff you do. We had, um, Abby Jacobson who's on broad city, she's a hilarious comedian, but one of her ancestors was this entrepreneur, a woman entrepreneur. So we did like a whole segment on female entrepreneurs through history, uh, including Betsy Ross. Like we all think of her dislike, so in the flag. But apparently she's like, she had like a team. She was, cause she was, she was a kitten. Yeah. Uh, and same with, um, JFK is great. Grandma came over and opened a like a button shop and it's, the Kennedys would not have existed if she hadn't been an entrepreneur and funded her kids' education and then they whatever got into liquor and then that spawned the political dynasty, the gateway to all good things. Is it

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       to you or of course going to be promoting the podcast? You've promoted books in the past, done various types of PR and marketing. Uh, one of the bullets that I wanted to talk about was, and this is in your voice, but how I learned to love marketing these, a lot of, a lot of authors, a lot of artists certainly think of marketing as a sullying their hands with the dirty work of commercialism or, uh, a, an evil to be avoided. So how did you learn to

Speaker 5:          01:29:42       I didn't, well, you know, partly inspired by Tim Ferris. Uh, but partly it was, I reframed marketing, I'm trying to think of it, not as the sullying, uh, that selling my art, but as something that could be creative in its own right. And part of this was I interviewed the artist Christo, you know, the guy who raps islands and uh, the, the gates in central park, a really interesting guy. And he was working on this one project for 24 years. He was trying to put up these gates in central park, these like flat, uh, these curtains and arches in central park, like 10,000 orange, uh, arches. And he had to deal with city bureaucracy for 24 years. So I asked him, you know, God, that must have been so frustrating. And he said, well, yes and no. He said, I actually see dealing with the bureaucracy and as part of my art is like all part of one big art project.

Speaker 5:          01:30:46       Uh, so I don't separate it from the actual designing of the, uh, of the pieces. And I was like, that's an interesting way to look at it. So I tried to apply that to marketing and instead of seeing it as this horrible pain in the ass, like, what can I do that's creative with it? And one of the things when I was doing the year of living biblically, for instance, I was like, how can I a section this off so it, uh, I can appeal to like 50 different audiences. So I wrote a piece for a music magazine about music in the Bible. Uh, I did for Glamour magazine. I wrote sex advice in the Bible cause there's, there's a good amount of sex in the Bible. Um, and uh, and it was actually, it was very interesting. I've, I became a fan of this way of thinking as opposed to being an end. The same thing with speeches. I used to hate giving speeches, but like we said before, the whole fake it till you make it. Uh, I, I forced myself to do every speech I could and now I just, you know, I love, I actually,

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       I, I'm not a fan of sitting down in front of the keyboard, but I, I'd much rather be on stage talking. Well that's part of the, uh, the dangerous Siren Song of marketing. So when I was working on tools of titans, I uses a program called scrivener to put together my books that I've done that for the last three books. And there is a, I had a working file, which was marketing ideas and I found it was very dangerous to have that within a stone's throw of my writing because it was always easier to or more enjoyable for me to work on the marketing ideas and put off the actual work of writing. So it had marketing ideas and I modified the file name. So it was marketing ideas, Ha Dash, focus on writing in all caps, exclamation points. Uh, that's it. But now if you had to rank the different parts of your job in terms of enjoyment and enjoyment that they give you, what would you say?

Speaker 3:          01:33:04       Well, it's a, funny enough, this past this, this last book was the first one that I've enjoyed writing. I enjoy, I love doing what I'm doing right now, which is my favorite part of writing without the writing, right? The interviewing, I love the interviewing and the researching. Do. I do enjoy the experimentation, but there's sometimes go sideways as you and I both know. So there's a always turn out as intended or hoped. Uh, and then the probably historically would have been marketing and then the writing, but the writing was right there. I would say yes. Not at par with the marketing, maybe even ahead of it this time around, which, what do you think that was? Was it the, the topic or what did you discover some who enjoy their work? There were a few things. I think that primarily it was the enjoyment and assimilation of, this is kind of Meta, but absorbing the lessons and recommendations of the people I interviewed as I was editing and reviewing and taking multiple passes on these chapters.

Speaker 3:          01:34:10       Interesting. So I was, I was actually incorporating a lot of the, what's an example? Do you remember one? Sure. Oh yeah, I was, I ended up having a routine where, for instance, I did a, used a barrel sauna, which with the exact same specs as Rick Ruben who recommended it to me, uh, and alternated that with cold exposure at specific times of the day. Just like Wim Hoff Wood. And in the mornings I would listen to say a guided meditation from Tara Brock, specifically the 2010 summer smile meditation, which Ray proposal recommended to me. So I started incorporating, and then I would take say exogenous ketones, which of these powders, synthetic ketones, which Dominic D'Agostino had recommended to me. So all of these bits and pieces from the actual

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       became part of my daily routine for working on the chapters, which is kind of wild. And then there's the deeper kind of philosophical stuff. I was writing this mostly over the summer and early fall and there were a few people in the book, like Bj Miller who is a palliative care physician who's helped more than thousand people die. Ed Cooke, memory champion who taught, you might remember a book called moonwalking with Einstein. Yeah. So Ed Cooke is, who is the the memory champion slash coach who taught in this case? I think it was Joshua Four. Yeah, there's four brothers. Both amazing writers. Uh, three of you now there are three. That's right. So to become national membrane champion in the U S in one year. So Ed Cooke, NBJ Miller, both use stargazing is a way to reduce anxiety and they both have particular ways that they go about it. So, so I did that every night before going to bed and it just went on and on and on.

Speaker 3:          01:35:53       So I think that the subject matter itself had a huge impact on the writing of the book, which was unexpected in a way that is the mark helpful. Yeah. And the marketing at this point for me is fun because I try to make it fun in the sense that I very often ask myself, how can I make the launch itself PR worthy, if that makes sense. And that forces me to do sometimes absurd things. And even if some of the absurd things are, uh, what, what I might consider or people might consider a waste of money, like doing billboards in New York City right now I have 80 plus billboards in New York City with the answers from guests to the question, what would you put on a billboard if you could put anything on a billboard to get a message out to millions of people. So we've got all these answers and took some of my favorites and now they're on actual physical billboards all throughout New York City that probably doesn't sell a lot of books. But that gives me such childlike joy to do something that absurd and to make guests happy themselves, that even if it is a waste of money, it's probably not a waste of money, meaning an isolation. Maybe it's a waste of money, but because of the infusion of enthusiasm that it's given me an excitement, it's created in a, among many of the of the guests and people who ended up in the book. It's acted as fuel for a lot of other things that actually do have a good financial return or at least a clear financial.

Speaker 5:          01:37:27       I love that. Funny. Yeah. I had a similar experience. I actually have, I'm finishing my book on the family now, but as part of it last summer, I through, uh, the biggest worldwide family reunion, uh, ever, and that was like financially not a great, but it was, uh, it was so fun and so interesting. Uh, and, and I hope raised the profile enough that it will pay off in the end. But, um, yeah, cause it was like 4,000 people in New York. But then there were 40 simultaneous reunions around the world and sister sledge came and saying, we are a family. One thing, this was a, this was a revelation. You know, I was sister sledge, we are family. I'm like, this is the perfect. So this is, uh, but it turns out like one of the sisters, like he's not talking

Speaker 3:          01:38:26       to the other lawsuit. So their family in the sense that every family is dysfunctional. Uh, let's grab a couple of the end questions and then we'll jump into some rapid fire questions. Yeah. This is a question you probably get a lot. I certainly get it a lot, but I'm curious how you would answer. This is from Constantine. He knows them stiffs of, as, I can't pronounce it, but it's a I. N o z. E m t. S. E. V. Which experiment or approached turned out to be a total dud. Something that you had extremely high hopes for? The completely flopped.

Speaker 5:          01:39:04       I did star, uh, and you probably will remember this guy's name, but, uh, the man who invented a, the idea of micro expressions where you, right Paul? I come in, yes, there we go. And it was, his idea was he was like the show about the lie catcher, you know, the people you can tell who's lying based on their facial expressions. So I interviewed him, great interview, and I tried it and I just couldn't do it. I don't know. I don't know whether it's because it's a pseudoscience or whether, because it's my failure probably the ladder, but I, it just, uh, and it's fun to write about failures,

Speaker 3:          01:39:46       but not when there's just nothing but can eat a little know lesson learned. Just couldn't do. Exactly. Uh, all right. This is from Miguel flea gear, I think it is, uh, book outtakes from your year of living biblically.

Speaker 5:          01:40:04       Is there anything that didn't make it in that interesting? I did, yes. There was, in Orlando, there's a theme park called the Holy Land Experience, which is the Disney version of, uh, ancient Jerusalem. And so you've got, and you know, instead of mascots like Disneyworld, you've got, you know, Jesus, you got this guy with robes and the beard and he's got a little Madonna, Ted face, Mike. And he's, you know, talk and you've got these guys like lepers. That was my feet like a blind leper begging on the street with his little microphone. Uh, so, and then they read it. But, but anyway, I went there and it could have been a funny chapter in that it was, I found it very ridiculous, but it was also like shooting fish in a barrel. It was like, or I think PJ O'rourke said, uh, you know, shooting cows with a sawed off shotgun. It was just too easy. And um, and there, and there are people, I'm sure that it was meaningful too. So why, why ruin their lives just for a cheap laugh? So that didn't make it,

Speaker 3:          01:41:16       so this is, I mean, these are all related, I suppose. This is from Anna Lamont and I'll, I'll try to simplify this a little bit, but that, or I might rephrase that for I read, it would be great to hear you take on whether it's possible to completely rewire our subconscious to ignore the norms and expectations instilled by society, family, environment, et Cetera, or is it a never any work in progress, something that you need to become aware of and focus on every single day? So I think part, if I could read into this, maybe what is being asked is or implied, is that we both do all these crazy experiments. How have you trained yourself to ignore the norms and conventions? But, uh, and this was directed at both of us. For me, I would say the writing is just the ultimate excuse. It's the, it's the perfect alibi to do any absurd thing you could possibly conceive of. And then just say, I'm doing it and writing it out. And people are like, oh, okay. Then, I mean, but if you were doing it seriously, right, if you, if you didn't have the pretext of writing about it for the year of living biblically, like I'm sure plenty of people thought you were crazy anyway, but there are people who would have assumed you were completely insane who otherwise were like, oh, that's so genius. Oh, what a great idea.

Speaker 5:          01:42:28       Yeah, absolutely. I think that's it. I mean, I think if you on a fee yourself as a method writer or instead of a method actor and just get into character,

Speaker 5:          01:42:39       um, I, I often do that. I'm like, I'm going to get into character now. I, you know, this is not me. This is me. And I think that you don't have to be a writer to do that. Actually, I think the idea of experimenting on your own life, even if you're not writing a book, is I think it's great to just, you know, try eight different toothpastes and see which works. But there is a sense where you have to commit and you're like, you know what, I'm, I'm going to force myself to do this. I'm going to take on a character and I'm going to do it. Uh, so that I find very helpful. And I think

Speaker 3:          01:43:10       also I would say this to Anne or anyone is that if you frame something, even if you're not writing about it as an experiment, I'm doing x for y number of months. You also can kind of get away with murder in the sense that if you're worried about trying something unusual or uncommon and you can get to, what should I test by the extension to reductio ad absurdum, right. Like, okay, if people are outsourcing like you did, what is the most absurd, exaggerated place where, where's the most absurd, exaggerated place? I can take this. Yeah, right. Like, all right. Passive aggressive bickering with my wife. Like I'm going to have someone that on my behalf or an uh, or having eaten, I actually, ah, you know, this might be another misattribution but had no, it's not, it's not this one. I think I'm getting right.

Speaker 3:          01:43:59       Were you, you hired someone to be worried on your behalf? I saw an extreme. I thought that was, you found it really helpful and that sounded so absurd. But I remember, I think it was a four hour body. I was really stressed out about the deadline. And so I paid her a virtual assistant to worry about my deadline for me. And it was just, it was such a weird, uh, form of, not necessarily self deception, but like taking advantage of a quirk of human psychology to know that someone else was on the job. So then I, I then, who is your virtual assistant? Was it like an Indian or, uh, in from Philippines. The Philippines. Yeah. Good Warriors. Yeah. And that is awesome. Well, I, and I also think calling it an experiment gives you permission to fail because it's an experiment. Sometimes experiments fail.

Speaker 3:          01:44:49       So if you do a change in your life and say, I'm experimenting with this, it makes it, and it reminds me of, uh, uh, I'm probably gonna get this wrong, but I think it was a French writer named Montonya who came up with a little word essay, which means to try. So that's what I find that so freeing. Like when you write something, it's you're just trying it, let's try and may work, may not. And the more that at least has been true for me, the more experiments you attempt and the more you try to push the absurd, uh, in certain respects, the easier it gets because you realize the penalties are generally not that severe with some of the stupid stuff that I do at, they end up physically being pretty severe and you can get very injured. Like don't try to learn park where in a week it turns out to be a bad idea for your knees.

Speaker 3:          01:45:41       I saw you recently after that you had done that and you were, I was good. I was not in good shape. He's still have injuries from that. But generally if you're doing these, these experiments that you think you're going to be judged very harshly for, if you're presenting them in, in the right way, if you feel compelled to explain them, uh, generally they're very few repercussions and people were actually more supportive and interested in then you would expect. And also if you get something good out of it, uh, for your own life, then it's probably worth it. Unless you inflict massive pain on others. Like with radical honesty. Yes. Radical honesty. That's the other one I want to explore a bit. There's a great book called lying by Sam Harris. I read that. I think it's a great, great book. Very complimentary to the, I think you're fat as a, uh, okay. So here's, this is from Charlotte Chapman, most embarrassing failure at an experiment. So aside from the micro expressions, right? Uh, most embarrassing failure and experiment, did he give up or refine his approach? Interesting. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think my life been a series of

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       embarrassments and humiliations. So in a way you engineer your, that's true. I experiments to be embarrassing. Yes, exactly. Because I'd also think that makes me better, a better copy is, you know, and that is actually one thing I was thinking about that I learned doing this podcast is that I'm being humiliated on radio is actually sometimes makes for better radio. So, uh, when I'm doing interviews and I ask a question and the person is like, God, that's a dumb question. That is beautiful. That makes the cut. That's gold. Yeah. So I, I may not look that sound, that good on the podcast, but I think it's entertaining. So, um, but yeah, I would say many humiliations I, I don't know if this counts, but this is the first one that comes to mind is, uh, I was working at Esquire magazine and we asked the actress, Mary Louise Parker to pose nude.

Speaker 5:          01:47:49       And I was, uh, uh, uh, tasked with asking her and she said, well, I will pose nude, but only if the editor of the piece also poses nude. And I was the editor. So, uh, I went to my editor in chief and he was like, all right, well do it. Take off your pants. That's your job. Uh, so I had to pose nude for a very well known celebrity photographer. And it was, it was quite humiliating and, and, uh, vulnerable and, and also highly insulting because I was, you know, he was, he's a big photographer, so you'd like 10 assistants, like Gorgeous, 20 something female assistance. And I was like, oh my God, this is so embarrassing. But they could not care less. They were like, you were like, no interest in my nude form. So that was like, that was tough for my ego.

Speaker 5:          01:48:38       And then they came out and they actually published the picture and we got some subscription cancellations, I believe. So it was a, overall, I was a, it was a dark time. All right, let's, let's do some rapid fire questions, which may in fact be misnamed. Uh, but there, there's short questions. The answers don't need to be short. When you hear the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind or who comes to mind? Uh, well, this is a little schmaltzy even answer, but I would say my dad, uh, he is a lawyer who loves his job. Like, he literally has no hobbies because only loves is spending time with his family and his job. So if you can derive that much pleasure from your job, uh, I think that's a success. I mean, to me they're two criterion for success. One is that you're happy and the other is that you're making the world a better place. So, um, and I think he does both. And he's also like, he is definitely in, in our genre of like taking things to the ridiculous extreme. He, he writes law books and he holds the world record for the most number of footnotes in a law article. 4,280. Yeah. So he finds something and he just goes with it.

Speaker 3:          01:50:02       Wow. Apple does not fall too far from the tree on that one. Uh, what is, I don't ask this with everyone, but I'll, I'll ask you, what is something you believe that other people think is insane or that very few people who would agree with you on?

Speaker 5:          01:50:17       Yeah, I love this question. And there, there are many, many things. Uh, so let me just go over a couple of them quickly. Uh, without trying to alienate too many of your listeners are so alienated away. Yeah, they're tough. All right. One is a cannibalism. Uh, what about it? You're up. You're a proponent. I am a proponent of ethical camel cannibalism. Okay. I'm very interested in excited about in vitro meat, lab grown meat. Like you take a little cell from a chicken and grow, uh, you know, a chicken breast or, um, so I'm very excited that I think in 10 or 20 years it's going to be reality and it's going to open up. You don't have to just eat cows or chickens, you know, you get a human burger. Yeah. Human burial. Well, I was thinking like, yeah, giraffe are endangered animals, but yeah, take it to the extreme. You get, what is the harm in eating another human, a human burger. And this is my idea for a startup. I know. I think you've pulled back on angel investing, so yeah. But um, and maybe some money. Plenty of them listening. All right. This may have already, someone may already be doing this, but my idea is a celebrity meat. So like you can eat a Brad Pitt Burger. Yeah. Either Ebita, Clooney Burger or eat a, you know, a j Lo Burger or, and it could even be

Speaker 3:          01:51:32       specific body parts like that. Little creepy. But I wonder what will end up being the Kobe beef of humans. So it's like if you can, if you can choose gender, race and so on, like where do we end up? Right, right. Yeah. That's interesting. I Dunno, I dunno for that. You have questions just begging to be answered. So cannibalism. Okay, that's one.

Speaker 5:          01:51:51       Um, another one I like Sam Harris. I don't believe in free will, which I think, uh, is some people see that as depressing, but I actually find it liberating and when, because it's so much easier to forgive yourself for doing stupid things if he realize that you really didn't have, there was no other die has been cast the die as we can endure. And I think you're more forgiving of other people and the stupid things they do. No, no. Conversely though wouldn't, couldn't you also be more uh,

Speaker 3:          01:52:27       forgiving or accepting of things that should not be condoned or is that that just come back to the lack of free will and your, your sort of,

Speaker 5:          01:52:39       my feeling is there's a difference between a fatalism and determinism. So you can believe that you don't have freewill. But of course our decisions make a difference. Like if I just for the rest of the month old lay here on this couch, you know, my life would, would fall apart. I realize that. So I'm not saying our decisions make a difference. It's just those decisions are predetermined. That's a big subject. Uh Oh and I did have, wait, what was the other one that I wanted to bring up? Shoot, it'll come back to it and go back to it. Oh well the last one, which is multi versus a, I know a lot of physicists believe in multi verses and, but it really hit me with this election cycle because it is so like I can see at the convention of of universes all of the multiverse is an ICC.

Speaker 5:          01:53:31       Our Universe is going to be like getting just ton of crap. Like guys, this is the universe where Donald Trump is president. Like can you believe that we'd be like, if the multiverse is actually collection of kids in school, you're saying that we're going to be taunted? I think so. I do believe that. Uh, so yeah, that's what I've been thinking about recently. What books, what book or books have you gifted the most to other people besides your own? Uh, I would say, I can't remember whether you had them on as a gas, but Jonathan Heit, I have not heard him on as a guest. He's a great writer. How do you spell his last name? H. A. I. D. T and I, maybe he's come up a few times in conversation with friends. Recently did a great ted talk. He wrote a book called the righteous mind and it's all about trying to figure out the, the gap between the red and blue states, Republican and Democrat.

Speaker 5:          01:54:25       And it's really interesting. And he likens it to almost taste buds. Like Republicans have different moral tastes buds than Democrats. And, uh, I think the righteous mind may have been recommended to me by a neuroscientist about a year ago, a phd in neuroscience. So the righteous mind, uh, what purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in recent memory? Is a good question. Uh, well one thing I do love the, my elastic shoe laces and my, uh, do you use those? No, I like this idea though. I was just fussing with shoelaces yesterday and got so fed up that I went and found a different pair of shoes that I had packed, uh, which you know, if she likes it. So elastic shoe laces. Yeah. So you just replace the, the cloth shoe laces with these, alas, I think it's called lace lock is of the brand I use. And yet lay shoe laces seem like such like 19th, 18th century technology. It's so crazy. We still use them. And these ones you just slip them on and they, they, for me at least, they're just as tight and uh, and secure. And also they're also not as sort of mental institution is like velcro shoes.

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       You don't have to make the jump to Velcro, you can go in between with the

Speaker 5:          01:55:47       right. Yeah, the velcro. If you're under seven or like over 80, you can get away with velcro. But in between it's hard.

Speaker 3:          01:55:57       Uh, do you have any particular morning rituals? Anything that is particularly important to you that is not obvious? Like, yes, you want to keep your kids alive and I'm imagining feed them in some form and fashion, but as a, are there any other morning routines or rituals that are important for you?

Speaker 5:          01:56:17       Well, one we talked about is sort of the, the mental calisthenics. I find that helpful. Another you talk about in your books, which is the sort of restricting information, information diets. And I have tried sometimes successfully to stop reading the newspaper or any news in the morning because, you know, then I just get depressed and spiral. Uh, I find it good to read news right before I go to bed cause then I get depressed and I'm able to fall asleep. So, uh, that for me, keeping your mind clear away from news in the morning is, is crucial.

Speaker 3:          01:56:56       Uh, if you were to give a Ted talk on something you are not known for, so you've given a lot of talks, but something that you are not associated with or known for whatsoever,

Speaker 5:          01:57:05       what would it be on? Oh, that's a good one. That's a good one. I, um, let me think. Uh, I don't know if this might be repetitive, but just talking about all of the horrible, the ways that the past is horrible. I think I could go on for like, I know you only have 20 minutes of, or a Ted talk, but I could go on for like four hours.

Speaker 3:          01:57:24       Uh, do you have any, anything, is there anything that you, uh, obsess on or over on the evenings or weekends? It's just something I got a pet obsession of yours that is, that you have not talked about.

Speaker 5:          01:57:39       Let's see. I mean, yes, I'm sure I'm, I'm a, a slightly obsessive person as are you. So, um,

Speaker 3:          01:57:48       yeah, slightly, it's slightly, is very generous in my case at least.

Speaker 5:          01:57:52       Uh, I, I'm trying to think. I would say, I guess, uh, that I'm, I do have the fear of missing out, not on parties, but on ideas. Like I am, I'm always nervous like that. I haven't read enough and that there's great ideas and I'm just willfully ignorant. Uh, so, so that's, I guess something.

Speaker 3:          01:58:19       You read the newspaper before you go to bed, exit breast and Wallah that then, uh, if you think about bad advice, what is, what is some bad advice that you hear given out often in your world? And you can define that any way you want. It could be writing, could be,

Speaker 5:          01:58:37       I do have one, I have one that's like a pet peeve of mine, which is be yourself, uh, because you know what, if yourself is an asshole, like Stalin, he was being himself just lets down would be stolen. That guy was really being himself. So I think, uh, if you think about this a little more, a little less flippantly, I think there are things that are very deep in us. You know, if you're gay, you're gay, don't try to change that. But there are, uh, aspects of our personality that we think are ingrained, but that can be changed. Like I don't think I'm a very outgoing person. Naturally. I think I, I would spend most days just indoors reading, but I forced myself to be social, uh, sort of force myself to be a, um, uh, to get out there and it's made my life better because you interact with people, you're happier. So don't just be yourself, try to, you know, be the best parts of yourself, but then take the worst parts of yourself and try to change those, which I think you do.

Speaker 3:          01:59:48       No, no, I agree with that. I agree with that bias. And I think there's also be yourself implies that you're a finished product in a sense to, which is where I take issue with the [inaudible], the obsession with discover yourself, where maybe as a compliment to that at least maybe even at an alternative, the create yourself maybe in some ways more accurate. Even though we think of this persistent, I, this persistent Tim, this persistent Aaj, uh, I mean from, from the cells in our body to just about every other aspect of our being. We were constantly in flux. I love that, uh, works in progress. So I may not have time to put this up in the next few weeks, but if you get, have one gigantic billboard anywhere to get a message out to millions of people, they could not be an advertisement. Uh, any short message,

Speaker 5:          02:00:42       I was thinking about this cause I know you ask it. I mean one thought that occurred to me is it's something like, you know, life is too complicated and subtle and filled with grace to be summed up on a billboard. So don't pay attention to billboards, something metta like that. Um, I did a piece on, on effective altruism. I know you introduced, interviewed McCaskill. Yeah, I am a fan of that way of thinking. Just, you know, how lucky we are and trying to give back. So maybe like, you know, I is that, but that would be an advertisement.

Speaker 3:          02:01:17       No, not necessarily. I mean you could have a, you know, if you make more than 68 k per year, you're in the global 1%.

Speaker 5:          02:01:23       Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. It was interesting cause like you got to use guilt, um, very guilt will only get you so far like that that might get you in the door. But then this feeling of, of empowerment of helping others I think is a better motivator for altruism.

Speaker 3:          02:01:45       Yeah. Well I think it's more if you're looking to optimize the lifetime value of a donor as opposed to a single transaction that the then resent then yeah. Guilt is not the primary tool. Right. At least it seems that way. Just working with a number of nonprofits, um, myself we'll say in educational stuff. So I sometimes ask people what advice they would give their younger self. I'm going to pose it a different way because you have this, this aged photo of yourself, your, your 82 year old self in your house. What, what advice do you think your 82 year old self would give your current self?

Speaker 5:          02:02:22       That is a good one. I like that twist. I think, um, and I tried to do this. I think my 82 year old self hopefully will be wiser and happier. I do think overall my level of happiness has arisen, uh, which is nice. Um, so hopefully trending in the right direction, hopefully fingers crossed that continues. Uh, and I, I guess I battled this to even today is um, uh, don't, uh, don't be so opinionated, don't have such strongly held beliefs that they can't be changed with evidence. Uh, you know, I think that this society is a weird, as a weird fetish with a strongly held beliefs and like, you know, these are my deep seated beliefs and if you change him, you're a flip flopper and I, you know, I think we should got to rebrand. Flip flopping is great as long as you're doing it based on evidence and not on whims like you are, you have the ability to, uh, you know, the courage to change your conviction. It's not just the courage of your convictions, but the courage to change them. So maybe I would tell myself, you know, work on that part of your personality. That's what makes a good scientist as well now. Exactly right. What is [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:03:45       one of your favorite personal failures? What I mean by that is specifically a failure that led in some way to a later success or set the stage for the later success.

Speaker 5:          02:04:03       Well, I have had many, many failures, have ways as we've discussed. And I am a big fan of them. I, uh, you know, and rejection. I try, that's one of the things I try to teach my kids all the time. Like, you know, you're going to get rejected 98% of the time. He just got to keep going. One, I don't know if this falls into the right category, but I, uh, NBC a couple of years ago options my life, one of my books and that it was going to be a comedy, uh, where every week it was this writer did another wacky experiment and chaos ensued. Uh, and it was a total failure. It didn't get picked up. What the lesson I learned was I actually made a conscious effort. I was like, you know what, this may or may not get picked up, but I am going to consciously enjoy this experience and get everything I can out of it.

Speaker 5:          02:04:55       Uh, you know, I got to meet Donald Sutherland, played my father in law. Um, my wife was played by this woman who had much bigger boobs than she did, so she loved it and it was just a blast. And I would go into meetings and I would see, he'd be like, you know what if, what if the main character who is named Aja, what if he did this? And they're like, oh, a Jay would never do that. I'd be like, ah, well I am. I don't, maybe he would. But it was just so much fun. And there's one producer who I read a book of hers and she's like, yeah, if you cannot enjoy the process, then you're screwed because the chances of getting a movie actually made are so infinitesimal. So enjoy the process, enjoy the walk up the mountain, not just the summit. That was a, that was a big lesson.

Speaker 3:          02:05:45       What's a, if you think back, can you think of the best or one of the best investments you've ever made? And that could be time, energy, money. I'll give you an example. So a Amelia Boone three time world's toughest mudder champion, most decorated obstacle course racer in the world, full time attorney, also at Apple. But it was her first entrance fee for one of these races, which was I think at the time, $400, $450, which was a stretch. I mean it was a, a real expenditure for, but it opened up this entirely new career and she not taken that. Who knows?

Speaker 5:          02:06:23       Uh, can you kidding? It doesn't have to be analogous to that, but, uh, he, can I go the other way? I have two ideas. One is about a month ago, I wrote an article for Esquire where I got the most expensive haircut in the world in New York City and $800 haircut. And it was crazy cause, uh, you know, as this guy, uh, it was on Park Avenue, his name is Julien Farel and he was very friendly. She said, Eric got. Um, and I was like, and it was a fascinating learning experience because of course it's not worth $800. It's like, that's insane. It's like, you know, 20% better than my super cuts, which cost 20 bucks. But just learning, he gets clients, he is booked all the time. Like how does he do this? And you know, he's got Goldman Sachs guys who've come in every week for an $800 haircut and it's, it's all about the experience because the actual cutting, it's not that different. Right. But the experience of the Cappuccino and the music and you know, he'll talk to you, stare, you deepen the eyes and talk to you about what your hair means to you and how it can change your life and tough task ahead of them with me if I go maybe,

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       although there the lot small remaining parts I have. Do you mean a lot to them?

Speaker 5:          02:07:40       Yeah. So yeah, it was fascinating. I mean that's how he does it. It's, and he'll look at your skull for like five minutes, like an artist like knowledgist for knowledge. So he's able to get clients by making the experience, even though the price is just so ridiculous. Maybe it's because the prices are ridiculous. That's a good part of it. Exactly. He has just Jack. So anyway, I thought that was an eye. I did not pay for it, luckily ask why are paid for it. So I guess one of my first books was about reading the Encyclopedia Britannica when they still actually printed that till they were like 40, 33 volumes. And uh, I read them all and that costs, that costs $1,500 to buy that set, which is an absurd amount for a, a book, but it turned out it paid off.

Speaker 3:          02:08:32       So would you say, was that book one of the biggest inflection points for you as a writer? I mean, did that, would you, would, if something put you on the map as a writer,

Speaker 5:          02:08:44       was it that book or was it an earlier piece where you, Saffron Atlee that took it to a different level. And, uh, I had written a couple of other books before, but they were sort of novelty short books like, you know, one was called America offline about this wonderful world outside of the Internet where you can actually meet people face to face and it's all like four copies. I it came out, I think it was, uh, it, it would probably suck, but it's also ahead of its time. So that probably both play. But that I think the key was that that was the first one with real emotion. Uh, and, and, and it's sort of an emotional arc. And I talked about my father, I talked about the meaning of life and, and you know, little lane way I, I tried but it, and that connected with people. I think emotion really does that. And that's one of the big lessons of this podcast that I'm doing with gimlet is like getting those emotional moments really makes a difference.

Speaker 3:          02:09:45       So let's, let's wrap up on a question directed at you, but for the audience of, for people listening and I'll certainly tell them, uh, we'll have two questions, but the first one is, is not related to where they can find you and so on, which is going to be the last question. This one is really, do you have any suggestions, recommendations, parting thoughts for people listening, something they could try or something that they can just carry with them that might be helpful or useful in some, ah,

Speaker 5:          02:10:16       aside from all the brilliant stuff we talked about for the last two hours, uh, it could be one that you want to underscore. Well, I definitely, I think we've both talked about this. The idea of experimenting with your life is so important because I think if you do the same, routines are good in some ways because they automate things. So some parts of your life should be automated, but sometimes the routines caused you to get in a Rut, like the, the neurons actually get in a neural rut. Uh, so doing simple tricks to just shake up your life. I've found it incredibly enriching. I think you have for sure. Uh, and it can be, as I said, it could be just trying a different toothpaste every month. You know, there's millions of to, I used crest for like 28 years because some kid at my camp use crest and I thought he was cool. So I kept buying it and like, you know, I actually don't like it. I don't like what it took me 28 years. I mean like, you know what, let me try some other stuff. And

Speaker 3:          02:11:21       you said also, I think this is worth repeating and I'm paraphrasing here, but it's often easier to act your way into thinking differently as opposed to thinking your way into acting differently.

Speaker 5:          02:11:31       Totally. Yeah. And the, yeah, the quote is, which is not mine, but yeah, it's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than to think your way into a new way of acting. It. I, I do love that.

Speaker 3:          02:11:43       Hey Jay, always fun to hang out. We've had a, we've seen each other a little bit this trip in New York City, which has been fun and great.

Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way, set it and forget it. Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than two and a half billion dollars under management. In fact, some of my very good friends, investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. So the question is why? Why is it so popular? Why is it unique? Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only pay pennies on the dollar for them.

Speaker 2:          02:15:10       And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations, bloated sales teams, et cetera. And I'll come back to that in a second. I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk assessment quiz, which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in. And if you just want to take their advice, run with it, do it yourself. You can do that or as I would, you can set it and forget it. And here's why. The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't. Great investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax loss harvesting, rebalancing your portfolio, cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large amounts of money over longer periods of time.

Speaker 2:          02:15:57       Wealthfront, as I mentioned, since it's using software instead of retail locations, etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely impossible right off the bat, you never pay commissions or account fees for everything. They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for free. If you use my link, wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance. Now, normally when I have a sponsor on this show is because I use them and recommend them. In this case, it's a little different. I don't use wealth front yet because I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal. They wanted to sponsor this podcast, but because of sec regulations, companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials. So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast, but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant amount of my own money, at least for me, uh, in the team and the company itself. So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client. Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener, you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account. But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you. Take two minutes, fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com slash Tim it's fast, it's free. There's no downside that I can think of.
