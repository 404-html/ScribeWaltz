Speaker 1:          00:01          All that stuff that I'm sure that'll equal if not surpass whenever you got it. Okay. It looks like it's recording. Okay. So that's fine. You got to do what's great about it is the most important position. So we get great feedback from it. So, so we're skipping through the, you know, a lot more like work on with major league guys is the timing of his swing. That's an important thing for them because really the main thing for it, for a picture it is, is to throw off their time. But at the same time, once they do swing, guys have, you know, guys are missing out on a tremendous amount of opportunity even through the swing. So basically my job is to park. I look at, you know, there's the stride, which is basically a whole nother level. So with you, we're just going to work mainly on the ones you swing.

Speaker 1:          01:20          So what I'd like to see you do is I want you to first feel most of your weight on your heels. And when I say that, I would say about 60 40 and the reason why I said it's because there is no, no need for our cats and baseball. So the only thing that calves will do is get your center of gravity or ask one of the fuel that right. Whether it be through your, okay. Cause we're going to use that for the week. When we straighten, we're going to straighten it and push that up. Okay. So I'd like you to feel that's the one thing, and I'm not going to put too much in your head, but that's the one thing. We'll take some swings, feeling the weight in that proper place. And the only other thing I want you to feel for now, and you do this well, you get an a slop, but get into the slot Lao, your arms and drop and your spine angle from this angle, keeping it straight so they're actually cannot throw three things. And you can think about just one would be just one quick question.

Speaker 1:          02:28          What's the weight distribution by back? Yeah. You are 50 50 or a little bit more on your back leg. Okay. Whatever's really, whatever's comfortable, but you're going to take a step over. You aren't going to ship. So it's more, what I've been trying to do is line up like that, less of that stuff actually start like this. So the star rating is not, okay. So let's just go with the stripe and that's right there. Perfect. So what I'd like to see you do is keep your bags exactly right there and close the Shul. Okay? Okay. Now, once Tim starts to open up the swing, that's when this arm drops. So from here, just like you could think about a pitcher, pitcher goes like this, boom is here. Now the needle himself.

Speaker 1:          03:45          So say the same thing. They basically been noon, I'll read it. So basically your same swing because you're swinging. I mean really it was, there's not much to mess with as far as anything. But what I'm saying. Okay, so, so you're just gonna stand here or what I want you to do is the weight is the weight distribution as it is on your heels and your foot. I want you to feel as you step towards the bag and just like I said, doing natural step, you don't have to think about it because you do a very big step. Okay? So you do a natural step. The only thing on what you think about is, yeah, I want you to, as the foot lands feel coiled and we're not going to do any pausing with the leg or anything like that. I just want you to do a coiled all right here.

Speaker 1:          04:40          We you're going to explode into get a down for, um, it's, it's a preference thing choking up would be about here and no choke up. And being about here, I used to when I played like just to hold it with a little joke. Okay. But there are guys it like, and I'm not really sure why, but um, if you want to, let's talk about Greg, just recite to me, you know, this is the one contact you have with your weapon and um, the mass is being transformed. We call about that. So you want to have what I call a consistent grip. And that's not just from the beginning. That's not just at the end, but that's through the swing shift. And I say that because hitters, lucid hitters just lose consciousness through the swing that are focused on the ball. Unfortunately, they don't do the training that I do. So there were, their hands will come off, you know, especially if they do the hands personally. Hands just simply cannot be the on back. That was too vast logo or so what I tell kids and sometimes that's completely changed their swing is keep the hand every part of the is on the bed, keep it on throughout the whole swing. And that's a seminar that would, that grabs the entire hand. So then you know, it forces you kind of hear so, so go ahead. And I would say just don't worry about that. Right. Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:40          Okay. So the one that you're focused on is actually for now just get used to it in the back. Don't even think about that. Good. Yeah. Good. Okay. Yeah. So the reason why it's going the small over, I was going to be a little more speed. Okay. Okay. So, uh, so, uh, I want you to feel as your foot lands, and this is just going to be a momentary feeling. Feel the shoulders developable. Yep. So you're one is going to land facing down the first baseline. Yep. Well, your shoulders are going to be portable and then as you slow from the ground up, you're going to unwind that.

Speaker 1:          08:35          Okay. Good. And her shoulders. So it's going to be, it's going to look like that. It's really just thinking about your fully wound up only as your shoulders start to open new field. So it's like this. Boom. Okay. So yeah, that's the only thing. What I'll do is help in baby steps here to say, okay, let's just do this in a second shoulder. Let's just do that. Yeah. Don't worry about anything else. Fall. Work a little bit about what you just did right there. Perfect. Okay, good. Do it three more times. You jumped the gun and okay. There was one more time and stay there. Okay. So I'm just going to go boom. That's it. That's enough.
