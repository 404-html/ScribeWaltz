Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. It like, to be honest, I'm a cybernetic organism, living tissue yoga.

Speaker 2:          00:00:23       It is very late at night. I am packing for an island to get away. Why does that matter? Because it reminds me of one of the sponsors for today's podcast Mizzen and main. Why? Because the only dress shirt that I'm taking, I normally hate dress shirts is from mizzen and main, specifically the Beckett Blue Gingham. The reason or the reasons I should say is because I can throw it in my bag in a duffle, not worry about ironing, not worry about any kind of wrinkling and then throw it on where it maybe four or five nights out of seven without washing it. It won't smell. It's antimicrobial. It is made of stretch, fabric, sweat wicking, athletic. I could wear it for a hike in between dinners if I want to do it, probably wouldn't do that, but mizzen and main has really delivered on the all around all purpose dress shirt.

Speaker 2:          00:01:15       They're fancy enough. You can fool people into thinking that you had them custom tailored, but they're also rough enough and resilient enough that you can toss them into the bottom of a duffle bag or backpack, pull it off and put it on in a bathroom at a restaurant. Let's say. Uh, hundreds of pro athletes love this brand. Uh, people who don't fit well into dress shirts, otherwise like NFL allpro JJ watt. And the last time these guys were featured on the show, Mizzen and main sold out of every item that they featured. So if you're interested in checking them out, I'd recommend taking a look. Just go to tim.blog/shirts and you can see that one shirt that I'm packing that I always pack the Becket Blue Gingham in addition to a couple of my other favorites. And you can enter Tim, that's Capitol Tim at checkout for free shipping.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       If you use this code before September 15th, that's 2017 to buy a dress shirt mizzen and main, we'll donate a brand new dress shirt to the relief efforts in southern Texas. That's in addition to the thousand shirts that are already being donated through Jj Watson. Credible efforts to put, or I should say rather help Houston and the surrounding communities get back on their feet. So there you have it. Check it out. Take a look.

Speaker 2:          00:02:42       This episode is brought to you by kettle and fire, which makes some of the best bone broth and certainly the most convenient that I've ever found and I have a big stack of them on my kitchen counter right now. I have one container every morning and this first came recommended to me by past podcast guests such as Amelia Boone, who is a four time world champion in world's toughest mudder, Spartan race, etc. And Dr Dominic D'agostino, the incredible hulk of scientific research. You check him out too. But there are a few things that make kettle and fire special. Number one, they are the first shelf stable. In other words, never frozen bone broth that uses bones from 100% grass fed, organically raised animals, so you are what you eat, ate, if that makes sense. So it's very important that you understand if you're consuming animal protein, what they consumed.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       They also use longer cook times, 20 plus hours, which means more collagen and other nutrients. For instance, they contain 19 times more Collagen, then one of their close competitors and an independent lab confirm this. I'll leave the competitor's name out of it because I don't want to get sued, but that's the case and it is not frozen. So thanks to many millions of dollars of packaging equipment. Their bone broth doesn't require freezing or shipping with dry ice. So like I said, it's just sitting on my kitchen counter in these boxes and then I can heat them up. They're basically ready to drink, heat them up on the stove top or in a microwave and you are ready to rock and roll. And you'll also get a nice payload of Glucosamine, glycine, uh, along with the Dalton and everything else that I mentioned. So check it out. I've been hugely pleased with this and like I said, had been consuming it every morning.

Speaker 2:          00:04:26       It gives you about, I want to say 20 grams of protein, which is a nice little slow carb diet boost if that's what you're looking for. Then I'll typically sip this Advate, very large camping coffee Mug as I do some writing or journaling, so you'll have it. Check it out. It's delicious. I favor the chicken, but uh, each to his own or her own. So check it out. Kettle and fire.com forward slash Tim and you can receive 20% off of your entire order. Take a look, Kevin, fire.com forward slash Tim boom ticket. Just say, this is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show. I have music on the mind. It's a Friday as I record this pet, way too much tea, and that gives me a little bit of personality. So let's jump into it. This episode of the podcast features Stuart Copeland on Twitter at Copeland music who is considered one of the top 10 drummers of all times.

Speaker 2:          00:05:25       Certainly one of the greatest drummers in rock and roll history. He was one of the founding members of the police, has been inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame and is a grammy award winning musician. Stuart is amazing. I've spent time with him. He reminds me a bit of doc in back to the future. It show kids Mati it chuck kids. But uh, I digress. He is a fantastic storyteller and a very, very well spoken smart guy in this conversation, which is very wide ranging. We delve into early lessons in surviving and how to survive the music industry, why entrepreneurs never get a day off. And certainly any self directed musicians or creatives are entrepreneurs in the sense of him, but in dead to make something from nothing. How the police developed a unique sound and the decision that changed everything for them and much more.

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       This interview comes from my television show. Fearless fear, less, less in quotation marks. Since your goal is not to be fearless, but to learn to fear less. And in this show I interviewed world class performers on stage about how they've overcome doubt, conquered fear, and made their toughest decisions. We recorded about three hours of material, only one was used for the TV show. So this podcast is almost entirely new content that did not appear on TV, but I highly recommend a few things. Number one, you can watch the entire first episode of fearless with illusionist and endurance artists, David Blaine, and he does a bunch on stage. You can wash it all for free@att.net forward slash fearless, all spelled out, no parentheses. So att.net forward slash fearless. So definitely check that out. And to see all episodes of this new TV show, you can use directv or you can use the APP at direct TV that Com and that's direct TV now. So you can check that out. D I r e c t v.com and that is it for now. So let's move on. Please enjoy this conversation with the one and only Stewart Copeland.

Speaker 3:          00:07:34       You want to fearless? I'm your host, Tim Ferris. And on this stage will be deconstructing world class performers of all different types to uncover the specific tactics they've used, overcome doubt, tackle some of their hardest decisions, and ultimately succeed on their own terms. So imagine yourself a founding member of one of the most successful rock bands of all time. What happens when you break up from any, that might be the end of the story, but from my guest tonight, it was just getting started with no prior experience. He went on to score films for Francis Ford Coppola and Oliver Stone composed for ballet and opera and even take pilgrimages to Africa where he played drums with hungry lions. I am not kidding. He's a founding member of the police, a member of the rock and Roll Hall of fame. And for the last three decades he's been one of rolling stone's top 10 drummers of all time. Please welcome musician master and Madman Stewart Copeland

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:08:36       So just, uh, we're going to get to the backstory because I was kidding with some of the guys when we were doing all the research that if I wrote a screenplay that covered the arc of your life, I think it would get rejected or heavily edit as being too unrealistic. We're going to get to that. It's just a fascinating story, but what was

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       your mother's background? Well, she's British. Her job was analyzing French and European train schedules and so it was very, if she was a spy, but it was in an office, it was a bureaucratic version of analyzing says for sorting out bombing runs, getting supplies. And it was called the Soe and the ladies of the Soa as almost all women by the way, unsung heroes and people are now writing books about the Soa, these women who fought this kind of bureaucratic data war and now data, we all understand data. But back then it was kind of number NCU met my father. They got married during the war and um, that's my parents. She's a bitch. She, when we went to Lebanon, she was an archeologist and she wrote books. In fact, my mother, a very bookish and her books are the kind of books that you don't read in a bookstore.

Speaker 4:          00:09:47       The kind of books that the people who write books that you read, use those research. The first word in her book, you know, one of our books is the second word is 14 syllables. Log started off easy. Yeah, yeah. It's fine. Not Great. But then it gets more and more impenetrable as you go into it. What was it like growing up as the American in Cairo or in Beirut? While there were other Americans to mostly oil families. All of the kids at the American community school of Beirut, a rumored to, uh, the American community schools, all the Aramco kids, all the families in Saudi Arabia, the American families around, they sent their kids to this school in Beirut. And in my generation was the first generation where the Saudi Arabians and the Gulf Arabs with their new wealth began to send their kids for a western education. And so I in my age group started to see Saudi princes in my class and got to know them. A one such was Osama bin Ladin in your class? Not In my class. He would have been a quite a big in your school and that school. Quite a few. If I had known him, I would have kicked his ass.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:11:04       Well, I mean I have to ask, did you, so you met and interacted with them? No, no, no. He was years after. Right after I got it and I got it. What, by the way? Yes. I went back to Beirut years later. Um, and it's all Arabic mouth and they're all there. The Lebanese, the most murky there. One of the richest countries, most developed countries in the Middle East and they rule in the Arab world. Anybody who's running any of these probably Lebanese and they have no resources. They have huge civil strife, huge ethnic tension. But they've been through their civil war and they've got it resolved in just the Lebanese. They are all about education. So the American community school educating these kids to go and conquer America, which they do. You know, there's a Lebanese ghetto here in, uh, Los Angeles is called Beverly Hills.

Speaker 1:          00:11:57       What did, what did you want to be when you were a kid?

Speaker 4:          00:12:00       I, I can't remember any time before I wasn't a musician and I don't remember, you know, was seven or something like that. I just never, ever, when I was actually in college, I thought, I don't actually want to play music. I want to organize it. So I, you know, I studied journalism and other aspects of the entertainment industry, but the drums just kept the siren song me back. When did you leave the Middle East? I left the Middle East, uh, and the mid sixties, I would have been 14 or 15, something like that. And I was already playing in my high school band and Beirut by that time. And I got to boarding school in England and a couple of things nobody had ever heard of where I come from. Where do you come from? Well, Lebanon. Well, where's that, you know, uh, the other thing was that I didn't realize it, but a lot of my vocabulary wasn't English.

Speaker 4:          00:12:58       Uh, they speak in Beirut, they speak Arab, a friend glaze, which is the Arabic, but the sophisticated bay, Rudy's speak French, but English, English American was invading the university was American. The hospital built by American missionaries, the Americans in the Middle East, by the way, during my time where most part from my father, the Americans built hospitals and universities and American money was going into the Middle East from Christian organizations, um, for missionaries. And so Americans were known for no strings attached. Good stuff, you know, because it was the French and the British and the old emperor imperial powers that had the bad rap. We soon earned a bad rap. But in those days the Americans were much loved. What brought you to even, why'd you guys move? Well, I was evacuated because, uh, after the Philby thing, it got hot. And uh, so my father just suddenly had to get the family out of dodge.

Speaker 4:          00:13:59       Um, Lebanon at that time was always, you know, 1958. There was a civil war there at that time while I was there. And it was bombs in the night. We had to fill the bathtub with water and stock up with food and, and so on. And there was sand bags in the streets. And uh, uh, and I actually in those days it was put out by the United States, Sixth Fleet show up, which is another reason I was real proud to be American. They showed up in 1958, I think Eisenhower was president and that was it. Civil war over, uh, they, they just, just for show they landed a whole platoon or whatever on the beach with the tanks and everything and did a display of these enormous 10, okay, well let's all go back to work now, shall we? You know, and there was no violence to I, it was just a display.

Speaker 4:          00:14:45       It was like a 4th of July exhibition kind of thing. These are the kind of toys we got to play with folks. Anybody who has any questions and, uh, because our, as I said before, because our, our status there was very positive. We were loved there that we, you know, and they, they're, there was an election coming up and they're very, I won't bore you with the complicated politics, but there was a, an election coming up and there's a lot of vegetation. And so the American showed up. They have a peaceful election. They elected the, not the, not American guy, actually, the, you know, they, my father was glad, but they elected Shahab instead of the guy that the Americans wanted. But it was fine. He did a fine job and civil war over, but it was always there. There had three major religions there who had to share power and the Christian has ruled the country.

Speaker 4:          00:15:37       Uh, then there's the Sunni and the Shia who were at each other's throats as much. They all, you know, is a triangle. And, um, that triangle with the influx of Palestinians just couldn't hold. And so civil war and then there were the really awful civil wars, you know, the same as what's going on in Syria now. They eventually blew over and in Beirut, Lebanon has probably more able to withstand the Syrian war next door because in Lebanon, no, no, no, no, no. We've been, there were not that Sunni's are fine. The shear fine law lets every, you know, everybody gets to go back to work instead of the u s six leaks showing up the civil war, the civil war in Syria next door. And their own history means they're not about to pick a fight anytime soon. Yeah. But before I was born in Syria where the family was living before I was born there, my mother was pregnant with my brother, Ian, uh, comes up in conversation a lot.

Speaker 4:          00:16:36       Um, and they had a problem with their general, who is they, you know, their dictator who was running the place of Fauzi, Al Shabaab or whatever his name was. And he was, you know, starting to get, starting to talk to the root skis and so on. And so you got to get rid of this guy. And so they figured out, this is my father's idea that I tell you what, why don't we have a rent a mob? Go and attack an American diplomats house or rent them up hours. Uh, and so, uh, and then then the, uh, our, our new kernel that we'd been shining up, he can get the soldiers out to go and put down this riot and Wallace soldiers around and they can take over the radio station and the palace. And that's how they did it in those days. And he be colonel who took over the palace, thought he was working against American interests, but in fact the other colonel Heather to undisclosed with the actual guy. And so his system was getting other people to do the dirty work. But okay. So this attack happens on the family home, the Copeland family home in Damascus, Syria and a, they're late at my father's on the phone to bay route and they show up. Oh, great, great. Go Bang. Oh No, they got god. That's not, you know, and Bang Bang. And the famous line that he had, which is as our family thing is, uh, he says, ah, I'm going to have to hang up now they're shooting at me personally.

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       No,

Speaker 4:          00:18:05       I never even believed these stories. Uh, because it was my bad pellet. I mean, he used to say, never let the facts ruin a good story, but the history books are being written now about that period. And my father's in there, oh my God. And according to the books, and I didn't realize this until I found in the family archives, uh, some, uh, uh, newspaper clippings about it. He chased them off with a gun. He had a gun. My father had a handgun. I never saw him with a gun or a he, you know, Alabama kid chases up bandits with a handgun. And, uh, there were in one of the Persian rugs there, bullet holes. And my sister's got that rug, uh, because during those days, the diplomatic wives and all the wives would go to Iran or Persia as it was known. And by all this incredible stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:18:55       So I have in my studio these Persian rugs that are older than I am. They've been in the family longer than I am. And in fact, another little digression, the patterns on those Persian rugs, but these strange, the geometric and yet curved lines and everything like that. And now I was crawling around face first on those rugs from the age of zero all the way up. And I just looked at those rugs the other day and I realized that pattern is my music, that my music is exactly that. The way it's a combination of symmetry and wild abandon the way the different colors interact with the other. I realize it was like printed when I was nose first phase first and these Persian rugs. So I'm going to, I'm going to dial this back a little bit to college. How did you choose where to go to college? How did you end up going where he did? Ah, well, I was a draftable American. Uh, in spite of my pride in my country, we were fighting a war in Vietnam at the time for which my brother had volunteered. My brother Ian, the heroic brother, actually, not only did he have a motorcycle in high school, but he went to Vietnam. He volunteered, he came back, a decorated hero. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:20:13       I, you know, I can't, you know, battalion citation, presidential citation, purple heart, bronze star of he found himself, you know, and he came back and became an agent. Never saw a gun for the rest of his life, but he started, he was a wild kid who discovered that. And he came back and when he came back, he was spat on and reviled. And it was a tragedy of the Vietnam War. How the American people saw it because we were afraid that we could be sent out. Well, the voluntary, those weren't volunteers over there. That could be me. Uh, and he did volunteered and he was fine until the war, the first Gulf War. And when he heard the crackle of the radios, the thump, thump, thump, thump of the helicopters, it came back and it, it almost, he had a psychosis for it. And then when the soldiers came home as conquering heroes, he, you know, that was the, that's what, how he should have been treated.

Speaker 4:          00:21:03       Every single one of the soldiers in his platoon ended up as heroin addicts. They didn't make it, none of them made it. He died of Agent Orange a few years ago, taken by melanoma. That's how the Vietnam War generation was treated. Um, and I didn't want any part of that personally. And by the time I came along, I'm, I'm at the end of the baby boom. Um, and by the time I got to college, there were planting, they built all these colleges and capacity for the baby boom. Well, at the time I came along and would kind of wait it out of it. So it was easy for me to get into college. You know, there's all this space. Uh, but how the hell did we get there? How did you end up going to college? How am I going to go and cut? Okay. So, uh, we had a lottery system.

Speaker 4:          00:21:50       Everybody, senator's kids, everybody was getting drafted and so they had a lottery system. Whatever your birth date, you'd take your date out of, uh, they pull the dates out of a hat. Okay. September 27, that's one. Okay. January 18, that's two. Okay. April nine, that's three. And you go down to all the 365 days of the year. And you get a number of mine was July 16 and depending on what state you are in, um, they had a quota. Alabama had a quota of [inaudible]. And if you're in a, an a, an Alabama and you registered to vote in Alabama and you're a number was a 47 year drafted. If your number was high, 200 or above, you're probably safe. Well, the draft board for people who turned 18 outside of America was zero. They had a quota of zero. So as long as they didn't come to America, I was legally not drafted.

Speaker 4:          00:22:39       I registered and I, and everything. But then I got my number 287, uh, and then it will say, so then I continued my university education in America, Berkeley, Berkeley, Berkeley. Why did you choose Berkeley? Um, because I'd outgrown the small school that I was at and I want it to go to a big school with 40,000 students and learn from, uh, you know, Nobel winners and so on. Just felt like a bigger battery place. It's a great school and they're in my backyard. Uh, tell, tell me about, and tell us about the, uh, the college event. Set the tip sheet. They've now you're getting, okay, now you have found a question for which I ain't going to have to make up material and it's true. I've been trying, don't, I don't mean by, by, by making it up. I mean like that's a question I've never answered before.

Speaker 4:          00:23:32       Alright, Mazel Tov. Thank you. Ah, college event was an idea of my older brother, miles who was the, the, uh, the businessman of the family. And, um, basically I called up all the colleges around the west and I said, tell me about what concerts do you put on? How much did you spend Frank Zappa, how much did he cost Janice Joplin? How much did he pay? How'd they go down? How did the thick of it? And they just send me back their report of the Gig and I printed it onto what was called a tip sheet. Um, it just information, just data. And I would send it to all the colleges and the West so they can see the, you know, Uc Santa Barbara can see that UCLA paid Frank Zappa, you know, $10,000. They trashed the dressing rooms or whatever. And so the colleges could use this as a data sheet.

Speaker 4:          00:24:19       And I sold advertising to the record companies and so on and so forth. And I was a little business venture. And then that drumming, it was just while I was into my second or third edition, and then I'd call it calling up, selling the stuff and getting the letters and the college people sent. All I had to do is print their letters about what agent rip them off and didn't treat them on that agent. The guy who deals with universities, they have a lot of money. These colleges. Oh my God. And so suddenly I had power, power, but it was all going great until that drumming thing. And there was a band over in London, needed a drummer and it was summers. I went over to the London plan, a band and it never came back.

Speaker 4:          00:25:03       What was the, uh, what were the most important lessons that you took from putting together that tip sheet? Uh, that you have to do it yourself was the main thing. And you have to think of everything. And there's the entrepreneur, unlike a job holder doesn't get a day off. And My, you know, a roommate, you know, people in the, in the building, they had jobs and they knew when they go to work and they knew when they come home and they got their check, but they have to go to work. I didn't, as an entrepreneur, you don't have to go to work. You're always working. You can never not be at work. And so you know, of my sins, I have seven children and my sons, you know, for instance, just take two for instance, one as an entrepreneur, filmmaker has a band, he's just, he's always picking up the phone, he's hustle bustle and the other has a nine to five job.

Speaker 4:          00:26:01       They are both happy as clams. The nine to fiver, he can't imagine what it's like. And six o'clock he gets into his car, he is free. His life just as it belongs to him. He can watch TV, you can have friends and go out to dinner. He just lives a great life. Next morning he gets up, goes to work. Work's like hell, enjoys his job. And then Jordan, he, he would not be able to thrive under those conditions. And what do you mean? I have to get up? You know, uh, it's more of a question. No, no, no, you can't go to bed. Right. I remember being told once, I said, if you work diligently eight hours a day for perhaps 10 years, then you can get promoted to boss and work 12 hours. Yes, exactly.

Speaker 4:          00:26:47       When the punk bands in London in 1977 desired to play reggae because it was, you know, for, for a punk bands, the only form of chill was dub reggae, which is still hostile. Still pissed off, but chill. And so there was no such thing as chill punk music. You just can't slow it down. And you know, and so the, the, the, the, the punk rockers would chill to dub reggae, which meant that I could fall right into that top or heat. And to his credit, he figured out, let's see, the backbeat doesn't go on two and four, so he's sitting there and his drums and he's signaling and then that, and he had to learn how to do it and he could do it. I already can do it. And so we develop that sound and the police, which is kind of important. And we didn't actually play reggae strictly the way it comes out of Jamaica. We did our own thing to it, but it was elemental. It wasn't learning it the way topper had do. It just was that secret weapon that I got from my friends in Lebanon.

Speaker 4:          00:27:53       So I call Stinko and I say Sony, he wants to join the band. He's like fancy. He's in, that's said no brainer water. You went, why, why, what? What are we waiting for? And I think, Dude, calm down, calm down. We can't afford him. He's a, you know, I had to explain to Andy, there's no record company. I'm the record company, you know, illegal records. You know, I printed them myself staying and I put the records into the bags ourselves and I would let lecherous I did the artwork myself and I called up the stores. My son, we got, I'm the record company management. I'm the manager to an agent.

Speaker 4:          00:28:30       I'm booking the gigs to roadie. That's you. And uh, so we, you know, I, I'm really flattered, but you're going to leave after two weeks, you know, we can't, you know, you're, you know, you've got a life, you've got the expenses, you know. Um, and he insisted. He said, no, no, no. I'm canning all my sessions. I want to be in the band. He had played with soft machine or burden, uh, the animals. You know, he had a list of credits as long as your arm, but you didn't want to be a side man anywhere to be in the band and to be for the band, to be his band. And of course I'm going to get rid of that other guitars, you know that, right? And I say, sure, sure sir. I didn't think about that. Um, and we actually did play a couple of shows with two guitars, but, um, so he insisted and so, and, and by this time thing going up, no, he's an actual musician.

Speaker 4:          00:29:19       He's in the back not going to calm down. And finally, you know, it's either, either he's in or I'm out. Oh, okay. So, and he's in the band. And immediately Andy has deep musical training. I didn't have to show them an e chord or a d or an a chord. He knows he flattens seventh carry the, you know, you know, he really, and as soon as him and sting put their heads together, out of nowhere, sting writes a song as a result of Andi joining the group. There was another surprise in store for us all, which was the, in our punk band, the singing was, ah, Dah and thinking do that. And that's all I ever heard him do because that's what we did. And that kind of, that genre was all shouting. Yeah. Um, but we had one last Andy Summers Gig to do. He said, look, I've got one last Gig, this guy in Germany and I'm going to go over and by way he needs a drummer.

Speaker 4:          00:30:13       So you got a Gig to so dandy and I went over to Germany with Everhard Sherner this high concept thing where he's got jazz saxophone, he's gotten lazy. Sorry I'm, he's got a ballet dancer and they punk group. Yeah. And for a punk group or you know, actually, you know, we've got a buddy who plays bass, why don't we bring him over to sheriffs? They brought suit. So the three of us are there as the punk group as a part of this multi, you know, mix and match kind of show and the jazz singer, the obligatory American jazz singer, jazz singer chick. And she had the shoulder down.

Speaker 4:          00:30:48       She's out of tune and liked it that way. The jazz attitude. And she's a punk van. And one day, so, but long story short, we, the first show, we were not unprepared. We, you know, the, the a all kinds of bedlam and craziness. And we got the first shower door. We don't even know how we're going to finish the set that at one point she slinks off, but she does her mother slinks off like that. And there's the Mike stand. Then there we are and we're not quite sure what, what to do next based buyer walks up to the microphone and the sound out of his mouth. A keening wailing sound that was soaring high with the stars, with a pain and a yearning and not growing feeling of the cosmos coming down to take us away and the heart of this wave and the Andy and I. Fuck me.

Speaker 4:          00:31:59       And so the police was born, well, two things. I didn't know he could write songs and I didn't know he could sing like that and that it was sort of Andy who made it all the, the whole thing come together. The cocktail come together with the police. How did you decide on certain visual aspects of the band or other stylistic decisions like the bleach blonde hair for instance? Well, we would never be caught dead discussing such matters. Uh, the bleach blonde hair came from, uh, the fact that sting's wife was an actress. She had an agent, she took one look at her client's husband and said, that guy belongs in front of a camera. And she would send him for a modeling jobs and in advertising and so on. And he would get every gig. Um, and one day they wanted a punk band for a Wrigley's chewing gum commercial.

Speaker 4:          00:32:55       And so, uh, they called, you know, he got the Gig and said, well, I have a punk band. I am myself a punk. Um, so they got Andy and I out there as well, but they didn't think we looked snarly enough. I know. Let's peroxide their hair. And uh, so the, the, the, the wardrobe people just like the ladies, he got back there, they made us look the part and we looked at each other, say, that's kind of cool. And so we got our blonde look from a Wrigley's chewing gum commercial somewhere they ad didn't run, I guess it didn't test well or something. And, uh, somewhere in a vault somewhere is that ad of a, the three blood heads blonde for the first time. I actually am blonde. Okay. This is real. It actually I'll get gray, but I'm blonde too. But alas, the locust sick, my hair a common cause of male pattern baldness, you know, Stinko and I, music fulfills a different purpose in our lives.

Speaker 4:          00:34:03       Uh, for me it's celebration, it's a party. And for sting perhaps it's more of a, um, an escape, you know, a peaceful, beautiful place that he can go to. And those two things, when we were codependent, we, the differences between us really filled gaps. And so it was very synergistic. Um, but as we, you know, the first two albums were recorded with that, the first album, it was just us in the studio and we got in there and we recorded an album in 20 minutes. And then the second album was after we'd started to get somewhere in America and we've been playing and we're getting great reviews and burning down the house night after night and we're feeling really great and they say you have your whole life to write your first album and six months to write your second draft. And so there were back in the studio and you know, we've got half an album worth of material but we got to get a new album.

Speaker 4:          00:34:57       And so that's second album. We just came up with it. We were full of ourselves. We're, you know, we were validated by, you know, we, we know that we're the coolest. So we had the confidence in our second album, just was all creativity. Had a bunch of hits on that record too. So the third album, we're going into the studio and now we are not just us anymore. This was the beginning of the police becoming something that isn't our, just our little thing anymore. It's bigger than us. And there's a momentum there. There's a record company that is counting on hits and we were there in Holland. In fact, recording the third albums and yacht. I'm on data and the record company are actually in the studio. Is that a hint? No, I think the other one's hit and it was like commerce was in the room with us and it really bummed us out kind of like that.

Speaker 4:          00:35:45       But we were still had had a buzz going and it was us against the world. The next two albums which we recorded in monster at and the Caribbean far, far away, 12 hours from the nearest record company executive. And there was just the three of us and by now, um, we were not so codependent. But when it comes to music, I kind of like working with an orchestra. And by the way, I write music for 60 piece orchestra. They don't talk back. I put every note and how they play it on the thing that Piccolo players been playing Piccolo his whole career. But he's going to play exactly what I put on the page. And it's not Deta Dah Dah. It's data data with a little diminuendo at the end with articulate the Staccato, the third note, and then the, the, the, you know, the slur over in, I put on the page in ink in Italian, exactly in 60 guys.

Speaker 4:          00:36:40       And that's how it works. And guess what? Steam likes to do that too. Uh, and he's real good at it and he has kind of a track record of being successful at it. Um, but what he wants to do is kind of different from what I want to do. The purpose of music for him has a different purpose for me. And, and we came together for the reunion tour and it was so hard for us to make the pieces fit back together. Cause guess what, 20 years ago by, and we'd grown and I had lost, I'd gotten out of the habit of the bass player turnaround and telling me anything, you know, uh, and he'd gotten out of the habit of this world war three going behind his left shoulder and he comes over to, uh, well, maybe not, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:37:27       Oh, okay. Maybe not. And, uh, you know, with the best of intentions, you know, I'm sure sting looks at the mirror every morning, says, okay, today I'm going to let Stewart be Stewart and I would look in the mirror in the morning. Anything he wants, I will be there for him. Any scintilla of, of a new, I will listen and I will do my best to remember what he told me. And you know, and that gets us through the first hour of rehearsal. This is the thing about Francis Coppola as he can spot talent and his, you know, very different from somebody like Oliver Stone for whom I've scored as well, who stone himself owns every frame, every aspect of the film comes from his creativity. And that's what he does, you know, uh, he doesn't want people to clever ideas. He wants people who are clever, it carrying out his ideas.

Speaker 4:          00:38:16       Unfortunately, he's got really great idea. So Frances has a different technique. He finds people that have the talent and he just gives them a long lead. It says, you just go for it. You take it, take it. And I want to see what you come up with. And that was a good relationship. What did, what was different about the idea that you presented? Uh, for the material? I'll give you a clue, which was the, his people is produced, kept saying, when's the scoring date date? I've been in the studio for a month. We mean date, you know, the way they used to do films was there to have a date. And on the date they show up with the orchestra and they record the music on that day. And uh, that's the, that's the recording session. I don't do it like that. I, I'm in the studio by myself and I play a little bit of drums, then I add some guitar and then I settle around over here and I'm working on building it.

Speaker 4:          00:39:11       Like, you make a record. And I was gonna say that was just completely an alien exercise. I mean, the people would come down and they said, this is kind of interesting. And, but there was the moment when Francis did turn around, so this all sounds really fantastic. And all of his old guys, his crew that he'd been working with forever, they're all thinking, wow, this is really different on or anything like that. But it kind of works. I said crazy, but it kind of works, you know? And um, but it did turn around and say, I want the strings. You know, I need some strings. And I'm going, Oh shit, he's going to hire some string schlocky guy, Francis, you're so right. You need strings. I going to fix up some nice strings and strings, you know, nice strings, strings. And so I call up the contractor and said, send me some strings.

Speaker 4:          00:39:53       And he says, well, okay, sure, fine. How many strings? I Dunno, how many strings is strings send me some strengths, you know? And so these, I think it was maybe 1415 guys showed up, you know, strings and a, they arrive and usually a recording session, your guitar shows up and you book them for the afternoon. Then he comes in with his 10 guitars and couple of apps with a bunch of pedals. And he said, okay. So the first thing, it's just kind of like gay dad ain't doing India. And then when it comes to that show, get a shop of his name and you know Matt Dillon and he's called it the, you know that kid with a Bandanna. Okay. On the shot of just kinda hit it, you kind of thing there and then kind of pull back a little bit in there and then you, you know, and you're talking to him like that.

Speaker 4:          00:40:35       And that's the way you work at. And the guy who, oh cool, how about this? Maybe, how about that? Try that. Stratacap you know, you talk and it's an interaction in between the two of you collaborate and you get it. So the strings arrive a lot of them. And so I go out to do my thing. Hey guys, it's great to have you here. It has movies, kind of an art movie and you know, the first song, it's kind of thinking that the guy that, and then when you see the guy with the Bandana, it just kind of goes a little long like that. And I'm talking and I'm talking about them. And they're looking kind of more and more uncomfortable. And eventually one of them says, ah, my stroke. Um, the one of the play, what the music on the page here or whatever the fuck you're talking about.

Speaker 4:          00:41:17       And I play the page by page. And so they do invite the page. By the way, in this case was footballs, what they call this whole notes. Nice. Eh, you know, I didn't know how to write it. I didn't know how to write that music at that time. So it was just the chords that I was playing myself. Bling, bling here, stop the tape. Okay. Roll tape bleeding and uh, ear bought and put that on a chart so that that's the top. No, no. Okay. We'll give that the violin and violin to viola and I had an arranger put it on the page, you know, then I need to study, you know, I was a music major in college so I could read it, but I hadn't seen a sheet of music in 20 years in rock and roll. There are no sheets of music and it just, it's just not part of the vocabulary.

Speaker 4:          00:42:15       But here with these string players a section. And so they have these footballs and they say, well look, it's all footballs. Can we just, uh, this is run it down and everybody wants, you want to peek from the thesis. They go, let's just down in a day, day, day day did, okay, cool. Okay. Roll tape. And they play and they were done in like half an hour. They just played what was on the page, you know, I didn't need to talk to them at all. They just play was on the page and they played it and there were, you know, after the guitarist guy, he's there all afternoon, you're trying stuff. These guys, it's on the page, they play it exactly in their done. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:42:59       Wow. You meet. All I gotta do is figure it out and do the homework, put it on the stand and they plan. So 20 years later I, you know, I'd done maybe 40, 50 films, TV commercials, uh, and all this stuff and you use orchestra lot. And pretty soon I got, I learned how to write down a little bit of a battle and a fancy stuff. And, um, the best part of it is that it's about the home with a band you think on your feet and it's an interaction. Musicians of the ear musicians are divided at birth into two categories. Musicians of the ear and musicians of the eye. Musicians of the ear where I come from, they're connected to the music by the ear. They're staring off in space and they just know when eight bars are up and they know where to listen for the groove.

Speaker 4:          00:43:42       And they're part of that groove and they're connected with their ear musicians of the, I read a chart and they, their fingers follow what their eyes told them to play. And even the rhythm comes from the conductor, a visual cue, the conductor's baton. It their eyes connect them to the music and the musicians of the ear, they just make that shit up. Uh, it's, it's a collaborative way. It's improvisational. They know that it's ea and d, but how are you going to hit that? [inaudible] how are you going to which inversion of a, you know, and so there's, you know, it's the, it's a collaboration. You work it out together, it takes forever. Uh, but an orchestral music, you put it on the page and they will play it. And like I said before, it's not just Dah, Dah, Dah, as dotted down, you know that you put that shit and you have to put all that shape on the page.

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       And if you do 60 guys, then that guy over there on the double bass and that guy way over there on second violin and they're 30, 40 feet away from each other. But each of them has their own book with only their own part. And if they follow exactly what's on the page and execute it beautifully, then they all, all 60 of them become the mighty Chicago symphony. And that's where their ego lies. Not from, I'm gonna Express myself on this part here. Goddamn it. Even though I'm the third chair, second violin, no, their ego, their pride in their work comes from these corporate identity of the magnificent orchestra of which they are part. And by the way, they're playing Mendelssohn and Brahms and really, really good music. The best of the best of the best. That has withstood the test of time. So there's two completely different musical universes and a, I love jamming with guys who come over to my studio and we jam and we just make it up as we go along.

Speaker 4:          00:45:33       But I also love to do that homework and get it on the page and conceive of every aspect of it where the swell is, where the surge, the ebb and the flow in that violin lended going up to there and he gets up high like that and the Trump, it takes it over and then go buy boom on the low brass. Oh, I, you know, that's just really a lot of fun to conceive of that stuff. And then you go and you sit with the orchestra and they play it and without debate and the first time, what's that? It's a little creaky. The second time it's like wow. And then by showtime it's really good fun to play that stuff. I like this question. This is from James Stubbs, Facebook. He's one of the few rock drummers that plays traditional grip. How did he come to play that way?

Speaker 4:          00:46:17       So maybe you could also explain to people what this means. Well, in Olden Times these snare drum was a military instrument, a former GE, and to March with and the snare drums or that deep cylinder like this and that deep into march with it. Like this is Kinda hard. So what they do is they turn on its side so that the drum is like that and you can still march, which means to hit the drum. Like this is kind of a problem. So how about this hand hold the stick like that and you create the drum? Is that this angle? And now your sticks can go like that because that, whereas this would be a problem. That's where it came from. Okay. When they took the snare drum and put it on a drum set and created the trap set probably down in New Orleans or somewhere, wherever they, whoever had the idea of assembling a bunch of drums.

Speaker 4:          00:47:06       Uh, and to the traps set, uh, the snare drum was, you know, the technique of playing it still was this, you know, both hands are not the same. This is called match grip. This is called Orthodox. It's old school and just the practitioners would set up this newly invented contraption and have the snare drum at that angle. Okay, years go. And I learned from that, from, you know, buddy rich and the gene Krupa style, the my father, as soon as he spotted me as a musician had me in lessons, which meant Orthodox, I book paradiddles and slamming it and all the rudiments and everything with this technique. And then nowadays a drummer can set up the drums at any how he darn well wants. And these has it logically flat and the Tom Tom Logically like that. And what's this for? So he plays like this nowadays. Nowadays drummers all play match decrypt. It makes perfect sense. Now, in my opinion, this is a bigger digit than this. There's bigger muscles here, so, and I want to get that backbeat look out baby. This hammer's coming down with this thumb to bring it down and it's a, seems like a more stronger thing. I Dunno. It's not matched and say you learned to make it set. The effect is the same but different mechanics in each hand. Glad you asked.

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:48:34       and the next one is from Masud Khan. We don't have to do 10, but he asked the 10 top 10 albums you would take to another planet. Let's just say three albums. The old desert. Uh, well any Hendrix album, but probably the double one because it's a double one. A, which would be the third one. Uh, access. No, not access. Um, what was the third one? Voodoo child or visited double album. All the naked girls on bicycles. Uh, I'll go, I'll go Google it later. Anyhow, that's one. Uh, I'm not a huge Beatles fan, but I would probably take either the white album or sergeant pepper just cause the variety. If we're going to be stuck on that island for a long time, we need some variety. Um, and uh, probably some blues just cause it makes me feel good. But then again I could play blues myself.

Speaker 4:          00:49:27       No, I wouldn't take a blues record. Uh, I dunno. Some classical, some Stravinsky, probably write some spring or Patrice scheme. And if you're out of the running, if you had to combine since say three drummers alive or dead into your sort of perfect super drummer, who would they be and why? I would take the majesty of John Bottom. He achieved with very few drum strokes, very sides, but boom, boom. It just sounds like a mountain. And everybody, nobody has gotten there, figured out how to make a drum set. Sounds so huge. And it's the economy and it's the way he hits the drum. Just some magic about the way he played, created size, just hugeness. Then I would take uh, God, I'm terrible with names. Uh, James Brown's drummer, stubble fields, double anyone here. Anyone cried? Stubblefield for funk cause we've got a dance, you know, and he's not a star guy, but just give me some of that.

Speaker 4:          00:50:37       And so we're all be dancing and those few Dender will be, you know, doing what they do. Uh, and then I would take Mitch Mitchell for technique or buddy rich. What about the technique? Just the effervescence, the lively spark of either, it'd be tough between, uh, I mean buddy rich is the number. He is the absolute top God whether you like his music or not, there's nobody who's been able to achieve just the manual dexterity, let alone the artistry and everything else. I mean, he really isn't a class of his own. Mitch Mitchell is up there as well, but he had, he was, his music was more fun and more effervescent and, and science. I'd probably take John Bonham, Clyde Stubblefield and, and Mitch Mitchell since we saw you tearing it up in the first video that we showed. This next question is from I am Keith Andrew on Twitter. What weaknesses in your playing or writing or composing bug you and are you fighting to overcome?

Speaker 4:          00:51:37       How do you fight them? Uh, arthritis. Uh, and right now I play with an orchestra and my drums, uh, are designed to play to accompany amplified instruments, which can be any amount of volume, you know, so Dominic and range of the rock and roll drummer goes from seven to 12 guitar. It's only go to 11 and drummers. And by the way, we don't do it by turning a little mob. We do it by hitting it. And, uh, in the orchestra, the orchestra feels very loud, but it's in fact a quarter of the volume of a rock band. And when you go to a concert and you see an orchestra play, it feels emotionally really big. But physics wise, it's actually much more quiet. And so you have the huge rockstar and you put the drug in their crack and the orchestra is God, they're toast.

Speaker 4:          00:52:29       You can't hear him, nothing because the drums are so low. So the biggest challenge has been to play quietly. And I now after years of playing with orchestras and working on it, and, and I practiced with the music, barely audible. So I, I, I can't accompanied unless I get it down there. And a couple of things. First of all, less work. Second of all, the drum sound so much better. Third of all, all kinds of finesse of technique that I learned as a kid but never could use in rock and roll. They just have, we never hear the, you know, a rough or a drag, you know, you can't hear them in rock roll. Now you can. So they sound great, cool technique, less work. And so learning how to play that quietly, I can now play a fawn drum set, my drum set designed for the aforementioned cacophony.

Speaker 4:          00:53:19       Uh, and there's a violin solo that I wrote, a nice little violin solo and she's 30 feet away and I'm not the, and I can now play so quietly, but I can hear her and soak in the audience, you know, and uh, that, that's an achievement is the, as we mentioned, arthritis, is that, is that a real issue there you're contending with? Absolutely. Yeah. They're there. They're there on the y. How do my thoughts, how do you, how do you deal with that? Well, I find that if I, you know, I don't look at my drums until I've got a show coming up in this year. I've had shows coming up all year, so I've been in shape and so I have to start up. It's like rocky, you know, I start slow and I work it up and I have little things like that to get, you know, and I find that when I get fit to play and I'm up to speed, the arthritis goes away and it doesn't return until I walk away from the drums.

Speaker 4:          00:54:12       And I don't even look at them until next time I have to. And then the arthritis creeps back in, opening a door out. If it's locked a locked door. Ah, man, that's hurts, you know? And, uh, and I think Darren, this is really inconvenient for what I do, but in fact, when I started playing drums, when I get fit, you know, it's not a problem. Did you do anything else for self care in the hands or the yeah, there's the stretches. I have a thing that I got in China, which is like our little pointy soft wooden thing that I just sort of massage the muscles. And like I say that there's quite a fash fetish. I'm pretty familiar with the structure of the hand and there's 10 bones there and like all this really complicated, but I'm pretty into making it work and playing at that volume.

Speaker 4:          00:55:03       It's just isn't the stress that it is at high volume. So this might be related, but a next question is from tinker coffee co at tinker Topica. What's the most technical but underappreciated skill for our drummer to possess a, I would say that quiet thing quiet. Um, because I have drummers who have that range dynamic range of seven to 12. Uh, and that's just really hard work. You know, my, my buddy, uh, fishermen in fish, he's really quiet. He's been doing that. Oh and I saw a bad guy and you know, you see them from the front and it's blazing cause there's a 50 zillion watt PA system to make it louder. He doesn't need to make it ladder and saw the sign this and watching and he's just comfy. He's hardly breaking a sweat. I'm going to do that, you know, and playing quietly. That's the most unappreciated technique that I would say to answer that question. All right, well given that you're, you're, so you're talking, uh, sort of categories are the, do not discuss lists for dinner conversation. If you were to give a Ted talk, let's say, or some high profile talk 20 minutes long, but you couldn't talk about music, couldn't talk about drumming, nothing that you're known for, but maybe some secret obsession or thing that you study on the weekends or in the evenings or anything for that matter. What you talk about, Old Testament Theology, Old Testament theology.

Speaker 1:          00:56:27       Yeah. All right, well tell us more. I grew up in the holy land

Speaker 4:          00:56:34       and they're still arguing about it now to this day. Uh, who's is it and a which religion prevails. And it turns out that the three religions fighting most vociferously over that piece of real estate are the same religion. Uh, they come from the same book. And the Old Testament is that book in the Old Testament is unique because I also love Egyptian history. You know, I think Moses was a jackass. You know, th th th the Egyptian history was a beautiful, beautiful thing as described in the old testament. You know, the Egyptians were great people with great values of beautiful culture, but the people who wrote the Old Testament didn't think so. So the Egyptians describe their enemies in these pejorative terms and, and turn are described by the Israelites in these pejorative terms. It's fascinating because in the Egyptian history, there was no plagues. There was no Moses, there was no exodus.

Speaker 4:          00:57:32       And so obviously the exodus and the events referred to in the Old Testament, there's something happened historically to PR to, to create what became these stories. You know, there's gotta be an origin to these stories. Which feral was that? Which part of Egyptian history was that? Um, you know, traditionally it's, it's Ramsey too, you know, the big one just because he's the biggest, but it wasn't man, you figured out there are these different chronologies. There's the archeology. Uh, or let's start with the Old Testament, which says that a thousand years ago, Moses did this, uh, so many thousand year ago, Solomon Solomon did that and there's a chronology. Then there's the Egyptian chronology, which has its list of kings and it's not measured in 1927 nights. It's like this king in the third year of King Center. Kreb the second, and it's like you have to know how many, there's that chronology. Then there's the archeology. The strata of Jericho, for instance, tells us that there was no burning down of Jericho.

Speaker 4:          00:58:32       When the Bible says that they came, the came, you know, they came and burned down Jericho. None happened folks. Jericho has been burned, but not when the Bible says it did a couple of 3000 years early. Well, okay, well let's pull that. Bob will call you down. Pull this one up so that that matches now. Well then we've got a problem with the Egyptian chronology, so we stretch that. Then Shit, you know, and the period of Solomon, there are no great architectural masterpieces or anything to denote a great kingdom during the time of Solomon. It doesn't mean he didn't exist. It means that the chronology of when the Bible said he exists might be a little inaccurate. So you like, that's what I can find endlessly fascinating.

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       Wow. Okay. Okay. I know, I know, I know, I know

Speaker 4:          00:59:26       I lost you. I totally lost you there for a minute, but I'm going to bring you back. Okay. Over in the west side of Los Angeles, there's all these private schools where all US fancy folks send our kids and there's only a few of us, all US fancy folks send our kids and they have these school gala fundraising events. Where they raised money is if they need to raise money and they have this gala event and they have, you know, all the bands, you know, and uh, you know, we got to all the dads is going to be some rock stars in there. And so they have, you know, I call what I call the grateful dad, which is the school band, um, of whatever dads are in that school. And you know, one of the schools here at Wildwood, the school, the grateful dad was Stephen Stills. Gene Simmons, me a Barclay, um, Travis bark glee miles in a wheelchair, kind of a wrap. [inaudible] and Bob, Bob Dylan was supposed to be there but he bailed. So that's the bad gene Simmons Steven stills in me. Okay. That's pretty disparate. What we've figured out a show we played for all the dads. Okay. Turns out that Gene Simmons is a student of Old Testament theology. So they're at this event where we're playing all this stuff. Like there's the Bass player of kiss and the drummer of police backstage are agreeing about which profit knows that. But Diet was not those

Speaker 1:          01:00:56       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:01:03       very well read guy. Are there any quotes? Is there a quote or quotes that you either live your life by or think of often? Don't worry. Be Happy.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       All right. [inaudible] by the way, by the way,

Speaker 4:          01:01:22       that's is the first thing that came to my mind and thank you for that. Nice, polite pleather. What the fuck does that mean? What uses that? Don't worry. Be Happy as if is there a pill for that? So good advice. But it is good advice. Kind of facile. So we can also come back to that one. If anything, if any, if there's someone who is particularly quotable in your mind in a way that has impacted you, maybe that's another way to tackle it. Uh, you know, for me it would be a Seneca, maybe an Emerson. Wow, that's sophisticated. Well, I mean Seneca, no, I'll show you how unsophisticated I am. So from Long Island, I thought Seneca was, and there is another Seneca and fairness, but a native American elder for the longest time I was like, this guy's the best quote ever. That was like, oh wait, he's a, Roman has been dead for 2000 years. But that was a football team or city. And he does a lot of things. Seneca has been used for a lot of labeling. If you

Speaker 3:          01:02:19       saying giving advice to a young musician, very capable musician who's getting ready for their first, would they perceive to be big Gig? And they're just all nerves. They are. They feel like they've got a bottom. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:02:34       By the way, a presenter of a television show, it could have been made. What advice, what advice would you give that person? Relax, relax. Take that as your living room. It's um, well that particular thing, there's a bunch of specific to that challenge, which is that there are audiences on your side. You're getting your, your, your, you walk out on stage as a total success and it's yours to throw away and it's really hard to throw away, you know? Um, so relax, assume that you're blowing everybody away. Um, and everything else will take care of itself. You know, when I was young, I used to think that I got to get myself out to go on stage and I got to go out.

Speaker 4:          01:03:19       But in fact, that's a dissipation of the energy, you know, there was that film whiplash where the kid is trying to get better and he goes back to woodshed, may show him the woodshed. That's the one thing they got wrong. Yeah. Uh, to get better, you don't grow like that. You go like that, you know, calmly. And the more relaxed you can be, the more energy, the more ferocity you can achieve by being relaxed. You know, definitely mass murder is best delivered cold. Is that well, I mean I revenge is best served. Oh yeah. There we go. The uh, 80 act of violence has more aggression and violence if it's done commonly. Well, you also see this in a athletics, right? I mean, it's kind of a nervous, evil laugh going around the room. This little chorus of Dr Evil Laugh. That's all right. Yeah. Uh, I mean, you see the wives check your husbands, you see the ability to teach

Speaker 3:          01:04:21       for an off informing the ability to turn out, right. I mean, you see this in athletics all the time, meaning the, the someone's capacity to turn off and relax being directly correlated to their ability to turn it on if they're always on or somewhere in the middle. It just doesn't seem to manifest the same way. I remember hearing this story about a gent named Marcello Garcia, so he's considered sort of the Michael Jordan, Mike Tyson, Wayne Gretzky combined to the Brazilian Jujitsu world is something like a nine time world champion. And I know, uh, a fellow who co owns a school that, and Marcel has gone to the world championships, biggest event of the year on the planet and he's supposed to go into the finals and they call his name to go out to the mat and he's asleep. And the bleachers,

Speaker 4:          01:05:07       they had to go shake him to wake him up and he's sort of groggy, rubbing his eyes, walks out. And then as soon as he steps on the mat, just different person, I, I totally that you get yourself into a state of calmness and the ferocity we'll take care of itself. I had a similar thing I, the other day I was, and playing in Seattle with the Seattle symphony, they're doing, Ben Hurts a 90 minute program with big orchestra, really complex show my hotel rooms just around the corner. So I go back after, you know, rehearsal and I'm, and I set my alarm for six o'clock and I got into a sneeze. Ah, I set it for 6:00 AM not pm. Ah. So I wake up, oh like that. And I got a bit of a sandwich and I'm chewing on the sandwich and I look at, Oh shit. So I run, you know like Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God the hell it and I'm on the 28th floor elevator out of service down the step up the hell do they get get there like that. And Ah, okay. Showtime. Best show ever.

Speaker 1:          01:06:18       Ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker 5:          01:06:37       Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a few more things before you take off. Number one, this is five bullet Friday. Do you want to get a short email from me? Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering over the week. That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered. It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've somehow dug up in the, uh, the world of the esoteric as I do. It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my close friends for instance, and it's very short. It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

Speaker 5:          01:07:25       So if you want to receive that, check it out. Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work, week.com all spelled out and just drop in your email and you will get the very next one if you sign up, I hope you enjoy it. This episode is brought to you by kettle and fire, which makes some of the best bone broth and certainly the most convenient that I've ever found and I have a big stack of them on my kitchen counter right now I have one container every morning and this first came highly recommended to me by past podcast guests such as Amelia Boone who is a four time world champion in bolts, toughest mudder, Spartan race, etc. And Dr Dominic D'agostino, the incredible hulk of scientific research. He's checking him out too. But there are few things that make a kettle and fire special.

Speaker 5:          01:08:11       Number one, they are the first shelf stable. In other words, never frozen bone broth that uses bones from 100% grass fed, organically raised animals. So you are what you eat, ate, if that makes sense. So it's very important that you understand if you're consuming animal protein, what they consumed. They also use longer cook times, 20 plus hours, which means more collagen and other nutrients. For instance, they contain it 19 times more Collagen, then one of their close competitors and an independent lab confirm this. I'll leave the competitor's name out of it because I don't want to get sued, but that's the case and it is not frozen. So thanks to many millions of dollars of packaging equipment. They're bone broth doesn't require freezing or shipping with dry ice. So like I said, it's just sitting on my kitchen counter in these boxes and then I can keep them up.

Speaker 5:          01:09:01       They're basically ready to drink, heat them up on the stove top or in a microwave and you are ready to rock and roll. And you'll also get a nice payload of Glucosamine, glycine, uh, along with the gelatin and everything else that I mentioned. So check it out. I've been hugely pleased with this and like I said, had been consuming it every morning. It gives you about let's say 20 grams of protein, which is a nice little slow carb diet boost. That's what you're looking for it. And then I'll typically sip this, have a very large camping coffee mug as I do some writing or journaling so that you'll have it. Check it out. It's delicious. I favor the chicken, but uh, each to his own or her own. So check it out. Kettle and fire.com, forward slash timber and you can receive 20% off of your entire order.

Speaker 5:          01:09:51       Take a look. Kettling fire.com forward slash. Tip. It is very late at night. I am packing for an island getaway. Why does that matter? Because it reminds me of one of the sponsors for today's podcast visiting Maine. Why? Because the only dress shirt that I'm taking, I normally hate dress shirts is from mizzen and main, specifically the Becket Blue Gingham. The reason or the reasons I should say is because I can throw it in my bag and the duffle, not worry about ironing, not worry about any kind of wrinkling and then throw it on where it may be four or five nights out of seven without washing it. It won't smell antimicrobial. It is made of stretch, fabric, sweat wicking, athletic. I could wear for a hike in between dinners if I want to do it, probably wouldn't do that. But mizzen and main has really delivered on the all around all purpose dress shirt.

Speaker 5:          01:10:47       They're fancy enough. You can fool people into thinking that you had them custom tailored, but they're also rough enough and resilient enough that you can toss them into the bottom of a duffle bag or backpack, pull it off and put it on in a bathroom at a restaurant. Let's say hundreds of pro athletes love this brand. Uh, people who don't fit well into dress shirts, otherwise like NFL Allpro, Jj Watt. And the last time these guys were featured on the show visit domain sold out of every item that they featured. So if you're interested in checking them out, I had to recommend taking a look. Just go to tim.blog forward slash shirts, and you can see that one shirt that I'm packing. Then I always pack the Beckett Hulu Gingham in addition to a couple of my other favorites. And you can enter Tim, that's Capitol Tim at checkout for free shipping. If you use this code before September 15th it's 2017 to buy a dress shirt mizzen and main, we'll donate a brand new dress shirt to the relief efforts in southern Texas. That's in addition to the thousand shirts that are already being donated through Jj Watson. Credible efforts to put our, I should say, where help Houston and the surrounding communities get back on their feet. So there you have it. Check it out. Take a look. Even if it's just to take a peek at this one shirt, the Becket tim.blog/shirts. Again, that's Tim dot. Blog forward slash shirts.
