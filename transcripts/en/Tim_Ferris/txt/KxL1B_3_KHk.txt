Speaker 2:          00:23          This episode is brought to you by a cent protein, the cleanest least processed protein I've ever consumed and I have tried just about everything since well before the four hour body. I've started my day with 20 to 30 grams of protein. First thing that has been part of my routine, but I don't always have the time or necessarily the desire to cook an entire meal. So what to do. Protein powders can be a fast way to get this protein needs met, but most products are full of crap. They're bleached, they have excess sugar, terrible artificial sweeteners or just straightforward low grade, low quality protein. Ascent contains zero artificial ingredients and the parent company is actually a cheese manufacturer so that they produce their own native proteins. It's, it's really fascinating and I've looked at they're processing it takes or it took them about five years to develop.

Speaker 2:          01:19          You can mix the protein in as little as four ounces without any clumps or issues of mixed ability whatsoever. And they nailed the taste. They tested, for instance, the chocolate version 282 different versions. It put a lot of money and a lot of time into r and D for this particular product, and they have both way and my seller casing. So if you want to say improve body composition and recovery overnight slow release, you can take the my seller casein or in my case, whey protein. I would take postworkout for instance, or in the morning. So check it out. These guys were really fascinating.
