Speaker 2:          00:24          This episode is brought to you by convert kit, my go to email service provider. A lot of you have asked me what I use for email and I've been hesitant to tell you because I don't want to give them the hug of death and have my own service drop.

Speaker 2:          02:30          This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic, founded by the Genius Fin's who lit the Internet on fire and you may have heard of their mushroom coffee, which features Chaga and lion's mane, which has taken Silicon Valley by storm. I use it pretty much every day, either that or the Chaga, which is decaf. There's a separate version and I use both of these primarily for focus and productivity. They just get you going let you up like a Christmas tree, so definitely check it out. People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement and for right now this is the answer. I try to force this on all of my house guests. It is a hell of a thing. If I have employees or people come over who are working on projects with me, I always try to feed it to them because I'm going to get the limitless effect and get a lot more out of them.

Speaker 2:          03:23          The first time I mentioned this product and four sigmatic on the podcast, their product sold out in less than a week, so you may want to check them out soon. If you're listening to this and the coffee tastes like coffee, it takes just seconds to prepare with hot water. And oddly enough only includes 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you'd get in a regular cup of coffee. I don't get any jitters, acid reflux or any stomach burn, any of that. It's very unusual and very, very cool. So if you don't like caffeine, they also offer very strong, but caffeine free mushroom elixirs, which I will sometimes have in the evening. I find Chaga specifically to be very, very grounding and earthy. So that is another option. And I have a cupboard full of their products, uh, at the moment, which is right around the corner of my kitchen. You can try something. You can try sample pack, which is great also right now by going to foursigmatic.com forward slash. Tim, that's foursigmatic, F, O, u, R, s. I, g, m, a, T, I c. Dot com, forward slash Tim and use the Code Tim Tim to get 20% off of your first order and they're not that expensive. Anyway, if you are in the experimental mindset, I do not think you'll be disappointed, so try them out.

Speaker 2:          04:38          No ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to interview people from many diverse fields, different arenas of competition or lack thereof, to dissect what makes them the best at what they do, the habits, routines, philosophies, beliefs, et Cetera, that you can apply in your own life. This episode we have Sharon Salzberg as AOL, z. B. E. R. G. You can find her on Twitter. I believe it's just at Sharon Salzberg and Sharon is a central figure in the field of meditation, a world renowned teacher and New York Times bestselling author. She has played a crucial role from the very beginning in some respects in bringing meditation and mindfulness practices to the West and very much into mainstream culture since 1974 when she first began teaching c is the cofounder of the insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts and the author of several books including the New York Times bestseller, real happiness for seminal work, loving kindness, which we'll get into in real happiness at work, very well known for her down to Earth Style and you'll get a firsthand view of that when you listen to this.

Speaker 2:          05:51          She offers a secular and modern approach to Buddhist teachings making them more accessible than I think some of the esoteric varieties would be two, type a personalities like you friend listening to this podcast probably she's a columnist for on being a contributor to Huffington post and the host of her own podcast, the Metta hour, m, e, t, t a, and a. We will get into what that means. Her newest book is real love, the art of mindful connection. And I wanted to speak with Sharon for a long time. I've read her work, I've heard her audio and it's very meaningfully impacted how I operate in the world, how I perceived myself and others and ultimately that has made me both more effective and given me a greater sense of wellbeing. So I hope that you pull some of that from this conversation. We bounced all over the place. I ask some very personal self interested questions, uh, which I think make the answers practical also and a, there you have it. So I hope you enjoy as much as I did this wide ranging conversation with Sharon Salzberg.

Speaker 2:          07:02          Sharon, welcome to the show. Thank you. I have been looking forward to this conversation for some time and I'm glad we could finally make it happen. The construction around your apartment in New York, not withstanding and uh, I know that you have to be out, uh, at a set time. So I'd like to just jump right into it and begin at the beginning in a sense with a question related to your youth and if you're comfortable sharing the story. Could you tell us about your experience that you had? I think it was at nine years old when you were dressed in your Halloween costume and watching Nat King Cole.

Speaker 3:          07:47          Yes. I, uh, my mother died when I was nine and it was that night when I was nine that my mother started hemorrhaging. I was alone in the house with her and, and she, uh, I got ended up getting an ambulance and she went to the hospital and she died about two weeks later. And um, it was much later when I was writing a book called faith, which is kind of like my faith journey that I looked back over my life from the time it was born till the time I went to college at 16. And I realized that I had lived in five different family configurations along that time. And each one of them had been altered by trauma or death or a, some kind of really no terrible circumstance.

Speaker 2:          08:28          And what, what was your relationship like with your father when you were younger?

Speaker 3:          08:34          Well, my parents had had divorced when I was four. And my father, as far as I can recall, it was really like my hero, you know, he was, he was the love in my life. And then he was just gone. He completely disappeared and there was no contact whatsoever. Uh, from the time I lived with my mother after I was, after they split up, uh, on her siblings from the time I was fortunate the time I was nine. And, um, at that point, after she died, I ended up living with my father's parents, whom I hardly knew. And that was the first time that.
