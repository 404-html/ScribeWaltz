Speaker 1:          00:00          I guys, this is Tim Ferriss. Going to cover some basics of dog training. I'm not a dog trainer, but I thought I would share what I've learned from going over 2030 books and working with a number of trainers. The first is a prerequisite skill. This is Molly. Good Molly. So the prerequisite skill number one is attention. You want to get eye contact, and I have mentioned this once before, but this is how this works. So let's just say she comes over prerequisite skill number two. I'll show you what this is is. So that's called hand targeting. We're going to talk about that in a second, but let's just say we come down and pretending that she's not. This is a clicker pretending that she's no, no, that's a different trick. Then we have eye contact and you go out to the side.

Speaker 1:          00:42          She looks at me and I give her the treat. All right. So I am training her to constantly check in with her eyes and the clicker makes it very fast, very consistent because if you're like nice doggy, good doggy, Yay, Molly, whatever, it's not consistent and it's not going to impart the conditioning that you want. Okay. The way that that then develops, leave it. Okay. So then you can start to instill self control in your dog and discipline. This is very, very important for safety. Now she might have some water because this stuff is dry.

Speaker 1:          01:22          So you can see the, okay, the [inaudible] is a stop or the eye as a stop. Uh, I was also negative reward marker. I'm going to get to that. But the hand targeting is number two. So first in India, she's constantly checking in with me, looking at me, waiting, waiting, waiting. And I'll have her sit to say please for everything. So if we come over, Yup. Okay. And then down. Up. All right, so sit is pleased. That's true. Coming out of the door. That's true. Getting out of the car before going through a door. Always. I have her sit, I walk through. I always go through first, then she checks with me and then okay, and that's the release word. And there's a lot of debate about using okay as the release word, I think it's fine. 99 times out of 999 times out of a thousand.

Speaker 1:          02:16          All right, so hand targeting and this is something you can do very easily with, say puppies also get them used to poking your hand with their nose and you use the clicker to tell them when they're doing it correctly. So if you want it to get a dog to heel, for instance, you could put peanut butter on your hand and I haven't done this with her so it may not work. But watch if I do this, she'll follow the hand and then poke it with their nose and then I gave her a treat. So it would have clicked. Right? If you're working with a puppy and trying to get it to follow the taste on your hand, that's a very good way to train heel. You can also do it with a wall on this opposite side. Very, very common. Okay. But still is kind of a, a vanity trick. All right, I'll show you another vanity trick.

Speaker 1:          02:56          Okay. Yeah. So she's, she loves jumping into heal. But another vanity trick would be stay stay as a safety trick. Okay. So safety behaviors, safety tricks and number one, vanity trek or something like this. I thought, all right. Okay. So high fives and catches do not keep the dog alive, but they might impress a dinner guest or something like that. Right? So down I do like rollover, that kind of stuff. Also vanity tricks, very simple stuff. And uh, but I'll show you how we would use a clicker to teach something like rollover. Okay. And then this is true for many different tricks and it's a progression. It's really just conditioned response. Okay. Down is, so she knows this trick obviously already, but you would use the food to get the dog to follow your hand like this and then click as they get closer and closer to the behavior, they don't have to complete it first.

Speaker 1:          04:03          They just have to make an inch of progress in the right direction. Click, click, click. And then eventually you would fade the lure. So you lose the food and use the same motion, give the food, and then you start to make it smaller and smaller. Sorry. It's sorry food. It's like sign language. It's conditioned now. Uh, and that way you get to the point where you can do something. For instance, another vanity trick would be turning, right? So you get your doctor's spin. Now you start by using the food to get them to follow it and then you get to the point. So this is her default. This is a new default behavior. Um, when I walk with her outside and I do a lot of off leash training, but you can see that the spin, I just need this type of emotion. And it started off like this, getting rid of bu effectively chase their tail staying.

Speaker 1:          04:56          And you do the same thing where as you provide the food and get them to move their body or head in a certain way and then you lose the food and then you make it smaller. You can get them to do things like any Molly take a bath. So as to take the bow, uh, and, and, and you can really get creative with this stuff. The clicker is incredibly important. And Karen Pryor don't shoot the dog. And then command performance are really, really helpful. But let's just say using the clicker, I'll show you some stuff you can do. You can, you can get into very what people might think of a sophisticate behaviors. These are actually really simple. So cute. Alright. And then let's say she's, I want her to do a quarter turn. Okay. Quarter term. So a quarter turns pretty easy. Let's say we want to do backwards turn, okay.

Speaker 1:          05:45          Or I want to do through the legs, spin around, back to heal. And then let's say she's a little bit too far forward back girl. So, so those are some basic trick that you can see. She's very well behaved and if I give her, say good about. All right, so let's say this was something poisonous. Okay, I'll give her one just cause she went to bed, but okay, leave it. All right, so let's just say that was something covered with paint or arsenic or some miscellaneous object. On the side of the road. I want to be able to keep her from eating that, which I can do because we've practiced all of this hundreds and thousands of times, and then she checks in and I go, okay. And then she can eat it. Right? So priority number one with training your dog is keeping your dog safe. Priority number two is keeping other people safe prior to number three is entertainment or anything else. Okay? So those are some of the basics of doctrinal. Be Nice, be consistent, and good luck.
