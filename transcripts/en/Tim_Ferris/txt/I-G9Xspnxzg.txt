Speaker 1:          00:00          What are, what are the top, say, two or three books that you either discovered or delved into while researching? I was told us away. I mean, if you had to pick your top two to three, you're like, all right, if you want to maximally gain in whatever way, I'll let, I'll leave it open to, to you read these two or three bucks. Like, if these are the only two or three books you read this year, you'll be, you'll be better off

Speaker 2:          00:25          for having, okay. Well, I'm looking at the bibliography right now and some that jumped out at me that were total favorites. Ron Chernow's biography of John D Rockefeller, which is Titan, though the life of John d Rockefeller was like a total game changer to me. It was an amazing biography. Um, I like Sarah Bakewell, his book, how to live. It's like a series of essays about Montana who invented the essay. Yeah. Um, he's really fascinating. Sarah Bakewell.

Speaker 3:          00:55          Hmm,

Speaker 2:          00:55          cool. Um, I like, uh, let's see. Oh, I read this book. Um, the, uh, the fish that ate the whale, the life and times of America's banana king. He was this, uh, a totally fascinating but relatively unknown historical figure who started, he started a fruit company buying spoiling like the, the day old, not daily, but the, about to expire bananas. Um, that would be important in like late 18 hundreds, America. And he would sell them, um, like he would sell them by train car. He ends up, he ends up buying United fruit. He starts a small fruit company that it grows to be so big that it buys United Fruit company, which is the biggest fruit company in the world. Um, so that's why he's known as the fish that ate the whale. He's this sort of fascinating, a Jewish businessman. Um, I read a really good biography of Edison by Matthew, uh, Josephson called Edison a biography.

Speaker 3:          01:57          Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:57          Got It. And if there was any others, I'm trying to think. Yeah, those were some, oh, and I read a really good biography of Ulysses s grant called Ulysses s grant, triumph over adversity that I loved a lot.
