Speaker 3:          00:02:15       Uh, what is this funny? Because I, I teach writing in various contexts. I, but I teach at a summer writing program in Paris and then I'd been, uh, doing a class at Yale the last couple of years. And, uh, so I, I'd been reading a lot of craft books recently and I realized that I had crossed my carrying capacity that I needed to stop freaking reading books about writing craft. That like I had learned all the metaphors there. There were, um, and so, I mean there's some, there's some journalistically minded books like Roy Peters Clark has the writer's tool kit, I think it's called a, and Philip low paid, uh, has a book called a collection of essays about the writer's craft called to show and to tell, I think, uh, because you know, the old adage goes, I show, don't tell, but he's a believer in the idea of strategic telling and in, and he's a brilliant SAS team stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:03:09       Spell his last name, a. L. O. P. A. T. E. Got it. Uh, he sort of the modern father of, of the Bella touristic essay, the personal essay and he, he actually came up from New York to talk to my El students in, in, in person earlier this year. Um, and he's, he's, he's kind of writing is very different from what you and I do and he might sort of frown on it to a certain extent that he's, he's really about that old going back to Montana high art of the essay. But he really has some good advice on writing and, and jumping back to screenplays. The breakthrough for me in my writing when I took my first vagabonding trip and thought I was going to be the new Jack Kerouac and tried to write about it and realize that one chronological retelling of what I did was not going to work regardless of how beautiful the sentences were.

Speaker 3:          00:03:54       A with stumbling into screenwriting, uh, 20 years ago and learning the importance of structure. And so those classic screenwriting, the tomes, like, you know, the student field's screenplay book or Robert McKee Story, which is actually ridiculed in the movie adaptation. Right, right, right. I think Cox actually plays a Robert McKee and that movie. Um, I think that those are useful because they go back to the very core of how we communicate as humans, how we tell stories. And you can get tired of the three act, a screenplay structure or the needs of the audience, but the audience is damn important. And I'm a big believer, uh, and you know, I'm not a believer in cultural hierarchy. I think that the high literature is important and good, but, um, I mean I just wrote a Popey B movie. Uh, I think that, uh, that it's good to know how Raymond Chandler stretchers his narratives in the same sense that it's good to know how Montaigne's structure is his narratives as well.

Speaker 3:          00:04:55       So I would say if people are looking for writing craft books, don't be afraid of any kind of book that just talks about how to tell a story. And I think that movies are great metaphors for how to tell a story. And there's crappy movies out there and you know, adaptation. It's sort of a, a lampoon of how we invariably tell stories in movies. But just because you learn a very basic and formula, what formula way of say, telling a cinematic story doesn't mean that you have to use that every time. It just means that you understand the rules and then within the structure of those rules, then you can shine. As a writer.

Speaker 2:          00:05:35       I very much concur. I, uh, I have an embarrassing confession, which is, has been agonizing over a screenplay for several months now. And, uh, I think partially because I've loaded, I've loaded the expectations, uh, and the burden so large on my shoulders, it's, it's roughly

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       an adaptation of the four hour workweek and a lot of the backstory, and it's intended to be comedic but instill or at least convey a lot of a sort of philosophical takeaways that hopefully will, will spur viewers to do, uh, interesting things in their lives and make big changes, blah, blah, blah. Um, but I've been agonizing over at the one thing that did help me to at least get started. And I have quite a lot on paper. It was a save the cat. I thought that was, I don't know if you've seen this book, but I found it so helpful because I also read, I took McKees story seminar actually, uh, which was, which was a quite an experience in and of itself. Uh, I mean the, the uh, the portrayal and adaptations not far off the mark. Yeah. Uh, but, uh, uh, uh, a fun experience.

Speaker 4:          00:06:45       Then the last, uh, I really found a save the cat to hold your hand and walk you through at least getting things down on paper by saying are right by this page and this minute you should have this type of element and really allowing you at least get, um, I wouldn't consider what I have a first draft, but a skeleton structure down that I can use to fill in the blanks with all of these random ideas that I have. Um, totally agree. I think that, uh, you know, become recently interested in, in Joseph Campbell, had a passing familiarity with Joseph Campbell, watched a few documentaries. Um, but the, the hero's journey and, uh, the, the, the Mono myth I find very interesting, uh, just as a way of getting started, if you can sort of lay out these markers for different stories that you're considering telling. Um, but, uh, you know, another, another thought that I had, which we don't have to go too deep into unless you have thoughts on it, but is that that beginner's mind that you mentioned, which is achievable through travel or vagabonding, uh, is also, I think one of the primary benefits of, uh, what you might consider therapeutic use of psychedelics.

Speaker 4:          00:07:59       Um, and that's, uh, it'd be part of the reason that people often describe with the right set and setting a psychedelic experiences. One of the best experiences of their lives is, I think the same reason that many people would describe their first vagabonding experience as one of the best experiences of their lives. And that's the present state awareness and the beginner's mind. Uh, and the appreciation that both of those experiences tend to catalyze. Um, but yeah, well,

Speaker 3:          00:08:31       I touched on that a little bit in vagabonding. I sort of gently dissuade readers of the necessity to say smoked marijuana when they travel because reality is giving you this present state awareness. You know, if you allow yourself to be bored or if you allowed yourself to be lonely or just, if you allow yourself to have experiences by accident, then suddenly you're having, you're discovering in a vivid way that don't need a artificial enhancement.

Speaker 4:          00:09:00       Definitely. The, one of the pieces of advice that you gave, I'm pretty sure that, uh, you gave this advice, I feel free to, to, uh, to correct me, but was getting lost the benefit of getting lost and heading out of your, your housing, whatever that might be. And just walking off in one direction, maybe with a map, maybe without a map and just walking and taking random turns for a few hours. And I have found that so invaluable, not only while traveling, quite frankly, but even in San Francisco and places where I've lived or live, uh, exploring by foot. Um, a terrain that you might otherwise for the sake of convenience use taxis for, for instance. And it's, it's been, uh, I think a major priority for me when I travel, uh, not for business but for this type of, uh, experiential reflection and exploration to, to try to catalyze discomfort whenever possible.

Speaker 4:          00:10:06       And uh, that doesn't mean a pebble in the shoe, but, uh, to, uh, for instance, to purposefully go out of my way to encounter language difficulties. And one of my favorite ways to do this, uh, I'm typically a night owl like I mentioned, but when I travel, I try to switch it up. So I like to try to wake up in some cases very early. And I did this in Greece. My first trip to Greece, I was traveling with a close friend and I started waking up really early. I would just leave the blinds open and I'll wake up as early as possible. And my habit was to, to go for a walk and just hand wave and try to ask the locals. These were on some very small islands where I could find a cafe or a bakery. And inevitably I would go to these bakeries or coffee shops and there would be a small group of really old Greek guys sitting outside debating what, whatever old Greek men debate.

Speaker 4:          00:10:58       I would imagine it's probably complaining about politicians and so on and so forth. Much like every other sort of gaggle of old men early in the morning, uh, everywhere else in the world. Um, and, uh, and then I would just proceed to kind of sit down and try to have a conversation with these guys. And it was always hilarious and extremely fun. And, uh, I ended up being basically the court jester for these guys for, for a period of time in the morning and they always got a kick out of it. So, uh, I think that, um, yeah, I mean I said that, that, that, that's seeking out of a mild discomfort or uncomfortable situations I think is, is really one of the main, um, values, um, uh, and benefits that I've taken away from, from travel in the last, certainly last 10 years or so.

Speaker 3:          00:11:50       Yeah. This ties into a lot of ideas that are really close to my heart and that I've sort of embraced even since I discovered vagabonding. And it's fine that you're talking about the old Greek guys because as a travel writer, one of my biggest strengths, and it could be an accidental strength as a person who wanders out with purpose of getting lost, is that whatever town I'm in, inevitably the town Weirdo finds me like the most eccentric by, and if you read my second book, Marco Polo didn't go there. Like one third of the stories are about me with a really strange dude in Lebanon or Burma or someplace and it, it's sort of connected to the idea of the old Greek guy sitting there is that they, they see each other every morning. But the chance for an American to stumble in and sort of have a semi comical exchange with them is the most exciting thing that's happened to them all week.

Speaker 3:          00:12:45       You know, it's like their wives have stopped listening to them, their children have stopped listening to them, and so they can take you under their wing. And just the things that you learned from these guys is amazing. Um, and so that, that's funny that, that's, that's very relatable because I, I feel like for whatever reason, I don't know if I, if it's my, my Midwestern tendency to, to, to talk a little bit less and maybe listen a little bit more something that I always meet these guys who just have the weirdest, um, view of the world. But you were talking about walking out and getting lost in, in vagabonding I talk about how if in doubt, just walk until your day becomes interesting. And this, and this is sort of tied into a concept that I've discovered since then and as a concept set that I teach in my Paris classes because we're in the city where it was invented and it's the idea of the flinor. Are you familiar with the flinor? Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:13:37       Only reason I'm in passing. I want you to expand on it. The only reason I know I recognize that word is because, uh, a friend of mine named Nassim Taleb who's very famous for having written the Black Swan sure. And a number of other books describes himself that way. Yeah. Uh, and um, so maybe you could, uh, expand on that because I would love to hear more. I quite frankly, I didn't know much about the term.

Speaker 3:          00:14:05       Yeah. It's a, it's a wonderful idea that they get in a sense when I was walking until my day became interesting, I was being a full neuro before I knew what it was, but it goes back to it's a bode layer and in, in, in, in, uh, uh, you know, over a hundred years ago in Paris, uh, and it's connected through French ideas through the, the situationist of the 1960s. And the idea is that, and flaring is something that I use in travel, but it was, it was really invented as a concept in your own hometown. And the idea is that you become so used to and inured to your hometown that you're not seeing it anymore. That is to become a purely utilitarian space in between point a and point B. You've seen, he's living that in your routine. You're not really live in your routine. You're just sort of, and this is a paraphrase, but you're sort of Zombie walking through your day.

Speaker 3:          00:14:57       And so being a full neuro, if Linda is not someone who walks through his own city in, in a utilitarian or pragmatic way, a full or someone who goes out in search of experience, uh, and there's someone, um, it's also tied into the idea of psychogeography that instead of walking through a city, uh, with the idea that you're going to say see tourist attractions or that you're going to go to visit your friend on the other side of town, is that you're going to walk through the town psycho geographically and you're going to collect the color red and you're just going to see how many forms the color red con can take, are going to look for every parking meter in town. Where are you going to look for license plates with the letter Q on them? Or are you gonna look for every immigrant restaurant?

Speaker 3:          00:15:39       And that is going to organize your day. That psychogeography being a flaneur is even less structured in that you're just, you're just wandering. Um, and it's a wonderful, it was invented to be done in your hometown to break out of your own habits. Um, it's a great thing. It's a great way to break out of your tourist habits where you go to a city and there's 100,000 things you can do at any given moment. And you do the obvious thing which is go to the tourist attractions and, and I'm not going to knock that. There's a reason why there are tourist attractions, but people talk about how, oh, there's the beaten path. Everything's been discovered. Everything has already been done. And it's like, actually that's not true. You know, Paris is the most tourist city in the world, but you wonder for 10 minutes and pretty soon you're going to be finding something that's unique to itself.

Speaker 3:          00:16:24       Even along the Sean's, all these [inaudible] even you know this Shawn do mar with the Eiffel Tower is if you just embrace the idea of the flinor and walk until something catches your eye and stay open to experience instead of your plans, then you're going to, um, you're going to be living in a way where you previously had only been consuming those moments. And Flinders. F, l A. N. E. U. R that's right with a little hat over the a got us caught my eye. All the languages I've attempted, although this one very halfheartedly, I just cannot seem to get a grasp on the French because I panic when it starts to erase any of my Spanish or confused anything and I'll sort of studied. But Paris, what does it like to teach in Paris and art? What type of students are you teaching? Oh, I teach it at the American Academy.

Speaker 3:          00:17:15       I'm actually the, the course director and it's sort of become my baby. I've been running this writing workshop for the last 10 years on roofs on shock in Paris and my students are like age 18 to age 70. And it's just, it's a large number of people. I mean, some people are there because of they know vagabonding or my writing or they know some of the other writers who teach there. I have two, one other nonfiction teacher and two fiction teachers, so they can, it's not just travel, right. And they can study poetry or a screenwriting or short stories. Uh, and so a lot of people have just, it's, it's sort of a bucket list thing for them is that they want to come to Paris and be a writer for a month. And it's, and it's one of the exciting parts of the program is that it delivers, you're there on the left bank, you're in the University of district of Paris and you're, you know, you're, you're firing in all cylinders that you're, you're writing all the time, you're interacting with writers, you're reading a lot and you're being a flaneur is, and this, it's funny that I discovered the flinor in the context of Paris, even though I'd already been doing it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:12       And I, even when I'm not teaching travel, writing the flinor is such a great creative exercise for my students who might be writing a poem rather than a travel story. Um, and evil and Wa talked about how a city like Paris is sort of like a house that's been wallpaper and over so much that the only thing holding it up is the wallpaper, is that there's no, everybody's written about Paris. And so you have to find a way that is against expectations. And the only way to find that is to get out and wander and find your own interests. You know, and I've had students who have brought their skateboard and through skateboarding and Paris had discovered sides of it that nobody else is seeing. And they've discovered, you know, uh, the French skateboarding culture. Um, and so yeah, my, my students are just there for the romance of Paris.

Speaker 3:          00:18:58       And the great thing is that it's a great, you know, July in Paris, his romantic place to be, but it's a great place to deliver. You know, you can walk outside of a classroom and in 90 seconds you're aware of victory. Hugo lived when he was 11 years old. Um, and, and so there's this huge, I in, in, in, in, in three minutes, you can go to a place where Hemingway got shit faced, you know, cause like, we're literally, we're on the street, you know, that he describes, you know, in a movable feast. And so I think that energy, I mean, it's like we could teach the same thing in North Dakota and it would still be a very professional, I'm very proud of what our teachers are doing, but there's, it's almost like a catalyst. Paris puts people in a mental state and almost like an athletic performance thing is that people are in Paris and they're not going to blow it, you know? Right. They don't live in Paris. They're were going to come to Paris and they're going to do something special. Um, and it creates this energy that, that amazes me every year of people just uncorking some really, um, some really good stuff. And, and just having some, going back to time, wealth, just an experience that is, that is very specific and very, very Parisian, but very unique to themselves. So, uh, I've, I've really loved my association with that city.

Speaker 4:          00:20:11       Sounds amazing. How many students are in the course?

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       It varies from year to year. Um, we've been averaging about 24. Uh, it's capped at 32. Uh, and so probably anywhere from 18 to 32 students.

Speaker 4:          00:20:26       God, I feel like I should take the course. It sounds amazing. I, uh, I fantasized a fairly frequently about, uh, going to graduate school or a attempting something like an Mfa for creative writing because I really haven't ever explored to fiction outside of elementary school doing some exercises in elementary school. Um, what do you find of, of the students who take this course, uh, what are the care, what are the shared characteristics of the people who get the most out of it? Then I'm going to leave that open ended on purpose.

Speaker 3:          00:20:59       I think it's, it's an earnest desire, um, to do their best combined with sort of a, a humility, almost a beginner's mind, tight humility towards writing. Um, and sometimes I can get it very young and brilliant college students, um, who will come in sort of a leg above maybe sort of a mid career professional, but because the college student is, has not quite cultivated, it's, it's, it's a strange thing to think, but there's this sort of confidence and self assuredness that college students have that like a mid career professional doesn't have and that can get in the way of the beginner's mind. And so that sort of know it all is a wrong word, but like the overconfidence of a, of a brilliant college student might impede his or her, uh, advancement where like someone who's 35 or 45 and is just there to soak in everything and work as hard as they can.

Speaker 3:          00:21:57       Um, I, I think it's the person going back to the beginner's mind, it's the person who is willing to embrace the beginner's mind and work hard and synthesize the creative aspect with the parts of Paris that you can't overlook. You can't just come to Paris and sitting in your room and write all the time, any more than j j p Morgan should have been reading TeleTech's is the whole time he was in Egypt. That that interactive going out and having fun and having a bottle of wine by the Sen and Flynn during, through the city and discovering things by accident is going to feed what's happening when you're alone in your room. And so I think it's the students who can find that balance. Um, and, and the students, I think to a big extent, it's the students who have been almost like vagabonding who'd been saving their money and this, this means something, you know, they're not just gathering from their limitless pool of resources, uh, to pay for their month in Paris, but they have earned this with their sweat.

Speaker 3:          00:22:46       It's like a chapter in vagabonding and talk about how the work you do makes your travels meaningful. I think it's the people who come in and know the value of what they have in Paris, that this, this one month is a special time that can catalyze them into a new creative state. Those are the people who are gonna who are going to get things delivered for them. And, and you mentioned MFAs. I, I got a mid career MFA. Um, and I don't know, there's, there's some advantages of that sort of thing, but I think there's an extent to which that creatively, a one month program like this can cover a lot of those MFA basis without compromising two years of your life.

Speaker 4:          00:23:24       Right, right. Agreed. I mean, I'd love to hear your thoughts. I mean, my basic feeling is that, uh, the benefits, uh, would be, and I mean, it's, it's maybe sounds ridiculous that, uh, I feel very isolated writing a lot of the time and, uh, it's, it's, it's sort of odd that I'm, you know, the access to more people than I've ever had access to in my life. Yet I spend a lot of my time feeling quite isolated and lonely. And, uh, there's, and I don't know many writers in San Francisco, I just, that's not in my social sphere. Uh, which maybe is a good thing. Maybe it's a bad thing, but the idea of being any group of people going through the same experience, um, having that sort of shared study experience, I'm sure with some degree of commiseration every once in a while with a structure that actually facilitates experimenting with new types of writing is very appealing to me. So maybe the month, maybe that's, maybe that's a great solution as opposed to two years, like you said, which I don't, I don't think I could, I think that will remain a fantasy in my hand.

Speaker 3:          00:24:35       I think they both, they're both good for that social, um, that community of writers situation. I'm just like this, the friend that I'm swapping houses with w who lives in Brooklyn is a Grad school friend and I just, you know, in my late thirties, I was able to make very, very dear friends through my two years of Grad school where there's an extent to which at that that like MFA programs aren't really designed for 38 year olds who are already successful as writers. Um, yeah. And that, and then that, um, that a month program, I mean obviously I have a vested interest in my own one month program, but a one month program can deliver both the community and a more concentrated spark of uh, of inspiration, uh, without having to go through a two year cycle that isn't necessarily um, tailored to someone in your situation. One thing a two year program can give you is his structure, like deadlines, monthly deadlines. But if you've already written a book, I think there's an extension to witch dyke that exposure to poetry or fiction or screenwriting and just 30 other people who are gung Ho and are locked in on that similar creative openness that that one month catalyst can be more youthful, useful in both senses then then a more extended no certificate program the last two years.

Speaker 4:          00:26:00       You know, it's, I, I am happy that you misspoke for a second, said useful because in a way I think it's almost appropriate because like you said, the charge of a group in Paris recognizing, uh, for most of them that it's a very unique opportunity that required a lot of sacrifices to make happen would charge it with a certain useful energy, which I'm trying to reinfuse into a lot of what I do because, uh, and I don't think this is purely a function of age. Maybe it's exposure to just the doom and gloom of just general Internet bullshit. Uh, but, uh, I'm trying to beat back my own cynicism with a club and really try to prevent myself from becoming apathetic. That's a very strong word. But there's just, there's a lot of instability and, and craziness in the world if you go looking for it or if you were spending a lot of time, uh, on social media for instance, and I want to combat that with, uh, a pipe positive and charge you youthful energy. Uh, so it's very interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:27:16       Well, I think that that goes back to the idea of, uh, of success versus lack of six test and that, um, as certain kinds of successes, more meaningful when you're 30 than when you're 40, because you have a different relationship to that success after you've been steeped in for awhile. So finding the screenplay that you can bang your head up against or, or embracing poetry or any or, you know, Samba dancing or, or anything else with that, didn't, that vulnerability, that beginner's mind, uh, that youthfulness. I think that, that, that is so useful to use the right word this time, uh, in, in rejuvenating your relationship with yourself. Just like when I started out as a travel writer and there were certain by lines that were really important to me that aren't now, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:28:04       and by by lines you mean publications and credits?

Speaker 3:          00:28:07       Yeah, yeah. I'm going to write for the San Francisco Chronicle. I'm going to write for national geographic traveler, good publications. They do good work. But I realized that once you took away the, the, the, um, the thrill of that initial success of having a major publication acknowledged the quality of your work, then the h shifted, you know, what, what I was doing with the content, uh, I, I guess transformed a little bit. And so, um, so now I'm writing a screenplay with, with zombies in it. Not that I'm going to become a a B movie screenwriter now, but it brings me joy, you know, sort of that childlike joy in the creative process that doesn't exist anymore with what I've already become professionally successful at. Right. And so I think you get into that pattern and it sounds like you're experimenting with this already, um, that you become successful in a certain manner of, of creative expression.

Speaker 3:          00:29:03       And, and a, and a certain matter of expertise. Um, and then I think a way to keep yourself fresh is to try activities that you might fail at. And a, I think, right, if you aren't failing at something a fairly substantial once a year, then you're not pushing yourself enough. And of course travel is a great venue for inviting failure and, um, you know, mild humiliation. Uh, but, but, but sure. I, you know, I think, I think it's great that you're, that you're bashing your head against a screen play that might not work out. Um, 10 years ago or maybe eight years ago, I sort of had my vagabonding screenplay where I was sort of expressing philosophical ideas of, of a, a vagabonding through a coming of age story and it didn't quite work. You know, maybe I'll go back to it, but it was a good thing to have tried and not quite succeeded at. And I'm not saying that that's where, where your screenplay is going, but that process I think is important for keeping yourself sharp and keeping a perspective, a mid certain jadedness to other kinds of success.

Speaker 4:          00:30:07       Definitely. Uh, the, the, the, the adjective, well, the adjective successful has come up a couple of times. When you think of the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind and why?

Speaker 3:          00:30:21       Oh Man. I don't know if, I don't know if a person comes to mind. I, you know, I think when I was 28, I may have a, I may have been able to name like a travel writer that I wanted to be like Pico Iyer or Tim Cahill. Um, and I think the reason that a person, when you asked that question at first, it didn't pop into my head because I have that different relationship to success. You know, that the hunger to be like Pico or Tim, um, played itself out in a very integrated way. It became a part of the energy that made me a travel writer. Uh, and so now I don't think, you know, it's funny, I, um, I feel like our backgrounds are fairly similar. I'm from Wichita, Kansas. You're from springs, right? That's right. But Bullseye Middleclass families, it feels like that's right. And you had your Ivy League [inaudible] league experience right out of high school.

Speaker 3:          00:31:13       And I didn't it like I did my, I taught at Penn and then Yale for a couple of years really recently. Um, and that became a part of me felt like I needed to measure myself against that standard and it was a great experience. Um, but now that has also been folded into my idea of success. And so I think this might be a little bit tied into talking about the creative process and sometimes it can be difficult. That what my notions of success, how are, are slightly different and it has a different energy. So I'm not thinking about someone I want to be necessarily, but it's back into that. I think it's more about appreciation. Like my role models and I, I'm still blanking on who I might point out are not achievement people, but appreciation people, you know, people who have found the success and are synthesizing it in sort of a good life kind of way.

Speaker 4:          00:32:07       Definitely. I think this is just somebody who can't, who comes to mind? Uh, I've, I've asked this question of a lot of folks and, uh, more, uh, more than a few times, Steve jobs comes up, but he's, he's actually not a in many ways, um, exemplary, uh, based on what you just described. And I think Steve Wozniaks cofounder very much is, uh, I've, I've met was on a number of occasions and I even gave him a little tango class prior his dancing with the stars experiment. And, uh, he released savers and loves life and has built a, as built a life for himself where he is able to enjoy or experience the joy of discovery and, uh, is a genuinely happy human being. Um, and this is going to sound funny, but despite all of his material success, uh, because I think that, uh, the, the material success, not to say that that's a bad thing, I think that it enables more than it disables, but, uh, it can become a, it can make people very defensive, uh, where they spend the vast majority of their time managing the protection and growth of their assets as opposed to the growth in other areas of their lives.

Speaker 4:          00:33:29       And I've, I've certainly, I've been, I don't have hundreds of millions dollars or anything like that, but I've been very fortunate to have enough success with publishing and elsewhere that, uh, I don't have to worry about where the, the next month's rent is coming from. Um, but I've, I've, I've witnessed that in myself and I think that there's a possibility, and maybe this isn't true, but I'd be curious based on your observations, if you, if you've noticed this in your coming from, uh, a very middle class background where there were many, many times when money was tight in the family and we weren't able to take certain trips or, uh, get certain birthday presents or whatever it might be a go out to certain restaurants that, uh, my, my inclination is to be very, um, to focus on the, the, the defense and protection of assets more per, more than perhaps those people I met, for instance at Princeton who grew up as Bluebloods where money is a known quantity. It's, it's a, it's an element that for multiple generations, the family is, it has become comfortable with, um, so, uh, unless you're, if that's worth exploring, but, uh, that, that's something that I try to be very cautious or aware of because I think it's a, it's a, it's a terrible inclination that I have.

Speaker 3:          00:34:49       Wait, will, you touched on a couple of things, a couple of new concepts I've come, I've sort of wrestled with very recently and it actually made me realize who my, who my role models are going to be to your earlier question, but yeah, get light teaching at Yale for example, which is such a good institution. You know, I came into into Yale in my early forties and my excitement at being at this institution after all these years, you know, after being a person when I was 17 at the, at the college fair in Wichita, Kansas, I remember looking at the Yale table and feeling sorry for the guy who had to come to Kansas and not even going there, you know, just because I came from a family that, that, um, that you don't spend money on an ivy league education. There's, there's more practical ways to get your IB education if it wasn't an expectation.

Speaker 3:          00:35:35       But me sitting as a teacher in a class at Yale, this is very recently who's excited about being at this institution in a way that the 18 year old student isn't, you know, the 18 year old student is just relieved to be there because they've been expected to be there for years and it's a part of their socioeconomic status. Um, and they, they didn't have to go to their safety school sort of situation. Right. And so in a way that's sort of a, a gift of middle class in this is that you're not, you don't have those expectations. Nobody's going to be disappointed. Sure. You don't end up at Yale and then you can actually have this, this beginner's mind, that experience of being a 42 year old who over the moon about being a Yale professor all of a sudden. Um, and actually the other thing you asked about when you think of success, who do you think about?

Speaker 3:          00:36:22       Actually I've been really fascinated just like in the last couple of months of the stories of Dave Chapelle and John Hughes, Dave Chappelle being the comedian who had turned away 15 $50 million and society sort of said, oh, what's wrong with him? And then John Hughes, who in the 1980s made all of the best team movies ever and then just sort of disappeared to become a quiet person. And did he make home alone or am I making that up? He made home alone. He made all of those brat pack teen movies. He made hump alone or did he also make that one? He may have been involved as a screen, I might be making that up. But he had involvement with movies through the 90s and then just sort of stopped doing that altogether. Um, in the two thousands. And we, and I'm still in the process of researching this personality type because I'm really interested in the relationship that these guys have to success.

Speaker 3:          00:37:16       And they were both judges sort of harshly. And I think that these are guys who are really trying to wrestle with the idea of who they were versus who their success dictated they were supposed to be. Right. And so Dave Chappelle, we live in a society where you have to be insane to turn down $50 million. People were questioning Dave Chappelle's mental health. That was a very prominent feature of the whole discussion. Yeah. Whether or not he had gone literally insane when in fact it could have been. And again, I'm still researching these guys. That could have been a radically sane thing to do. Um, a friend of mine, Rachel cods Egon side who's a, who's a great up and coming journalists, wrote a piece, a profile of him for the believer where she went to his hometown and yellow springs and talk to his mom, yellow springs, Ohio.

Speaker 3:          00:38:05       Uh, talked to his mom who is a professor and actually ran into them in a coffee shop but sort of wanted to respect his privacy sort of thing. Right. And Dave Chappelle is a fit happy guy living on a farm in Ohio, hanging out with his friends and it feels, again, I need to do some more research, but it feels like he's a guy who decided what would make him happy and he realized that $50 million and getting locked into a show wouldn't. And similarly, John Hughes is a beloved guy. And then these are two examples there. There's other examples that one could throw in, but he was beloved for his team movies. But I think there came a point at which, especially by people of my generation, there came a point at which that he didn't want to be beholden to the breakfast club and 16 candles anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:38:50       That he, he's a family man and a, and a guy who was passionate about his creativity and I think he chose, um, being happy in a city that he loved Chicago with family members that he loved over making, you know, the breakfast club three and making another $10 million. Uh, and so while I wouldn't say while these guys didn't pop into my head as examples of success, there are guys that have sort of captured my attention because I think the, the sort of public perception of, Oh, here are these guys who have disappeared with these two examples there. These guys aren't disappeared there. They're not people who disappeared, but they, they return, they realized that they had, they had the, the structure in place to live the lives they wanted to live and they quietly have been doing that.

Speaker 2:          00:39:42       I love it. It makes me want to immediately start researching. But if you're on, if you're on the job than a, and I, given that I enjoy your writing so much, I'll probably just wait. Well actually

Speaker 3:          00:39:53       it's funny but I'm not researching it from a writing point of view. So go ahead and take it. It's just like from an intellectual point of view, you know, there were at all points that Heraclitus said, you never step into the river, the same river twice because it's a different river and your different men, and that's probably not a direct quote, but you're always trying to make sense of, of how you're living and how other people are living. And suddenly this is just a random intellectual thing that I probably wouldn't have thought about in the context of success until you brought it up. And here's two guys that I think, you know, we're crazy like foxes. You know, that that said, no thanks American idea of success. We're going to take real success. We're going to take time, wealth, and live in ways that make us happy instead of trying to, to, um, live up to artificial ideas of success. So I wouldn't actually, you can have it, Tim, and I want to read this. I want to read this book or article on the, uh, on success management, you know, management and I like it. It feels like an important topic. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:40:51       yeah, I agree. Especially because it's such a, it's such a nebulous term that I think there's a, there's a lot of insidious potential, uh, for such a heralded, pressured, nebulous term in particular. Uh, interesting. All right. I'm, I'm going to assure that seed will, we'll just sit in my head and not go away. So I might have to scratch that itch.

Speaker 3:          00:41:18       Well, I mean, if, I mean, if so many ways of looking at, at, at prospective in success, but in dental terms, we're all more successful then the kings of Europe 500 years ago, you know? Right. So there's that. The keeping up with the Joneses idea of success, you know, that comparing yourself to other people, idea of success, um, is useful to an extent, but it's also toxic. And so it's a part of this idea of success management, which is a phrase I only just now said, but it feels like it's the other half. There's a million books about how to become successful, but perhaps there's not. Perhaps the idea of how to manage one success in a, in an enrichening and in life enhancing way is something that more thought needs to be, uh, you know, addressed that topic. Definitely. Uh, well this, this is a,

Speaker 2:          00:42:10       this has been a fantastic conversation. I have just a few more questions I'd love to ask. I want to be respectful of your time, but, um, I think, uh, I'm, I'm, I am very hopeful

Speaker 3:          00:42:19       full that people will

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       enjoy this and they should definitely, um, let us know if they, if they want to round two at some point if you're up for it because this has been a blast. Uh, but the, the, uh, the questions I have. So there are a couple of rapid fire questions. Uh, you walk into a bar, what do you order from the bartender? What's, what are your, your drinks of choice or drink of choice?

Speaker 3:          00:42:43       I have turned into a, into a whiskey guy and I'm, I'm actually giving myself a little vacation from whiskey just because almost like with internet connectivity and became too easy to like have a nightcap that compromise my morning productivity and you know, being in the middle class guy, I am, you know, I love Woodford reserve and I'm talking about the bourbon, any types of whiskey, but Evan Williams black label, it makes me happy. Um, but I'm taking a little vacation from it just because it became my, you know, my booze version of the Internet where it just became unnecessary for me to be having, you know, another Evan Williams and you know, I like, I like this single malts and stuff like that too. But as far as something like I needed a freedom app for my bottle of Evelyn

Speaker 2:          00:43:34       just duct tape over the mountains. Right, exactly. Exactly. Like an anti booze pacifier. I should sell one of those.

Speaker 3:          00:43:42       And it's not, it's not alcoholism because I've been on my whiskey fast for about two weeks now and I never think about it. I just needed to get my monkey brain off of, off of my, my whiskey night cap because it was delightful and unnecessary and completely counter to my own creative life. You know, there's a very lazy, it was like checking my feast Facebook feed for the third time in 20 minutes, you know. Anyway, eventually I will return to whiskey with pleasure, but I'm on a, I'm on a little mini retirement from whiskey.

Speaker 2:          00:44:19       I, uh, I understand. I just took a, took a month off of booze entirely for similar reasons. Uh, do you have a favorite documentary or documentaries?

Speaker 3:          00:44:30       What into my head is, is Verner Hertzog grizzly man.

Speaker 2:          00:44:35       Oh boy. Have you seen this? I've, I've, no, I've heard of this. This is the one with the, uh, I think part of the reason I may have avoided it with, with a horrific, uh, epilogue if I'm not mistaken, is this, is this the same movie that, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:44:51       um, uh, the epilogue,

Speaker 2:          00:44:54       well, let me, let me rephrase that. Our, our people eaten by bears.

Speaker 3:          00:45:00       It's eccentric fellow named Timothy Treadwell who spends 13 summers, I believe it's 13 summers in Alaska with grizzly bears. And the 13th summer, he's actually eaten by a grizzly bear. And it's something, this is not a spoiler because you know that from the end of the movie. And one reason I like it is that it's such an interesting experiment in story telling. And I, and I use as an example with my students about how you infuse narratives with mystery, with the idea that you're going to get certain information later on in the narrative. And he hurts all, gives us the answer to the mystery almost immediately, which is the what, what happens? Timothy Treadwell gets eaten by a bear, but then it's like the how it gets answered, but then it's the WHO, it turns into this, who the hell is this guy who had hang out for Grizzlies for 13 summers?

Speaker 3:          00:45:46       And, and I'm not saying it's not my favorite or it's not one of my favorite documentaries from the standpoint of like sort of life changing model for how I want to live or even how I want to make a documentary. But it's such a brilliant use of narrative. Verner Herzog is just so good. Um, literally yesterday I was looking at like these spoofs of like Verner Herzog, reading, curious George, which it's just, it just killed me. It just, it was so funny if you've seen, if you've seen grizzly man with his sort of Germanic voiceover here, this spoof of him leading Kuli as George was Achilleas monkey. So it's so uncanny. Anyway, that that's sort of an aside, is that he's, he's another one of these role models of someone who is so brilliant. He is sort of an replicatable. He brilliant in the way he uses narrative.

Speaker 3:          00:46:40       And it's such a subtle and simple and brilliant way of telling the story of Timothy Treadwell, you mostly through Tim Treadwell's own video, um, that it's just, it's just a fantastic documentary and it doesn't really tie into lifestyle design, but as far as using it as a model for using found footage and existing resources for telling a really, really, um, profound story about human nature and the people who sort of go against human nature and nature itself and the assumptions of nature, it's just fantastic. And, um, yeah, a guy gets eaten by a bear, but, um, it's less macabre than you might think.

Speaker 2:          00:47:20       Uh, this is a random one, but, uh, we, we mentioned adaptation earlier. If, uh, if nick cage came to your house for dinner, what would you them?

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       Oh God. Well I'd probably, I'd probably go to all these and find some cheese brought worsts um, just because that's sort of how I roll, you know, it will be the same if you showed up at my doorstep in any number of friends or celebrities. Um, that, that's an interesting guy. And this is another complete aside, but I'm a little bit obsessed with the movie con air.

Speaker 4:          00:47:55       That requires some elaboration. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:57       Because I saw it on a bus in Syria and that movie, like if you took every, if a computer took every action movie cliche and turned it into an algorithm and spit out a movie, it would be con air, you know, with a cast full of Indy actors. I mean, Steve, who sent me is in that movie and uh, John Malcovich isn't that movie, but I watched it on a bus full of Syrians. And they didn't have any of the snarky, self-aware, judgmental, hipper than now attitude towards it. And they cheered at the end and then they cheered in the middle and as an, and that became a part of my emotional experience of Syria, which, and this has been 14 years ago, which is this amazing place. And it's become this heartbreaking place because, um, I know that the people I met there and who were so wonderful are, are living hard lives now.

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       Um, and so I want to write an essay about this at some point about my emotional relationship to con air that is somehow tied into the experience of travel along with like the helplessness of seeing what's going on in, in Syria. And sorry for this to take a serious turn, but it's one of those limitations of travel, you know, for all of the, of the beauty of humanity that I experienced in Syria, which was such a wonderful place years and years ago that I have this dumb nick cage movie tie it in to my emotional experience of the Syrian people. Oh, so

Speaker 4:          00:49:23       you should absolutely right that I think that'd be a, I think that'd be a fascinating piece, Roger that, uh, so to cheese bratwurst, that's it. Come on over. It's signed me up. Uh, what, what is the, uh, the most gifted or the few most gifted books in your life? Meaning aside from the books that you've written and of course, uh hmm. People who followed me for a while know that I've given away hundreds if not thousands of copies of AGB OnDeck. But, uh, and thank you for that. Of course. Yeah, of course. I think it's, I view it as, as a, as a must read. Of course. You know that, uh, aside from your own books, what books have you gifted to other people the most?

Speaker 3:          00:50:08       Well, you could probably guess. Um, Walt Whitman's leaves of grass. Definitely. And, and, and this is, this was especially a young adults to mid thirties gift, and this is going to sound funny, but I, I probably gave it to every woman I dated for like six to 10 years. Not because I was some sort of jaded pickup artists, but because I felt it was so true to my own, you know, you know, joyous attitude towards how I wanted life to be and just sort of the openness like this 19th century gay dude capturing these ROVs straight guy emotions towards, you know, the joy of life. And so I apologize if I sound data to my ex girlfriends, but there's a point at which that I felt so connected to that book, you know, that I would give it to people I was falling in love with, you know. Um, and so that continues to be a book that, especially for, for young people who are just sort of coming into wrestling with what's in store with them for life, leaves a rass this, this great reminder that joy and, and openness to experience and inclusivity is something that is going to, is going to be that catalyst that makes every, every experience more exciting. I love it.

Speaker 4:          00:51:30       Yeah. Any, any others? What do you, what have you been gifting to your, uh, your, your girlfriends for the last while?

Speaker 3:          00:51:38       Let me think. You know, I've, I have so many writer friends now, um, that I, I, um, like I have really good friends from my Grad school program who are poets and like you're, you have a poetry bestseller if you hell out to sell 150 books of poetry. Right? Uh, and so I've been buying a lot of poetry, uh, by my friends or even just by poets I respect simply because that one purchase and handoff is meaningful to them in a way that other people might not be. Right. And this is something we haven't touched on, but poetry is useful for non poets in the way that it uses language. You know, there's nothing more pure and distilled in a way that every single word operates in poetry. And so my friend Eli Burrell just came out with a book I'd, I've been buying that for friends. My friend Heather, Heather Dobbins comes, had a book that came out with a poetry and I think poetry is a good, and hopefully my friends who are receiving these books or reading them, it's just a good reminder about how important language is and how much you can do, um, on a single page with language. Um, and so that would be, I guess leaves. We were asked as poetry too. So somehow I'm this po prose writer who's besotted with poetry for the last 20 years. Um, that, that's a big thing too. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:52:55       definitely I need to, I need to read more poetry. I've never been much of a consumer of poetry. Partially I think because I, uh, I dealt with a lot of sort of holier than now liberal arts majors and at Princeton who seemed to imply that if I understood, if I, if I insisted on understanding the poetry, that it was, uh, above me that I was lacking the intellect or somehow if, if I couldn't appreciate what I considered

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       to be nonsensical, right. Rose that I did just, I just didn't get it. Uh, and, uh, that I think gave me a bit of an allergy to poetry that I should probably revisit. Uh, besides, uh, Walt Whitman. Any, any other poets that, uh, that you would recommend to the intrepid reader of poetry?

Speaker 3:          00:53:47       Well, I'm actually a guy who speaks most every summer in Paris is a guy named Stuart does shell. How do you spell his last name? D. I. S. S. I. S. C. H. E. L. L. It's very dude like poetry. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       I mean it's like a country song about the pickup and the dog or what are we talking about it?

Speaker 3:          00:54:07       I mean, he, he's from Jersey. He's from Atlantic city. Okay. Um, and it's not dude like in Bro, like poetry, but it's just like if, if you're, uh, you know, like a, a straight male who's encountered bigger questions in life. There's something very relatable about it. Got It. Penguin Po publishes him also a guy who was born in Kansas and he was sort of out there and his poetry is really infused with a lot of pop culture is, is Michael Robbins who wrote up a poetry book called Alien vs. Predator. That's just sort of a trip to read. In fact. Yeah. Um, it's a fun book to just read by and read out loud to your friends because there's so much. He's like using this, these strange meters and rhymes with poems about axl rose, you know, rhyming, axl rose with something else. Really interesting guy. He's also published by Penguin.

Speaker 3:          00:54:55       So those are a couple of dude poets that I think would be accessible or at least appealing to people who aren't usually vested in poetry. Um, Billy Collins being another example. These are all men. Actually. There's a woman named aiming at Duke who Motl. Um, in easy, h, u k. You, m. A, t. I, T. I l, great woman. I've spoken with her at a, at a writing and environment con conference and very accessible and beautiful poetry. Um, one recommend mandation. I might have people for people who are interested in poetry, which I would imagine for your and my audience, both is maybe not a huge priority of people who will read our books. Right? Um, just get an, get an edition of best American poetry any, anytime in the last 20 years. And read through the palms and the ones that you don't like, forget about them and the ones that are appealing, find other poems by those authors. Um, and that's how I've found some of some of my favorite poets.

Speaker 2:          00:55:49       That's great advice. And I, I just wanted to raise also one other poet and I've, I've, and this is, this is one of the rare poets you broke through my PR, probably unfounded bias against poetry. Uh, Naomi Shihab Nye, uh, a s, h, I h a, B and y e two words. Um, her father is a Palestinian refugee and just a really enjoyed, have enjoyed her poetry and kept it quiet. This is so stupid, but it just goes to show how early bruising can affect how you behave as a supposedly mature adult. Uh, right. Uh, I, I enjoy her poetry because I understand it. It's beautifully written, but I, I get it, there's sort of a, a message being conveyed or a point or a description of something concrete. And, uh, I suppose I was based on the, uh, sort of condescending, uh, lectures that I would get from people at Princeton who were probably very similar to the guy in the bar in goodwill hunting, who's reciting, uh, you know, right. Plagiarized classics. Uh, just like imagine that dickhead and multiply it by a couple of hundred people up. I guess I've never really talked about it. But Naomi, she have NY, uh, is a poet that I've, I've come to really appreciate. Uh, so I need to, I need to read more poetry. I'm glad that you were sort of lighting of lighting a fire for that

Speaker 3:          00:57:21       and those poets are out there. A major Jackson is another guy edited, cursing me, African American guy from Philly, um, who actually taught at the MFA program. I didn't study poetry, but he was there. Great Guy. Um, and, and you know, for every completely abstract poem that's playing with language in a way that is almost meant to be pretentious, you have Porphyria, it's very soulful and accessible and great. Um, and uh, people might bag, well people deeply voice, vested in poetry. My bag on the accessible stuff, but there's a lot of it out there and again, the best American series or other anthologies might be a good way to find it. Or even just going to poetry daily and ignoring the poems that seem completely inaccessible and following up on poems that seemed to really be, um, delivering something relatable. Donald Hall is another great one. He's, he's in, he's pushing 90 now, but he's a wonderful, wonderful poet based up in New England.

Speaker 2:          00:58:14       Well, Ralph, I want people to, uh, to continue exploring your thoughts. How can they, what is the best way for them to, to learn more about you, find you online, et cetera.

Speaker 3:          00:58:28       Uh, my author website is [inaudible] Dot Com uh, that links to all aspects of my travel writing career and also my career as a journalist and an essayist if they want to know more about vagabonding hey, they can buy the book. They can also go to vagabonding.net which I can, we should probably remind them, has resources that go in tandem with the vagabonding audio book that you published and are also more updated than the print book that came out, uh, 11 years ago. So vagabonding.net/resources will allow you to, to follow up in a lot of the stuff that we've talked about today, a lot of these websites like boots and all. And then finally, anyone interested in my Paris a course which takes place in the month of July and every summer is Paris writing workshop.com, um, which is also linked from, uh, my author websites with Paris writing workshop.com. We'll give you all the basics about that. And Twitter is at Rolf Potts. So a many ways to find me.

Speaker 2:          00:59:23       And that is Ralph with an f, uh, for those people who might be wondering what the spelling is with an o and an app with an o and an f in an R and a couple of tees as well. Yeah. So Rolf Potts and a few folks who, uh, are interested in the, the book club. So I do have a book club and vagabonding was the very first book I used to launch that book club. And a, you can hear a sample of the audio book and a and check it out@audible.com forward slash Tim's books. So you can, you can, you can get a, get a scope on some of the books that have had a huge impact on my life and I'll, I'll thank you once again are off because vagabonding certainly hit me at a very important time in my life where I could have gone many different directions and I feel like it steered me in a very positive direction. And if I hadn't read vagabonding quite frankly, I don't know if the four hour workweek ever would have been written. So, uh, so thank you once again for, uh, for having that impact on me and many, many thousands of other people as well.

Speaker 3:          01:00:25       Well, I appreciate it that and I appreciate you championing the book too, that I've really, it's really gotten to people who may not have found me otherwise. So it's a great synergy happening there

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       for sure. And I will continue to champion it. So Raul, thank you so much for the time and uh, I would love to continue this sometime, uh, when you're, when you're available, uh, and uh, and uh, not taking a sabbatical from, from electronics.
