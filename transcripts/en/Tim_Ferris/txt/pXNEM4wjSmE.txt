Speaker 2:          00:01:31       Hello Ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss, otherwise known as Faye you tongue, but I'm not going to ask you to call me that. And this is another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where my job is to deconstruct world class performers or teachers, oftentimes both in many different areas and that could range from chess to sports to acting, to government, to military. And this time we have an incredible meditative thinker and teacher, uh, specifically in the Buddhist tradition. So Tara Brock, I have been looking forward to speaking with Tara for many, many, many months. Tara is a phd in clinical psychology and one of the leading teachers of Buddhist thinking and meditation in the Western World. She is the founder of the insight meditation community in Washington DC. And her lectures, which are fantastic. Our downloaded hundreds of thousands of times every month. I was first introduced to Tara's work by another guest on this podcast, Maria Popova, who's amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       You should listen to her episode as well. Soon thereafter, looked like the universe was conspiring. A friend who's also a neuroscience PhD recommended her book radical acceptance. She claimed it was life changing and all of my red flags went up and it ended up exceeding all expectations. It really had a profound impact on my life. So it's my hope that this tactical conversation offers you techniques for addressing all sorts of issues ranging from loneliness, anger, hatred, the quote trance of unworthiness and quote and much more, uh, Tara has had a meaningful impact on my life. And of course I wish the same for you. That's why I invited her to pee on the podcast. And for those of you who know my fondness for stoic philosophy, I think Tara's work and certain facets of Buddhism in fact are a fantastic complement to all of my talking and reading about Seneca, Marcus Aurelius and the other favorites. So without further ado, please enjoy a conversation that I really enjoyed and a wide ranging romp across all sorts of subjects and topics with Tara Brock. Tara, welcome to the show.

Speaker 3:          00:03:44       I'm delighted to be with you, Tim

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       and I am having a bit of Deja Vu all over again is a one very wise man. Once said, because I've heard so many of your guided meditations, it's surreal to be talking to you live. I do. Do you get that a lot? Do you had, do you have people come up to you and have to do a double take with your voice or people recognize you in restaurants because they've heard your guided meditations?

Speaker 3:          00:04:09       Yeah. That and they'll say, oh, you look so much littler than I thought and then I'll start speaking and they'll go into a kind of hypnotic trance.

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       I've been introduced to you through many different people and eventually almost in the same way that meditation kind of knocked on my door until I finally answered. Uh, Maria Popova who runs a site called brain pickings is just just one of my favorite people and brought you up on this podcast. In fact, and then a number of my other friends, a friend named Olivia who also brought you up and it just got to the point where specifically, uh, your guided meditations and radical acceptance head been introduced into my, my life or my slipstream my consciousness. So many different ways. I felt like perhaps it was time for me to sit down and take a look at things at. So first off, I wanted to just thank you for the work that you do because it's had a very positive impact on my life and based on the response of my audience on many people who are likely listening to this, this interview. So first off, I just wanted to thank you for that.

Speaker 3:          00:05:23       Thank you. I appreciate hearing it and it's very neutral, but I won't go there right this moment, but thank you for how much you're, what you're doing ripples out. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:34       It's just every everyday. Yeah. Slogging along in my own way, although if people could see it, sometimes I think how the sausage is made. I, uh, I, I not so much worry, but part of the reason I, I usually decline journalists want to follow me around for three to five days. I'm like, you might be envisioning something that is very different from my reality. I think you see me like snowboarding in the Alps and then taking, uh, taking some type of zip line, like into a bathtub where I'm reciting poetry or whatever the image might be. I have no idea what the images, I'm like most of the time it looks like I'm just sitting there, I know can be awful ordinary from the inside out. Extraordinary pose. So I was, I was hoping we might start, uh, where, uh, where, where things began, uh, and to rewind the clock a little bit and just give people a retrospective of how you got to, to the point where you're teaching Buddhist meditation and mindfulness and so on. Um, and I have a little bit of the background from radical acceptance and having read that, but for those people who were unfamiliar with your work, maybe you could give just a brief, uh, a brief overview of your background. But I think that'd be a helpful place to start. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:06:55       Sure. Well, if I go back, you know, more to the teams, you know, I was completely, I remember when I first went to a class on comparative religion and you know, we've got a whole mess of them introduced. And I decided that Buddhism was at the very bottom of my list because it just like, you know, why would I want to give up desire? I was a total heat and nest and I love my desires, you know, whether it was, you know, nature and athletics or drugs or sex or parties, you know, it's like, why give up desire? And it wasn't, it was about another five years until I got it. But that wasn't the message. It wasn't give up desire. It was, you know, not be, not have that desire to be a tyrant over your life, you know, not be possessed. But, so I, I was, uh, you know, just a thrill seeking and also type A, kind of a, uh, teen, very hardworking and hard playing.

Speaker 2:          00:07:57       And where was this?

Speaker 3:          00:07:59       I grew up in Montclair, New Jersey and a, which we all called the hub of the universe because it seemed like the center of everything. And then I went into college thinking I was going to be a lawyer and when I graduated I moved right into an Ashram. So something happened in there.

Speaker 2:          00:08:18       Nothing happened. I'm so curious. I mean, what triggered that? Was it a conversation, their particular movie or book? I mean, how did you go from preparing to be a lawyer to going to an Ashram?

Speaker 3:          00:08:31       Well, I got, there are a number of influence as part of, it's the times, you know, I, I went to college and it was, um, social activism and I was very antiwar, very involved with left wing politics and the kinds of, the Combo of that with, um, psychedelics combined with, uh, just the whole, you know, coming to the east east, coming to the west and introducing yoga. I began to do yoga in my junior or senior year in college. And my reality shifted. Tim, you know, it's like, um, I was still, I had a, I've always had an interest in, uh, you know, learning and academics to some degree, but I was like, I was passionate about discovering, you know, what is the nature of the universe, what is reality? And I've always fascinated the psyche, like how do these minds work? So I knew that somehow I knew, I just had kind of had to give myself to that.

Speaker 3:          00:09:30       So when I graduated, um, I went to what's called the summer solstice gathering. It was a big yoga meditation gathering and there was just this experience that, um, there was a mystery that was so much bigger than the world that I normally lived in, that that was the thing to commit myself to. So I really literally went from college right into an Ashram community and Ashrams, uh, for those that are, are listening, I don't know, it's a, it's a spiritual community where practice yoga and meditation, we'd get up at three 30 in the morning and start with a cold shower as the first beginning of the day was just getting into it, cold shower. And then doing a lot of very vigorous yoga and chanting and meditation and you know, after a few hours I identified the day feeling, uh, just absolutely ablaze with, you know, both energy and also very, very peaceful and happy. And then during the day, because, you know, I carried all my type a stuff into Osram list, I would either just, I was kind of, Oh, you know, we're a pretty driven Yogi player.

Speaker 3:          00:10:49       You've got it. It's amazing. We all, we do that. We, I've seen pretty much everyone I know get into spiritual life or spiritual practice, but bring all their normal egoic neurotic stuff into it. So I did that and I, I remember, I mean we all have different ways of doing it. For me, I had this idea that if I worked really hard at it, I could get enlightened and six or seven years and I have no idea where I got that number. That was my, you know, I just kinda figured I really throw myself in. And so I would sometimes go to different teachers and say, well, so what else can I do? Cause you know, I was a pretty, you know, I was going at it like as a group, we would get up at three 30 in the morning, but I'd often get up at two 30 so I can get a little extra. And, and, and I don't say this by the way, with pride. I mean, I was, you know, I've, I've learned since then, but, um, so I'd asked this question, you know, what else can I do? And to a tee, the response would be just relax. And then I go, oh, just relax. And that would become my next, you know, practice. No, it's, I'm going to do this now.

Speaker 2:          00:12:05       You're going to wake up 30 minutes earlier to relax.

Speaker 3:          00:12:09       Exactly. Right. Exactly right. It's like race, race, race to get there and wait. But, you know. Anyway, so that was kind of, um, those were my earliest years in the Ashram. I was pretty driven and trying really hard to purify and become a better person. And, um, you know, I got drawn both because I intuited, you know, this, this mystery and two did a kind of love that really was possible to and have it in an express and an awareness that was very vast. And I also was drawn because I wanted to become a better person and I, I spent a lot of my earlier years feeling like I wasn't enough, I needed to be better. So it was also kind of a hot self improvement project at the same time.

Speaker 2:          00:13:03       How did you feel you weren't good enough? Or what were the things you hoped to improve?

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       Well,

Speaker 2:          00:13:13       cause I'm a head case about this stuff, so this is not a, this is not me talking down. Um, in any way. I, I struggle with a lot of these, uh, I think issues. So I'm asking this as much for myself as anyone else.

Speaker 3:          00:13:28       Yeah, yeah. Well, um, I've come to call it the trance of unworthiness in retrospect. Um, and I, I, I like talking about it cause I, I feel like most everyone, I know it's, it feels like a pervasive suffering in our culture that we have this sense that we should be better, that we're, you know, there's a, there's a cartoon I love with this dog on a psychiatrist's couch. Anything, it's always good dog this and good dog that, but is it ever great dog?

Speaker 3:          00:14:04       It does, doesn't it? Yeah. So, so, um, I text her myself. I was, um, I think the biggest areas of feeling unworthy or not good enough was a sense of being selfish or self centered. Like in some way my own needs come first. Then also ceiling. I remember in high school and first years of college being out of control with my eating and feeling overweight and being really, really ashamed of that. So I felt that was, you know, something is wrong with me there. And then I just in some way was falling short, whether it was as a friend or a daughter or whatever. And I had a lot of insecurity about and I would just very driven to seek. And so I could see the different ways that it played out. But, um, it was definitely the core sense of I'm not good enough.

Speaker 3:          00:15:01       And that, that really became the seed of writing radical acceptance was both through my own experience of not enough. And then as a psychologist and as a spiritual teacher, just seeing the torment, like how many people are not able to enjoy their moments. Cause in some way there's a sense of something's wrong. And I'll share with you one story that really hit me. Um, and I think it's in radical acceptance of a woman who was in a coma and her daughter was by her daughter told me this story and she was dying. And at one point she, her kind of eyes bolted open and she looked at her daughter in the eye and said, you know, all my life, I thought something was wrong with me. And then she closed her eyes and that was it. That was her last word. She, she died after that.

Speaker 3:          00:16:03       And for my friends for this young, for the woman, it was kind of a parting gift because she realized just how, um, how sad it is to spend so many moments at war with ourselves. And, and, and part of when I teach about the trance of unworthiness, we can start to see how, if we're really not trusting ourselves, if we're filled with self doubt, it's very hard to feel intimate with other people. Um, there's always a sense that, yeah, it's like they'll find out. It's like if I'm right now talking to you and I feel like there's this core deficiency, it means I won't be able to be spontaneous or, you know, respond with tenderness. It's like there's always a defendant mess. So anyway, that's a long way around saying that, that that became very clear to me. Um, and, and you know, at the end of college and then beginning of living in an ashram that, that I really wanted to, in some way, I needed to be friend myself. That became a very clear thing. It wasn't, it wasn't just a psychological thing. It's very much a part of spiritual awakening that I, that I needed to really be friend. This life.

Speaker 2:          00:17:22       When you were having this Ostrom experience, when did things change? When did you leave the room?

Speaker 3:          00:17:29       You know, I was the Ashram, the strengths and the positive aspects where, you know, it made it very easily to have a very regular strong practice. And you had, the Nice thing about having group of people, and I really recommend this to all of us, is that it's, you know, to periodically be able to practice with other people and exchange what's going on. That sense of community can keep on nourishing and, and enlivening, uh, what's going on in terms of awakening. And the Ashram had a lot of rigidity to it. Tim, it was, you know, I joined when I was 21 and I came from this very kind of liberal background. I was very independent and yet I joined something that had quite a hierarchy. It was very patriarchal. It was really very different from what I would have thought for myself. And gradually those qualities as the kind of rigidity just made it. So I needed to continue on the spiritual path, but not inside the mushroom environment. So I laughed. Right. Um, I left, I stayed for 10 years and I had an arranged marriage. Is that something that's not so difficult in the last, you know, I too have, you know, had all the normal learning to, you know, fall in love and prince in shining armor and get married and instead I, you know, I was assigned to my husband and, um, um, I don't know if I should speed over that one or not.

Speaker 2:          00:19:02       Uh, you know, we might, I might come back to that. You can please continue and then we might come back to that. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:19:10       Um, so, you know, so I went along with a lot of stuff because, you know, again, I was having very intense altered states of experience that were very lovely and it's learned to concentrate my mind and you know, had a lot of devotional experiences and so on, but the, but the structure and the authoritarianism of the, of the community got to me. And, um, so, so I left after 10 years and, um, and then right after leaving got pregnant and had my son Ryan

Speaker 2:          00:19:49       and is, if you wouldn't mind that them, there's one particular story about the honest truth. I mean this, this, this being called out, uh, Oh yeah, group setting that I think, I mean it really struck me as a turning point perhaps where, uh, an important event at the very least, if you wouldn't mind describing that. Uh, yeah. Add some context as well.

Speaker 3:          00:20:16       Sure, sure. Um, yeah. Are, I had been trying to get pregnant, you know, and, and really eager to have a child. And I finally got pregnant and I went to a gathering, you know, we, we would gather for about a month in the mountains. And I remember it was very, very hot and it was very rigorous activity at our, our gatherings. And I miscarried. And so I wrote a note to the spiritual leader of the community, um, and, and basically said, you know, we might want to warn some people that if you're pregnant this, you're in this kind of heat and this, you know, it might not be a good idea. And I think that that must have made him feel like I was saying, well, your teaching something about your teachings caused me to Miss Kerrick. And which of course was saying, but, but I was in a group of several hundred people when he had me stand up and he said, you know, you're trying to blame your miscarriage on such and such and you miscarried because of your ego.

Speaker 3:          00:21:24       And he was very, it was very crude and very, it was abusive. It was an abusive behavior to here I was two days after a miscarriage too. Um, you know, have me in that vulnerable a place, uh, be rated and that way. And so that, and I'm glad you brought it up because that, you know, I had already had a lot of misgivings about Ostrom living, but his behavior made it utterly clear to me that, you know, I couldn't be part of something where the leader with treat people in an abusive way. And interestingly, I have had no abuse or trauma on that of any real sort in my history. I think if I had already been an abused person and I'd already had trauma in my nervous system, that it would have been much more difficult for me to process that. But as it happened, um, after that experience for the hours after it, I remember going into a little, um, kind of a chapel and, and crying deeply, you know, the humiliation of it, the pain of it, heard of it, that kind of the betrayal.

Speaker 3:          00:22:38       Like how could somebody, I'd kind of trusted, do that. And then I got to a place where either I became very clear to me that either I was going to in some way believe that he knew something and use it against myself, or I was going to absolutely get behind myself in the sense of really dedicate to embracing myself, not to buy into some badness because it could've easily played into the trance of unworthiness. It could have been, it could have been the killer, could have been the nail to the coffin. And, but what it made clear to me is that I really want, you know, that it was intrinsic to the spiritual path to trust and embrace the life that's here. And that doesn't mean to him that I felt like I, my ego, that I was, you know, ego free and that I didn't make mistakes. And you know, I mean I'm, I'm very, very aware of all my imperfections. It more meant that on some fundamental level was going to trust my goodness. And so it was a turning point because it was after that betrayal that I chose to really, I really committed myself to accepting myself as I was. And, um, since then I ran into this a quote from Carl Rogers who says, you know, it wasn't until I accepted myself just as I was that I was free to change.

Speaker 2:          00:24:16       I'm glad you brought that up. I was actually going to bring up that exact quote. Oh really? And we'll get to that just because I've found it very challenging and I've talked to many friends about this, the balancing of acceptance versus productivity or the acceptance versus being proactive. And we'll come back to that because I know this is something you've thought about before, but uh, the Ostrom then at that point is, is a closed chapter of sorts. So you embrace, decide to do what many people perhaps would not have done because of their background or circumstances, which is really sad. And you see this a lot in closed communities, but you took the path of sort of accepting, trying to accept yourself as opposed to accept this a negative version of yourself that had been reinforced by this, this leader at that point. Where did you go with your, your studying and end or your teaching?

Speaker 3:          00:25:19       I left. I had been doing a lot of teaching while I was in the Ashram, Yoga and meditation. And I laughed and got very drawn. My meditation kind of started shifting and I got very drawn to Buddhist meditation, which interestingly is, if you think of a lot of the yoga meditations is a very, um, very much of a training and concentration. And I, I suspect we'll get more into the different kinds of meditation as we speak, but it, it can really allow you to quiet the mind and settle the mind and, and have access to experiences of a lot of peace. And, um, it's, it can be very, very, uh, very profoundly pleasurable. And the, and I love that, but what it didn't teach me was mindfulness, which was really how to open up into the present moment with a, with a very kind of profound quality of just simple acceptance and presence to really notice what's going on right here. So I got drawn to Buddhism because that, that capacity for mindful presence, uh, became more and more what drew me. So after I left the Ashram, I started reading and then going to retreats. Um, that were, that were Buddhist meditation retreats and they also had a child. So it was, I was juggling juggling a few different worlds there, but they came together. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:26:56       And since I promise to come back to it and arranged marriage, I'd like to talk about this because, and I want to hear your thoughts on a couple of things, but uh, so I've had conversations half jokingly, not totally jokingly with friends who are say Indian and who have friends, who've had arranged marriages and some of these, these friends live in say New York City and they have this paradox of choice conundrum where whoever they're dating however smart or attractive or kind and so on, they might be, they are passing so many people in the street that they worry might be just a little more attractive, a little more of this, a little more that, that they hop from one person to the next to the next to the next in relationships. And they will, if I have a few drinks with them, sometimes they'll joke, you know, it'd be a lot easier if I just had an arranged marriage because it would take the decision making out of it on some level. Or you know, perhaps my parents could say, not this is the one person, but here are the five people you have to choose from. They're all really great people. Take your pick. And I, I'd just love to hear how your arranged marriage was arranged. Like what, what were the criteria? How will, how were you two paired and just your general thoughts on, uh, on that entire experience.

Speaker 3:          00:28:19       Yeah. So maybe just to make a broader comment that, you know, for some people from some traditions, it may well be that, you know, given a handful of people that there may be somebody in that handful that it really does work better for them. And so it's Mrs not like a judgment that culturally this is a bad, a bad ritual, you know. But, um, and in this particular case, um, it happened, I'd say a good number of times, maybe three quarters of the marriages of the, you know, we were all in our twenties when we first joined the ash from were arranged by the head of the whole organization. And, um, and, and so mine was, and it was not done by any criteria that any of us could ever think of. It was very much that, um, he, there was a, a man who lived in Canada and needed his green card.

Speaker 3:          00:29:19       That's what it was. And they want to end, he was part of our larger community and they wanted him to be able to move into the country and get a green card. And so they were looking for somebody to match them with and they knew I was single and they, they made the arrangement for me not only to marry him, but I had to leave where I was living, which was Boston and come down to, so it was, it seemed in my mind to be absolutely this crazy groundless pairing. I couldn't imagine. I mean, it was just so far from what I ever imagined for myself. And when I met him, he was a perfectly nice person, but very, very far from anybody. I would have naturally in my own choosing have picked as a mate. So it was, it was really, really rough. I was very upset by it.

Speaker 3:          00:30:12       I pleaded not to have to do it. And ultimately it was my sense that well to be dedicated to this path means to be, to go along with this. That was somehow or rather how my mind construed at that I needed to surrender. I needed to surrender my wants and, and just do it. And I'm still, and I can say right now and my current state of mind kind of astonished that I would have viewed it that way because as I say, I came up from a very, I came at a pretty independent thinking people, but that's what happened. And I married him and it turned out that he was, as I said, a very, uh, you know, a wonderful, wonderful human and he considered continues to be a dear friend and brother. I mean, he really is. He's very, we're very much, we had a child together. We, even though we divorced, we co-parented and we're good friends. And I think Tim, that, you know, part of it is because we didn't fall in love in a romantic way when we decided to divorce. There wasn't the kind of um, painful tearing apart that brings up so much, you know, anger and census of betrayal and so on. We were able to, we were able to move on together.

Speaker 2:          00:31:34       Yeah, you didn't have the right word, but you didn't have that. A lot of the components that create the complexity and sort of, I suppose one could say to irrational anger and exaggerated, uh, anger directed at the other person just didn't exist.

Speaker 3:          00:31:53       Exactly. I mean, the more attachment there is, the more the fallen that when we come apart, the more, you know, pain and, and feeling of, you know, vengefulness and everything flies up. So no, it didn't have that.

Speaker 2:          00:32:06       So I'd love to talk about meditation and mindfulness and we'll get to that looking at the different types of meditation. But I'd love to ask you a couple of questions that are just on my mind right now. So you mentioned enjoying the d, The desires, the sex, the drugs, the this, the that, which all sounds pretty fun quite frankly. Uh, is it possible to be a mindful hedonist? And if so, is that a bad thing?

Speaker 3:          00:32:38       Mindful sheepness

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       that should be my next one. Fuck. I like it.

Speaker 3:          00:32:46       I think it's possible to take tremendous pleasure in this world. In fact, you know, when one teacher says, why six sate your desire on one thing, I'm not just desire it all. And, and the more we're in that kind of receptivity where there's just an amazing appreciation for the simplest things for everything. Um, actually there's a lot of freedom in that because there's not a lot of clenching and holding on and having to control where the idea of mindful hedonism could fall on its face is if we become attached to the particular current, if he didn't as him being a certain way. So, you know, if we become attached to always having a certain food and then it, and then we ended up getting addicted or we get attached to a certain chemical substance and it then becomes harmful for our body or we take hedonistic pleasure and dealing with one person sexually, but then it turns out that it doesn't work out with that person. So if you see what I mean when there's attachment and it's a tight holding, it actually causes a sunburn.

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       Totally, totally agreed. I have a friend who uses hedonistic as this. He says it was the sort of bitter cutting edge to his voice is a very close friend. I won't name them, but I think that it's, it's a, it's kind of got a bad rap. I mean, not to say that, uh, that everyone should aspire to be. He knows. But I think that there's a, also, from, from my own experience at least, and just looking at modern technologically enabled culture, there is a, there appears to be a disconnect, uh, where a lot of human beings do not know how to enjoy a sensual pleasures. And by that I don't mean purely sex. Like they don't, they don't, they don't feel at home in their own bodies. They don't walk around barefoot. They don't have these types of sensory experiences that it can be so rich.

Speaker 2:          00:34:52       Uh, and uh, that's, I feel like the baby just kind of gets thrown out with the bath water a lot. And I'd be curious to hear how you might recommend someone experience pleasures without developing a harmful attachments. For instance, before we started recording, I was chatting with you a little bit about fasting and, uh, I've been experimenting with fasting partially just to prove to myself that I am self sufficient and conserved five fasting. I mean, it's a very, it's been a very empowering experience for me. And, uh, similarly I did an experiment with my audience a few months ago, um, called Knob nom, which I got a lot of grief for, but it meant a no booze, no masturbation for 30 days. And so we had about 10,000 people do this experiment and it was very empowering for everyone involved. Even those who didn't make it the full 30 days. But aside from these intermittent periods of abstinence sees experiments. So there are other ways or practices that help someone not develop attachment to uh, I suppose anything but certain pleasures certainly would fall in that category.

Speaker 3:          00:36:09       Yeah, it's, it's a wonderful question because really if we look at our lives, um, where they're suffering, if we're not happy and if we're not at home, it's really because of the sense of I want things different. I want more. There's not enough here. And that's attachments. Like I have to have more. It's have to have feeling. And so, um, my experience is that the more we actually are in the moment and in the census, like right here, right now, the more we decondition grasping. So the very training of cause this grass when it comes, like you have something and then you have the idea that you need to have more to be happy. But if you actually let go of the idea and just experience directly, contact the center, the pleasure in the moment, and just notice that. And then if there's this arising of a sense of wanting more, you just notice that and then you come back right to your body.

Speaker 3:          00:37:17       Again. It's staying in the moment that actually interrupts the chain reaction that leads to grasping on to things. But that takes practice them. I mean it's like for most people, as soon as we have the first few spoons of ice cream, um, it's kind of like we forget and we just spoon it in and we don't taste until at the end there's something lingering and then we have to have more. And there's already, we're already leaning into the future. So to stay with each bite, there's actually a fulfillment in it and we don't go down that track of having to have.

Speaker 2:          00:38:00       Right. And it's, it's, uh, I'm glad you mentioned the, the eating. Um, my girlfriend has done, as I mentioned before, we get started, a massive fan of yours, uh, has done quite a bit with women with eating disorders. And I know you spent a lot of time thinking about this, but she's had a lot of success with her past clients simply saying, you're allowed to eat whatever you want to eat, but you have to really enjoy it and focus on the experience of eating that food. And just by not forcing, but facilitating that. A lot of those people didn't go on autopilot and consume the 12th scoops instead of one, for instance. And, uh, the, the, um, she's trying to stop me from drinking wine last night and she said, you're allowed to have another glass, but I want you to think about it. At first I was like, oh, you got me.

Speaker 2:          00:38:54       Uh, anyway, but the, uh, it was a very nice sons here in, in, in my defense. But the, yeah, I'm, I'm getting, I'm going off the rails here. Let me, let me steer my, my, uh, my thinking back on track. Um, one of the challenges that I have is, uh, for instance, anger. Uh, this is, I've, I've been rewarded in life for a lot of, I feel, uh, aggression, sort of bull in a China shop type of, uh, aggression sounds very, has a negative connotation, but being, being very, very proactive with trying to accomplish the things that I set out before me, whatever those things might be. And a, maybe a side effect of that is a lot of anger directed at myself directed at other people. And I'd love for you to talk about it. This was, this was something that I just really, when I talk about radical acceptance, this is one of the examples I bring up, or one of the stories. Could you talk about Maura and inviting Mara to tea?

Speaker 3:          00:40:01       I'd love to be, can I ask you a question about the anger? Sure. Yeah. Do you feel like it causes you suffering? And if so, how do you notice it as suffering? Because I get that you've gotten rewards for aggression.

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       Yeah. Uh, and, and I'm not, the answer is yes, absolutely suffering, which is part of the reason that, that I finally started attempting to meditate regularly and I've done a fairly good job, uh, was because I recognize the suffering was not, not only undesirable on so many levels, but unsustainable. I mean, it was, it was, uh, and I'm not the person who came up with this, this was analogy, but, uh, the, you know, the acid hurts the vessel that is storing it more than anything that it happens to be poured upon. And I was just carrying around this acid all the time and I recognized it wasn't, it wasn't a sustainable, um, it wasn't sustainable in any way. So yes, definitely suffering. Uh, I'm never good enough for myself ever. Uh, for instance, I mean, I end, and this is, this is where I have so much trouble because I won't mention names here, but for I'll give you just the type of anecdote that on one hand people could say is ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:41:18       On the other hand, I really enjoy, and maybe this is, you can read into my pathology here. Uh, so there, there, there's a very famous tech entrepreneur who is a billionaire several times over and he was playing chess with a very well known competitor. One point and this billionaire lost. And he stood up and swiped all the pieces off the board and kind of stormed off. And the other guy said, wow, you're really, you're really bad at losing. And he said, show me a good loser and I'll show you a fucking loser. And now that's a very, uh, that's a very exaggerated example perhaps. But I mean, if you look at some of my favorite movies, right? Like miracle, which is a Disney movie, but it's amazing. It's about the, the US hockey team when they, they were the, I think expected to be number 16th or 17th and made it all the way to the gold medal match against the Soviets, who at the time were thought to be invincible.

Speaker 2:          00:42:14       And just the, the, the extreme nature of the training and the pushing and how hard they had to push to even make that remotely possible is attractive to me. Right? And so as a competitor, and I'm going on a little long winded it bit here, but I was always taught and in fact maybe I just taught myself that like second place is first loser, right? Like I would rather be last place than second place because second place means you tried really, really, really, really hard but just not hard enough. You, you tried like 2% less than the person who got the gold metal metal and no one remembers the silver medalist ever. So

Speaker 3:          00:42:54       let me ask you a question about that then. If you had a step back and look at your life, what is the most important place that you would want to win a gold medal? I mean, if you really think at the end of your life, looking back, if you could be the very best in something, it's just like what? What do you most want to be best at?

Speaker 2:          00:43:16       I would say, um, creating learners who are better than I am. And if I do that, I feel like I can create a benevolent army of part you tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of world class teachers and that just self replicates. So I think that would be the answer one. I know we're bouncing around here, but it's okay. The one of the, when I started meditating regularly for the first time, it was only because I had two people I could identify with recommended to me when I was really in a very to dark places. So one was chase Jarvis, who's a world class photographer. He's been on this podcast and other was Rick Rubin, legendary music producer who also has been on this podcast. And in this particular case, and we'll get into the different types of meditation. They said, why don't you try TM? Okay, so transcendental meditation and because these two guys did not strike me as very woo woo or overly detached from the stresses I faced, does that make sense?

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       Like they were negotiating contracts, they were dealing with difficult people. They were really on the front lines of their own respective wars. If you want to look at it that way. And so I was like, okay, if they're recommending this thing that I've kind of discarded as a not a fit for me. Right. I, I've, I've always shied away from using the word spiritual for instance. But because it came from these two people, I decided to give it a shot. The, and then I started seeing the benefits of meditation. I mean, even if I just looked at it through the lens of my type a personality full of ambition and Piss and vinegar and self flagellation, I was like, if I meditate in the morning, I get more done with less stress and others less flailing. So for that reason, for that reason alone, I don't meditate.

Speaker 2:          00:45:23       Right. Uh, and then I remember getting to a point after meditating for the first time ever in my life consistently for about, I don't know, let's, let's call it two weeks. I was, I was on a road trip with a friend of mine who had had a very similar experience and, and uh, she asked me, do you ever worry that you're getting to chill, that you are losing your edge, that you're not doing things you should, you should because you're too accepting of whatever happens as being, okay. Uh, so I struggled with that. I know we're, we're, uh, we're digging in here, but, uh, that, that balancing of enjoying the benefits of meditation and how much I would say happier I am and how much more content I am when I meditate regularly with the nagging concern that perhaps I've taken it too far and I'm, I've just become lackadaisical or complacent.

Speaker 2:          00:46:32       And when I talk to my friends who are like world class performers, type a personalities, they all have this kind of this concern, right? Like what if I lose my edge? Right? Like, what if I lose the thing that has allowed me to be the top, you know, in the top 5% in my field as opposed to an also ran. And I mean, I just love to hear your thoughts on that because this is something that, uh, that, uh, it hasn't stopped me from meditating because I feel like it, that's my medication on some level too, to keep me from not being a huge pain in the ass to myself and everyone around.

Speaker 3:          00:47:08       Well, how about this? Here's the way that I think is that I like to frame it is that meditation is evolution strategy to bring out our full potential.

Speaker 2:          00:47:24       Well, I like that. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:26       And just the way we know we need to still exercise to maximize our body's health, we need to mentally trained too. And so meditation's very broad. You know, there are many different kinds of meditations, but a training of the, I'll call it the heart mind, really what it does in a very specific way. This is what research is showing is it activates a part of the frontal cortex where there's kind of neurocircuitry that really has to do with, um, being able to have a larger perspective, being able to have better executive functioning, being able to have more empathy, being able to have more compassion. And it started evolving in the human species. You know, we, it's what led us form tribes and be able to start collaborating more. And it's a collaboration that's actually allowed us to have the greatest of the scientific kind of breakthroughs and so on.

Speaker 3:          00:48:21       So if you look at it, and then in terms of evolutionary development, both your own evolution and also as a species, the more that we learn to direct our attention, the more we have access to what's called like a whole brain thinking, where we really can be creative, where we really can be spontaneous. We, it's almost like it evolves. So this past the identification with a separate cell into something more whole. And I think often of all this actually describes this reducing valve of awareness where in the EGOIC state the mind just takes in the information so we can, you know, survive and do our, our daily functions. And it, it kind of blocks out a lot of the vast mysteries of the universe. And as we meditate that reducing valve doesn't reduce so much. So we actually have more of the flow of a kind of universal intelligence. And creativity that moves through us. So I do think of it that this training actually can allow us to access our greatest potential. Now here's a couple of pieces to it that in the egoic state, dominance and competition are really the way to a flourishing.

Speaker 4:          00:49:38       And so those people not familiar with the term, the EGOIC state, it's just the focus on I

Speaker 3:          00:49:43       yes, yes it did. It's very self focused so that we're doing things so that we can, um, I can be the basket, I want to be recognized because I want to be special because I'm an important person. So it's that kind of thing.

Speaker 4:          00:49:57       Sounds like my writing. I'm kidding. And

Speaker 3:          00:50:02       when you think of the moments when you're happiest, it may give you an, we might get an initial rush of chemicals when we feel personally recognize and personally the baster. I know I wrote in my most recent book, my special person complex. You know, where I get caught and you know, feeling important in some way. And yet that's not when we're happiest. In fact, you know, the way that you can sense and an evolutionary way. So we are as a species learning to identify with larger, wider and wider circles of beings were able to feel a sense of, as you and I talked that it's not me proving something are impressing, but it's, there's some collectivity that's going on between us. It's creating an entirely new field.

Speaker 2:          00:50:51       I could not agree more and also to speak more cause I've had a lot of caffeine. The uh, the fact of the matter is if I want to have the impact that I mentioned and to create hundreds of thousands or millions of worldclass learners, the most, the, the more effective way to do that is by having a team to help me. So whether whether I'm collaborating with five people, 10 people or a hundred people or even fewer potentially having a very short fuse has been a major handicap for me.

Speaker 3:          00:51:27       That's exactly the, that's exactly where I was going. Is that the thing you most want to experience and to produce for you, Tim, is world class learners and world class teachers, which I'm imagining if I read into that with then allow there to be more creativity, healing and wellbeing. On the planet earth. Yes,

Speaker 2:          00:51:51       definitely more and more problem solvers. So you have no problem solvers who can also train additional problem solvers, right? So it becomes this sort of exactly the Netherlands virus. I, I mean, maybe that's not the right phrasing to use, but a wave of problem solving that it's hard to contain.

Speaker 3:          00:52:13       That only happens when we are operating in a collaborative way. So what the very, um, domain that you are engaged with is really a more about domain. It's not the competitive domain. It's going more towards collectivity, towards, um, belonging to a field and you're working to wake up to that and engage other people in it. So, in a way, when you ask that question, what will keep my edge? Well, really the new edge that we want to keep as our capacity for empathy and collaboration and mutual creativity.

Speaker 2:          00:52:49       Right? Right. Yeah. I'm sharpening the, the hatchet when it's like, no, dude, you got to sharpen the saw. It's a different tool. You're spending your talk. Exactly. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:52:59       Interestingly, with meditation, it doesn't, what it does is it actually serves that you become better at that.

Speaker 2:          00:53:07       Yeah. I've, uh, I, I've been really profoundly affected by a daily practice. And what I would, I'd love to do to get granular for people is to talk about perhaps some thought exercises or practices that people are currently working 80 hours a week and feel like they can't take a lot of time [inaudible] Tate could utilize and I'm not, I'm not sure if the sacred pause is a good one to talk about. Um, I really enjoyed that discussion. Um, but could you also, because I feel like among my group of friends, this would be very interesting for them to contemplate. Could, can you talk about little exercises that people could use? Uh, if they want to not flame out. And what I mean by that is I know a lot of type a personalities who are like, if I'm going to meditate, I'm going to meditate. And so they try to block it out like an hour every morning for like five days a week. And of course they don't make it to the end of the week. It becomes too much. So I'd like to prevent that, you know, these, these driven people from defeating themselves, uh, which is what I did for a long time. But the, uh, the inviting Mara to tea, um, I'd love for you to describe what that is. Uh, and yeah, and then I'll let you run with, with the discussion wherever you want to go.

Speaker 3:          00:54:27       Okay. So in the Buddhist mythology, and this is to me one of the most amazingly contemporary relevant kind of principles in the universe, the Buddha's awakening to a larger reality. I came through, he sat this night, uh, under what's called the Bodhi tree. The vote is the tree of awakening. And through the night, the God Mara who represents a anger, greed, pride, a version, um, passion, jealousy, all the, all the forces that can take over and create misery. I packed them and you know, there were, so there were arrows and flames of light and spears and so on coming at them. And you know, he sat through the night and practice this quality of presence so that all this, the attacks, each of the weapons turned into a flower petal. So by the morning, morning star when it rose, he, there was a heap of pedals that is at, is, uh, in front of him.

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       But interestingly, Mara did not just vanish and the Buddhist lifetime, Mara would keep appearing and so huge, the Buddha would be teaching in a field somewhere. A lot of people gathered and Mara would start lurking in the outskirts and the Buddha's loyal attendant would be freaked out and they'd say, Oh my God, Mara is here. What are we going to do? The shadow is com, but the Buddha would kind of say, chill. It's okay. And then what do you do is go right tomorrow and say, I see you Mara. Come, let's have tea. And what those two communications really say. I see you, Mara is mindfulness. You know, I see you. I get in this moment what's happening? Okay, there's fear, there's anger. It's so this, this capacity. We each have to pause and just recognize this is what's here right now. It's an honest recognition.

Speaker 3:          00:56:29       So he said, I see you Mara. And that's considered the first wing of presence, seeing what's here. And then the second come, let's have tea is instead of fighting what's here in the moment, there's making space for it. There's getting to know it. There's a quality of heart. It's the quality of heart space that lets the life be just as it is in the moment. And these two wings of presence that you see in this myth really are the very foundation of a meditation practice that in any moment that we can pause and say, you know, you can ask that question. So what is happening inside me right now? And I invite all of you who are listening to this right now just to, you might just check in what is happening inside me right now.

Speaker 1:          00:57:20       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:57:21       I check the feelings in your body sensations. If there's a mood,

Speaker 3:          00:57:28       this is the first wing of mindfulness that we say, okay, so here's what it's like right now, Mary, with our senses, very embodied. And then the second win, which is let's have tea, is really like a thing. I'm just going to allow how this experience is right now to be just as it is with amber brings some interest and some care to it. Let's have tea. So it's a way of being with ourselves that's intimate, that's full and naturally it extends. Cause if you can say to yourself, okay, here's what's happening, there's some anxiety and okay, let me be with that. Then when you run into another person and they are aggravating and you in some way and judgment comes up or they're intimidating you, you could say, oh okay, so this is Mara again. Um, I see you Mara, and you're saying this to yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:58:23       I, I get that this is intimidating and let's talk to you. So there's a, you create a space of presence for what's there. And in response to what you said earlier is couldn't this be passive or kind of a, a chill stance? Um, it's really out of that presence that we can then act in a way that is most intelligent and most empowered. So this one radical presence and radical acceptance that I'm describing these two wings of what's going on and let's have tea that's not are permanent stance. That's the grounds for action. It's like we've come home into the moment, we've come into some stability and balance, and then when we respond to the world, we actually are responding from our full potential. We're not in a reactive mode.

Speaker 2:          00:59:16       We have our internal house in order. I mean it's, we have, that's exactly

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       right. Yeah. We've, we've, we've, we've Rican, you know, we're online again in a way because what happens is when we're reacting to the world, we kind of cut off from some of the parts of our frontal cortex that actually can make us most effective. And I'll give you an example. A story that that's always touched me of this is a surgeon or commanding surgeon in the army who took us, took an anger management course. So this does is, this has to do with anger down. And you took this course and it was very much based on mindfulness, based on what is happening in this moment. And can I open to this? Okay. So he took the course because she was ordered to actually and yeah, yeah, yeah. And um, and he, and then as the story goes, he went the end of the day to a supermarket to um, you know, cause he need this so up on supplies and he gets into line and in front of him as a woman with just a few items in her cart.

Speaker 3:          01:00:25       And not only that, um, she's got a baby and it isn't, this is not the express line. And so we start fuming cause why does she get into express line? She's in front of me and taking time. She has the baby to the clerk and they are laying and I know over this little girl and so he is okay. So he is triggered and he remembers mindfulness. Okay. The first step with my phone, cause you pause and that's a sacred pause. She sense, okay, something's going on, let's pause. And then the second step is, okay, so what's going on inside me right now? You know, what are we seeing? And He, you know, so he noticed it was anger and then he could feel underneath the anger that anxiety. And many of us know the anxiety of when we're busy and on our way and it feels like a whole world's going to fall apart cause we're going to be late or not prepared.

Speaker 3:          01:01:17       So he could censor his anger and fear underneath the anger. And then as she had to with it, as he just stayed with it, he found some more space and some more presence. So when he looked up and he saw the little girl, I thought, oh, she's cute. And when it was his turn, the woman had left with, with the girl. He said to the clerk, you know that that little girl was adorable. And the clerk beamed at him and she said, Oh thank you. Actually that's my little girl. My husband was killed in Afghanistan last year and my mom brings, sure by everyday, twice a day so we have a little time together. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:01:56       Yeah. I share that story because if we don't pause and deepen attention, we live out patterns. We've been living our whole lives. To keep us separated from ourselves, our highest self and each other. And you know, we don't know what's going on for others. You know, it's not like everybody has just endured that kind a loss, but not everybody's struggling hard. And we're so quick to, to take personally into read our lives into things, to be able to pause and both bring mindfulness and attention inwardly. And then outwardly this is, this is what's going to change the world. This is what's gonna allow us to step out of reactivity that tools, wars and actually be more collaborative. This is evolution.

Speaker 2:          01:02:48       I really appreciate that story also because it brings to mind for those people out there who are struggling with some of the same things as this, uh, the, the gent in the story or, you know, the, the kinds of things that I, I'm very, uh, sometimes the anger very often takes the form of impatience or maybe it's the other way around. I'm not sure. But, uh, very impatient and, uh, generally always have been. I mean, ever since I was a little kid, if, if I sat with an empty water glass in a restaurant and my mom thinks this is hilarious, but also kind of annoying, I would just like get up and walk into the kitchen and grab a pitcher of water, like not known for by my patients. And there are benefits to that sometimes. Uh, but the, what I started doing a few years ago, and in fact what I think helped prime me for meditation is reading quite a bit of stoic philosophy, uh, which, which I think has a lot in common with certain types of Buddhism or teachers, teachings of Buddhism.

Speaker 2:          01:03:48       Anyway, but a couple of things really helped me. The first was, uh, trying in the morning to basically do it. Marcus are released it. So Marcus are really as who wrote meditations, but it was really a, basically a journal. There was never intended for publication was at one point the most powerful man in the world. And he would wake up, and this sounds depressing to some people, but I don't find it depressing. And he would say, you know, today I am going to, and I'm paraphrasing, but run into people who are ungrateful, rude, entitled, et Cetera. And basically I sh I need to be prepared for that and not overreact to it. And along the same lines, you know, in the mornings when I've tried to remind myself of when I Journal at usually after meditating is you know, everyone is fighting a battle. You know nothing about number one.

Speaker 2:          01:04:36       And then number two, and I think this is, this was extremely important for me and I can't remember who told me this initially, but it was don't ascribe to malice what can be explained by incompetence. And I actually added to that and I was like, don't ascribe to malice what can be explained by incompetence or dizziness. Right. And I mean I'm, I'm amazed sometimes, and I know I've done this in the past, but when somebody will come up to me, I've never met them before my life, and they'll say, you didn't respond to my email. I'm like, I don't know your name. I don't know who you are. I have no idea what you're talking about, but they're overreaction to that. You know, assuming that I had sort of slighted them by reading the email and siding, it was unimportant and the ignoring it, which was not the case at all, his guarantee, virtually guaranteed that I will not respond to there cause I got so pissed off and flew off the handle and I have no idea what their name is in the first place. Uh, but what, what are Le, let's look at a couple of different types of meditation. I'd love for you to sort of describe, actually, let me, let me take a step back. Let's talk about your personal experience. So what does your, what does the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like? Your morning routine?

Speaker 3:          01:05:45       Well, I am woken up if I don't wake up myself, I get up real early. I mean, I actually wake up around, well not real early, that five or so, five 30, but if I don't pop out of bed, then I've got a dog that will climb on my chest and licked my face and nudged me out of bed. Um, and so he does that because we go right away straight from, uh, we go right down to the river. I live right by this Tomic River. So usually hike for about three to four miles in the morning. It's the first thing with my dog and it's almost any weather. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:06:22       I was think that, no breakfast, no coffee, Yay. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:06:25       go out. I just leave cause I find for myself, um, I like, um, I've always been very physical and um, so and when I was younger, more athletic and that's a whole other story because I did lose it for a while. But, um, I find that for me just moving and moving vigorously and being in nature is, you know, if I had to say what my religion is, it's, you know, being in nature, I just love it. So, you know, so we go and we do is kind of up down hike and by the river, by the river and in the hills. And then about an hour into the hike, I have a place by a stream that I'll stop and then I'll do a meditation there. So I do a standing meditation there and uh, could last anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes and then we do the rest of the hike and I come home.

Speaker 2:          01:07:17       What does that standing meditation, uh, what, what is that comprised of? Uh, what does it consist of? Like said, so when you, if you could just walk us through what that standing meditation is sort of internally, what the, what you're focusing on and not focusing on et cetera.

Speaker 3:          01:07:38       Sure. And, and any one of the component, the first part is really pausing. It's like getting that, ah, okay. I just stopped this forward motion that's like we have, we always have the sense that we're on our way somewhere. So there's really a sense of, okay, I'm pausing to be right here and that this moment matters as much as any moment in the whole universe because we tend to, we tend to think that this isn't what's important. It's yet to come or it's back there. So to really just pause, and there's a beautiful quote from Viktor Frankl. It says between the stimulus, the response, there's a space. And in that space is your power and your freedom. So that, that's the beginning. It's just getting, okay, pausing and arriving,

Speaker 4:          01:08:28       open or closed.

Speaker 3:          01:08:30       Well, sometimes I'll start open and really taken the, you know, I'm right by a stream and right now there's, you know, incredible, you know, the birds and the sounds of the currents and everything. It's uh, it's quite lovely, but so I'll take it all in, but of course my eyes eventually just to kind of quiet my mind more. So I began very much with a, a kind of a sweep through the body with my awareness. And I will kind of starting from the head down, I'll just soften and relax different parts of my body so that I'm feeling the life from the inside out. So I'm feeling a sense of sensation. So if you're listening and you just close your eyes and I sometimes will use the image of a smile to help, to deepen that sense of presence and ease. You can sense the eyes smiling.

Speaker 3:          01:09:26       You can smile into your eyes and feel the corners of the eyes up a little and let the brow be smooth. So there's just a way of softening in the eyes because when we're thinking a lot, when we're in that home movie that's filled with a kind of incessant inner dialogue and a lot of, a lot of fear usually or stress, um, the, the little muscles around the eyes or tense. So by softening the eyes and letting the brow be smooth, that that actually helps the mind to quiet some and you can actually put a half smile on the mouth. And uh, it's amazing. There's a lot of research on this dude that if you have a little bit of a smile and you can feel the inside of your mouth smiling, that that actually sends a message to your whole nervous system too. You can relax the whole fight, flight, freeze, constellation and access more of, um, in evolutionary terms it's called attend and befriend that there's just more of a benevolent witnessing when there's a slight smile.

Speaker 3:          01:10:32       So that's another trick. And again, even if you're not sitting for a long meditation, just pausing and closing your eyes and relaxing the eyes and having a little bit of a smile itself, just even a 32nd pause can shift you from the sympathetic nervous system, which is really a very defensive and aggressive to the parasympathetic, which is much more ease filled. So I sweep down the eyes the mouth, I go to the shoulders and let the shoulders fall away from my next song so that I can just soften in the shoulders. And even again, as you're sitting, you might feel the shoulders from the inside and see if it's possible to have a little bit of that, that melting of ice to water.

Speaker 1:          01:11:24       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:11:25       I still water.

Speaker 1:          01:11:27       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:11:28       And then what are two gas kind of letting go. And it's really, really helpful to let the hands rest in that, um, very easy, effortless way because when I have my hands by my side or if you have your hands in your lap, because again, when we're stressed we have these micro muscles tense in the hand. So by consciously softening your hands, you actually deconditioning that stuff. Stress Reaction.

Speaker 2:          01:11:59       This was actually a question that a number of readers had, which was sort of like a Ricky Bobby I think. And tally tally Talladega nights knows anchorman. I don't know what to do with my hands. I don't have to do with my hands. They were asking when I'm sitting in a sitting meditation, does it matter what you do with your hands? As long as they're relaxed,

Speaker 3:          01:12:18       there are literally called Mudras that are hand positions that in a refined yoga kind of perspective have energy circulating a certain way. But the deeper purpose of practice, if you're training your mind to pay attention, if you just soften and relax your hands, there'll be a slow and you won't be perpetuating Kanchan

Speaker 2:          01:12:40       do you want your hands together?

Speaker 3:          01:12:42       They can be touching lightly, but you can also play some palms down on your right above your knees and just let it be a light touch there and just feel the contact, the warmth, the tangling. And that's fine too.

Speaker 2:          01:12:56       Uh, I've sometimes placed when I'm sitting with my back straight, uh, which analysis have a cushion behind me because I find it too stressful to do freestanding. But if I, if I put my arms, this is, this is gonna sound like probably the worst idea ever. But when I, when I sort of sit, I sometimes sit in a posture that's similar to what I used to do for a judo before practice. They would have you do [inaudible] said have you do a short meditation before and afterwards and you basically put your palms close to the crease in your hip so that your elbows are just kind of flared out to the sides a bit. But for my 20 minute meditation, I can tell almost the second one, it's 20 minutes because my wrist starts to tingle. But, uh, the, uh, I don't want to interrupt you. The description of standing meditation, what are you doing the sweep then for how long do you do this? Sweet, right?

Speaker 3:          01:13:51       Hey, what I'm describing, most people would do this sitting, this just happens to be me cause I, I just like being outside when I can, but everything I'm describing us for those that are listening sit in a way where, you know, ideally it's comfortable but you could sit up tall because really you want the posture to invite forward the qualities of mind that mattered to you. So we want to be alert and we also want to be at ease. So the idea is sit comfortably but sit with your spine tall and I would not use the kind of thing you described him as it. There's good reasons for judo, but for, for training and meditation, let it be more relaxed. You don't need anything to adds tension to the body.

Speaker 2:          01:14:37       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:14:38       So yeah. So if I was going to continue and I'm not, cause I'm actually, I realized I was moving right into a guided meditation, but um, just to, just a sleep through the body and census there anywhere they can relax just a little bit more right now. And what you'll find is if you ask that question, you'll notice that without even knowing it, the body tenses and it, and to really relax and relax is really, really helpful.

Speaker 2:          01:15:05       And, and I want to emphasize just a couple of things that have been helpful for me and I'd let you feel free to veto any of these. I'm, I'm still on training wheels, but, uh, I know a lot of people out there haven't even tried to get on the bike with training wheels. So a few things. Number one is, uh, I have, uh, found that just the sitting alone has huge benefits, whether or not I feel I've been able to quiet my mind in any way. So if I, if I sit down for 20 minutes with very upright posture, sort of imagining like a thread being pulled from the, the, the crown too, to lengthen the spine and really try to float my head into a place over my shoulders and neck so that it feels weightless to the extent possible. Uh, I found so many calming benefits, postural benefits after even a week or two.

Speaker 2:          01:16:03       I've never had so many compliments on my posture ever. I've never had compliments about my posture period in my life cause I'm built like a monkey and a caveman and wrestle for too long. So I have terrible posture. But after a week or two, sort of having complements my posture and my, my walking gait and everything had changed and found tremendous benefits of just sitting with that upright, not hunched over a laptop pop posture. Even if I felt like my meditation was quote a failure and quote because I was just running through my to do list or whatever for 20 minutes, uh, and unable to turn off that monkey mind. Uh, so just see that. Um, what, what would you suggest for someone just getting started, who's always been turned off of meditation for any number of associations they might have with meditation? Mindfulness? What, what is a good place to start? So for instance, there's a guy named Bj Fogg has done a lot of research at Stanford. And if you, if he wants someone to start flossing, for instance, regularly, he'll say, don't start with your whole mouth, just floss your front teeth. And he'll give them just the smallest, uh, task possible to start building momentum. And

Speaker 3:          01:17:17       they, right. And that's the way we do it too. In fact, then got a program coming out I think in January called mindful 40, which is 40 days. And you can really, really get the practice down at and we do 10 minutes a day and it's five minutes is some, you know, background and in five minutes of meditation. So I'm with you, Tim. I think starting with a commitment no matter what, every day helps a lot because nature loves rhythms and you can build a habit with that kind of, um, every day practicing. But here, here, here are the basic ingredients, is that it's useful at the beginning to have a place that's quiet and that you're not going to get interrupted. And it's useful to close your eyes just because that will, you know, there's less stimuli visually that stimulates associations. And it's useful to sit still for a few minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:18:13       And know that you're just doing this as a, this is your evolutionary strategy for bringing out your best and just a few minutes of sitting still and one of my friends says, you put your Tush on your cushion, you take what you get. It doesn't matter what happened. No, no, just sit there. Now there are of course all sorts of very helpful guidelines on how to direct your attention. That will help to not only quiet your mind but wake up your senses. And one of the things that I most love about the effect of meditation as I'm more in my body, it's like I go through the day and I'm less in that trance of thinking or I'm going to kind of that I think of it as a home movie where I'm just off somewhere else and I feel more of a liveliness and energy through my body and at my senses are more awake. You know, I'm worth taking in the colors and the forms and the sense and so on. So it is, you sit still for a few minutes, come into your body as well as you can. The breath is a very good, uh, homebase are anchor if you want to kind of commonly just kind of be with the breath and that's it for starters.

Speaker 2:          01:19:26       And one tips that I think you gave in radical acceptance that I found very helpful and it seems like such a, uh, I wouldn't say trivial, I mean that, that minimizes it, but it seems it's had a larger impact than I expected. So when I've been told in the past like, focus on your breath and then when your mind wanders, just gently bring it back to the breath. I was like, what does that mean to gently bring it back to the breath? I don't know how to do that. What specifically are you asking me to do? And in, in a few things really helped. Uh, one for me was focusing on the breath. I always found it and still find it very difficult. I think this is partially because I'm a chest breather, but to feel the breath in the stomach. And I remember someone said, just focus on the feeling of the breath on the outer rim of your nostrils.

Speaker 2:          01:20:15       And I was like, what? And I started doing that and it really worked well for me. So focusing sort of on the sensation of the breath at the very outside of the nostrils, I'm inhaling and exhaling. But the point from radical acceptance was focusing on the breath. And sometimes I'll just say like inhale XL as I'm doing that. Um, and I'd like to talk about the uh, the sort of pros and cons of, of TM in a second. But the, the, when I would start thinking about something, whatever it would be a, and not the breath, I would just say thinking, thinking, and then come back to the breath. That was, that sort of became my queue. And I think I'm almost certain that there were examples of that in radical acceptance, but I don't want to attribute something to you that if I'm, if I'm off base, but, but I started using that throughout the day too. When I would get angry, my, my way of, or impatient, my way of sort of saying Hello Tamara would just be to say, hmm, impatient, impatient or angry, angry. And it was just enough of a pattern interrupt to allow me a greater degree of of of self control and more like responsiveness, choosing to respond as opposed to being reactive.

Speaker 3:          01:21:28       Exactly. It is in radical acceptance and it's one of the most important support strategies. You know, naming are noting what's going on. It's really, really helpful. So with the breath pick wherever the breath is easiest and most pleasant did attacked. So for you it might be the rim of the nostrils is refined enough in yet distinctive enough and for somebody else feeling the whole body breathing can be doing it. And for some people the breath itself is not a good anchor. I know people that have had trauma around breathing and that's not the best banker. So listen to sound and sped, but you're right when the mind wanders and you want to bring it back, if you just name what's going on, if you just name I was thinking or worrying or planning or fantasizing. Sometimes you can even name, which is, you know, we call it the top, top 10 hits, you know, like went to the top 10 is going on right now.

Speaker 3:          01:22:22       Okay. You know, like basically, you know, pissed at my partner for not doing his or her share, whatever it is. You can name it and if you name it, and here's the cool thing. When you name something, you're not as identified with it and that, that's the thing, it doesn't control you as much. There's a, there's a saying that when a sham and names a fear, they have power over it. So when you name thinking you're no longer in the cloud of thoughts, you're opened up to something larger and then you can choose is just not useful. Or is it not often? You know, most of the time our thoughts are very habitual and they're fear-driven and they just perpetuate a sense of being, you know, a victim or being at risk or being endangered or being stressed. And if you can catch when you're in one of those flurries and just say, Oh, thinking, thinking it's, it creates some space, you can relax open again to a bigger world.

Speaker 2:          01:23:21       Well, I also, I was thinking of a quote that I actually put in four hour work week, which was named must your fear be before banish it? You can, which is of course by Yoda. So if it's good enough for you, that's good. That's good. Good, good. Uh, the, the uh, so sitting for 10 minutes, uh, the way I actually started it, and I know this is a, it's probably a terrible bastardization, but just for those people who might find this useful, a friend of mine named Komal Ravi con actually recommended that I try this because I was having so much trouble meditating what I, in a way that I could use as successful. Right. And of course in a, in a way, the people who need to meditate now can say the most, but are the people who are obsessed with doing things everything successfully.

Speaker 2:          01:24:10       And yet at the same time, they're the most, they might be the people most likely to quit. So. Exactly right. And uh, I remember I heard someone say, you know, if you don't have 30 minutes to meditate, you need three hours. And I was like, wow, okay. But anyway, where I was going with that is he said, just pick a song you really liked that puts you into a good mood and focus on your breath while listening to that one song first thing in the morning. Like before you brush your teeth, before you eat breakfast, but just wake up, put the earbuds in, sit up straight and with a good posture against the wall if need be and just do that one song that's like your state queue. And it was, I've realized that that's not something I, uh, it's not something that I use now, but I found it very helpful to just break the ice and end, have the, the sitting down for three minutes, be the pass fail mark and not having to jump right into the deep end and sort of wrangle with, with my thoughts quite as intensely. I found that helpful. I know it's a crutch, but um,

Speaker 3:          01:25:16       and the Buddhist tradition they called skillful means. It's like there are things that incline us. And so if the song and climbed you, I know a woman who kept saying, I don't have meditator, don't have time to meditate because she would rush rush through her morning. And then she realized that her medication time as well, she was boiling water for her tea and when she poured her cane, when she drank her tea and that was going to be her meditation. And she, if you call it your meditation, you actually, you know, this might not be the language you like, but you create sound quality of sacredness or specialness or importance or meaning. And that's helpful. That starts inclining you. So I, I go for anything that helps to move us towards presence.

Speaker 2:          01:25:59       No, and I, I have no problem with secretness by the way. Okay. That one's okay. I have just such a Weirdo when it comes to language and definitions. Uh, well let me, let me ask just before I go on one of my, my massive like left turn tangents again, a transcendental meditation. What, what are your thoughts on it? A I n just for what it's worth, I'm not a ape surest or militants TM person. It just happened to be the first thing that I did consistently, but I also do quite a lot of their days or weeks even when I, I will do what people might consider the Pasana Meditation. But what, what do you view as the pros, cons, um, of say a TM and just, just to throw it out there? One of the cons for me is the fact that in most circumstances people have to pay whatever it is, 1500 bucks for basic training and a mantra, which I think is extremely cost prohibitive for most folks. And uh, really had me raise a ton of red flags. But I found the accountability of having a four day for lunchtime meetings in a row to be necessary to get me to comply to doing the meditation twice, twice a day for four days. And so that was the main gift. It was really having a sunk cost, which made me feel compelled to do it, number one. And number two, having an accountability, which I think other people can probably engineer and a million other ways. But what, what are you, what are your feelings on TM?

Speaker 3:          01:27:35       Well first a lot of people from the old days found their way into meditation through TM because it was one of the earliest and most well known. So just, you know, we have many, many people that practice mindfulness that started with TM. So, and there's with every, I think one of the things I always have my antennas go up on any particular style claims that it's the best of the,

Speaker 2:          01:28:00       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:28:01       I have, I mean I'm very fundamentalist about being non fundamentalists. So you know, it's like that one always gets to me because I think that different personalities and temperaments benefit from different things and clearly for you having that structure. So I like the, I like that there's a structure for some people. There's different styles of that structure. Um, I too, I offer everything, all my meditations for free. And I just feel like this came to me, you know, it's, this is given from the universe and I want to give it back and, and I, so I like whenever possible ought to have to charge for something in this domain of waking up. So that always, and I also like that it'd be very available to populations that are underserved or can't afford it. So that's another piece. But in terms of the actual meditation TM is as primarily a concentrative practice.

Speaker 3:          01:28:54       You're taking a mantra or a set of say could words and repeating them and repeating them. And the benefit of which is a narrowing of the Lens. So focus is that actually collects the attention and the mind gets quiet and when the mind is quiet, there can be experiences of bliss and serenity and peace and so on. So that, that's what TM does. It gives you a break from that, uh, incessant inner dialogue. And the more you practice it, the more easily it is to collect the mind. Now, there are other ways. There are other focuses for concentration other than a TM mantra. But that that's the way cam works for me. The limitation is it doesn't allow you to see into the nature of reality. And by that I mean it doesn't bring a kind of presence that allows you to sense what's actually happening.

Speaker 3:          01:29:50       Now, most of our understanding of reality is conceptual. We, you know, we have ideas about things and to really have a, you know, a clear, penetrating insight, um, we need to be present. And Tm doesn't, it's like it aims the mind at something, but it doesn't open the attention so that whatever arises, you start learning how to be with it. And to me, the power and freedom of mindfulness is you start getting the knack of being with whatever arises. And one of the things I'm very aware of is that most of us are, you know, we, we were aware of our mortality and we're tensing against what can go wrong. And so we go around our day and in some way there's this tension about what's around the corner that might be overwhelming and we're not always aware of that tension, but it stops us from fully savoring and luxuriating and being creative and alive in the moment and what train, what d conditions. That tension is when we unconditionally open to the life that's right here and we don't resist it. And we realized that wow, there is space for what's here. Even when it's unpleasant. Even when we're, even when we're sensing a dying of some short, to me the gift of meditation is it actually teaches us how to be with living and dying. And so I don't, I don't feel that, I think TM offers a support in one part of a meditation training, but it doesn't go the whole way.

Speaker 2:          01:31:25       What, what, uh, suicides from your own books, which I recommend to everyone listening a few things. If people want it to start with two or three of your guided meditations and they've, they, they viewed themselves as sort of stubborn, a driven types, which, which meditations might you suggest that they start with?

Speaker 3:          01:31:52       Well on my website, there's a a landing page for a guided meditations and they're all you, they're all free and they usually are anywhere from 12 minutes to, you know, 25 minutes and you can start them. And, and this, you know, they, they start off with really guiding us into presence and then they keep going. You can even stop them. Um, I would use one of the featured ones. Those are the ones that are most generically useful but also just play around. It really helps to have guided meditations to begin because you'll eventually internalize, you'll get an inner meditation teacher, you know, but here, but hearing it and hearing kind of a few different versions, we'll give you a sense of what works best for you. Cause sometimes I'll emphasize how to relax through the body. And sometimes I'll emphasize how to really collect with the breath. And other times, meditations on self compassion or forgiveness. So there's a lot of different styles and types to play with.

Speaker 2:          01:32:53       And what is your website?

Speaker 3:          01:32:56       It's Tara brock.com.

Speaker 2:          01:32:57       Yeah, that's, that's straight and simple. And I'll put that in the show notes. Everybody as well as, uh, other links to resources and so on. The, uh, do you have, so the rolling stones have, let's say, satisfaction, right? Everybody knows satisfaction, they love it. It's a crowd pleaser. Are there any of those meditations that are kind of like your satisfaction? Are there any, uh, are there any the that appear to resonate with a higher percentage of people than others? And of course I'll encourage people to, people are going to be hopefully enjoying these for more than one day, so they can test quite a few. But if you, if you had to give your, your, uh, your hits, what might those be?

Speaker 3:          01:33:38       Well, the name I've, I don't remember the names, but I have featured meditations on the landing page for guided meditations and just choose it according to Lens because there's pretty much the same content in them. So got it. But the right there and there, they're easy to find. And then there's also the audio talks page, which gives the kind of background of understandings and so on that really helped us to not only start a practice but and sustain it, but really bring it into our lives. Because the big deal, I mean, you know, everybody talks about sitting practice. The really the big deal is can you and I be talking right now and still have that quality of remembrance where we're in touch with what matters, where we're embodied enough so we can feel feelings. You know, we, we tend to cut off so, uh, habitually in our lives and as you described earlier, we're so plugged into so many different virtual realities that, um, to me the big challenge and invitation is can we get more real and alive in our day unless habituated and less automatic. And so that's the carryover.

Speaker 2:          01:34:53       Outside of your own books, what's, say two to three books for people who want to delve further into meditation, mindfulness, et Cetera, are there any other books that you would recommend?

Speaker 3:          01:35:07       Well, Jack Kornfield, who I teach with a lot and love is a very good friend. Um, has a couple of books that are very good. His is classic is a path with heart. And the other book that is is I think wonderful. I loved Pema Chodron and Pema Chodron has her, one of her classics is when things fall apart. So those are, those are two right there that really, really helped, you know, helped me guide into the practices and, and really help heal the heart.

Speaker 2:          01:35:44       Is, uh, and this is, this does not have to be specific to meditation and Buddhism or anything like that, but what book have you gifted the most to? Other people or books

Speaker 3:          01:35:58       might have to come back to that. Cause I sometimes I'll just, I gift the essential roommate, which is a collection of poetry that Coleman Barks at, um, I think is really, really beautiful or poetry by the poet pace. So sometimes it'll be poetry books at all, all gasped. Um, you know, I really value Eckhart Tolle, totally his books and I think he's done a great job. I think I'd just, Shanti's done fabulously even more with his, his, um, audio, you know, his, his talks and even as books, but it's books, author, Wonderful Haji Ashanti. It's a d y, a shanty. S. H. A. N. T. I

Speaker 2:          01:36:44       what is Shanti mean because I've, I've, I've seen this word pop up quite a lot. I'm looking it up right here. Pcs piece. Ah, there we go. You beat me to it. You'd beat me to it. All right. Uh, well that's a, that's a good word. He is, uh, the, the, the beginning of your day. We talked about the, the hike first thing with the dog, the standing meditation. Uh, and then, then what is your, what does your day look like at that point? After that?

Speaker 3:          01:37:18       Well, it varies. Can like most people have some traveling and teaching, you know, cause I, I teach different centers around the country and some in Europe. Then I'm out and about.

Speaker 2:          01:37:28       But say you're at home and you can do whatever you want. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:37:31       That's when I'm happiest.

Speaker 2:          01:37:33       Yeah. Your hair.

Speaker 3:          01:37:35       Yeah. Well. Um, usually that means that I am writing, I am component putting together talk and um, cause I do it, it's like being a minister. I do my weekly talk and that's kind of where a lot of my energy goes. But I'm also involved with, uh, we have a meditation community here in Washington. A lot of socially engaged action initiatives are going on. So I'm involved with projects like, uh, we were bringing mindfulness into the schools in the area and that's it. That's kind of amazing. I mean, just to imagine this next generation, um, training their attention so they're able to be more collaborative so they're able to be more emotionally intelligent so they're able to find their center. So that, that one really excites me at night. You know, spent some time working on that. In fact, the Congressman Tim Ryan and I've done a number of presentations in the area, two different schools that, uh, and, and it's, there's thousands of kids in the area that have now been taking mindfulness courses. So that's just an example of something I'd be working on

Speaker 2:          01:38:46       that. Is there a dedicated website for that or can people find more information on your own?

Speaker 3:          01:38:51       Yeah, well, um, mine's m I N D s is the group that, um, that I've been advising and that's affiliated with us and I think it's, you know, I'll, I'll let you know before the end because I'd love people to check it out there. It's amazing what they're doing, the kind of work they're doing. And in fact, I'll tell you about one project that I, that I really love, which is that, um, I, I mentioned that Jack Kornfield and I are collaborating on this mindful for day. There's 40 day program. Well we're mines has, we're affiliated with mines and we're going to be working in one of very diverse, very underserved, very large high school in the DC area. And we're going to bring mindfulness to all parts of it. In other words, they're going to do the training with the kids and Jack and I are the this online program or have all the faculty and Admin and parents are going to be a of the group that we work with. They're going to be taking it. And we've got on the ground mentors. So, um, the idea is to see if we can change the whole culture of the school by bringing the sand and there's so much research now showing the beneficial effects for kids that, um, but to have the parents also to me is what's exciting. So we've, we've been able to get some revenue enough to get the first round going on this and uh, and I think it's going to be a very cool pilot that can be done elsewhere in other school systems.

Speaker 2:          01:40:29       Cool. I love, I love these types of, of pilots because they can really set a precedent and provide a case study that people can replicate. So, uh, I will put that whether we get to it today while we're talking or afterwards, but for everybody listening all to put a link to that in the show notes, I would like to ask a very self interested personal question, uh, in that is that I think also applies to a lot of people listening to this. So the, if I look at my circle of friends in Silicon Valley, if I look at my circle of friends in New York, and certainly I think in many other cities around the world or just in many other places around the world, there is an increasing,

Speaker 5:          01:41:14       uh,

Speaker 2:          01:41:17       severe problem with Fomo as we call it here. Fear of missing out. So this, this can manifest itself in many different ways. People feel like they can't stay away from email for 30 minutes because they'll get backlogged and there's a fear of missing either a problem. We were missing some type of opportunity. Uh, in my particular case, you know, I've talked to a number of friends of mine who are involved with startup investing and whatnot about taking a startup vacation. I would like to take a three month, 100% vacation from new startup investments because it's become, uh, something of a source of stress for me. I think things were very unstable right now and uh, irrational and the, the feedback almost universally has been you shouldn't do that. Don't make any kind of public proclamation because then you'll stop seeing deals. And then before you know it, you'll be out of the loop and then you won't be able to get back into it when you want to get back into it. So this is very, and that,

Speaker 5:          01:42:14       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:42:15       as you might imagine, puts me on edge because I, I, I found that there are certain things that I feel I need to categorically say no to. Even if just for a period of time I can't do it 80%. If I tried to do at 80%, then I'll look at everything in it. It just becomes a self defeating. Right. It did. Did I won't make any progress. So how would you, how would you think about or encouraged people to think about this? This fear of missing out where they feel like they constantly have to be in the loop. We're accessible or fill in the blank because it, it seems to be a huge source of stress for, uh, for almost everyone that I know.

Speaker 3:          01:42:54       You're right. And I think it's getting more so because of the degree of the Internet and plug it, cause we're always plugged in on so many levels. You know, the book the shallows and did you read that right?

Speaker 2:          01:43:06       No, I don't actually

Speaker 3:          01:43:07       can't remember the name of the author, but it's really describing her technology actually shapes and changes our brain. And you know, whether it's the, the onset of typewriter changing cause instead of handwriting, which brings out a certain part of our brain, um, you know, having a typewriter but being plugged in all the time, our brain is changing and we're actually taking it a lot more information, but it a lot more of a shallow level, not so dimensional. And we've lost our capacity to actually immerse and drop into the deeper, more subtle dimensions of things. It's actually a change in the brain that people that used to be, um, very avid deep readers just can't get themselves to, there's a kind of attention deficits when it comes to certain things. And what the Internet promote is the sense of missing out because there's so much coming in from so many different angles so that you always got the sense that you're missing it.

Speaker 3:          01:44:01       That there's just something else that you need to be plugged into. And, and one of my favorite little cartoons of this man and a woman sitting in the living room and he sang to her, you know, if I ever become a vegetable, just pulled the plug at which point she goes over the TV set and she hangs out the plug. And, and what I like about it, it's just like we're, we get, we get into kind of an existential anxiety, oh my not plugged in. Like the world is moving on without us and how to deal with it. The first is what you're doing, which is name it, name it, and really get that this is a product of the Times that, that we're at a very speedy time, the end. And it's accelerating. Where, um, you know, there's like a, there's a relationship with the, the Chinese word for buisiness that has to, that's in relationship. The heart killing.

Speaker 4:          01:44:57       Yeah. The speedier we get. Yeah. You could feel it. The left side of the character means heart and the right side means death. Yup. It's amazing. Amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:45:07       And so I can say for myself to him that when I'm in my, like that fear of not being prepared or the fear of missing out, my heart's not so open. If my son calls and I'm in the middle of it, I really am not able to take in him what's really going on for him because there's some part of me that's tense and on my way somewhere else. So it feels like first of all, to have the aspiration to be free from that trance is the first step to recognize what's going on and know that you can be a more full, more productive, more wheel being when you're not constantly being tugged around by that something more or something else. And then the second piece is, you know, if I think of people that are really good teachers or people that are really good writers, people that really have done the music that, that those two people saw, they retreat, they, they unplug, they take space, the, the step out of the dizziness and allow an open themselves to something bigger, something wide or something more mysterious and fluid and order for that to happen.

Speaker 3:          01:46:23       And for you, and I feel us in particular for you because I feel like you're, you've got, um, you're very plugged in to the pulse and a very good way and your sensitivity and attunement, we'll get even deeper if you could take sabbaticals. Agreed. Because it, what'll happen is it'll break. We all get habitual to some degree. And the trick is, can we keep on recognizing and out of any of the habits that stop us from being as sensitive and attuned as possible? And, and so you need a sabbatical to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:47:00       And what, how would you contend with the, the fear of that, the unintended side effects of that sabbatical? Right. So for the free, right. So the friends I have, we're like, dude, you can't do that. If you make some kind of crazy public, a proclamation or put out a blog post about how you're taking a x month startup vacation, you have no idea what kind of cascade of events you're going to trigger like you, you're going to be and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So there's this kind of fear mongering fearmongering that, uh, I'd love your thoughts on how to contend with,

Speaker 3:          01:47:39       first of all, part of who you are, 10 is don't, you guys don't have to try it out. I'll go ahead and try it. All right. You know what's on the other side? So part of it is just knowing that, well, let me put it this way, there's a palliative caregiver who said, you know, who was with thousands of people when they're dying. And she said the greatest regret of the dying is not living true to ourselves is that we're living according to the expectations or the cultural fears or whatever. So your whole path is about playing the edge and not buying in. And part of what that means is that you're willing to feel the fear but not be driven by it, right? So that's where we get, here's now we're coming back to having tea with Mara for you. It's go ahead and say, I'm, I'm, I'm stepping back. I, I'm taking a sabbatical from, you know, whatever, whatever it is, and then your process and it's an important process. It's not like, I wish I could sidestep this so I could actually have my sabbatical. Part of it is you are learning how to, uh, find your peace and balance and ease in the midst of those energies of fear.

Speaker 2:          01:48:53       Right?

Speaker 3:          01:48:55       One of the interesting things to me is that if you go to, in Asia, there's these, uh, Mondalez, which are, you know, filled with images and right at the center of them a sacred space. And in order to get to sacred space, you have to pass through what are called the animal headed goddesses. And they're really fear and anger and hatred and jealousy and point isn't that you get the only way to sacred space to encounter these energies, but the, with them not try to sidestep them. So it's almost like it is the path to face fear. And then there's the question of well how do we do that in a way that actually feeds us and not freeze up know. And um, for me the way that I work with here is there's a difference by the way, between traumatic here and the kind of fear we're talking about.

Speaker 3:          01:49:50       Definitely. Okay. So with non traumatic fear, and by the way, I'm doing a whole online course on working with here in the fall, which you know, I'll, I'll tell you more about because I feel like for almost everyone I know really what's going to free us most. What's going to bring out most of our creativity and most let us be intimate in the world is to really learn how to work with the fears that we run away from. And in fact, there's one, one mystic who says there's only one really good question, which is, what am I unwilling to feel? Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:50:26       that's a good one.

Speaker 3:          01:50:28       And fears what were unwilling to hear. So it's like, to become fearless, you need to feel fear and be willing to be vulnerable, be willing to have everybody tell you, hey, you know, you're going to, you're going to go offline and then you're going to miss something to be willing to feel that vulnerability but not be driven by it.

Speaker 2:          01:50:47       Well, that's me. Reminds me of, I'm paraphrasing of course, but what Mike Tyson's trainer, custom auto said in his, at his peak, which was the hero and the coward feel the same thing. It's what the hero, the hero does that makes them different. And because Tyson was, was terrified before getting to the ring, oftentimes, uh, just hard to imagine. But true. Uh, the, um, I like this. Yeah. I need to think, make a couple of pretty big moves, which, uh, which I've been meditating on, but, uh, I've, I've been frozen and not fried, so I need to pull the trigger on a few of those. I think if you could have a billboard anywhere, uh, and you could have it say anything that you liked, what, what a, what would it say and where would it be?

Speaker 3:          01:51:42       It let's say realize and live the loving awareness. That's really who you are.

Speaker 2:          01:51:52       Where would you put that?

Speaker 3:          01:51:55       I'm not sure.

Speaker 2:          01:51:57       You know, where do you put it? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:52:03       sure. I put it inside everyone's heart and mind. It's like, I feel like, you know, the Buddha said it pretty elegantly that if you're suffering, it's because you're forgetting who you are. You're, you're living in a, in a smaller narrative. And that really each of our jobs is to start recognizing how, what, what am I believing? It's limiting me. What am I believing that's keeping me small, separate, either feeling deficient, are feeling superior? Because, you know, I talk about the trance of unworthiness, that I can honestly say that I am as much in the chance trance of specialness, his unworthiness, and both of them caused stuff, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:52:43       Right. No,

Speaker 3:          01:52:43       it's, it's, it's about really waking up and realizing that there's a basic goodness here. This, there's a humanness and, and alive in this and intelligence and a lot of it's what we are and we all have our particular qualities, but you know, there's this basic goodness. So a lot of what I'm doing and my books and then my teachings is how do we pay attention so we can come to trust that and live from that and then look at each other like, so I can be listening to you and sense pass any mask or persona, just that, um, you know, just that consciousness, the sentience, the place that we're really in the same field.

Speaker 2:          01:53:28       So many questions I could ask, but I know we're, we're probably coming up on time and I don't want to consume your entire afternoon, but I do have a few more I'd love to ask. And, uh, the, you're mentioning knowing thyself. And actually before I get to that, just a quick side note for people who do face a lot of fire in the public world. Uh, when I first got exposed with the success of the first book and it was turned down by whatever it was, 27 publishers, no one expected to do anything. And all of a sudden I was having to get 10 with a lot of, uh, public facing an angst. And, uh, someone said to me, you're never as good as they say you are and you're never as bad as they say. And I was like, wow, that's good advice. Uh, don't let it go to your head, but don't get shopped off at the knees either. The, the, let me ask a couple of questions that are, are less, maybe less serious than, than some of those we've tackled, but, um, feel free to answer or not answer or, uh, however you feel you need to respond. But, so the first is, um, what, what music would people be surprised to know you like or listen to?

Speaker 3:          01:54:46       I'm not sure if surprised. I love Mozart and Beethoven.

Speaker 2:          01:54:50       Tickle music. Not Thinking that's going to be surprised. You don't, you don't listen to like Marilyn Manson when you're working out or anything? Oh, when I'm working out, but you didn't ask me that.

Speaker 3:          01:55:01       You know, my son widened my taste, so you know, so I can then I have a capacity to enjoy a whole lot of different art forms. But you know, I don't like a lot of, I like silence and quiet so I'm not, you know, I try to, whenever I can have it quieter.

Speaker 2:          01:55:17       Got It. Okay. What about a guilty pleasure that is a movie movie or documentary or TV show that you really enjoy that might not immediately come to mind if people are imagining what a, that you would like. Is there anything, are you like a big legal, a lethal weapon fan or any,

Speaker 3:          01:55:43       what was that series? I'm forgetting it now that I love so much. You know, Albuquerque and drugs and breaking, breaking bad. I went crazy for breaking bad. I went so crazy for it that I would be teaching a class and leading the meditation and knowing you didn't want to be, I wanted to get home sooner so I could catch him. You know? I mean, I love that. Yeah. So that's one. Does that count?

Speaker 2:          01:56:09       Okay. Do you have a favorite documentary or any favorite documentaries?

Speaker 3:          01:56:15       You know, my favorites are more just because I have such a passion for it. The, you know, any of the documentaries about, um, there's been documentaries about the earth, you know, those kinds of things. Documentaries about pharmaceutical industry document. You know, it's kind of the political ones that I, unbelievers and that, that undressed things. The tobacco industry, you know, there's been some documentaries on racism better. Like I just saw one called doing racism or the illusion of race or something. It's just, you know, right now, because we're the times you're bringing it more to our attention. It's like we're seeing what's happening in the daily lives of African Americans, but we're just seeing like spot hits of, you know, unarmed African Americans being killed. And then this whole, you know, shooting and Charleston, it's like anything that brings that into our consciousness, that this is not some distant other having a bad experience. Now I man, these are our brothers and sisters part of our, our world right here who are living still on a daily way that is, um, violent and oppressive documentaries that show, that kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          01:57:30       Got It. Uh, this is, uh, maybe a jarring segue from, uh, and uh, and, uh, be curious to hear your response to this, but what, what purchase of less than a hundred dollars is most positively impacted your life in the last six months or a year?

Speaker 3:          01:57:50       Uh, less than a hundred dollars. Um, and they have to come back to that one.

Speaker 2:          01:58:02       We can come back down or it will be, or we can table it.

Speaker 3:          01:58:06       Oh, we got some raspberry bushes that, uh, probably pretty much less. And they're like, oh my gosh, you know, I just went out this morning and picked a whole mess of raspberries. And it's like, I really like simple pleasures so

Speaker 2:          01:58:22       that my gown, well that's the gift that keeps on giving to it's, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Oh, that's, I'm so jealous. I wish I could walk out and pick some raspberries right now. Uh, so last, last question, last of two, but the, the t the last question is kind of a parting question. Uh, the advice

Speaker 6:          01:58:42       you would give your 30 year old self, what advice would you give your 30 year old self

Speaker 3:          01:58:51       to profoundly accept and love myself as I am, but I'm going to add on to that. Um, and this is more relational as I'd like to speak to a little bit related, you know, we do a lot of training to be with ourselves in meditation, but the missing component is how do we train ourselves to be with each other. And I would say to my 30 year old shelf, take the chance of being more vulnerable. Like, let, let your vulnerability be there so that instead of feeling angry and expressing the anger, stay with the anger and that she could feel the vulnerability underneath it and be able to name that. And this is particularly in intimate relationships. Like with my husband, we have a ritual I and we buy a reteach. Uh, we teach courses and bringing mindfulness and meditation to relationships. Um, which is one of my favorite things in the world to be teaching.

Speaker 3:          01:59:54       And uh, that's, that's the message it's like to be, have the, the nerve, the courage to feel, feel what's vulnerable. You know, that, that thing I said before about what are you unwilling to feel to feel it and to be able to name it in the seal, the relationship. Because what happened just the way when you name something inside yourself, you're less identified when you do it together. It, it helps both discover a field of intimacy that really is filled with compassion and understanding that you can't get to if you're not willing to be vulnerable.

Speaker 6:          02:00:31       And what is the ritual that you have with your husband?

Speaker 3:          02:00:33       Well, we a couple of times a week and we do this more than appliques formally, like we have to like, it's on our schedule, um, is, um, which is, you know, Tuesday and Friday mornings we, um, we alter our morning routine some so that we sit down and meditate together and then we basically share whatever's going on. You know, it could be in our lives, but more is there anything right now between you and I and really feeling loving and feeling open and that's kind of the inquiry and, um, and, and then to hold a space for whatever's there so that nothing, so we don't get into a habit of that, you know, of in some way covering over something and then having something built and then not be as tender and open with each other. And we're, you know, we're, we hadn't been married that long.

Speaker 3:          02:01:25       We've been probably together for about 12 years. And, um, you know, and it keeps on growing and unfolding. And I will tell you one very brief story that, and one of our ritual sessions, um, I had this feeling like he was, he was kind of like staying on the perimeter and so on. So at one point I said, so how are we doing? And he had that deer in the headlights swept like, oh my God, sorry, anniversary every guy in the history of the world. Exactly, exactly. To me the other day, she goes, do you know what tomorrow is? And I was like, Oh God, oh no. Yes, I know it strikes terror in a man's heart. I get it, but I get it. And it was, and it was actually, I could even feel it as I was doing, it was very controlling move. So he had that look and then pull that into his iPhone. And he said, Siri, what do you do when your wife says, how are we doing? And here's what she said. I swear this is the truth. Very said. You say, I'm okay and you're okay. And this is the best of all possible worlds.

Speaker 2:          02:02:31       Really?

Speaker 3:          02:02:33       Oh, really? He's like, I mean, I, he handed it to me, I looked at it and I gave up. I said, okay, let's go kayaking. I said, drop this communication stuff. Let's just go play

Speaker 2:          02:02:44       unexpected turn of events. That's, that's amazing. But I liked, I really liked the idea of having these scheduled checkins because it also avoids the bubbling over a of these conversations or discussions so that they erupt at really inopportune, uncomfortable times. Uh, right. Minimize the Zippo doesn't eliminate them, but it, it helps to mitigate that.

Speaker 3:          02:03:10       Well, what happens is when they come at the wrong time, we go into our old habitual, either the sender attack mode and what we and, and then actually create the walls that are the two we don't want. So it really, it really helps just like formal meditation, it helps to have on-purpose sitting times so that if something needs to present itself and you need to work through something, you're, you're available. And then stuff will come up at other times too. But you kind of get more than knack of how to work with it then.

Speaker 2:          02:03:41       I love it. And if you could make an ask of everyone listening to this and ask, or a recommendation, what would that be?

Speaker 3:          02:03:55       The real ask would be to pause enough so that you can contact what's really going on inside you and pause enough so that you can look at another and see the goodness that's fair and mirror back some. Let people know.

Speaker 2:          02:04:12       Very good advice. Tara, I love your work. I'm so glad you're out there in the world doing what you do. Where can people find you on that? That web known as the interweb Internet, Tara brock.com.

Speaker 3:          02:04:30       Yeah, that's the simplest way. And then get on my email list. I, I'm not a massive emailer. I mean, I keep being told I should do that. I'm not, but I do let, let folks know then, uh, the different, uh, in person and online courses that I'm doing at the, the ones that are coming up or there's one on fear that's coming up that I'm excited about. And Jonathan, my husband and I are, are teaching some relationship workshops. So those kinds of things you'll find out about

Speaker 2:          02:04:59       and the guided meditations, just to reiterate that on your site are fantastic. I've listened to them while traveling quite a bit just to take the edge off. Uh, so I once again appreciate you putting that out in the world for free. Is there anything else you would like to say before we close this, this chapter? One conversation?

Speaker 3:          02:05:24       Um, I want to appreciate you because you know, I've been talking about evolution and I feel like you really are your curiosity and your way, your way of interviewing, you know, there's one teacher says that attention is the most pure expression of love and your way of interviewing and also moving to the world is deeply attentive and courageous and sets a model for us. So, um, um, it's a pleasure to the whole hands.

Speaker 2:          02:05:57       Oh, thank you. Thank you. That makes, that makes my day. I really appreciate it. And hopefully we will get to meet in person sometime soon and uh, we'd love to, to see the Potomac from the, from the, uh, the perspective of where you stand with your dog. That just sounds amazing.
