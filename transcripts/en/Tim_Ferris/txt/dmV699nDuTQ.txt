Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. I'm a cybernetic organism living.

Speaker 2:          00:00:23       This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic. You might remember Fort Sigmadek for their mushroom coffee, which was created by those clever finished founders and when I first mentioned that coffee on this podcast, the product sold out in less than a week. It lights you up like a Christmas tree, which can be really useful. However, recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum of new product and that is their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep. As you guys may know, longtime listeners, at least I struggled with insomnia for decades. I have a largely fixed that but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy, still isn't easy very often and I found Reishi, which I've been fascinated by for a few years now, has been very, very effective and calming their old formula, however four Sigmadek old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners, all sweeteners for a host of reasons and I then just ping them and asked, hey guys, I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested, but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it, if too much of a headache, don't worry.

Speaker 2:          00:01:30       And they are always game for experimentation. So they created a special custom version without the Stevia, without sweeteners. Now it is part of my nightly routine. Their ratio elixir comes in single serving packets, which are perfect for travel and in fact I'm about to leave the country right now and I have a packet in front of me. This just going to sit in the end of my carry on bag. You only need hot water and it mixes very, very easily. Here's some recommended copy that they put in the read, so I'm going to read it and then I'll give you my take quote, a warning for those in the experimental mindset, Reishi is strong and bitter in parentheses, like any great medicine. So if the bitterness is too much, I recommend trying it with honey end or nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       So I'm going to say no, you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter. And maybe should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing younguns. When they say Boone Ung. Sure. Cool. Which means you're not able to eat bitterness. Bitter is in many cases, an indication of things that help liver detoxification and so on. Not saying that's the case here, but I've tested this ratio lecture on family members, on friends. Everybody has liked it. It's a little bit earthy. It's not that hard. So I would just say suck it up and no, don't put in honey or milk or any of that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea. It's delicious, I think. Right? If you like poo air, that kind of stuff, that type of tea, you're going to dig it. So just try it. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       Back to then my read. If you'd like to naturally improve your sleep, both onset and quality, I think naturally you might just enjoy this ratio lecture without any sweet nurse.

And that scratchiness is Tim Ferriss coming off of antibiotics because I had some little gremlins inside me that I brought back from the Amazon. That's a separate story. In any case, my job dot. De de, De de, De, de construct, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah many fields. And this particular episode we have a wonderful guest, Jack Kornfield. Alice Walker Calls Jack Quote, one of the greatest spiritual teachers of our time and quit jack trained as a Buddhist monk in the monasteries of Thailand, India and Burma. Shortly thereafter, becoming one of the key teachers to introduce Buddhist mindfulness practice to the West. He has taught meditation internationally since 1974 that's before I was even a glimmer in my papa die.

Speaker 2:          00:07:02       So it's been teaching for a very, very long time and he has had a profound and direct impact directly on my life. So I'm thrilled to finally have him on the podcast to share our shared history, his incredible stories and the practical tactics and very detailed techniques that you can use and we dig into all of that. You can also say hi to him on the Internet at Jack Kornfield on Twitter. Check it out. Jack's history. Just a little bit, won't spend too much time on it. Jack cofounded, the insight meditation society in Barre, Massachusetts with fellow meditation teachers, Sharon Salzberg, who's also been on this podcast and Joseph Goldstein and the later the spirit rock center in Woodacre, California, which is where I did my first silent retreat. And we talk about that. He holds a phd in clinical psychology, which is important to me and comes into this conversation because he's a very, very diverse toolkit for dealing with many different types of personal challenges, issues, questions and so on.

And compassion isn't a word that I use very much, but Jack is unique and I'm thrilled to give you a window into his story and his teachings. Without further ado, please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with Jack Cornfield. Jack, welcome to the show. Oh, thank you Tim. And pleasure to reconnect. I have

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       wanted to have you on the show for some time now and you've had certainly a tremendous impact on my life, uh, both through your writing and through a firsthand in person interaction, which I think we'll touch upon. But first I wanted to ask you a complete non sequitur from that, which is something that our mutual friend, Adam Gazzaley suggested I ask you about. And Adam, for people who don't know him is an incredible, uh, PhD MD neuroscientist based at UCF. And he suggested that I ask you about hang gliding. And I have no idea why he suggested that, but I'm going to start there. And if it doesn't go anywhere, we can, we can change direction. But I figured we would just start with that and then we're going to rewind the clock. But why did he suggest I ask you about hang gliding?

Speaker 4:          00:09:49       Well, it started many years ago when I cross country with a friend who had a hang glider and we would stop periodically and go off different hills. Um, and it was fantastic. And then I wanted to do paragliding and started to learn it. Now because everything is developed and paragliding slot, you know, is a lot more official. You need a license, which I don't have, but one of my favorite things is to tandem paraglide and go off the top of places like Grindle walled in, uh, uh, in Switzerland where you can take the ski lift up to 9,000 feet and then jump off and float silently. Like you're a bird among the clouds. The birds actually do come by sometimes and like check out what's this big bird flying up here? You can catch thermals and go way up above the glaciers. And um, it's one of the most thrilling and delicious experiences that I know.

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       That's incredible. So you've, you first experienced that at what age?

Speaker 4:          00:10:58       Uh, probably in my late twenties. Um, and did some and then sort of put it aside. Uh, and then I was traveling and teaching in Europe. Um, and I saw a sign for paragliding and I said, oh gosh, I really want to do it. Um, and started and now each time I go where there's high mountains and paragliding, that's one of my things that I love doing. You know, there's something about, I've had most people have these dreams once in a while. If you're lucky, a dream of flying or maybe in your meditation you have the sense of not being limited to your body. Um, and, and this is the closest thing that I know cause it's absolutely silent and you're floating there. It's quite fantastic. And this is something you still do it and hope to do it and hope to do it next summer when I'm back in the Alps. And how, how old are you now? 72

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       72. Good man. Well, we're going to then go back a bit in chronology and ask about childhood. I would love to hear you describe your childhood. What were you like as a child? What was your upbringing like?

Speaker 4:          00:12:12       Well, first thing to say is, I remember when I got to Dartmouth College in 1963, um, and I called my mom from the payphone in the dorm sometime in that fall. I didn't call very often, but you know how it is. And I said, mom, I said, guess what? There are a lot of other really fucked up fat is the side. So that's kind of where we, where we, where we start. So, uh, there, uh, yeah, I had three, three brothers and my father was a mixture of a tyrant and in a really abusive person and a brilliant guy. Um, I was born on and on the Marine base in, uh, toward the end of World War Two. And they didn't send him overseas to do, they put him in the medical part of the marines because he tested so high on their tests that they, you know, okay, we're gonna use them for something.

Speaker 4:          00:13:17       Um, so he was brilliant in certain ways. He was a biophysicist who, uh, help design some of the first artificial hearts and lungs. Worked on the space program, but also did other kinds of weird stuff like work for the army, um, biological weapons, people not making biological weapons. We're trying to design things that were kind of computer, um, biological interfaces, all kinds of creative stuff. But he was, uh, he was all, he had mental problems and so we didn't know when the car pulled in, whether we were going to get Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He would come in and, you know, either he could shout, be abusive. Thrilled my mother down the stairs, rant, Jace after us strive to hit us, whatever. Or We'd get this interesting creative person. But we hardly ever had people come over when he was around during the daytime is a way we would, um, because you never knew what you would get.

Speaker 4:          00:14:16       And so, um, our family life in my family life in some way was also, there were great parts of it cause I had my brothers and we were like our own gang. We moved all the time, but we had each other. Um, and because he was a wacky as well as smart, my father either quit or got fired every year or two, and then we would go from one place to another. I went to, I dunno, eight schools by the time I finished high school. Um, so my childhood, uh, partly it was, there were the happy of rough housing and being a boy with, with three other boys, um, uh, and adventures. Um, and then in the basement, my father had all kinds of scientific equipment. He had all this stuff from World War II, this huge radio from a battleship that you could tune into a thousand different, you know, shortwave stations around the world.

Speaker 4:          00:15:14       Um, and projects. He was trying to design stuff. And so we learned from him, you could pretty much take or design or do anything in the physical world. Um, and at the same time, uh, I felt like my whole childhood was also, uh, how to say it colored with the fear of his violence and his unpredictability. Um, so and I became kind of a peacemaker in the family. We all sort of had our roles and duck. Now I do it as a profession, right? I'm trying to kind of make it a little smoother between my parents so they kill each other. Um, and each of my brothers had their own strategy. My twin brother who was a lot bigger, um, and much more outgoing, um, who played football, which I certainly didn't. I was skinnier and you know, I was in the orchestra and he was the football player.

Speaker 4:          00:16:14       But anyway, I remember when he first got in a fist fight with my dad cause my father was abusing, um, our mom and, um, my twin brother had been as young men sometimes do that was probably 13, 14. I mean, grew pretty big and it was looking in the mirror, you know, making muscles in the mirror to see how strong he'd become. Anyway, he just, you know, uh, got into a fist fight with my father. Um, and I was both thrilled and terrified. Um, and uh, but it worked in some way because of the abuse, uh, settled down quite a lot after that. So that was his, his strategy was just to get angry and then later kind of to go his own way. Somewhat moral though. We're all all had been very close as brothers. Um, so there was that at the same time there was a lot of interest, intellectual interest.

Speaker 4:          00:17:13       So we read and learned about all kinds of things. Both my parents were, um, really interested in the world around us. And, um, uh, so it was sort of this mixed a thing of the, you know, the gift of being together with my brothers and a mom who was basically pretty nurturing, although she kept trying to leave him and never got it together. I think it was too scary in the 50s to have four boys, you know, no job. Um, and so we were in the middle of this and the kind of healing that it, it took a long time, um, to do the inner healing work from, um, the pain of my family. Um, and I remember when I became a Buddhist monk and I was sitting these first years with my teacher, Rajan Cha in the forest monasteries of Thailand on the border of Thailand and Laos.

Speaker 4:          00:18:12       Um, and I've been sitting quietly and then some of these memories are energy would come where I remember one monk who had a hot near mine and the forest did something that annoyed me and I just got enraged inside. And I sat and then I went to the teacher and I said, you know, um, I'm really getting angry here. And, uh, he smiled. He said, yeah, we're, where do you think that comes from? Or something like that. And I said, well, I don't know. I said, I thought it was a peaceful guy. It wasn't never going to be like my father. I won't, you know, be peaceful. But it turned out I just stuffed all that stuff. And so when I told my teacher about it, he said, good. He said, go back in your heart. It's the hot season. You've got a little tin roof and close the doors and windows and put all your robes on.

Speaker 4:          00:19:02       And if you're going to be angry, do it right. Sit in the middle of that, you know, and sit in the middle of the fire and don't be so afraid of it because you're afraid of it. You're just going to keep stuffing it. And on the other hand, or if you're afraid of it, it'll just explode. There's another way to be with it. Um, and so that was the beginning of some healing, just to realize that I could actually tolerate the suffering. Um, and the energy that was in my still carried from trauma in my body and heart.

Speaker 2:          00:19:30       So we're going to absolutely come back to [inaudible] cause I have many questions on that chapter in your life, but just, just so that I can create the proper visual in my own head. So you sat there in your hut in the sweltering heat with all of your robes on when you were, were you angry in silence?

Speaker 4:          00:19:50       Well, I was pretty much angry in silence. And that's an interesting question. Yeah. I, you know, in the monastery, the culture was not, was not much that you would yell, you could go somewhere out in the forest and yell, but it was, it wasn't decorous or something. People are with the Hell's wrong with that monk. Um, so mostly, uh, I was sitting in silence and then scenes would come. Then I would realize, wow, you know, I thought I was peaceful. I carry every, in every cell of my body. I also carry both the pain and anger, my childhood and my father, and just the, the anger that comes with being a human being and human incarnation. And I was never going to have that, but of course there it was. Um, and it lasted, you know, this was, I had days of and, and actually, um, much longer weeks or months of waves of, of this coming and learning how to, you know, be present it and not get overwhelmed by it.

Speaker 3:          00:20:50       So I want to backtrack and then connect those dots. So between childhood and ending up in Thailand, you mentioned Dartmouth earlier and from what I've read, at least you were initially premed and then ended up Asian Studies. Could you describe that experience in Dartmouth or how you went from premed to Asian Studies?

Speaker 4:          00:21:15       Well, you know, we all get turned in these mysterious ways in our life. We think we're going one direction and then something happens unexpectedly and a gateway opens. So I was coming from an organic chemistry class to the class that I'd signed up for out of interest on Asian Studies, uh, raise in philosophy or something. And it was an old professor and doctor winks it. Chan who would come up from Harvard. He was kind of emeritus there. Um, and he even said cross-legged, sometimes, you know, in the front of the room and would talk about loud too. And that was him. And they talk about Buddhist teachings and how the Buddha taught suffering and its causes and its end. And that really all of a sudden I sat up, I said, there's an end of suffering, there's a way to do. And he said, oh, there's all these teachings and practices where you can transform your heart and mind.

Speaker 4:          00:22:21       And I became thrilled about it and realize that whatever impulse I had to go to medical school, um, probably part of it came from wanting to heal myself. Um, and so I started taking more and more courses and then it was, it was the 60 [inaudible] and I became a card carrying hippie. I'm a card carrying LSD, taking hippie as a matter of fact. And um, Eh, at the end of, in, yeah, when I was getting ready to graduate, there was still the draft and I thought, well I'm definitely know we want to go over and kill people in a war that I, that I've been protesting it protesting against. Um, so I decided to go into the Peace Corps instead and ask them to send me to a Buddhist country where maybe I could find it. One of those old Zen masters that you read about, um, and got assigned to Thailand.

Speaker 4:          00:23:15       Um, and when I got there, um, people you could kind of request where you went, they, and, and I said, send me to the most remote place you can. I wanted adventure. But I also wanted to kind of reading all those old zen stories. I wanted to see if that, that still existed. So, um, you know, and there were little detours like being in Haight Ashbury in the summer of love and things like that, that definitely, um, they, it changed my life also in a very deep way, um, because for at least for a time, there was a window when people were just giving things away. There was such a sense that the world could be transformed. Um, some of it as we know, very, very naive. One in the other hand, it also felt like a greater sense of brotherhood and sisterhood than I had ever known. Um, um, except with my own brothers who I love a lot and we've done a lot of things together and I started to feel like there are other ways for me and for the world to be and live. Um, and that was, that was also very, um, wonderful.

Speaker 3:          00:24:27       You mentioned, you mentioned a three letter acronym that we're probably not going to spend too, too much time on, but I, I, you and I, you and I have had quite a number of conversations where I've wanted to ask you about some of your experiences, uh, with psychedelics, including LSD, but we've never really gotten into it. So I figure why not do it in front of a few million people, uh, the, the Lsd at that point, your experiences with that, did that inform your decisions at all to then go into the peace corps and end up in a remote area?

Speaker 4:          00:25:02       It did. And I've written out a little bit about it and in a couple of different of my books and chapters in books I've written because I'm the most, oh, Buddhist teachers and teachers of my generation, um, also started with academics. You know, myself and almost all my colleagues, um, you know, in the spiritual industry that I'm in, um, that was the beginning and for me, um, it showed an incredible possibility that all is created out of consciousness. Um, and the possibilities of inner freedom and, or basically I was able at the, at the best of it to see my body and my personality, um, and my history and realized that that's not who I am to become much more the conscious witness of it all. To See yes, birth and death and to go through those kind of, um, uh, death, rebirth experiences that can happen, um, at times in a deep session with Lsd or death of ego or sense of self or removing and realizing, wow, there's a freedom and a life force.

Speaker 4:          00:26:15       It's what we're made of. Um, and that profoundly influenced my interest in spirituality and also interest in what the world can be. Now. Um, just a few days ago, I was on, um, loudly with my beloved wife Trudy. Um, and we were visiting spending time with Ron Doss, who for listeners that don't know, was I'm the author of this bestseller in the 60s called be here now and now, easy 86 and in a wheelchair. Um, but Ron Doss, who had been at Harvard University and was one of the early explorers of LSD before he went to India and became a spiritual teacher, um, uh, in the living room while we were there two days ago. Um, Roland Fischer, who is one of the senior professors in psychopharmacologists at Johns Hopkins University Medical School over rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling. Griffis rather, and Roland, excuse me, Roland Griffiths and Roland, um, laid out all the research that's happening now on the silicide and that he's been doing and it's success for people, terminal cancer patients, all of losing a great deal of their, the fears that they had. Um, uh, working with people with severe depression. Um, and it was a beautiful session because you could hear how these sacred substances and these mind altering substances when they're used in the right context, can really transform human beings. Um, and Nyu Johns Hopkins, there's a whole series of studies that are happening now that are finally bringing it back into the mainstream.

Speaker 3:          00:28:08       So I'd love to underscore just a few things that you mentioned. Uh, number one, uh, Ron Doss, for those people who want to do additional reading, formerly known as Richard Alpert, if I'm getting that right, also has a fascinating story coming full circle with psychedelic research beginning, I guess at Harvard in some respects as it makes sense to me, why Roland's research would be so meaningful to him. Uh, and a number of other, just, just quick comments for people. Number one is if you're interested in, in looking into these sole Simon, which is, uh, considered the active psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms, uh, at Johns Hopkins and elsewhere, I've actually been involved with a crowdfunding and funding myself, some of the research related to a treatment resistant depression, uh, at Johns Hopkins with Roland Griffiths as the senior investigator. Uh, and I'll be posting some updates to that. But fascinating work looking at everything from, and this is also as you mentioned, Nyu and at other very well regarded universities, uh, alcohol addiction, nicotine slash tobacco addiction as you mentioned, uh, end of life anxiety in cancer patients.

Speaker 3:          00:29:30       The implications are, are really profound and the data very, very promising. And I wanted to also mention to folks who are perhaps saying to themselves, well, I'm interested in taking cell psychedelics myself, that there are people I know, good friends of mine who do not currently use psychedelics, but had the ego dissolving, a experience of a non ordinary reality through psychedelics that then led them to become, uh, or contributed to them becoming very, very delicate, diligent meditators. S and, uh, Sam Harris, who's a phd in neuroscience, uh, and thought of are very well known as a and an atheist. Uh, or you know, one of the four horsemen of the atheist apocalypse along with Richard Dawkins and others, uh, is a very close friend and extremely diligent meditator. And He's, he's written about how his psychedelic experiences, which were in some respects very, some of them uncontrolled and you really have a coin flip there. Uh, it's in terms of which direction you can go, but showed him possibilities within his own mind that then led to a very, very, uh, I'm not going to call it devout, although I should just a bathroom diligent practice. So I don't want to take us too far off the rails, but you go to Southeast Asia.

Speaker 4:          00:30:58       Oh, sure. We move on because we are talking about this. It turns out for those who were listening, that set and setting an intention are extremely important. If one uses these psychedelics like psilocybin or something to set the intention to learn, to open, to have a quiet, it's not, not as a party experience, absolutely makes, you know, brings your attention inward. And then all the kinds of discoveries, um, become right in front of your right in front of you. Um, the, but the other thing is that whether it's right for somebody to use psychedelics or do you use meditation, these are all, uh, invitations to step back and see the mystery of your life. Because we tend to live in the, you know, daily Minutia and checking off our list of tasks that we have to do and completing them by work or, or you know, or eating or all the kind of things that make up a day and we go on to automatic.

Speaker 4:          00:32:07       Um, and whether it's meditation and difference or other spiritual disciplines or for some people it also can just be that they have what in Greek is called a Kata Bossam below, you know, somebody close to them gets cancer or, or is dying or they have some accident or something and all of a sudden you sit back and you realize, whoa, life is an uncertain the way I've been taking it. It's not just checking off the list and this is a mystery human incarnation and what am I going to do with it? And Wow at this, how did I get in this body? Look at plants and trees. And, and, um, language that air coming out of your mouth that you shape it different ways in it vibrates a little drum and the ear of someone else. And I can say Golden Gate Bridge and they can envision it.

Speaker 4:          00:32:54       And you start to realize that all of it is alive and made of consciousness. And then the whole sense of who you are and what matters begins to shift. And you start to realize that life is not just getting through the hoops, but it actually also can be a celebration of the heart of something that you have to bring to the world that you come out of life. And my friend melanoma. So Mary, who's a west African Shaman and medicine man, also two PhDs are kind of remarkable guy. Um, he says with the dog or up people in West Africa that he's from that um, they say that every child comes into the world, uh, with a certain cargo. Is there a metaphor like the cargo ships that ply the rivers of West Africa and that, that they're given gifts to bring into the world and that we have gifts to bring to this mystery which include opening to it. And as we do love grows, connection grows and in a whole different way of being in the world happens that we need, um, so much at this time. So that's a little interlude there. Before we move on to the net, your next question,

Speaker 3:          00:34:12       I welcome as many interludes as you would like to interject and I wanted to just ask you to say one more time that it was, I believe Greek word for caught them off, which means a blow. It's like something comes and it just sets your life spinning an entirely different direction. Right? Like a catalyzing event and that the, exactly, I've had a few of those recently that I'd like to selfishly ask you about later, but I can bookmark just so I can bookmark this name, uh, s uh, Stanislav Grof if I'm saying that correctly. That's correct. When just when did you meet him? Roughly what age or what date, just so I can come back to it because this is another thing I've been meaning to ask you about for a long time and get into. But I haven't had the chance.

Speaker 4:          00:34:57       So I had, there's two things to say. Um, when I came back from the monastery and now it's, you know, I guess the year that I connect with Stan was maybe 1973. I made two really important connections, right.

Speaker 3:          00:35:12       And came back and start

Speaker 4:          00:35:14       eight psychology in graduate school. Um, I was in Boston. Um, and first really important connection happened when I went to a meeting of the Massachusetts Psychological Association. And there was this guy who looked like he, he didn't look just like the straight psychologists and it turned out he'd just come back from India not long before named Dan Goleman, who was it, who was a graduate student at Harvard and he had projected on the screen this Tibetans wheel of birth and death that you see in the Tibetan Tonka is that that normally would be taken as some kind of affirmative, um, icon, iconic, uh, you know, symbol. And he said, no, no, this is a psychological diagram. The Buddha was actually more than anything else. Um, he was a scientist of the mind and a us, a profound psychologists. And here is how craving turns into contentment, and here's how aggression can be transformed into powerful energy to heal yourself and others.

Speaker 4:          00:36:24       And he were going through this diagram and I went and I talked to him and he said, Oh, you, you come back from monastery, you've got to come over. Um, and so he took me to David Mcclellan, who had been the chairman of the social science and Psychology Department at Harvard at that time, the one who hired Tim leary and Ram Das. And then later had to fire them for their LSD work. Um, and his house, he and his wife Mary, were Quakers. His home was a kind of soiree, um, where Ron doss and Tibetan lamas like Chogyam Trungpa and I think Krishna Murti and various spiritual figures would come. Um, people were going to MBN coming back. Um, and, and, um, I connected with this whole group of folks who have now been friends for 45 years. Um, Richie Davidson was another that I met there, who's now one of the preeminent neuroscientists in the world on studying contemplative neuroscience and an affective emotional neuroscience.

Speaker 4:          00:37:28       It was a whole collective of people, Dan Goleman who wrote emotional intelligence that sold 10 million copies and many others. And then I got a job working for a, an Esselyn like growth center in Boston at that time cause I was excited at all the new gestalt bioenergetics what are the things that are transformative here. Um, and they asked me to help set up programs and I thought, well, who do I want to, who do I want to meet? So I set up a program with John Lilly and I set up a program with Stan Grof who was still at Johns Hopkins and married at that time just married to Joan, Halifax, Joan Groff. And we became friends. And so we've, Stan and I have now worked together for 45 years. I went out to join him at SLN for many, many years, spending many months together, helping during his development of the holotropic breath work that's at this powerful breath transformation.

Speaker 4:          00:38:27       And, um, he has been a partner and a, and a in a heart friend for exploration. And we've traveled where we've taught in Russia and in, you know, places in Europe and various places around the world. So this is, this is definitely a path that we're going to come down and dig further into, but I, I'm going to steer us to, uh, [inaudible] I want to know how do you land with the Peace Corps in ever more remote? Well, what most people would consider a remote corner of the world and ended up finding a living master. How does that, how does that actually happen? I don't know. I, but I assume you didn't speak Thai at the time. I did actually did the Peace Corps. Right. And then I had to learn Lao. I did because the Peace Corps at that time, it was a very early in the peace corps had really good language training.

Speaker 4:          00:39:29       They borrowed it from the Monterey Language Institute. So, you know, initially I didn't speak that well, but um, because I'd also studied Chinese at Dartmouth, he came more easily. Um, and I was there working in these, um, in the health rural health department, on tropical medicine teams, mostly malaria, but also typhoid and teams going up to different villages and taking, drawing blood and um, giving out medicine and things like that. And then somebody said, there's a, there's a western bank in this province we heard about, um, do you want to meet her? I said, of course I do. So I, I went to this little mountain and walked up to thousand steps to the old Cambodian temple, ruined at the top. And there was this very interesting guy, um, who had just finished a couple of years before the first peace corps, I think in Borneo. And then got interested in Buddhism and common ordained as a monk.

Speaker 4:          00:40:31       And I talk with him. He's now, he's named Dot Johnson. Tomato is, is, um, amongst name cause he's still a monk. And he became quite famous and Thailand and then became the abbot of a temple in, in England. Um, and I became friends with him and he said, oh, I found, I found a really fine teacher. He said, you know, a lot of them, they kind of take you, you're a Westerner and they treat you special. He said, this guy doesn't treat you any differently than anyone else. He just wants you to do that work, you know, and learn that, learn, learn the deepest way you can. And he's in this forest jungle. And I said, I'm going there. So having heard that, I went and I visited a Jen Cha and he was a little bit like the Dalai Lama. He was funny and wise and very warmhearted, but also very strict and very demanding. But he did it in this loving way. Um, and I thought, okay, this is the real deal. This guy looks like, uh, like what was reading about and all those in stories.

Speaker 3:          00:41:36       So I, I read that he said to you, and I'd love for you to tell us when he said this to you, I hope you're not afraid to suffer. Uh, if that's true. When did he say that in? Why did he say that?

Speaker 4:          00:41:52       Hey, I, so I visited him a number of times and told him I was going to become a monk and then I ordained in the village where I was living in the peace corps. People wanted me to do that. It was a beautiful ritual. And then after some days, um, made my way down to his temple and he said, that's, that was his opening gambit. I'm walking in and did the gate and I see him, I vow as I'm here and he looks at me, you know, kind of leans back a little, a little skeptical. He said, all right, I hope you're not afraid to suffer. Welcome. And it was, it was, uh, it was like, you know, you didn't come here just to kind of do some interesting, cool anthropological experiment or something like that. If you're going to do it, we're going to put you through the training. Um, and, and, and he did, but he, you know, there was like this little smile as he said it. Like, okay, you are you up for it? All right, dude. Come on in.

Speaker 3:          00:42:52       Well, and what did, what did the training consist consist of? What were, what were some of the first things that you had to do and then what, what was the suffering that he alluded to? What were some of,

Speaker 4:          00:43:03       well, that'd be some examples. Um, okay. So of course the, the first training was just how to walk around and not have my robe, you know, fall on the ground and embarrass me and everyone, a hose that comes to, they all loved it. Oh yeah. All right. Look at the western. He's, he can't even wear his robes, right. Or whatever. So part of it was just the unfamiliarity of it culturally and otherwise. Um, uh, there were the, there were the two kinds of suffering. The big suffering of course, was being alone with my own mind. I mean, there you go, you know, having to do hours of meditation, um, when I didn't know what the hell I was doing. Um, and then as I talked about with anger or fear or confusion or, you know, all those kinds of states, um, learning to deal in a very conscious and mindful way.

Speaker 4:          00:43:57       And then more importantly in a compassionate way, in a kind and loving way with all the energies that make up my humanity and our humanity. Um, and that means that when you sit and you get quiet, anything unfinished in your heart will also come up all the unfinished business. So, you know, um, relationships that I'd had that ended badly in college or, or, um, certainly stuff from my childhood and family dreams that I carried, things will fill the, not all of that up. It's, um, yeah, my friend Danny, the mot humorist and writer says, my mind is like a bad neighborhood. I try not to go there alone. And there's some way in which, um, in community, sitting together with others in meditation and then sitting in my hot, um, it was really facing myself and my full humanity. That was the, that was probably the most difficult thing because then you get insanely bored, are insanely restless or, and then how do you deal with all those energies?

Speaker 4:          00:45:02       Normally what we're restless or bored, you know, what do we do? We, you know, um, open the refrigerator or you know, go online or something because we can't be with our own loneliness or fear. Um, so those are the inner, and then there's the outer with bordering the outer one or ones were things like, uh, getting up. The bell would ring at three 30 in the morning and I'm not an early riser by nature. I go, Oh God, here we go. And we walked through. It was actually very beautiful. Then we'd walk through the forest at night, either by moonlight or sometimes you'd have a tiny little flashlight. Um, and one of the forest monasteries where there were a lot of cobras, we'd have a little stick and you'd tap the path so that the snakes would know you would feel you coming and move out of the way.

Speaker 4:          00:45:54       We wouldn't step on them. Um, and then we would sit silently for a couple of hours and then do an hour of chanting on a hard stone floor. Mind you, when we, everybody else seemed comfortable in my body was killing me. Um, and then at least once a week we would sit up all night with the teacher and he would sit there comfortably meditating, maybe talking with another colleague that it would come and we'd just be sitting and meditating and he would kind of peak over at us. Like, how are you doing? I go, God, it's been four hours. When are we, when is he going to let us go back to sleep? And he didn't, you know, so sitting up all night, um, it got very cold in the cold season, um, and it got insanely hot and hot season. Um, and somehow learning to live extremely simply where the set of sandals and a set of robes and an alms bowl and then you would eat what you got offered in the village.

Speaker 4:          00:46:54       And we would share it in that monastery with others around us. Um, and sometimes you'd get nice food and a lot of times in the dry season you get really, really skimpy food and there wasn't that much to eat. Um, and so picture a day where you get up at three 30 in the morning, you know, um, you sit for a couple of hours in meditation and do long than an hour long chanting on a stone floor. Then it's getting dawn and you walk barefoot, you know, three miles, five miles, 10 miles with the alms bowl and a handful of other monks and get your food and come back, whatever you've been offered in. That's the food for the day. Um, and then you go back to your meditation or to the work of the monastery of sewing robes or drawing water from the well, um, and it's, you know, McGee and 105 degrees hot season.

Speaker 4:          00:47:50       Um, and uh, then you go back and you join in the community for more meditation and then the teacher smiles and say, how are you doing? You know? Um, and then other kinds of practices. For example, we had a charnel ground there. And so I've charnel ground, which is where a cremation ground where people bodies would be burned. And so on occasion would go to a cremation and then sit up all night. And contemplate death, um, and you know, look at the body and then watches it burned and then do these meditations where you would reflect on, well, this is going to happen to the body that you're inhabiting as well. Who Do you think you are? Do you think you're this physical body made of, you know, hamburgers or lettuce or whatever you happen to eat? Is that, are you hamburgers and let us, you know, or Oh, where are you? Your feelings or your thoughts? Who are he really born into this body? Um, like Koans. Um, so anyway,

Speaker 2:          00:49:00       and the alms bowls. So you'd be, did you eat whatever you gathered in one meal? Was it spread throughout

Speaker 4:          00:49:10       one meal? You eat one meal a day, which makes you very easy to make your life easy. Um, and at the same at that monastery, things were shared. There was other monasteries I stayed in where you would just eat what was put in your own bowl. Um, uh, and, um, you didn't have to eat everything that was given to you. There were some things that were, you know, in the dry poor season there would be Curry's that were too hot for me to eat cause they use the chili's to kind of um, preserve, preserve, preserve the food. But you know, when, when it was a really poor village or something, you know, they would have to make curries out of um, field bias or field new apps or bat or bats or, you know, I remember eating, there was a, um, curry that was made out of basically the grasshoppers that had come scrap through and there was this whole big, you know, insect wave of insects that were kind of eating the crops and they, they collected them all, made curry out of it.

Speaker 4:          00:50:17       So, you know, okay, this is what you get for your food today, dude. I think I might take the grasshoppers over the, over the bats I, but yeah. Well yeah, but when it's highly spice, you can't tell what is mystery. That's true. We all had mystery meat and middle school. Anyway, this was like mystery meat on steroids, exotic mystery mean. What was the, what was the longest period of time that you spent in silence during that time in Thailand? Well, then I went to a Burmese monastery because I wanted to do this very intense meditative training and I spent about 500 days, so less, less than a year and a half in silence. That with the exception that I would talk to the teacher, um, uh, every couple of days I'd have a little 10 minute conversation about what was happening in my meditation and the rest. I was just sitting and walking 18 hours a day when I could or, or so sleeping a little bit.

Speaker 4:          00:51:15       Um, and I remember at one point, uh, it was relatively early on, I've been sitting and walking and, and pushing it as young men. Do, you know, I'm going to get enlightened and all of that and not moving, sitting with a lot of pain, which is also part of what happened that at the forest monasteries sitting on a stone floor for hours without moving. Um, he really had to learn how to deal with your own physical pain. And I was exhausted from sitting and walking in my little hot that I had for that long retreat. And after a couple of months I thought, I'm really tired. I got to lie down. But then I thought, well, but I'm not going to nap for a very long cause I'm, I'm on my way to enlightenment, whatever. Um, I'm going to do this. Right. So I said, all right, I'll lie down on the wooden floor rather than on the little map that I had and that way it won't sleep so long and I'm lying there.

Speaker 4:          00:52:15       Um, and then I wake up and I get up and I walked very slowly doing this mindful slow walking to the end of the hot and look out the window toward where some of the other monks in the teachers live in some, some way down, some way down through the trees. Um, and then I turned around and I start walking the other direction in this, this meditation hut that I had. Then you could walk probably it was maybe 15, 18 feet long. It was long and Arrow. And I see this body lying on the floor and all of a sudden I go, oh, that's me. And then I realized that I'm having out of body experience. And what had happened is that I was so intent, I'm not going to sleep long. I'll get up very soon. That intention was really strong, but my body didn't want to get up.

Speaker 4:          00:53:10       So I got up, but it was, it wasn't in my body. And I've walked very slowly and I peered down at my body and I turned around and walked the other way and walk back. And then the second time I walked back, I got closer and then I fell into my body and I woke up. I said, Oh wow, that's interesting. But what I saw out the window, it wasn't just like a dream because I was watching, you know, my teacher and talking to these other monks. And then I got up again. And that's exactly what was happening. And that was the first of a series of all kinds of very interesting experiences that happen. And those other examples of those types of unusual experiences. B and D, Was it your time in Burma that found you experiencing these for the first time? Well, first of all, to first experiences, even though I had experiment with meditation back in, in a senior, in college and so forth, um, worry experiences again that came through psychedelics.

Speaker 4:          00:54:16       Um, and so I was familiar with all kinds of weird and, and powerful and mysterious or mystical kind of experiences. Um, but they, but there's something about learning how to navigate it without taking a substance and learning that your own consciousness is the field that you can, that you can learn to navigate first all the personality and emotions and history and so forth. But then you start to realize that you're bigger than that. That who you are is not just your thoughts and feelings in your mind. Um, and so whether it's out of body experience or the experience of vastness of becoming the sky, um, within which everything arises and passes or the experience of profound silence, we're of the void where you enter, enter a stillness before experience even arises or the experience of luminosity where, um, uh, where my body would dissolve into light, uh, their time sitting.

Speaker 4:          00:55:21       As you get concentrated in somebody, your concentration builds that your whole body and mind open up. And you know, first you get the elements, your body can feel heavy like a stone, the earth element or can fuel so light that you have to peak your, open your eyes and make sure you're not floating cause it feels like you're floating in the air or it can be filled with fire and you feel like you're in the middle of a raging fire or can get icy cold, you know, or all kinds of vibrations and couldn't delete the energies. And chakras start to open. And sometimes it's pleasant, sometimes it's not. You know, as deep energies start to move through your body, they also kind of push open. The places that are held close so that when your heart starts to open in deep meditation, sometimes it feels like you're having a heart attack. They've physically painful because all the, all the things that you've held around your heart to protect yourself start to loosen. Or when the energy hits your throat and it starts to open, weird was come out, you know, and then you get to visions that come and, uh, you know, Brow Chakra, you start to see all kinds of colors and visions and hear things that all possibilities of the play of consciousness can start to open after, um, both period of silence, but also really deeply training attention and concentration,

Speaker 2:          00:56:49       these experiences just to put them in or at least part of, uh, what you said in context for people listening. Uh, there, there were a number of things you mentioned, but one in particular that opening in the chest that I experienced in the 10 day retreat, done it a spirit rock, uh, which, which for which you are one of the, the instructors or the lead instructor. Uh, and I, it was an incredibly powerful experience. And listening to your description of some of the feelings. It makes me want to go to the jungle and spend time doing this type of training. However, the 10 day retreat as you know from firsthand observation and interacting with me was incredibly difficult for me and terrifying it. A number of points where I felt like I had crossed a boundary into maybe even madness where I, I was fearful I wouldn't be able to return from. And so I'm curious to know during that period of time in Thailand and Burma could be afterwards as well, but when you were in the, in the jungle and doing this very intense work, were there any particular points when you wanted to quit to go to go home?

Speaker 4:          00:58:10       Absolutely. I mean, I remember I, I got what I think was malaria. I would have a really high fever and I was sick as a dog and I'm lying in the bottom of my little hot there. Um, high fever and shivering and Odg and chalk came to visit me and in allow language and he was, he was also funny and quite blunt. And the allow language is a very straightforward kind of, the sentence structures are really simple. So he looked at me and he said, sick, Huh? I said, yeah. And he said, hurts all over. Huh? I said, it's your just, he said hot and cold. Yeah. He said, you know, makes you afraid. I nodded. He said, makes you want to go home and see your mother, doesn't it? And I'm not there. And then he looked at me and he said, you know, this is the jungle fever.

Speaker 4:          00:59:00       This is malaria. We've all had it. Um, but now there's some good medicine. I'll send the medicine monk over and then a couple of days you'll be fine. Um, um, and then he looked at me and he said, you could do this. You know, you can do this. So I mean, that was an example of wanting to go home to my mother. What am I doing? What gets me, what kept going? I mean, I don't want to interrupt, but psych, what kept you going for, I'm imagining 500 days of silence. I could barely handle 10 days. You know, Tim, I mean, what's kept you going? What keeps any of us going about things that we care about? I had somehow, I don't know, kind of a wacky, but I think also, um, important kind of passion to say I want to understand or I, I, you know, I've started down this road and I want to see where it goes.

Speaker 4:          00:59:49       And I think all of us find at a certain point in our life that there, or if we're lucky that something really matters and you've done it in your work and your travel, you want to explore what your human capacity is. And I'd read, read these old zen stories in this. I said, I want to see if this is true. I want to find out. And then as I, I started, things started to happen like that, out of the body experience and rapture and changes in and openings. Um, and I realized that there's really something to learn here. But there are a couple of other things that I want to add to this. Um, one of them that's the most important is that it turns out that it wasn't, and it isn't so much about the actual experiences. So, ah, Jen Cha, my teacher talked about how in his album training for the first eight years in the jungle, um, he had been a very ardent meditator and had all kinds of insights and dissolving and somebody in John Experiences all kinds of, he is a weakened.

Speaker 4:          01:00:55       Yeah. Or how would you try to found, somebody has a lot of meanings as a word, but it can mean profound states of concentration in which the mind dissolves into light or into joy or bliss or, um, becomes absorbed with anyone of all kinds of states. So we went to the most famous teacher of that time, another odd going on Jenman and told them not all of these experiences in the master looked back and Vince said, Cha, you missed the point. These are just experiences. You know, it's like gone to the movies and you have a romantic comedy and you have a war movie and you've a documentary, you know, and uh, you know it. Disney movies, they're just movies on the screen. Some pleasants a month. I wasn't. The only question is to whom do they happen? Turn your attention back and ask, look to see who is the witness of these.

Speaker 4:          01:01:53       What is the consciousness that is knowing these ever changing experiences? This is where your liberation will come. He said, become his language. If I translate it is the one who knows. Become the knowing rather than the experiences. And then you can tolerate anything and you can respond with love and understanding because you rest in the timeless consciousness, which is your true nature. So part of what I also learned in meditation and teach is that it's not so much about the experiences, Oh, I want to have this or that experience, but it's this profound turning back to ask who am I, what is this consciousness itself? And that was born into this body that will leave it. And we can talk about death at some point if you want. Um, what is this mysterious consciousness itself? Um, so there was that. Um, and then, um, then I also had the opportunity of being with a few other teachers.

Speaker 4:          01:02:59       And one of my, uh, one of the people that I was very close to and, um, inspired me profoundly was a Cambodian monk named Maha goes and under who was the Gandhi of Cambodia. And what I met him, we were living in training together in a forest monastery in Thailand. And it was during the time the Khmer Rouge came to power and, and eventually killed 2 million Cambodians in a kind of genocide. And he was, he survived because he wasn't in country, but all 19 of his family members were killed. His temple burned. Um, you know, uh, all the, all the Buddhist texts and so forth were destroyed. Um, and when he was able to, he went to the refugee camps, refugees were pouring out of Cambodia by the hundreds of thousands, and he went to the refugee camps on the border of Thailand and Cambodia. And, um, I was able to go with him and at a certain point and he decided to open a temple in the middle of one of the biggest refugee camps.

Speaker 4:          01:04:11       Here's 50 or a hundred thousand people, these tiny little bamboo huts, um, and got permission from the UN, HCR High Commissioner of refugees, uh, and build a platform with a little roof over it and put an altar with a traditional Cambodian Buddha on it and so forth. But it was a camp with the Camaro rouge underground, um, lots of them. And so they put the word out that if anyone went to be with this monk, when they got out of the camp back to Cambodia, they would all be shot. So we wondered who would, if anyone would come and, uh, went through the camp the day, the opening day with a big kind of Temple Gong ringing it and 25,000 people poured into the central square around this little 10 point God and he logos. And the sat there and he was a scholar. He spoke 15 languages and he was, uh, you know, extremely kind hearted human being who had suffered enormously, um, and had transformed it into the kind of compassion that we think are with the dollar alarm or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:05:31       In fact, they became friends and go, Sonata became the head of all of Cambodian boozing. But there he was at this point, sitting looking out at 25,000 people who had suffered immense traumas. And you could see there was a grandmother and the only two surviving grandchildren that she had, or an uncle and one niece and their faces were the faces of trauma, um, and of survivors. And I thought, all right, what is he going to say to them? And he sat very quietly for a long time, just in their presence. And then he put his hands together in this kind of modest way, um, and began to chant in the microphone, yet it sound system in Cambodian and in Sanskrit are Pali, the Buddhist language. One of the first verses from the Buddhist texts, um, they'd goes, hatred never ceases by hatred, but by love alone is healed.

Speaker 4:          01:06:34       This is the ancient and eternal law. And he chanted it over and over in Cambodian and in Sanskrit, Pali. And pretty soon the chant was picked up and in a little while, 25,000 people were chanting this averse with him. And I looked out and they were weeping, many of them, cause they hadn't heard their sacred chants for years. Um, but also because he was offering them a truth that was even bigger than their sorrows. That hatred never ends by hatred, but by love alone is healed. This is the ancient and eternal law. And they were sitting in the middle of the, the, the healing energy of the Dharma, of the teachings of the heart that can liberate us. Later on goes to Nanda, who was nominated for the Nobel peace prize a number of times. Um, spent 15 years walking through the killing fields and the, you know, mind areas and so forth, leading people on foot back to their village. And he said to the refugees, you can't go back in a boss or the back of a truck or something like that. You have to reclaim your land with love. And so he would lead a thousand people and he'd be in the front with a bell and a Gong and a few other monks and the whole way back they would be chanting the chance of lovingkindness so that by the time they got to their village, uh, whatever had been destroyed, there was the sense that they were reclaiming

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       not just the land, but they were reclaiming their own hearts. That's a beautiful, really beautiful story. And it, it prompts me to ask a question that I struggle with answering myself. Uh, and, and it's also a question many of my friends have asked themselves and I'll take a stab at it. Uh, how do you decide when to do deep inner work? And take an extended period to do that versus being in the world and trying to impact others and the world. And to just provide a little bit of background on that. I have friends who are building businesses or building careers of some type or families. And I at this point do not have wife, kids or company to build, at least with a large organization. And I've come back from various experiments, sojourns experiences over weeks or months and shared these with them. And they've, they've expressed this longing, this deep yearning to do something similar.

Speaker 3:          01:09:28       And then they asked this question like, how do I, how do I best decide if and when to do the deep extended work versus being in the world? And I know it might be a false dichotomy. You might not have to choose, but, um, I'll talk a little bit more just just to fill the space. But the, uh, I, I had this experience personally not long ago when I was in South America and had someone telling me, uh, in sec in Spanish, which was not their native language. Uh, this is an indigenous tribe, but this, uh, Upal this mayor effectively who worked a lot with different, um, plant medicines and he said that he recommended one 15 month diet, very, very strict, 15 month period with many different restrictions, uh, no sex, no alcohol, no pork, etcetera, and to develop certain capacities and to practice in effect, I mean at certain types of meditative practices.

Speaker 3:          01:10:30       So I struggle with this myself as well. How do you, how do you suggest someone think through, so did you give up sex and pork? I've done it for short periods of time. I'm not a year and a half. I've done it for weeks at a time, but not for 15 months. But what appealed to me about that, definitely not the lack of sex and pork. I like both of those things. It was, he said that's something you only have to do once in your life and it opens doors and it creates opportunities that are difficult, if not impossible to achieve otherwise. So of course that's very tantalizing, but 15 months is a really, really long time to opt out of everything else. Um, and I'm not saying it has to be 15 months for some people as you know, setting aside even 10 days to do silent treat as hard. And I know there are things that they can do on an ongoing basis, like morning meditation and so on. But for, for those who are really drawn to this extended deeper work, how do you think about, and that's why I go Sananda brought it up for me because he'd spent so much time outside of his country and then went back and was really on the, on the ground doing work with locals had. How do you think about that or suggest someone think about it?

Speaker 4:          01:11:39       Uh, first my answer is yes because all of the things that you say are true that yes, there, you know, most cultures, um, encourage at some point human beings, most wise culture as human beings to step out of their ordinary roles and their ordinary routine. Whether you go to the mountains or the ocean, you know, or, or a temple or a change in how you're living so that you can open up to the mystery. Um, and so that you also can open up to love because what I saw with my teachers and go sonata as well, nudge in chat and other is, um, that they were able to love no matter what it was really, eh, because they, they inhabited consciousness in a very different way than just a small sense of self. There was something much a possibility that we could live with forgiveness and love and be really effective in the world at the same time.

Speaker 4:          01:12:39       Um, so they're not separate. And that's sort of what your question is, how do we live in the world? Um, and at the same time, you know, what trainings and how do we connect with something deeper and part of it is just intuitive. You know, Tim, um, Eh, if you have new more than, you know, or young children and so forth, it's not the time to go on a long retreat. Your kids are your practice. And in fact, you can't get as zen master who is going to be more demanding then, you know, an infant with colic. Right. Or, you know, or a teenage, you know, certain teenage kids where you, but with the young ones, you know, years end master might say, you've got to get up early in the morning and you know, once in a while you might roll over, the kid is crying and sick.

Speaker 4:          01:13:28       You have to get up. Um, your family needs tending and the, you know, if you're even vaguely, um, a responsible and caring parent as you, that becomes your practice. And if you think, well, if only I could be in the great zen temple of Kyoto or an Ashram in India are down in the Amazon with Tim, you know, taking Iowasca or whatever that plant medicine they give, you know, your kid is, can be like Iowasca on steroids. Okay. You want to, you want to face yourself and your own limitations and your own, you know, you want to look at the smallest sense self and find out how to live with it, where the freer and bigger spirit here, we just hired someone to live with you and train you full time. So it's really, you know, um, and that's an important thing. But what, what makes it work is that, um, you have that intention not just to soldier through it, but to say, let this be a place where I awake and um, graciousness and inner sense of freedom and peace as things come and go where I awaken the possibility of presence, um, in pleasure and pain and joy and sorrow and gain and loss and all the changes that I find, uh, uh, an invite, a more, a timeless place of becoming the loving witness of it all, becoming the loving awareness that says, yeah, now I'm having a family experience and this is the place to find freedom because freedom is not in the Himalayas or in the Amazon.

Speaker 4:          01:15:13       The only place it's found is in your own heart exactly where you are. And that's what goes to Nanda, Todd. And when, what Jen Cha, that's really what they wanted to communicate. Now that being said, if you have an opportunity and you're drawn to it like somebody you might do, you know Jack Dorsey? Jack. Yeah. So Jack just did his first 10 day meditation retreat and he tweeted about, I wouldn't say it otherwise, but he tweeted about it and it was, you know, one of the top transformative experiences of his life. And it's not to say 10 day retreats are the be all and end all. They are. They're very powerful and compelling. Um, but you, even if you have a company or even if you have a family, there might be a period of a week or some days where you can in fact get away, um, and step out of those roles and turn inward. And that can be tremendously valuable. So I think both are important. You just have to listen what the, when the time

Speaker 3:          01:16:15       it's right. So there are so many things that this, this brings up the, the first though is just a housekeeping for people who may not recognize the named Jack Dorsey. Uh, that's Jack at Jack, I believe it is on Twitter of a, you might add then wonder how did he get that user handle? Well, uh, he's, he's one of the people behind Twitter. So you use of Twitter and square fame among many others. A fascinating, fascinating guy. Uh, so people can check him out. The, uh, the comment on the infant being the full time trainer working with you, 24, seven reminded me also since you mentioned Ron doss earlier of a, a quote of his that I like, and I'm going to paraphrase, I'm sure, but if you think you're enlightened, go spend a week with your family.

Speaker 4:          01:17:03       Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:17:05       Which I think is a fantastic one. And that's part of the reason, uh, and, and you know, some of the backstory, but, uh, we all have, I would imagine we all have tough things that happen to us. Experienced trauma, traumatic experiences as children have a lot of triggers related to family members typically. And, uh, for me, the forced to break takes a number of different forms, but that includes a trip every six months and extended trip of two to four weeks with my parents and my brother when he can make it. Um, so that's only after being introduced to meditation, something that I would even consider as a practice. And, uh, the, the last point I'll mention just out of my personal experience is that a, there's a piece of paper I have in my wallet and I've had in my wallet for a few years now. It's getting a bit worn down. It's a piece of construction paper and an ex girlfriend gave it to me who, who knew me very well. And it says, the task that hinders your task is your task

Speaker 4:          01:18:09       beautiful.

Speaker 3:          01:18:11       And uh, that's a good reminder for me. I wanted to ask you two questions that, uh, are personally important, uh, but, but also may apply to other people. The first is the question that I believe you mentioned Adrienne Cha perhaps others have indicated is the question versus the, the experiences or movies of these say out of body experiences and so on. To whom do they happen? Right? To whom do they happen? Is this a Koan? Like what does the sound of one hand clapping where there isn't really an answer? You're are, you're expected to arrive at is, is the value in contemplating the question more than any answer?

Speaker 4:          01:18:54       Yes. Both. Yes. Both. And no, because, um, it is, it's a profound contemplation for us. One of the great, you know, questions of human incarnation. Who are we? How do we get into that? How did you get into this body with the wiggly things on the end of your limbs, you know, little fits of a clause that you have, you know, his nails and this digital tail and that whole at one end into which you stuffed dead plants and animals and glug them down through the tube. I mean, the whole incarnation thing is really pretty wild. So who are we? And then what are, what, how do we make meaning of it? What this is that this is a lifetime question and that way that it's a on, but in another way, it also actually does have an answer. And the answer, of course has to be found by each person.

Speaker 4:          01:19:47       The answer to point toward it. Um, it's very clear that you're not just your, you know, salad and vegetables and hamburger body and you're not just your emotions. I hope cause they're always changing and your thoughts. Good God, I hope you're not your thoughts. Um, so you start to realize, all right, why is there then, what is this self? Who am I in neuroscience? You know, there was a Time magazine issue on modern neuroscience where it said neuroscience to search throughout the brain over many decades now and come to the conclusion that they cannot find the self located anywhere in the neural mechanisms of the brain and that it simply does not exist. But what does exist is a sense of self that's built out of a sense of identification with our thoughts and body and so forth. It's all wise, inappropriate. We should be, but we also know that it's not the end of the story and you know it from walking in the high mountains or listening to an extraordinary piece of music or making love or taking some ex, some sacred medicine, you know, are sitting at the bedside of someone when they die.

Speaker 4:          01:21:06       That mysterious moment when spirit leaves the body or when a child is born. We have these moments where we open to mystery and realize that who we are is not just our personal history or our body and emotions, that we become the consciousness itself, the witnessing awareness, that we are the loving awareness that was born into this body. And that becomes actually a direct knowing, a direct experience. So there is a, a way in which we also can come home to ourselves and it brings a tremendous sense of freedom and wellbeing, um, as all the movies of haver changing life happened to us. So that's why I said yes, yes and no. And both. Um, and I, there's just a little aside thinking about you going back to your family as a practicing twice a year as you're doing, I just want to remind you in the listeners that, um, Buddha and Jesus both had a hard time when they went back to their family. So don't think that it, you know, there's something wrong with you, part of it. So that's why they call it nuclear family. I think some, anyway,

Speaker 2:          01:22:23       uh, the, uh, there's another, I guess it's a word more than a question that I'd love to ask you to define and that is compassion or compassionate. When you use that word or those words, what, what do you mean exactly? Or what would you like it to me and for people?

Speaker 4:          01:22:41       Um, I would like to distinguish compassion from empathy. Um, and I'll use a simple illustration. If you're on the playground and you see a kid being bullied and you feel, oh, that must feel terrible, that hurts, right? That's an empathy. And empathy can be useful. It also can, you can get overwhelmed by empathy if you don't know what to do with it. But there's some way in which you start to feel resonating. You, because we are not limited to these bodies. We are actually a and interconnected system of consciousness. And I'll talk about that a little bit more. Um, uh, in a minute. Um, but we all know whether it's mirror neurons from neuroscience or the field of presence as, as neuro, you know, scientists like Dan Siegel talk about extended presence that we can feel empathy with one another. When someone's sadness, someone's angry, um, someone's hurting.

Speaker 4:          01:23:49       Compassion is the next step. You, you, you see or recognize, you feel, and then you care. You care about it and you want to, if you can do something that helps so that you see the kid being bullied and you realize, um, I want to tell the teacher or the principal, or I want to just walk over there and, and say something or intervene to help stop it. And so compassion, it's called the quivering of the heart, um, when it wants to move to alleviate the suffering of yourself because you can have self compassion. It's very important or those around you. And it's born into, and the earliest studies of infants, um, you know, at Yale and various places like that show that even very, very, very small children have this resonance and this kind of care. Um, and so it's not shut down in us.

Speaker 4:          01:24:46       We were a species that's interconnected and we care for one another. And this is your birthright, this natural, natural compassion. And through practice in meditation, you can reawaken it, you can extend it, um, and it can become your way of living and moving in the world. Um, as a little aside, and I'll just bookmark this one, um, just got back from a conference with our dear friend Adam Gozali, our mutual friend, Richie Davidson, who is another of the most famous neuroscientists, especially in this area. Um, and a number of other, some contemplative lives and neuroscientists and some technologists from the valley and VC talking about how to build compassion into our interface with the technological world, compassion tech. Um, and in from starting from the very simplest things of projects, like can you build a fitbit for compassion, where instead of your body where you can either no moments of care around you are in yourself or be prompted to care for yourself, you know, or when you say to Siri or Alexa, you know, I'm feeling lonely, or you know, and so forth.

Speaker 4:          01:26:02       Um, what kind of response do you get from them? From the algorithms and all of that because the UK, England, uh, just, uh, uh, pointed their first minister of loneliness for the country and I think it was a joke, but it's not like an old Beatles song. All the lonely people, there are 10 million lonely people in England, Dave estimated and this minister has got cut and it's, you know, it's for isolation and loss of capacity and health and all kinds of reasons that loneliness makes things way worse. But there's some way in which compassion is that which connects us. And it's a beautiful thing. Even if you walked on the street and you see someone, you know who's struggling and so forth, it doesn't mean you have to fix the whole world. That's not your job. That would be egotistical. But you can reach your hand out in men, the things that you can, you can tend to things that you can and you can do it not because, oh, you pity them, those poor people, but because they're your family, you recognize that we're common humanity. We're in this together.

Speaker 3:          01:27:15       I'd like to build on that and preface it with a comment on the tech. So you mentioned collaborating with Adam and he's discussing the potential of combining or utilizing technology to help people to develop and harness compassion. And some folks listening might be like, oh, come on, that's so pie in the sky. But I'd like to point out that you've already collaborated successfully with Adam on software like meditrain, uh, m, e, d, I, t, r, a, I n, which was one of the tools Adam has used in his end of one or end of two experiments in a rejuvenating his mental capacity to, I want to say in his twenties and Adams Adams, one of those guys, you can't tell if he's 28 or 45 and he's just a, a silver Fox will always looks young. So I don't know how old he is, but he's not, he's not 22.

Speaker 3:          01:28:07       Uh, but the Mediterranean was one of the tools that he utilized. And uh, I don't remember the name that he used for this run of experiments. You might know that the training that he did neuro man or something like that was very, very successful. Uh, so you already have a track record of collaborating successfully with neuroscientists and technologists. The on the, the compassion front, I'd love to use that as a segue to loving kindness. And by way of personal example, I failed but failed as a strong word. I quit, I stopped meditating after many, many attempts, had very absurdly high number of false starts over many years. Uh, and it's, it, it really stuck after a number of experiments and experiences. I had a doing three or four day trainings with say, transcendental meditation and having the Social Accountability, being accountable to someone else's. Very helpful. But another turning point was experimenting with loving kindness meditation.

Speaker 3:          01:29:14       And I think in part it's exceeded because it took the focus off of me, me, me, and allowed me to focus on others. But I'd like to read a brief paragraph from a profile of you in the New York. New York Times is from 2014 and feel free to correct anything that is incorrect, but I'll, I'll give it a read first. And I quote in the West, Kornfield says, quote, we encounter a lot of intense striving ambition and a lot of self criticism, self judgment and self hatred and quote concerned. He initially turned to the Dalai Lama for advice, but self hatred was such a foreign concept to the Tibetan Buddhist that he wasn't able to offer any real insight. Over time, cornfield and his colleagues began to believe that Americans needed particular meditation closely. I'm sorry, practice closely linked to the concepts of self forgiveness and loving kindness. A training and the unconditional acceptance of imperfection without such a foundation says cornfield meditation can easily become, and this is the part that I underlined and starred without this foundation says cornfield meditation can easily become yet another form of striving quote, another thing you do to make yourself better and quote instead of a path to true contentment. So could you please describe for folks, uh, what loving kindness meditation practice looks like and elaborate in any way that you feel might be, might be useful or helpful for folks?

Speaker 4:          01:30:37       Yeah. Um, and, um, that meeting, which was some decades ago with the Dalai Lama, yeah. He didn't understand when we talked about south hatred, he couldn't eat. There is no word for it back and forth with his translator. What does this mean? Fine. He looked up, he said, man, but this is a mistake. Why would anyone do this? But then he asked, how many of you, there was a group of us who were teachers have experienced this and almost everyone raised their hand. So we see that when people begin in our culture and in the west to meditate or to try to in turn inward really, that, um, it's very common to encounter a lot of self criticism, self judgment, or even self hatred. Um, and you know, they're all the causes from are, these are all kind of conditioning that we got from, from our childhood, our education and so forth.

Speaker 4:          01:31:35       But what it means is that you're sitting there saying, I'm not doing it right. I'm no good. You turn meditation into one other, one of the things that you don't do right cause you can't control your mind. The truth is that you can't control your mind easily. That's not the point. Um, there's a different way of approaching your mind which gives you tremendous capacities, but it's not, oh I have to stop my thinking. I don't want to have these fields and I hate having all these judgments. I don't want to be so judgmental islands thought I hate this judging mind. What does it just more judgment. So instead is you become first able to become the loving witness, the, the mindful loving awareness that says, oh this is the judging mind and it's been trying to protect me. Thank you for trying to protect me.

Speaker 4:          01:32:22       I don't need you now. Thank you. Um, all of a sudden there's a distance from the, from the painful or destructive or, or um, self critical thoughts simply by witnessing them with loving awareness and acknowledging them. This becomes the gateway to the practice of lovingkindness and self. Self compassion. Um, and very often people can't do it for themselves. They feel that's too much of a stretch. Like why would I wish myself well, it feels egotistical. Um, and so the way that this practice, um, begins for, uh, skillfully for, for such folks is instead to think of someone that you really care about a lot. Um, and to picture them, remember them, put them in your mind's eye and feel the kind of well wishing you would want for them. You know, may they be protected and safe from difficulty. May they be held in loving kindness, may they be well, healthy, strong, and you wish them that may they be happy.

Speaker 4:          01:33:38       And you do this for a time, a kind of inner well-wishing. Um, and also maybe you feel as you think of this person that you care about, if you let yourself also tune in to the measure of sorrows they have, the struggles that every human being has, you know, and it tenderizes your heart as you think of them because you don't want them to suffer. You feel the kind of rising of compassion and care. So may they hold themselves and compassion. May they be safe and protected and well, and you do that with water to people that you care about for a time. And then you can imagine even as I'm describing this, and you following your own heart, you could imagine these two loved ones looking back at you it with the same kindness and saying, just as you wish us protection and safety and happiness and wellbeing and oh and compassion, they gaze at you and they say you too.

Speaker 4:          01:34:42       May you be safe and protected. May you be filled with tender compassion for yourself and kindness. May you too be healthy and well, may you be happy. They want you to be happy. I think about, and when I'm doing this, I'm visualizing some loved ones and I know that as I do it, I can feel they want that for me. And then finally, as you feel that from these loved ones, you can put your hand on your body or your heart even if you like, and take it in and, and then begin to realize that you can wish this for yourself. May I hold all of the joys and sorrows of my life with tenderness and kindness. May I hold my struggles with compassion? May I be filled with loving kindness and loving awareness. May I be safe and protected? May I be well strong, are healed.

Speaker 4:          01:35:44       And as you repeat these simple interventions that have been done for thousands of years, it's as if your cells are listening. And this is the research of people like Liz Blackburn and Alyssa Apple Hoo Hoo. There's blackboard and got the Nobel prize for discovering the telomerase and the telomeres mirrors at the end of the caps and the DNA. Um, it turns out that your cells listen to your heart and that to your intention, that consciousness affects your body. And little by little, even though it can bring up its opposite, I hate myself, I'm never be good enough. And you see all those and you just say thank you for trying to protect me. I appreciate that. May I be well, may I be safe, may I be held in love. And little by little like water on a stone, it starts to soften the places that are holding your lack of self forgiveness, your lack of care and love and kindness starts to grow in you.

Speaker 4:          01:36:45       And it's a very beautiful practice. There's lots of places you can find it on my, in my work and teachers like Sharon Salzberg and family children and Tara Brock and [inaudible] and so forth. Are there any particular, do you have any guided, loving kindness meditations or audio that you can recommend people listen to? I do. Um, and uh, I don't know. They could go on my website, Jack kornfield.com. I think they will be on there. I do know for sure I have a whole series of great programs with sounds true with soundstrue.com that include, um, meditations on the mine vast as the sky meditations on compassion and loving kindness. Um, and I did a book, one of the books I've done is called, um, a lamp in the darkness and it contains, uh, I think eight or nine different, um, guided practices that you can get either with it on the CD, but you can get it as a download basically.

Speaker 4:          01:37:48       Um, and sounds true also has that and has a compassion practice and a grounding practice in a kind of a vast sky like mine practice and so forth. So you, so you can look off, look for all of those. Wonderful. The beautiful thing is that you can learn this. And I was couple of years ago invited to be part of the first White House Buddhist leadership gathering. Um, there were 120 Buddhist leaders from around the country, from different communities. I don't think that's going to happen again very soon, but there it was. Um, and uh, one good hope and um, we talked most of the communities did beautiful things that were involved in the soup kitchens and tending the homeless in projects, you know, um, to support healing for whether it was malaria. Are there other diseases in different other parts of the world and so forth.

Speaker 4:          01:38:46       All kinds of great stuff. And certainly meditation. And when I got to talk, which was kind of a summary talk toward, uh, toward the end of it, um, I mentioned that in the historical record, whether it's true or not, that the techs and so forth describe the Buddha meeting with kings and princes and ministers and so forth. And probably if the Buddha were or around now would go to the White House if you were invited. He certainly would have bet with Obama and who knows. And now, um, Eh, end, he had advice about why society, which he would give to leaders and you'd say, if you can train your people to meet one another with respect to listen, with respect to differences and to come together peacefully listening to one another and then, then you're pro society will prosper and not decline. And if your society tends to the vulnerable among them, the, the young people, the old people, those who are sick, it will prosper and not decline.

Speaker 4:          01:39:53       And if your society tends to the environment around it in a healthy way, it will prosper and not decline. And so these are, these are principles of compassion and why society that you could read perhaps in a number of great traditions from the Iroquois nation or from the Taoist sages. But here's the beautiful piece. Yes, these are, these are good things, meeting and harmony and discussing and harmony and being respectful for one another and so forth. Um, there are practices that you can teach and learn that develop this capacity so that in our elementary schools now, you know, through organizations like castle, which is a consortium for social and emotional learning that's worked in, you know, 10,000 schools. Um, kids learn social and emotional learning. They learn compassion, um, and it changes their lives. They're better academically. Um, and all these kids carry that, you know, the troubles of our times.

Speaker 4:          01:40:58       They hear the news, they see the trauma even in their own family. Um, to teach you how to steward your own hard, um, from when you're young. And then these capacities are now being incorporated as we know, mindfulness based stress reduction in clinics and hospitals in businesses in, you know there's the mindfulness teachers that for the, when the Seattle Seahawks won the championship or the the Chicago Bulls in the La Lakers when there were championship teams, they had a, they had a meditation coach, a mindfulness coach, George Mumford, a good friend that these capacities can be learned wherever we are and they transform our life. It's not just by accident or that you have this beautiful experience on the mountains or making love, but you can make that alive for you through these trainings every day, every part of your life.

Speaker 3:          01:41:53       Jack, there was a question I was planning on asking at some point. Anyway, and I think this is a good segue, which is how can you get a busy person hooked on my fullness practice and what would be a first step or how to start and since we're talking about loving kindness, I would like to give a bit of a hard sell for loving kindness. Meditation is one option because I recall, perhaps it was two years ago, I was really beating myself up and for people who don't know this about me, I've spent the majority of my life being, uh, the, the, my own worst enemy in terms of inner dialogue and be extremely brutal and hypercritical and load some of myself, uh, in, in so many different respects. And I was going through a particularly intense and difficult time with that inner critic, just ruthlessly, uh, beating myself up.

Speaker 3:          01:42:46       And at that point, another friend of mine, a shade Manc 10, who created the search inside yourself, classic Google. He was a very early engineer, which became w the most oversubscribed class for employees at Google, uh, recommended that I take a look at lovingkindness meditation and, and I didn't have any particularly sophisticated approach to it, but I decided with nothing to lose and that I was having so much trouble during that period, sitting still and trying to focus on say, the breath or anything like that, that at night this was happened to coincide with book deadline. Probably, uh, not pure coincidence that my beating myself up was exacerbated during that time. That was a few years ago and I began at night, uh, in my case in a, when I would take a shower at night or sit in a sauna, I ha I very often go to hotels to write, which is something Maya Angelou and a few others that convinced me it might be a good idea, uh, that I would consider to people.

Speaker 3:          01:43:48       Just like you had mentioned two people I really cared for and wish them well, that's all I did. And a shaded said to me, Mang is usually what I would call him, that at one point a woman in one of his classes had done this for a one day at work. Every hour on the hour, she would just look out of her office and wish someone well that she could see in our mind's eye for 60 seconds or so. And she says, she said it was her best day of work in seven years. And I found that unbelievable. So I decided to try it myself. And that week of just spending maybe two to four minutes at night before going to bed ended up being one of the most blissful weeks, uh, in memory. Certainly at that point, uh, in several years it was really profound and I couldn't pick out any other variable that had changed.

Speaker 3:          01:44:38       Uh, so for me, I just want to, for people who are listening and saying, ah, you know what, I'm type a driven, super hyper competitor. This doesn't apply to me that it very well could apply to you. And that by taking a little bit of the harmful edge off, you don't automatically remove your competitive edge. Uh, and in fact, I would argue just as you mentioned that the bowls and so on used to have or still do, but you used to have a mindfulness coach for competitive advantage that that it can be another tool in your toolkit and doesn't take you out of the game, so to speak. It just makes you more aware of the games that you're playing. So that's a long sort of infomercial sales pitch that I wanted to just make sure I got in, uh, because I discounted a lot of these practices for a very long time because I thought it would at best be a waste of time and at worse, uh, take away some of my skills or tendencies that allowed me to get to where I am. Um, so that, that, that is more of a confessional than a question. But I would love to hear your thoughts. Any additional thoughts on, on loving kindness meditation, but also any additional thoughts on how, if you wanted to get a, a busy, uh, maybe even an impatient person hooked on mindfulness practice, what first steps or approaches you might suggest?

Speaker 4:          01:46:05       Uh, so a lot of different questions sort of woven into what you said. Um, and the first is that there's a kind of misunderstanding in our culture that love is a weakness and it's not, there is a way in which, um, it's the force that can, it probably the only force that can meet the level of aggression or violence and other such things that are happening. And, um, you know, in the world, um, it's the power that lets mothers lift cars off their children, or it'll let somebody like Dr. Martin Luther King Stand. Um, you know, after his church was bombed and children were killed and say, we will meet your violence with soul force. We will not harm you, but we will love you so deeply that we will not only transform ourselves, but we will transform you in the process. And so the notion that love is somehow a weakness, um, I think we do everything out of love.

Speaker 4:          01:47:05       We want to be loved even in our, you know, ambition and our desire for, for success underneath it, um, is, you know, we want to be well, we want to be, find our happiness and that's part of part of love. So it's, it's actually a power. And my colleague and friend, um, west Nessc or when to interview Gary Snyder a couple of years ago, Gary is a pure literary prize winning poet, um, and environmentalist for 50 years when writing about bio regionalism and one of our great kind of elders in this environmental movement, he said, Gary, what do you have to say to us now that oceans are rising, the world climate is changing, you know, the hotter and hotter the species extinction. And Gary looked back and he said, don't feel guilty if you're going to save it. Don't save it out of guilt or anger or fear.

Speaker 4:          01:48:01       Those are the very things that are actually making the world worse. Save it. Cause he would love it because it's part of you because it, and that's the, that is the, is the power. Um, whether you're starting a company but also it's not just that you, you know, some vision, okay, now I'm going to become this wealthy playboy or whatever, you know, a Zillionaire, um, that what is your life mean for you and what do you really want? And when you listen, there is something in you and it's part of your birthright, um, to both be able to give your gifts but also to love and be loved in return. And it's turns out that it's a power. So then what you're talking about is that, um, it doesn't take much to begin the training and you're, you know, two minutes or four minutes in the evening or this woman at her work taking once an hour, you know, 30 seconds or a minute to look at somebody there and offer a well-wishing can transform everything.

Speaker 4:          01:49:05       Um, for people who want the practical support because it is hard to do on your own if you go to sounds true.com and look up, um, the programs that I have first, there's a 40 day program called mindfulness daily, which is 15 minutes a day or 12 minutes a day depending on the segment that both gives instructions in mindfulness, loving awareness and loving kindness practice. Um, and it's 12 or 15 minutes a day and by the end of those 40 days, you really have learned the inner skills and then it builds up. There's, and then a deeper training called power of awareness. And for those who are interested were about to open an online teacher training for people interested in mindful, um, in, in passing along mindfulness and loving kindness to others. Jack, just to interject for one second for people listening, I will also link to all of these resources in the show notes, which you can find at tim.blog/podcast.

Speaker 4:          01:50:03       So you don't necessarily have to remember all these things. You can go to the URL and uh, we will have direct links to these resources. Uh, sorry to interrupt Jack just wanted to mention that for people listening and with it. Then there is also of the programs there. There's one called guided meditations. That's, you know, a download. It's like 10 bucks or something and it has a loving kindness practice of compassion, practice of forgiveness practice. Um, I think it may even have a joy practice, uh, and and so forth. So you can, and it's really helpful to have guided meditations at first cause otherwise your attention, we have a very short attention span in modern society. Albert Einstein, at least according to scientific American said, if you can drive safely while kissing a girl, you're simply not giving the kiss the attention it deserves. And we are in this kind of multitasking world with our devices and we've forgotten how to tend to our own hearts.

Speaker 4:          01:51:04       We've forgotten how in some ways to really be present for one another and more importantly for our own life. And so getting guided meditations is tremendously helpful. And doing these little mini practices that you talk about one minute, two minutes, several times a day, um, can transform you now. Oh, I was just going to mention to people also, if you look at behavioral change, if you look at Bj Fogg, formerly of the persuasion laboratory at Stanford, you look at Diet, a dietary change, any of these things, uh, do, doing less than you think you're capable of doing is a really good long term strategy in terms of starting off rigging the game so that you can win in the beginning so that your pass fail mark and your mind is a really, really low hurdle. So I just wanted to reiterate, guided, guided meditation. Don't white knuckle in the beginning I'd make it beautiful, easy as possible.

Speaker 4:          01:52:02       And that the same principle from the, from the ancient, you know, texts say that you start and the easiest way for some people, kindness for themselves seems impossible. But then you pick a child you care about or someone else or even when you do go to yourself, you think of yourself when you were an innocent child, um, and wish yourself well. The game is to do wear whatever naturally opens the gateway. Whatever's the easiest. For some people it's their dog. You'd come home and you know the, the most nonjudgmental being in their life wags its tail and loves you and it doesn't care. You know what's going on in your head. So you take the avenue that most naturally opens your heart and then you do this just a little at a time as you said. And it doesn't take long. But the other thing that's important is that sometimes as you do it, it can actually display or show you the hypercritical nature of your mind, the shame that you carry.

Speaker 4:          01:53:01       Um, the, you know, the self judgment or self loathing. And so then you, then you say, well what do you do then? Or it brings, it brings up its opposite is that's the place that you just breathe and hold all that stuff with kindness because this is our humanity and we all have some of that. And the point isn't to get rid of it or judge yourself for having it or try to fix it. It's almost as if you put your hand on your heart and you say, you know, this is like mindful self compassion of deep training. This is part of the measure of struggles that I've been given, like every human being, these things have tried to protect me and now I can hold them with tenderness and say, alright, you know, thank you, but I don't need your help anymore. I can be kind to myself. And, and, and, and in that way you're not trying to fix yourself or perfect yourself. Um, if anything, you're trying to perfect your love. This is Jack. I want to do, we

Speaker 3:          01:53:58       give you credit for help that you gave me and also tactical advice that you gave me during the 10 day silent retreat. You give me a lot, but I want it, I want to highlight one that's related to what you just said. I was going through a very, very difficult time, particularly a days seven, eight, nine and you, you gave me the advice that you just mentioned. And there's, there's one component I want to really underscore for people. And that is when you're, for instance, trying to do loving kindness meditation and instead you get the opposite or you get this self ridicule, uh, who are you to try it, to meditate in this self indulgent way. This is ridiculous. Or this voice starts to pop up that is angry or hateful, whatever it might be. The process of not simply dismissing it or fighting against it, but recognizing it as a coping strategy that helped you in the past in some way that you developed.

Speaker 3:          01:55:03       Because in my case, you know, the rage was a fuel that if I had without, which I probably would never have left long island where I had friends who later overdosed on opiates and so on. So it, it was a gift in a way and the tool, and as you said, you can thank that response or that part of yourself and then put it, and I remember you recommended even visualizing, and please correct me if I'm wrong or elaborate, but visualize taking that part of you that is a coping strategy, thanking it and then putting it say on a shelf, uh, where you can use it later if need be along with say, other icons are figures who, uh, whether it's Buddha or other that that you recognize as wise. And then continuing with the meditation so that thanking that part of yourself for the function that it wants serve, even if it is not serving you now, was such a key insight for me that then helped me to, uh, manage my internal states or, or observe and appreciate my internal states for the next several days where I really felt like I was lost at that point.

Speaker 3:          01:56:17       So that was a really direct tool that helped me tremendously.

Speaker 4:          01:56:21       Mostly. Yeah. Thank you for bringing it up because it's so important for people when we come to that hypercritical, shame. Shame place. Um, we're, we feel very vulnerable and we've been identified with it. Um, because you needed it. I needed these things for survival. So, and if you try to get rid of this stuff, you just end up in a fruitless battle against yourself. And it's just more judgment. So what you described with saying, thank you for helping me survive. I appreciate it. Let me put it on the shelf or the altar. I'll put it in the lap of the Buddha or whoever, you know, the goddess of infinite compassion. You hold it for me. If I need it, I'll pull it back. Um, and that sense that this isn't who you are, it doesn't describe who you are. It isn't who you are. It was, it was a strategy because we're vulnerable beings and you were tender as a child, you know, and you had to make sure you could survive.

Speaker 4:          01:57:17       Thank you for that. And now I have a different capacity. Um, and let me just talk about that capacity a little bit because the capacity for presence, um, and the great heart of compassion that's said to be your birthright, um, is a really mysterious thing. Talk about identity. Um, and when my, um, youngest brother's wife Esta was dying of cancer, um, and she was just a beautiful being and I spent quite a bit of time with her and with my brother. Um, I had gone home, she was close to dying. I'd gone home to sleep and I want to get up early in hurry back cause it was very close and I, uh, got my car, I had to stop the drug store to pick up a prescription, um, hurriedly running, you know, dashing through the aisles and so forth. And I'm at the checkout counter and all of a sudden my whole body relaxed and I thought, oh, Hesta died.

Speaker 4:          01:58:21       And I got out to the car and I called my brother. I said, how's it going? He said, oh, as to died a few minutes ago. And I said, I know, you know, I'll be there shortly. Um, and we've all had these experiences. If I ask in a room, how many have had this particular kind of where you knew someone died when they died, you know, a quarter of the hands will go up. Why is this? It's because who we are is not this body. We are, we are the consciousness itself. And so with all of these practices, what they allow us to do is to step out of what's called the small sense of self or the body of fear and reconnect with the, with a field of connection, interdependence of compassion. Um, and to take our history and to honor it, but not be bound by it.

Speaker 4:          01:59:14       One of my favorite stories is a rum dos. Again, this wonderful spiritual teacher in the early years when he came back from being with his guru in India, uh, he was sitting up there and teaching, um, you know, devotional practices and meditation practices and he had a beard and white robes and uh, and, and beads and you sort of in the guru outfit and a woman in the front row raised their hand and say, rob does around us. Aren't you Jewish? What's with this Hindu stuff? And Rhonda, I said, well, yes I am actually. Yeah, it was bar Mitzvah'd is as I was too. Um, and there are many things I love about the Jewish spiritual tradition, the generosity of it, the, the Kabbalah. All did great. You know, teachings on the many stages in states of consciousness. The Hasidic masters who were like Zen Masters. And then he paused and looked at and he said, but remember I'm only Jewish on my parents' side.

Speaker 4:          02:00:20       And there is something both Whiti, which he was, but also profound about it because we are not just our parental history or, or the historical circumstances of this place and body that we were born into. And something in us knows this so that when you look at the, there's a wonderful book that came out last year, the year before called the book of Joy, which was a conversation between the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Tutu. And both of them have marvelous laughs. I think people go to hear the Dalai Lama by the tens of thousands, not just for the Tibetan teaching, some of which are actually hard to understand. Um, or even the fact that he's this Nobel prize winning, you know, world figure. I think people go to hear him laugh that somebody who's carried so much suffering from the loss of his country where he can't return and the burning of temples and texts and all of those things, and he and two had a week together when they were asked and to, and this created this book, how can you be joyful?

Speaker 4:          02:01:27       How can you laugh like this when you've lived through apartheid and the death of so many people around you? And Dalai Lama, they banter back and forth and like brothers. And the Dalai Lama says, so much has been taken from me. He know they've taken our sacred texts, they've taken our ability to make prayers in public. They've taken, you know, um, so much of our culture, why should I let them take my happiness? And then two, two, starts to laugh and giggle and say, you know, I've been through so much, um, but I am not going to let myself live in that place. I'm going to let myself live in that which affirms life and in a, in a kind of profound, a joy that we made it that were still alive, that we can contribute, that we can be here in this beautiful earth. And this shift of consciousness is what's needed for the world.

Speaker 4:          02:02:22       Um, because we look honestly, um, no amount of technology alone is going to save us nano technology and space technology and biotechnology and worldwide web, Internet, computer, a super computer technology is going to stop continuing warfare and racism and tribalism and environmental destruction. Those are happening based on consciousness of the human heart. And so we are now, you know, these have, you've made these enormous developments outwardly where you have the Great Library of Alexandria and your smartphone in your pocket along with it million cat you tubes or whatever. But there it is, it's all in there. And then, um, what we need is, um, collectively to develop a transformation inwardly of, of our inner life that is parallel to this enormous outer transformation. Um, and that's that, you know, one of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff some years ago said, we are a nation of nuclear giants and ethical infants. You know, you know how old, I don't know how old humanity is, but it's time, you know, um, it's time to grow up. So, so that this, this work that we're talking about is both individual. But as you learn to meet your own life with greater understanding and compassion, um, it empowers you to move through the world in a different way and to help others do the same. And then you get the kind of joy of two, two in the Dye Lama that you're somehow part of an awakening. That humanity now needs more than ever.

Speaker 2:          02:04:08       Jack, I'd love to ask you, these interviews are always driven by some self interest. I always have somebody issue or challenge or problem that I'm trying to figure out. So I reached out to someone like you to help me do it. But I record the conversation, uh, as, as we chatted about before we hit record, and you know, this already, but the last several years have been very, very important for me in terms of addressing certain traumas. In the last eight weeks in

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       have been transformative and a lot of beautiful ways. And the periods, the, the, the duration of periods, uh, within which I don't berate or attack myself have become longer. But there are still times when the wheels fly off the car. And this last week has been one such example. Uh, and I tend to, when I make a mistake or feel like I'm backsliding or relapsing to compound the problem by beating myself up, which then I start to, then I beat myself up about beating myself up. And you know where that goes. So let me paint a picture. So I, I found out recently that my Japanese host father, and I've been in touch with this family since I was 15. I'm very, very close to them, 40 now. And I found out that he just was admitted, uh, because of the host mother sent me an email to the hospital with liver cancer.

Speaker 3:          02:05:37       And, and this there, they don't have the details yet. I just sent a followup email. They don't know what the prognosis is exactly, but, uh, needless to say, the worst case scenarios are, are certainly being conjured in my mind or the potential of those and then, uh, simultaneously have been contending with. And I believe you have some experience with this, uh, contending with a what should be a very simple construction project of a cabin up in the mountains. Uh, and it is, it has been delayed and delayed and delayed and there've been cost overruns in cost over in cost overruns and his promises made promises, broken expectations, set expectations missed. And a friend of mine called with a whole new slew of problems yesterday related to this place. And I lost my shit, for lack of a better term. I mean there, there are many other things going on simultaneously.

Speaker 3:          02:06:34       But I got really pissed and I was like, you know what, this extending the olive branch, being understanding can't gambit is not working with these people. Like I, I need to, I need to, I need to take out the baseball bat and like pull old Tim off the shelf who was just this like juggernaut head through brick walls and be like, listen, fuck face. Like if you don't do a, B, c, d and e here, these are going to be the consequences. And then I'm like, well wait, I'm supposed to be compassionate, but how do I not be a pushover? And it turns into this big dramatic play inside my head and then I wait, then this is going to end soon. I'm not going to keep going. But what I then often do is self medicate with caffeine. And I think it's a way of feeling productive without actually being productive. And it also creates so much volume on the noise. I think I use it to tune out a lot of feelings. Uh, so when someone relapses or has this kind of experience, what do you suggest to them? I mean, is there, uh, is

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       there a particular pattern interrupt or approach that you've found helpful for regaining footing? Oh, so there's a number of things to say. Um, yeah. First of all, um, you could call it relapsing or you could just call it like, yeah. Is being human. One of the Po, the most most beloved poet in Japan was a zen master named Rio Kahn. And there's a two line verse that of his that I particularly find fitting for this where he wrote last year of foolish monk this year. No change. You know, and you can sort of feel the humor and the tenderness. Um, and, and there's a way in which you see your personality, that point, you know, you have a body and you have this particular body you're born with and you can transform it in certain ways within the limits of the body that you were given. Um, and similarly have a personality.

Speaker 4:          02:08:37       And anybody who has a number of kids realizes that you don't come in Tabula Rasa, that you actually, this kid is born. It has this kind of temperament. So we have a personality and just like you don't want to look too closely to the Bot at the body. Sometimes you don't want to look back closely. The personality either. Um, you know, it has its foibles and its fears and you know, all of that. Um, and so you start to kind of look at it and say, oh, now there's a really good example of how neurotic I can get. Thank you. Thank you. I'm pretty sure reminding me, you know, and then you get a little sort of like the keeper of the zoo, a little more tender with this, those kinds of creatures. So that's, that's it's bringing in the nonjudgment, you know, or loving kindness for the way that you actually are and not your ideal.

Speaker 4:          02:09:23       Um, or bringing compassion, you could say, yeah, this is a tough one in this triggered, I get triggered. So what? Um, now the other thing is if I have the same experience when we had a big remodel of our house when I was some years ago, um, and raising my daughter and, and in my first marriage and we were supposed to go and teach and travel in Europe and this guy who was a good contractor, but you know, everything of course gets more expensive and you know, news and it just kept getting slowed down and I said, you weren't going to get this done so we could make these decision for went to Europe and it's not happening. You've got to hurry up. I do that like three or four different times and it doesn't happen. Finally I go in, I get pissed and I say, listen, you know, you said this in our contract, it was going to be done by and if you don't fucking get this done by the time of day, I'm going to haul your ass in court and sue you because I need this done and I'm not going to pay you that God damn money.

Speaker 4:          02:10:19       Oh. He looked at me and he said, Oh, you really want this done, don't you? I said, yes. Next day there's a huge crew. It starts to compound that. I realized, okay, what I've been sort of talking meditation speak Nice, get it done. He was a fucking contractor and I decided to keep, I had to speak contractor ease, get the God damn job done or I'll haul your ass. Oh, okay. I got it. Yeah, I'll, I'll send a team over. And that's all it took. So there's something playful about that as well. It's not that you can't, I've seen the Dalai Lama get angry at people. It's not that you can't use that power and that understanding, um, you know, when it's necessary to get to the very strong or forceful, um, uh, and you don't have to judge yourself unless you hurt people. And then of course, that's the misuse of it. Um, but it's just, it's part of being human. Um,

Speaker 3:          02:11:16       is there, so you say to yourself when, no, I think, I don't know. You are, uh, certainly in person and any, with any contact I've had of you with you. One of the most compassionate people I've ever met. And I, I, I've, I don't use that word very much, but your, your presence of listening and being with someone is really incredible. Uh, and I don't know how much of that is an in intrinsic versus trained, but for better or for worse, you're coming out of the womb. I've been very, uh, impatient since day one, so I worry about, I can get my, it seems like my default is the yell is, is speaking contractor ease to, uh, more than just the way the wayward contractor who's, uh, who's putting off work. Is there some, when I feel that the sensations of anger beginning to bubble up, is there something that you would suggest as self talk or just a temporary pumping of the brakes to make it an informed decision versus just a lashing out?

Speaker 4:          02:12:37       Well, um, I could give you an answer, but in a minute I'm going to guide you in a little practice so that you can find the, find the better answer. First I just want to say that, um, that anger, you know, yes, it's your habit or maybe your temperament, that's energy. And there's nothing wrong with energy. You know, it's, it's the power of that. Let you do all the kinds of things you've, you've done in your life that are tremendously, you know, creative or resourceful or daring or whatever kinds of things. So you want to respect, okay, I'm getting filled with energy and you might be, then you want to lash out. But first you want to respect that energy. Wow, let me feel this in my buddy who anger, how big is it? Woo. Okay, then your question is then your question is, what can I do to modulate it?

Speaker 4:          02:13:23       I could give you, you know, okay, take some breaths, ground yourself, look at that other person number, blah, blah, blah. But instead, as we were talking, um, let yourself, um, picture a circumstance recently, it might've been with your, you know, the contractor is doing your cabin or something else and you're, you know, that uprising of, um, the injustice of it and how right you are, you know, and how you're going to get this goddamn thing done. You know, and how you have to have to be hard and strong. You feel all of that and feel that energy in your body. First thing is just remember what it felt like. And now you're becoming the, the kind of mindful loving witness of it and saying, wow, this is a lot of energy. Can you feel that? And remember that? Okay. Now, next step, um, is that, um, the wisest, you know, figure you can imagine, maybe it's the Buddha or, or maybe it's, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          02:14:26       It doesn't, it doesn't matter. Some great master martial arts master, you know, who's mastered themselves as well as their are, comes to you and let yourself imagine somebody who's going to teach you how to manage this powerful energy and see who appears, somebody appears to you. Um, and first they look at you and they smile and then they say, yeah, this is really, this is the big energy. Um, and they appreciate you. So instead of saying, Oh, you're a doofus, you know, they say, Oh yeah, you actually, you actually carry some powerful energy. And they acknowledged that they bow to you. Yeah, Tim, you got it all right. And then you say, yeah, but how do I manage this when it takes me over? And so this zen master, whoever comes, reaches under their robe and pulls out a gift for you, which is a clear symbol of exactly what you need in that moment to help you regulate it so that you can keep the energy, but doing it in a way that doesn't cause harm to you or another. And this clear symbol you'll be able to see, to adjust what you need. So let yourself picture the gift that they put in your hand and let yourself imagine. See, envision, picture what it, what it is. And if you can't see it clearly hold it up to the sunlight, you'll be able to, and then let me know what you get. You want me to tell you what it is? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:15:56       All right. So the person who came to mind for me, I went through a few, was the creator of judo. Fascinating guy named Gigo Takano. Really smoke a small guy, uh, who

Speaker 4:          02:16:09       yes. Who could, who could throw all the big guys and smile at the same time. Right,

Speaker 3:          02:16:13       exactly. Changed a lot also in Japanese government. Fascinating guy. The, the symbol, I don't know why this is to be honest, but it's a pyramid the size with, with, with straight edges about little too big to holding your palm. That is uh, uh, blue. It's like a sort of, almost a, a mixture of Scott pure sky blue, like a blue bird blue with a bit of electric blue mixed in and it's sort of a, a smoky vapor that's floating around inside this glass pyramid. I don't, I have no idea why that's the case, but that's what came up.

Speaker 4:          02:16:57       All right. So we'll stay with it. And then there's one more little piece. So he gives you this, this pyramid, um, free associate a little bit on what it might possibly mean cause the assembles or like dream images and they have, they come from a deep place in your psyche. And this pyramid has a message for you. This blue pyramid. Just guess what it might be.

Speaker 3:          02:17:21       I think it's very, very stable. Uh, it's an extremely stable structure. And uh, for me it also, I could imagine it representing power also. It seems like a very powerful symbol in many different cultures. Certainly. Yup. Uh, the blue, the blue is a little easier for me. It's a very cooling, soothing color where, uh, certainly red is the, the Colorado CCA with a fire with the, the uh, hi, uh, a resonance anger energy would be more of a red fire element. Uh, so the blue would be a, a cooling or countering balancing force for that.

Speaker 4:          02:18:09       All right. So now what I want you to do is imagine taking this blue pyramid gift, which represents a kind of extreme stability, um, and also a kind of power and cooling that's given to you by Jugaad Oconto and taking this into your body so that there you are filled with this energy and anger. You know, this huge wave of, um, you let that be there and you take this pyramid in and you let that energy be inside this stable, grounded place of power and feel what it's like to be inside this blue pyramid with this energy and feel how it feel, how to, it affects it. Just notice as if they're, you're in that circumstance. And now I'm remembering I am the blue pyramid with the, and what do you, you know, what does it feel like

Speaker 3:          02:19:03       wife, the Ma, the most noticeable thing. And uh, you know, I wonder of course how much of this is the, the actual visualization versus the timeout I permit myself to have, but others, there's very often a tightness on the left side of my chest, right by the sternum. And I feel when I start getting a wound up. And that is absent when after taking this gift and then visualizing it being incorporated.

Speaker 4:          02:19:36       So that dissipates while you're practicing and you know, and, and you know this very well in athletics, that yes, you practice things, but other times you also practice envisioning whether it's playing piano or whether it's, you know, some, some Olympic training that some of the times you just do it, um, in through visualization and it activates a lot of the same neural circuitry. So here you're starting to get the feeling of what it's like to be in the middle of this upwelling of anger and so forth. And then taking a couple of breaths and feeling the Blue Pyramid and the connection with the earth and the stability of it and the power then of that presence that cools you and allows the anger to be there but not in the same uncontrolled way. Now there's one more thing and that is if you imagine again, you got Oakano, I believe you said his name is, he comes, he comes up to you after giving you this gift. And he touches you kindly on the shoulder and he has a few words of advice of how to handle this powerful energy that comes up in you because he knows all about it. And what does he whisper into your ear constantly? Well, he whispers this, this, this came to mind immediately.

Speaker 3:          02:20:57       He, he says zen, you'll cuisine y'all, which is, uh, you know, I, I still have this actually there too. He has many famous quotes, but he, he has, you might consider proverbs short aphorisms that I, I've actually carried with me since I was 15, but they're packed. They're packed away somewhere. I have two of them are on cloth. Uh, and the, the firstest stomata but still made a bot cannot have the thoughts though. It's means basically if you, if you work hard, you will achieve, you will reach your, your target. It's not the best translation, but that's the idea. The other one is then New York was in your, which is effectively the most efficient use of energy. But it could also be the, the best slash most benevolent use of energy. And it's, it's a principle of judo, but it's something that he applied to everything, uh, includes including education. So it would be that very short bite sized aphorism, which is a, and I'm sure some scholars probably disagree with me, but roughly translated here at least as I take it, is the maximum or most efficient use of energy.

Speaker 4:          02:22:14       So take that in, take his, his intention zones and Yoko's annual, um, the benevolent and efficient use of it. Feel that pyramid. And now, um, you were assigned, is that the next, um, five times that this comes with your will, maybe tomorrow or next week or so forth, bringing in the blue pyramids, stable, powerful cooling. So the energy is still there. And then you hear his voice ses and you'll go [inaudible] and you go, oh yeah, I can use this, but I can use it in a benevolent way, um, and try it five times and then then, um, text me, let me know what happened because of that. We're closing the loop. If you do it and see now you're, now you're responsible. If you've agreed that you're going to do it, it's sort of goose. It gooses the game a little bit. You Go, okay now I better do it cause I have to let Jack know where we know what happened and let me know what happened. Well I'll be able to do,

Speaker 3:          02:23:08       be able to use it this week cause I'm flying out to the site of this cabin to meet with everybody and see what,

Speaker 4:          02:23:14       so I'll, I'll have at least five opportunities to do that. Have you have your zen training ahead? I mean the other thing that it's great and then that you can hear in this rather than my giving you a cookie cutter answer is that we actually have the wisdom that we're seeking or that's available. We have it in ourselves. I mean you didn't have to fly to, you know, Kyoto and getting your time machine to go back and see did you go to Ocado, um, you know, or whoever it happens to be the di La or whoever happens to come to you. Um, the booter or, or some other great figure that actually the goddess of compassion that we carry that wisdom in our own heart. And part of what these contemplative trainings do is they give us access just by taking a little, little pause.

Speaker 4:          02:24:07       It didn't take you 30 seconds. Okay? He appears, what do I do? Oh, here's how my body would feel. What, what perspective should I bring up? Here's efficient and benevolent use of energy. Okay? Now I remember. So these answers for the, for the questions of the psyche in the heart don't require going somewhere. They ask us to quiet and begin to listen. And as you do, then you discover your own and your own inherent wisdom and your own compassion as well because the, the benevolent use that he offers to you, where does that live? It lives in Tim. It lives in you.

Speaker 3:          02:24:52       S one of the, one of the reasons I've, I've wanted to have you on the podcast for so long is that for me, you represent a very wide spectrum of tools. So you have developed a toolkit that has enabled you to work with everyone from the, uh, the, the seekers of say, the Buddhist, uh, along the lines of the Buddhist traditions to say adolescents who are cutters to war vets with PTSD, missing limbs and so on. You've worked with a very, uh, diverse set of students and a patients maybe even, uh, in, that leads me to my next question, which is, after these experiences abroad, why did you decide to pursue, to come back? Why did you decide to come back to the U s period? And then why did you decide to go back to school and study clinical psychology?

Speaker 4:          02:25:54       So after the first five years in Asia, um, there were certain, there were a few other westerners who would become monks. It was a handful and some were going to stay for the rest of their lives. I've learned a lot. And so that was kind of a choice. Am I just going to stay? And I realized, no, I want a family. I want a lover. You know, I was a young man after all. And just the celibacy for those years was actually pretty hard. Um, I want, um, I want to see if what I have learned really translates into the life back home. I don't want to just leave it. Um, and so I was some wrestling, but it became very clear to me that, uh, that I wasn't fit for the monastery for the rest of my life. I had other, not only other desires, but also and longings.

Speaker 4:          02:26:48       Um, but also we're real interest to say, does this work elsewhere? Um, so I came back, I thought, well, what can I do? I got it, got a couple of jobs and right away, and of course I knew how to do is be a student, but I was now a student of the mind and the heart. And I thought, well, how do I learn more about what happened to me in the monastery? Oh, I'll study western psychology. And so that started me on that particular path and I learned a lot of complimentary things. There are some very good trauma work in the West that I've learned about that really enhances the compassion and loving kindness. And mindfulness things that I learned in, in the temple. Um, and, uh, you know, now I've done a lot of years of teaching eastern or Western psychology together. These principles that I've learned are spreading so widely in western psychology.

Speaker 4:          02:27:40       I went to the largest therapy conference in, in, um, the country, um, in December and down in Anaheim and gave a talk and you know, here's a room full of 3000 or 5,000 people. And I ask how many of you have, um, some experience of meditation or mindfulness practice? And the majority of the hands went up and that would not have happened, you know, 20 or 30 years ago. So, um, the eastern psychology is now becoming more invisibly woven into the understandings of clinical psychology and the West. And it's beautiful. Now I want to say something else. You know, when you talk about working with a variety of population, you know, um, s yes. People in prisons. Yes, that's our kids coming out of gangs, but also, um, CEOs. And there's a dialogue that bill forward. And I did. He was that that time the chairman of Ford Motors.

Speaker 4:          02:28:45       Um, he was actually the CEO perhaps before that, but, and then it was as he's the chairman of Ford Motors and he talks about it too. It was in, um, 2008, I guess when the auto industry was just about to melt down. Um, and uh, he called, we'd had some contact and he's a meditator and he said, you know, I'm going to lose the, my grandfather's company and maybe the whole industry on my watch and it's hard to sleep. What can I do? And we did loving kindness practices and, and, um, mindfulness practices together and so forth. Then I gave him some practices that he could use. Um, and it turns out that at whatever level you're on, whether you're incarcerated or whether you're a CEO or whether you're a returning, that, that these inner capacities that we have to be present without getting lost, to bring a, um, uh, an understanding attention to these energies just as you were doing with anger in ourselves, um, are really, really liberating.

Speaker 4:          02:29:53       And sometimes you know, what's needed, like for the vets are that the people coming back from the war is, I'm also a kind of forgiveness practice in trauma work. Um, and we'll come together and, you know, they'll say things like, um, I can't tell you what I saw because in fact, people don't want to hear the horrors of war. They can't tell the story. And if they do, often they retraumatize themselves and the people around them couldn't bear it. But there's something worse because they'll say, I can't tell you what I had to do. And so it's locked up in their hearts, you know, and then what do they have? They can drink or they can, you know, um, distract themselves or, or, or get in, you know, blind rages periodically. But if you get a room of returning combat vets and hold it with, um, a proper space of understanding and compassion, not only can they tell their stories, which they've never told, but they can listen to one another and say, Oh yeah, I've been there, and all of a sudden they're not so alone anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:31:05       And, and that release of the weight on their heart. Um, so there's a social dimension to trauma where we need to tell the story, um, helps them release also what's carried in their nervous system and in their, and there's some, some correlation between between those two together that becomes very powerful and we need that. We need, I do a lot of teaching of forgiveness practice and self forgiveness and those are also on those, those guided meditations that I teach. And for a lot of us self forgiveness, like self compassion becomes a very, very important way to liberate ourselves from what we had to do to survive in the past so that we're actually be free in our life. How do you set the stage, for instance, with those, with those vets, what do you say to them or what would exercise might you do that opens a door for them to share these stories?

Speaker 4:          02:32:03       So a couple of images. One with gang kids and then one with that. Um, for, for gang kids who come in are these kids who are trying to get out of gangs and might come with a mentor or something like that to some events. We've had any of these guys in there, you know, ah, their, their hoods are up in, their hats are on backward and their lean back and saying like, come on man, you're gonna teach this meditation. You're going to teach us, give us some poem stories or bit listen, we're out on the street. People got nine millimeters, you know, you gotta give us something better than that. So we try to make, uh, a setting that honors who they are from the very beginning. We say, well, we can't talk yet about the real things that we came here to do because there are too many people in this room who have not been acknowledged, um, and not been respected.

Speaker 4:          02:33:03       So would you go out in the parking lot and pick up a stone for every young person you know who's been killed? And we light one candle and put it in the center of a table, say bring it back in and say their name and put their stone by this candle to simple as possible ritual. And these guys and sometimes gals will come in and their hands are full of stones. No young people should know that many dead people. And, and they'll say, this is for Tito and this is for RJ and this is for home girl. And pretty soon there's a mound of stones and the names of people they've lost, um, were, were put into the, the fabric of the air of that room. And their hoods are no longer over their heads. They're sitting up like, okay, this is the place where we can talk about what's really going on.

Speaker 4:          02:33:56       So there's something about making, whether it's through, um, as the simplest ritual or making a container in which people realize that, that this is a safe place to talk about what we've never done before with the vets. One of the things that Michael Meade, Luis Rodriguez, these guys from Mosaic Multicultural Foundation that I've worked with for years, a really wonderful, um, Michael, who, who's in, you know, a great drummer and a storyteller and mythologist who's also been working in prisons and with vets and gang kids for years. And I'll say, let me tell you an ancient story of returning warriors. And he has a handful of stories from Africa to bat or the Mayan tradition about warriors coming back, you know, with their hands covered, with blood. Um, and you know, their eyes, uh, filled with, um, the, the Mars with the Marshall Energy that they would, that they can't stop the violence cause it's taken them over.

Speaker 4:          02:34:57       And here's a myth or a story that tells about how ancient warriors were brought back into their community. Um, I'll tell you the myth if you want to hear one of them. Oh yes, please. So here we are. You know, and there's these, there's these vets and already stories of started to pour out about, um, I can't tell you what I saw. I can't tell you what I had to do. Um, and Michael stood up and he said, let me tell you an old Irish story of a, um, an Irish warrior name, Coco Lane, or I'm not sure how his name is pronounced, something like that. Um, and he was the most fierce and famous of all Irish warriors. And the Irish warriors were, were mad men, um, because they would go out, they'd paint their bodies and they'd go out and make it. And sometimes you just see them coming and you'd run the other way.

Speaker 4:          02:35:46       But anyway, there was some marauding king, King, King and army that had come to threaten their area. And so coco lane went out and almost single handedly chased them and defeated them. But then he was coming back to his own town in a chariot, covered with blood, uh, and, um, his eyes blazing, bearing down in his own town, still possessed with the violence of war with the god Mars. Um, and they were all terrified he would come and do violence there too. And so they now look, can we do, what can we do? Um, and, uh, they went to ask the old wise woman in the village and she said three things. And so the first thing they lined up all the women in the village who bared their breasts and this slowed him down, um, as if it reminded him of his mother's milk or something.

Speaker 4:          02:36:47       Um, and because he was slowed down and the second thing they did was take a rope and tie it around him and put him in a huge cauldron of cold water, which hist off his body. And then they filled it three times with cold water and find his body cooled down. And then the third thing they did is they took him and still bound and they lay him on a carpet in the court of the local king. Um, and they sang to him the stories and myths and songs of warriors who had protected the kingdom and then come back and released the violence and the fears that they carried and planted their crops again and love their families. Um, and resumed living in harmony with the community from which they came. And they told the ancient stories and sang the songs for three days and nights.

Speaker 4:          02:37:48       And when it was over cocoa lane, eyes open, they let his, they untied him and he was back as a normal human being again. And after Michael told this story to that too, had been telling terrible accounts of things that happened in this room. Um, a hundred men stood up and we'd been working with a simple African chant, a song that was really an African chant of a prayer, you know, um, earth hold me for this. Living is hard. Um, we all sang to the vets, um, together for a long time as if we could sing them back into their bodies from this as if they were low lying there and the, the court of the king. Um, so this is, you asked the question, how do you, how do you make a setting that allows people to truly feel that they can tell their stories, um, and be held in compassion? Whether it's the grief of these gang kids, that no one's really given them the place to give voice to, you know, or the vet who says, I can't tell you what I had to do.

Speaker 2:          02:39:00       That's very powerful. And it makes me also think back to conversations I've had with uh, Sebastian younger who was, uh, a wartime journalist as, as, as a co produced and shot a number of really hiring a documentary films, including Ristreppo, uh, and most recently wrote a book called tribe that touches on some similar topic area. And leads me to ask you, are there any rites of passages or rituals that you feel would be useful for every man or woman to experience? This is something that I've felt a longing for and a lack of, uh, since my teenage years because I, I, I'm not Jewish, did not have a bat mitzvah, Bar Mitzvah. I don't know if that serves that purpose in the, in the Jewish tradition necessarily. But are there any, any rituals or rites of passage that you think we could use in, let's

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       just say the United States? Uh, that would be helpful too. Whether it's a specific population, specific group or uh, anyone. So while you're talking about is a really big subject that's a subject of initiation and unfortunately bar Mitzvahs, at least when I was in there, whereas it was a relatively lightweight and meaningless thing. You get up there and you recite your, you know, Hebrew portion of the Bible and now you're a man and they give you a bunch of presence and there wasn't a lot of meaning in it. But the, the problem that you raise is that of the lack of initiation and what's true is that it's been forgotten in our culture. Um, one of the few places you get initiation is going into the military. That's an initiation. Um, but a lot of these gang kids, for example, they're trying to initiate themselves, which can't really happen.

Speaker 4:          02:41:10       You need elders and you needed in a ritualized way, but they'll go on that, you know, if you're in the Mussai, uh, tradition in east Africa and the Messiah people, um, as everybody's heard, you know, a young man at a certain age of 14 or something, we'll go out and kill a lion, um, to prove that they're now an adult member of the society and that they're brave. And that's part of their initiation. There were initiations for young women as well. Um, and it's not just an Africa. The Mayans had initiations. And in Thailand, when I lived there back starting in the 1960s, at that point, almost every young man and many young women, when they reached the age of 1920, they became a monk for three months or for a year and lived in an austere way. And it was part of their initiation to learn both the inner life of themselves and also a kind of discipline.

Speaker 4:          02:42:09       We don't have it. And because of it, you know, kids who are trying to initiate themselves on the streets by, you know, shooting somebody or doing something, you know, that shows that they're brave, but it's not a lion, it's another person or it's, you know, I'm trying to get the attention of the others and say, prove how, how powerful or strong they are. So we desperately need these and we need them built into our education and to our psychology. Um, and I can't give you a simple answer, but one of the people who's has the most intelligence about this is a man of colleague of mine named Michael Meade. Um, and if you look on mosaic, multicultural foundation is the writings on initiation and what's possible here and the things he's led our very, very inspiring. Um, so that's a place that I would look, that's a good starting point. Wonderful. I will certainly find that. Well, Jack, I think we could go for hours and hours and hours and I always love chatting with you and I'd love to perhaps even consider doing

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       a part two sometime. But given that we've already gone for two plus hours, I want to ask just a few more questions and uh, I'll actually start with just reading something very short, which is from your 2017 year end message. And uh, this is, I think this is just to inject some more, uh, optimism into our conversation, which we've already had plenty of. But, uh, this is, this is just a small portion of your year end message. A Martin Luther King Jr describes our collective journey with hope. The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice and quote and Pablo Neruda Explains Further, you can cut all the flowers, but you cannot keep spring from coming. Renewal is happening. This is back to your voice. Take quiet time to listen to your heart, to meditate and to rest of midst the great turnings. Feel the renewal of spring that can be born in you.

Speaker 2:          02:44:10       Align yourself with goodness. Let yourself blossom like a Lotus or whatever unique flower you are shining in the world, offering tiny seeds of love amidst it all. Blessings to you in 2018, Jack. And I want this, this note to then lead into, uh, in certainly you're welcome to comment on that, but which book you would recommend of yours people start with or where they start with all of the many materials, recordings, readings that you produced because you're a, a fantastic writer and a prolific writer. Uh, you have some of my favorite book titles I've ever heard by the way, including after the ecstasy, the laundry, which maybe we could touch on, but where would you suggest people start, uh, of the many things that you've, that you've written and shared with the world. Uh, and, and if you have any comments on that year end message, you're welcome to share that as well. Cool.

Speaker 4:          02:45:05       So from books, if you want something simple, I have books like, um, you know, an introduction to meditation that sounds true. Publishes or I have, um, um, a little book called the art of forgiveness, loving kindness and peace, which is very simple stories and practices. Um, if you want something that's richer and fuller, then you could look at one of my bigger books, like a path with heart or the wise heart, the guide to the two principals of Buddhist psychology. Um, and again, I think lots of stuff online and SoundsTrue's particularly a good place to go along with my website. Um, then, and that 40 day mindfulness mindfulness daily, which is think it's like 30 bucks or something. And you, you know, um, is a really wonderful way to start. Um, in terms of what I had written, uh, about the trusting heart, one of the greatest zen techs from thousand years ago says to be awakened or enlightened is one with trusting heart and mind.

Speaker 4:          02:46:09       And it doesn't mean that, that we won't go through hard times. We always have and we will again, and we are now in many ways, but that we also have born within us the capacity to meet these difficulties with, uh, understanding, um, and with courage, with compassion, and to transform them. And in that way, one of my favorite recent books is, um, called the better angels of our nature by Steven pinker. Um, and he's a remarkable professor at Harvard anthropologist, historian talking about, um, the growing consciousness of humanity in spite of the kind of wars and conflict and environmental things. There are so many good things that have happened that he charts over the last few centuries of the development of, um, you know, uh, certain certain abilities for peacemaking. There's actually less for than there had been. Um, you know, respect for, for women. Um, the reduction in, uh, you know, child labor, all kinds of things.

Speaker 4:          02:47:13       And, and in that same regard, um, there's a wonderful book called very the chains, which is about the ending of slavery in the British Empire, starting with this handful of men, um, who met in a British tea shop or printing shop and spent 30 years riding around the country bringing ex slaves who are well spoken to, talk about the middle passage and the, you know, the horrors of slavery and so forth. And even though the British Empire's economic engine was built around slavery and sugar by the end of their work, um, of 30 years, uh, the British parliament, um, outlawed slavery and the British Empire, you know, decades before it happened in the u s and the Quakers were a big part of this. And the Quakers famously wouldn't take their hats off for the king. But when, um, what is his name? Thomas Clarkson, who was the center of this group trying to end slavery and going everywhere to do it. When Thomas Clarkson died, the goal, the Quakers of the England, England took their hats off because he'd, he's freed so many spirits and so many lives. So the possible we have these amazing possibilities that human beings, and we're just growing into them now culturally. Um, and it's about time. Um, but it's, it, they're the, they are possible and we each have a, have a contribution to make in it.

Speaker 2:          02:48:50       Jack, I'm going to ask you one more question before we wrap up with, uh, just, uh, letting people know where they can find you on social media and elsewhere, the website and so on. But last question is, one I like to ask, and this is, this is a metaphor, but if you could a short message on a billboard, in other words, get them. I get a message out to millions or billions of people. It could be a few words, one word, a phrase, a quote of yours, a quote of someone else's. Uh, what might you put on that billboard?

Speaker 5:          02:49:22       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:49:23       Um, well, two things come to mind. One is a question that when I sit with sat with people many times at the end of their life that they, that they then ask of themselves silently or out loud is, did I love well, because in the end what matters is really, um, the billboard would have a question rather than a statement. Um, and it would have a question. Something like, um, I don't know, how could I love myself better or what, what, you know, so that it actually, it's not that I'm going to tell them something, they already know this, but I'm going to remind those who read that there is something that's asking to be awakened in them. How could I love myself? And this world better. And then you know, or what gets and you know, then you'd go, well, it gets in the way of that. And how can I love that too? How can I love myself in this world better? Hmm.

Speaker 2:          02:50:28       Well, Jack, I want to of course, thank you for your time today, but, uh, beyond that, I want to thank you and this is, this is very, um, very much from deep in my heart. Thank you for helping me to learn to love myself better and quite frankly, to see something in the first place that is worth loving. That's not a where I've spent most of my life. So it's, it's turned into, uh, if not my, I hesitate to say my top priority because I'm, I worry about sounding it's self indulgent, but it's become one of the most important and fruitful tasks in my life is asking that question, how could I love myself better? Or how could I learn to love myself better? So thank you very, very sincerely, uh, for that. And that the words don't do it justice, but, uh, uh, I'll, I'll, that's all. That's the best I can do right now, remotely is to, is to put it into words. So thank you for that.

Speaker 4:          02:51:30       Thank you Tim. This was, this was a pleasure to do and what I feel and I know is it as you tend your own heart, I'm in a wise way, then it makes you available to bring the gifts, the many gifts you have to the world, you personally and others. Um, but to do it in a way that's on the carrier wave of connection and love and it transforms everything. So thank you to, Well Jack, I uh, you know, I'm looking at it

Speaker 2:          02:51:56       texts one of ours and I'm feeling the necklace around my neck, which is really a thread, a red thread that was used to close the one of the elements, the closing of the 10 day silent retreat. And I shot you a text not too long ago asking what the three nots meant because I'd forgotten. And this is what you wrote back first, not equals refuge in whatever you hold is most inspiring and sacred. Second, commitment to compassion for self and others. Third, following your highest intention. And the intention that I've said at the end of that 10 day retreat was to learn to love myself so I could love others more fully. Uh, but I've realized that maybe what it is is learning to love myself so I can help others learn to do the same. And you've been an integral piece of that. And uh, I just love that I have the opportunity to introduce you and your work and these traditions to more people. And uh, I will certainly be linking to, uh, where everyone can find you online, but are there any particular best places just to, to reiterate where people can find you and I'll link to these in the show notes.

Speaker 1:          02:56:38       Enjoy. This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic. You might remember four sigmatic for their mushroom coffee, which was created by those clever finished founders and when I first mentioned that coffee on this podcast, the product sold out in less than a week. It lights you up like a Christmas tree, which can be really useful. However, recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum of new product and that is their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep. As you guys may know, longtime listeners, at least I struggled with insomnia for decades. I have a largely fixed that, but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy. It still isn't easy very often and I found Reishi, which had been fascinated by for a few years now has been very, very effective and calming their old formula. However, four sigmatic old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners, all sweeteners for a host of reasons and I then just ping them and asked, hey guys, I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested, but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it.

Speaker 1:          02:57:45       Too much of a headache, don't worry. And they are always game for experimentation. And so they created a special custom version without the Stevia, without sweeteners. Now it is part of my nightly routine. Their ratio looks or comes in single serving packets, which are perfect for travel. And in fact, I'm about to leave the country right now and I have a packet in front of me that's just going to sit in the end of my carry on bag. You only need hot water and it mixes very, very easily. Here's some recommended copies that they put in the read, so I'm going to read it and I'll give you my take quote, a warning for those in the experimental mindset, Reishi is strong and bitter in parentheses, like any great medicine. So if the bitterness is too much, I recommend trying it with honey end or nut milk such as almond milk.

Speaker 1:          02:58:31       And so I'm going to say, no, you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter. And maybe should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing younguns when they say who and sure. Cool, which means you're not able to eat bitterness. Bitter is in many cases and indication of things that help liver detoxification. It's on, not saying that's the case here, but I've tested this ratio lecture on family members, on friends. Everybody has liked it. It's a little bit, or if the, it's not that hard, so I would just say suck it up and no, don't put in honey or milk or any of that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea. It's delicious. I think if you like to air that kind of stuff, that type of tea, you're going to dig it. So just try it.

Speaker 1:          02:59:17       Okay. Back to them by read. If you'd like to naturally improve your sleep, both onset and quality, I think naturally you might just enjoy this ratio lecture without any sweet nurse.
