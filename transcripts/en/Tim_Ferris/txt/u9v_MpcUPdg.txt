Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Optimal at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. No else. You posting a question? I'm a cybernetic organism living this year.

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       This episode is brought to you by Peloton, which I've been using probably for about a year now. Peloton is a cutting edge indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into your home. You can also do on demand, which is what I do. We'll come back to that so you don't have to worry about fitting classes into a busy schedule or making it to a studio or gym with a hectic or unpredictable commute. I, for instance, have a Peloton bike right in my master bedroom at home and it's one of the first things I do. Many mornings I wake up and meditate for a bit. Then I knock out a short 20 minute ride in my undies. Hard to do that at the gym, take a shower and I'm in higher gear for the rest of the day. It's really convenient and has become something that I look forward to.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       So you have a lot of options for one if you'd like, you can ride live with thousands of other writers across the country on an interactive leaderboard to keep him motivated. There are also up to 14 new classes added everyday with more than 8,000 classes on demand and you can pick based on length, 45 minutes, 20 minutes, whatever music, hip hop, rock and roll or say low impact versus high intensity or interval. You can pick the class structure and style that works for you and in my case I quite like Matt Wilbur's and I tend to do on demand and listened to a lot of and watch many of the same classes over and over, but I'm kind of promiscuous and also enjoy classes from a lot of the other instructors. They have Peloton and amazing roster of incredible instructors in New York City with a whole range of styles and personalities so you can find what you're in the mood for.

Speaker 2:          00:01:50       You also get real time metrics that you can use to track your performance over time and that will help, I would say catalyze you to beat your personal best. Now that all sounds good, right? Gamification, Yada, Yada, Yada. I didn't think that it would work for me or in any way incentivize me, but they really 100% hit the nail on the head. I was very, very impressed with how motivating it was and it worked tremendously to keep me pushing a, which quite honestly takes a fair amount. I can get quite lazy, particularly with anything that edges on endurance, which is kind of more than five reps of anything for me. So check it out.

Speaker 2:          00:05:09       Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers, people who are the best at what they do, to tease out the routines, the life lessons, the habits, the favorite books, whatever it might be that you can hopefully apply and test in your own life. My guest today is Paul Stamets. Hundreds, maybe thousands of people have requested that I have Paul on the show. You can find them on Instagram, Facebook and youtube. Paul Stamets, s. T. A. M. E. T. S. He is an intellectual and industry leader in the habitat, medicinal use and production of fungi. That's if you end GI fungi. Some people say, and you might also think of mycelium or mushrooms, part of his mission is to deepen our understanding of and respect for the organisms that literally exist under every footstep taken on this path of life.

Speaker 2:          00:06:03       This episode is bonkers. Uh, the implications, applications, medicinal uses of many of the things that he'll discuss are truly mind boggling. And we do get into some of my favorite subjects, including psychedelics and, uh, other aspects of bending reality. Here we go back to the bio. Paul is the author of six books, including my psyllium running subtitle, how mushrooms can help save the world growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms and siliciden mushrooms of the world. He has discovered and named numerous new species of psilocybin mushrooms, psilocybin mushrooms, or a solution be mushrooms, uh, better known as magic mushrooms and is the founder and owner of fungi, perfectee, makers of the host defense mushroom supplement line. And a little known fact. I have been using host defense, uh, products for a few years now after some mean no Surat said that one of them was her favorite purchase of less than a hundred dollars in the last year or two.

Speaker 2:          00:07:08       And that was in my last book, tribe of mentors. So I do have some familiarity with his products. Paul has received numerous awards including invention ambassador for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the national mycologist award from the North American Mycological Association and the Gordon and Tino Wasson award from the Mycological Society of America. His Instagram is awesome if you want to see some really, really, really weird fungi and him off in the woods all over the world doing weird things. And in a very new and breaking news, we were actually holding the podcast waiting for this to happen. Paul is the author of a new study in nature, scientific reports, which details how mushroom extracts specifically extracts from woodland a poly pore. Mushrooms can greatly reduce viruses that contribute to bee colony collapse. This is a huge, huge, huge deal. And we do get into the importance of bees and how without bees, pretty much everything goes down the toilet I including a lot of humanity.

Speaker 2:          00:08:12       So I will include a link in the show notes, which you can always find at tim.blog/podcast for everyone who wants to check that out. And two other announcements if you are interested as I am and I'm certainly committed to this, to the tune of seven figures over the next year or two to supporting psychedelic science and research. Uh, please join me. And if you're interested in doing so at a higher dollar amount, meaning over a hundred thousand dollars, please go to tim.blog forward slash science that's tim.blog forward size science. And if you want to support@alowerdollaramountsacheckoutmaps.org and for anyone who is already filled out that form, I will be reaching out soon. There's a lot of amazing stuff on the horizon that I hope you will be involved with. And the last but not least, the blog now contains transcripts of every podcast episode. To date. People have been asking for this for a long, long time.

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       I wanted to do it right. So now you can find transcripts to every episode of the podcast at Tim Dot. Blog, forward slash, transcripts, and that is a long intro. So without further ado, please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with Paul Stamets. And if you can only listen to one part, jump ahead about 49 minutes or so. 49 minutes and 50 seconds I believe. But yeah, let's call it 49 minutes to listen to his description of his first experience with solicit the mushrooms or psilocybin containing mushrooms and the effect it had on his lifelong stutter. It is fucking nuts. So if you're going to skip around, jumped ahead 49 minutes or so and listen to that story. It is really, really wild. So they have it. Enjoy.

Speaker 2:          00:10:06       Paul, welcome to the show. Thank you, Tim. I'm honored to be here. I've had so many listeners requests you on the show. I have wanted to have you on the show for so many years. And finally when you made your very comprehensive cameo and Michael Pollan's most recent book that served as the reminder that I had to reach out somehow. So I'm very pleased that you're here and I thought we could start with some definitions and pronunciation, which, uh, are very selfishly points of insecurity for me. So F, U, N, G, I, how should we pronounce that?

Speaker 3:          00:10:41       Well, that's an excellent question. Um, fungi according to Oxford English dictionary with a j is the correct pronunciation but fun, fun, fun guy or fungi. So fungi is, what else am my colleges use? A though people Spanish mycologists we'll use one g Italian mycologists we'll say phone g. Uh, but uh, English speakers. The standard pronunciation is fungi with a J.

Speaker 2:          00:11:07       Fungi. And then there are two terms that I suspect may not be totally synonymous. We have mushrooms and mycelium or Mycelium, I don't know the correct pronunciation. Are Mushrooms a subset of mycelium? One component part. Can you define or distinguish those two for us please?

Speaker 3:          00:11:27       The mycelium is the underground network analogous to the roots of a tree, uh, and the fruit bodies, the mushrooms. So they are produced as a reproductive structures long after many challenges on the path of growth, uh, in the wood and woods underground, et cetera. The mycelial networks are vast. It's been called the proverbial tip of the iceberg. But just think of this as the, the mycelium, um, navigates through microbially hostile environment. Literally there can be tens of millions of microbes per gram of soil and the mycelial, these five find filaments that look like cobwebs, um, are, are running underground. And this underground network is being challenged by all sorts of microbes. And as many people know that bacteria like to eat fungi. That's why mushrooms rot. Um, but the fungi are able to navigate with these mycelial networks only one cell wall thick and there can be up to eight miles of mycelium per cubic inch.

Speaker 3:          00:12:26       And now they only have one cell wall between uh, their, their internal, uh, cells and the external environment. We have five or six skin layers that protect us from infection. The mycelium that basically has one cell layer and yet is able to overcome the challenges of millions of microbes, many of which want to consume it. And it navigates to create the largest organism on this planet is a Mycelial Mat and eastern Oregon over 2100 acres in size. Now it's one cell wall thick, and yet it's the largest organism on this planet. And that's the testimonial to the immunological power of the mycelium and this vast underground network, uh, that is so essential to habitat and human. And plant health is something that we have really tapped into. So mushrooms come from mycelium. The mycelium can grow literally for decades before a single mushroom farms. Mushrooms are highly perishable.

Speaker 3:          00:13:21       They're like fish and four or five days they mature and, and then they rot. And then in doing so, they spoilery late just before they rot and they attract insects that are then help spread the spores. Much like, you know, birds spread seeds, um, and the birds come to fruit. The fruit of the tree, like a peach for instance, attracts insects and birds and then the peach pit or seeds of an apple or what other fruit are spread. So the fragments of the mushrooms are beacons, fragrance, beacons, the MNA through the ecosystem and the scent trails. And entice animals to come to these bodacious Lee delicious fruit bodies. And then they presented in the course of them eating them. They spread the spores. But the mycelium literally can be existent, not, not invisible, invisible to us, ridiculously stupid humans that are thundering giants upon these networks that are underneath their feet. But the mycelium really racist behind us and we're the biggest walking catastrophe that I know in the planet. And as we walk, we break wood chips, we leave impressions or the Mycelium is sensitive to those impressions of our footsteps. And as we create new debris fields and mycelium reaches up behind our footsteps to gobble up that newly made material and competition, but other fungi and other organisms and Mycelium, if we're looking at mycelium and uh, as one

Speaker 4:          00:14:53       component of that or rather not the, the product of that I suppose. And please feel free to correct me if I am fine. Screw things up by restating mushrooms. People have had a decent amount of exposure to and they tend to associate it with, say, the produce aisle in a grocery store. And think of them perhaps as plants, uh, from a genetic perspective or an evolutionary perspective, how should people think about mycelium?

Speaker 3:          00:15:20       I love this question. Well, you bring up a very good point for, for almost a hundred years now, the mycology departments where a subset of botany departments, they really should be in the zoo. All logy departments. Uh, we separated from fungi about 650 million years ago is 650 million years ago we had a common ancestor. In fact, there's a new super kingdom called a pilot content that joins fungi and animals Aaliyah together when basically the my fiddle network, um, when, uh, when they hit the land from the ocean, many people don't realize some of the largest networks of mycelium in the world. Now I've been discovered, uh, in below the sediment layers of the ocean is vast myself on networks throughout the entire ocean. There's lots of dead organic plant material. This falling down to the sediments and the mycelium is involved in gobbling those up. But from an evolutionary point of view, I 650 million years ago, we chose the path of in circulating our nutrients, basically in a cellular sac, stomach, the mycelium digest nutrients externally if it is the enzymes and acids and other compounds that breakdown complex organic molecules and then absorbs those, uh, through the cell walls.

Speaker 3:          00:16:36       The entire mycelial network, um, is like a sponge. It absorbs selectively. There's nutrients that it needs and animals, uh, went sort of overground and we did all these digestive systems and I in a protective, uh, skin, uh, enveloped structure or bodies. Uh, and then the mycelium continued on us of course, very happily developing underground. So with the divergence of fungi and animals is extremely well documented. But an ordinary article came out just this past year. Um, and this article, you know, the, the, the big bang was about 13.8 billion years ago. The earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. Uh, the first unicellular organisms, uh, were found them a few hundred million years later, but the first multicellular organisms so far found the oldest one is 2.4 billion years ago, but has found that South African lava, uh, in the basalt and as 2.4 billion years old, the oldest representation so far in the fossil record of a organism, and these are a mycelial networks.

Speaker 3:          00:17:53       So the mycelium had its form long before we've had ours. And moreover in Brazil, 150, 115 million years ago, this is before the, the great extinction event that killed off the dinosaurs. Um, and at that time machines also had their forms. So these mushrooms are really ancient organisms. They had developed reforms long before we had developed ours. We are descendant from these fungal networks. Um, they are progenitor ancestors. We are, we are really descendants of fungi. This is why under the microscope, so many of our cells, it looks so similar to that of a fungi. And also why our best antibiotics that we have coming from fungi are very good at preventing bacteria from growing. But we have very, very few good antifungal antibiotics because of our close evolutionary history that are not toxic or highly toxic to us. So antifungal drugs are extremely dangerous. Um, those who've had immunosuppressants are well aware of this. Um, and um, when you defeat the immune system and the human body using Immuno suppressants for a organ transplants and other, uh, reasons and, and medicine you really, um, dancing with death because it's extremely damaging to your immune system that can hold many of these infections at bay.

Speaker 2:          00:19:16       There's so many directions that I want to go with this. I'm going to try to contain my, uh, add and focus this in a direction towards another type of utility and relates to a problem that if I were to walk 15 feet, I could observe with my own eyes right now. And that is carpenter ants. And I was wondering if you could talk about your history with carpenter ants and the intersection with mycelium.

Speaker 3:          00:19:51       Um, is a subject very dear to my heart. So, well let me, I'm gonna I'm gonna Segue, um, because there could be listeners out there who have children and I'm going to tell their children to the story how vacuuming and helping your mother and your parents made me over a million dollars. And it ties in the carpenter ants. So, um, I grew up in, so I'm gonna, I'm, I need two minutes to set this up in the world. Okay. So I grew up in a small town in Ohio, Columbiana, Ohio, a very conservative town, about 5,000 people. Um, and I grew up in a fairly wealthy household. My family had steel mills and saw mills and we were affluent. Um, we had 400 people in the town under unemployment of a town of about 5,000. Um, so the stem is enterprise company. Unfortunately, because of after World War Two, we bombed, you know, we bombed Japan, we bombed Germany, but they retooled.

Speaker 3:          00:20:49       They rebuilt, their factory said modern factories after the war. Um, in the United States. We didn't do that. And so the machine tool industry really fell apart in the early 1960s. There's a huge economic downturn. And so I was, the best experience of my life was the fact that I grew up in a wealthy environment. And then when I was 10 or 11 years of age, the entire financial empire collapsed. We lost everything and we laid off over 400 people in the town were laid off. I'm going to school these, these kids and their parents, you know, or not very happy about what was happening. It was really a devastating to us. And my parents separated. We lived in this big house. Electricity was cut off, the water was cut off. Um, I remember eating cat food. I was just so hungry, gave me tremendous parts.

Speaker 3:          00:21:40       Uh, but, uh, but I, my mom was really desperate. My brother John went on to Yale. My brother bill was that Cornell. Um, and um, this is, you know, towards the end of their college experiences. And I was their home alone with my mother and my twin brother. And I just really had to step up the plate and help my mother as much as possible. I remember running a hose from my neighbors, so about 500 feet of hose just to get two or three psi so we could trickle feed into the toilet so we can flush them. It was really strange in the lead bewildering sort of, um, Kafkaesque existence because we were shunned by the town. My mother went into religion, my dad went into alcohol. They both were a self medicating and essentially, and where there's those two avenues. Um, but I got really good at helping my mom vacuum, um, because she didn't help and we didn't have, you know, the support team we had any more.

Speaker 3:          00:22:34       So I was always like tearing apart vacuum cleaners and borrowing parts and trying to get, get and trying to help my mom. Anyway, I quit. So I vacuum doc and doc here and I got, I'm really still passionate about vacuuming this one of my, I'm a really good house husband. I like washing dishes and vacuuming a lot. So how this word segues into the carpenter ants is the following. So I grew up in an affluent environment. It came out to Washington state, became the logger hippie for three years, working in the woods, then moved outside of Olympia, Washington. I went to the Evergreen state college and I tried to start this little business and I lived in a house and a Dr Andrew Weil said is the worst house he's ever seen anyone live in, in North America. Um, that's one statement. It was a flat flat house built with military surplus materials and I had 12 buckets catching water from the flat roof.

Speaker 3:          00:23:25       Why you need to build a flat roof in Washington state with army surplus materials. This is another question, but there's so many leaks that I just keep on putting up buckets. And then, um, one day I remember there's a storm and, and the, the house fell like two or three inches in. My wife does, my God, the house is falling. I said, don't worry dear. We don't have to fill the buckets as much because the water will rot faster. I was just trying to be able to be optimistic because I was afraid that she was the one to get up and leave me because the conditions were so bad. But any aisle I would be making my espresso in the morning. And um, and I looked over in the corner and there's a pile of sawdust from carpenter rats and I see them running around and the carpenter, carpenter ants are more nocturnal than they are active in the daytime.

Speaker 3:          00:24:07       And so I'd make my espresso every morning. I look over the palace, Sata supportive. I come clean or vacuum it up. I did the next day and the next day and the next day I'd do this for hundreds of days. Realizing the house is getting more, less structurally song, uh, w with a carpenter ants and punching them. And so I was not going to do something about this. And so, you know, I didn't want to use raid. I didn't want to use toxic insecticides. Um, cause the war against nature, uh, in my mind is a war against your own biology and it was toxic to other organisms is likely toxic to you. And this has been well founded now with lots of examples. So I wanted to environmental protection agency homepage and I looked up a group of fungi that would attack and these are called entimopathogenic fungi now. So mouthful but antimony maids, insects and pathogenic means of course causing disease of insects.

Speaker 3:          00:25:01       And this group of entimopathogenic a fungi that was particularly of interest and supported by scientific literature and with the encouragement of the EPA was a group of fungi in the genus [inaudible]. So Metta and rising, you know, uh, lots of Mycelium, lots of rice from works. And so I looked into this group of men, a matter of Islam, fungi, non toxic to bees, non toxic to fish, nontoxic to humans. Um, and I, I got some of these fungi and it started growing them out. Now I started studying this. Well, this is really interesting. Why isn't this not available everywhere, right? Why isn't there Lowe's and Home Depot and Walmart? Why aren't they selling this? Well, for very good reason, the insects aren't stupid. Um, when you see insects like the carpenter ants and are constantly cleaning themselves, they're trying to get the spores of the fungus off of them is the most common fungus according to some reports in the soil underneath your feet.

Speaker 3:          00:25:55       It is everywhere. It is a dance of, of, of dinner and death between insects and fungi. Many insects eat fungi. Many fungi eat insects. Um, the two of them don't like to be at this dinner table at the same time. So I ended up getting this fungus and I studied it. And the reason why it never came to market is for the spore repellency property. Now this is really important because these insects have realized that the scent of these spores meant that there's a disease threat to the colony. So the insects fastidiously clean themselves of these spores. So when the big companies like bear and Dow and Syngenta and tried to make bait stations using these spores, even though in the laboratory that can dust the insects of the spores, and sure enough, five days later they would kill the insects. Um, the human, they put made bait stations around people's houses.

Speaker 3:          00:26:50       The insects won't go near those base stations because there's saw the spores. And so the spore repellency property prevented these bait traps from going into market for preventing a termites, firearms, Carpenter ants, uh, moisture rounds, all sorts of, uh, ants and termites are infected by these, these, these, this spoilating fungus matter. Elysium. So I thought, well, I'm having a laboratory and a very large laboratories. We produce about 50,000 kilos of mycelium of the, of, of many different, uh, gourmet and medicinal mushrooms per week. And my environments are class 100 clean rooms. These are high tech clean room environments using heap, Hepa filters, high efficiency, particularly air filters. Um, and the last thing I wanted to spoil, letting mold in my laboratories. So I got these cultures and I was shocked at how many spores they world remind somebody of a penicillium mold growing on cheese.

Speaker 3:          00:27:44       Do you want that flying around your laboratory? Because my oyster mushroom cultures or my sheet talky cultures could, could become contaminated from airborne spores. So I, I cultured this out really quickly. And so the window of exposure was very short and I set up all these precautions and then culturing these fungi and then they grow out as green molds. And then I saw this white wedge, the shape wedge that was all white. It had no spoilation on it. And I went, Whoa, that's interesting. I look up in scientific literature and everybody said, Oh, the culture is losing the ability to reproduce and is losing the ability to spoil your late. It is sunesson avoid sectors. This is what they're called. These wedges are white sectors because that path of genetic, a path down that gene trail will end up meaning the culture will die and the parsley got that right.

Speaker 3:          00:28:38       But I was motivated by not having sports in my laboratory. So I chased those white sectors and they grow out and about a week or two weeks on then on a standard size petri dish. And then after about five or six, seven transfers, that white wedge got bigger and bigger and bigger and pretty soon no spoilation. And this is current day in your, the, this experiment that you were running was, is, is done more recently, not when you were under the, the flat roof built by military surplus, is that right? I'm just trying to put up, no, this is, this is a synchronous with that, with a flat roof. Okay. Got It. So, but I, I had to go out in my laboratory to have enough mycelium and be able to, to treat the carpenter ants. Gotcha. So anyhow, so I've, I finally grew it out and I grew it on and rice and I made a big deal to my daughter.

Speaker 3:          00:29:27       Um, and I am so thankful to her for the reasons you're about to hear. Um, and I made a big deal in the middle of summer saying we're going to trick the carpenter rounds because every morning I'm sucking up all those us. And so I asked her for Barbie doll dish, which I still have, I'm going to mount it in a frame and I put like 25 kernels of, of white mycelium on rice, Elysium fungus without spores because they wouldn't go near the rice if it had spores. And I laid it out at about eight 30 at night in the summer afternoon, summer evening. And I made a big deal of it. And it got my daughter involved, you know, as a citizen scientists young, she was only, oh my gosh, she was probably 14 at the time. And so we, and then we went to bed. So thankfully my daughter woke up at 102 o'clock in the morning and she, rather than going straight to the bathroom, you see one look at her Barbie doll dish.

Speaker 3:          00:30:19       She went over there talking to license, swarming with carpenter ants. Like, oh my gosh, you've gotta be kidding. And uh, and so she ran into our bedrooms, said, uh, dad, dusty, wake up, you've got to see this. And you know, we didn't want to wake up as two o'clock in the morning, but she dragged us out of bed and we went over there and it was just covered with carbon or rants or picking up the rice and they're going into the, into the recesses of the house disappearing and like, oh my God, that was amazing because I hadn't mice in the house, the mice could have eaten the rice and I would never have known. But we watched for a few minutes and they took away all the myceliated rice. So we fast forward, I'm making my espresso every morning, hundreds of times I get the vacuum cleaner out.

Speaker 3:          00:31:00       I go to that spot and there's no sought us, the carpenter ants or gone. And I went, oh my gosh, I just think I figured out a way to overcome the spore repellency property. So now this has been elaborated. We published an article in the journal, sociobiology proving this was effective against subterranean termites. Formosan termites. We've done experiments is now in the Usda, uh, and other, uh, teams, some of the biggest pesticide companies in the world. Um, I'd have to check my NDAs to see if they're still covered or not. But everyone listening, you can imagine who they are. They tested this is effective against bedbugs ants, termites, uh, thrips flies, mosquitoes, um, you know, uh, mites phenomenal reach. And so I ended up finding something that is a super attractant and basically the opposite of the spore repellency property is the mycelial attract unsee property.

Speaker 3:          00:32:03       Two sides of the same coin, the ying and Yang of nature. It's kind of harmonious and that sense. I like that. And we found that if we diluted the mycelial extracts on rice without the spores, this, these continual, these preclinical pre spoilating sectors that I described, we end up creating a super attractive, so powerful that when they attracted was diluted 500 to one with water diluting the extract, made it more potent in terms of attract, unsee it. One experiment, two drops of this on a pane of glass and fire ants, uh, uh, locked directly to that place and scratched at that place until they died walking about a meter, uh, creating a trail that other than a fire ants would follow. So that we have done this now with choices are called t tests. We've known this was the t test or even better, a t test oftentimes is go left for the control go right from the treatment.

Speaker 3:          00:33:00       But we ended up doing four and five choice experiments where there was only one corridor or avenue that had the treatment and the other ones were all controls. Uh, so highly significant activity. And we found something that I can, my dream is to be able to, uh, to attract a locust plague into a 55 gallon drum and we can put these in foggers and you know, in Africa and just create a massive, huge, a huge attractor NC factor. The cool thing also is they attract and C is not lethal. Um, so, um, that, that, that comes later, the infectious state of the mycelium, it grows and then it penetrates the, the Exoskeleton with a Hyphal peg. It kind of anchors itself like sticky little tongue and then it dissolves exoskeleton, the Chitin and then the Hypo peg invades into the body of the insect. And mummify is them.

Speaker 3:          00:33:50       So these are many people have heard about these Zombie fungi. This is what they are. Uh, some of them have a cordyceps representation is a little club, fungi and Costa Rica and elsewhere in the subtropics, the, um, um, many of the ants there are well known for the leaf cutter ants and other ants are known that they have to get infected with this fungus. They climb to the top canopy of the trees and they locked her mandible underneath the leaf and bullying a mushroom comes out of their head and their anus, uh, and a sport lights in this way, the fungus gets us sporty, late and free air conditions high up in the canopy. So it causes uncontrolled behavior of climbing with these insects. So this item, it's breakthrough and the reason why, and I ended up licensing in this to a group of investors and I got $1 million.

Speaker 3:          00:34:38       And, uh, so I like to tell my daughter, um, she was very instrumental in this and, um, the licensing agreement had some limits on it. They had to take it to market within five years. I pulled back to the licensing agreement. Um, and they didn't take it the market. So I pulled it back and everything is actually quite friendly. Um, but it's a little bit of a mystery why he did not make it to market. Um, and I have a lot of conspiracy theories as to why I did not make it to market. Um, I hesitate to mention those. Um, but I was given a chunk of change and I was smart enough to realize that they can't crush this and that was a condition. This has to come to market but doesn't come to market. Then I get the patent rights back and now I've been issued a nine patents on this. People can go to the u s patent homepage and look them up. The latest patent that was issued on this two years ago is really phenomenal because I have patents on the antiviral properties of mycelium and have these patents on these entimopathogenic fungi were all insects in all diseases vectored by in sucks. It doesn't get bigger than that.

Speaker 4:          00:35:47       Are there any types of, and um, uh, there, there are a number of different areas I want to dig deeper. Are there, are there any particular common viruses or particularly lethal viruses that you've seen applications for using mycelium in terms of resistance or defeating?

Speaker 3:          00:36:10       Yeah, well, there's there, there's a lot of examples of that. Um, and so I published an article and a journal peer reviewed journal called Herbal Graham and in June of 2001 summarizing a, all the literature that's been published on the, on the antiviral properties of mushroom mycelium is a whopping one page long with like six references. The virtually very, very little out there. Well that was in June of 2001 September 11th, 2001, you know, nine 11 occurred very quickly. The greatest concern for the US Defense Department and, and biosecurity was a weapon izable viruses, uh, pox viruses, you know, anthrax is a bacteria. The anthrax attacks occurred a few weeks later, a group of researchers in the US Defense Department where scabbing Jane the literature saw my article and I said, wow, there's some evidence here. And they contacted me because I had a very large, large library. Now it may sound large to people who don't have libraries.

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       I have about 800 strains of a different species of mushrooms, Co, many of which collected from the old growth forest. Uh, it's now some libraries have 20,000, you know, uh, culture. So I'm small compared to them, but I'm private. I'm not a big institution. And so they said, well, listen, you've, you've probably some interesting articles here. There's some evidence. We have been this, the fund funded by Dick Cheney and George George Bush. Ironically, I have a debt of gratitude to them with a bio shield by defense program. It's called project biodefense, but then became known as the Bio Shield program. And so they elicited my support and then I begin to send them cultures, mushrooms, boiled and hot water, ethanol extracts of the mushrooms and mycelium that gave rise to the mushrooms, et Cetera, et cetera. And so I ended up sending out a set them a hundred of these samples.

Speaker 3:          00:38:08       I mean, this is for me, this is a coup d'etat. I have government laboratories, I'll give me free research, you know, on my extracts. And so we started sending these out and didn't hear from them for awhile. And, um, and he's realized there were really disorganized. It was a new program and I got a colonel, I love that you mentioned his name. He worked at Fort Dietrich, you know, where they have smallpox and you know, it's a bio bio weapons facility biohazard, um, facility. The US government, we have the most pathogenic bacteria and viruses and other disease organisms. And so I had an MD person who was my controller it federal express. One day, you know, about two months later after I submitted the extracts, a dumper made this big package of research reports on anti POCs properties, smallpox properties of our extracts. Well, I mean, going through it and no activity, no activity.

Speaker 3:          00:39:03       I get the sample number 78 I activity against pox viruses and then sample 81 high activity sample 88 high activity. Whoa. I mean, it's like, you know, you're looking at a not effective and no results in the first 77 pages. You know, it's pretty disappointing. Then Bam, I got really excited. So I called my, I called up my colonel, uh, Fort Dietrich and, and I said, these results are amazing. It's exciting. And he goes, what results? I got the results that Federal Express just delivered to me. He goes, you're not supposed to get those. I am. I said, well, I'll make a photocopy and I'll send them to you. That he didn't appreciate the humor, but it was a very, very bizarre time and some very, very strange things have occurred, um, that at that time. But we ended up finding that those three highly active results came from an old growth mushroom called a guera con.

Speaker 3:          00:40:00       Now, Gary Econ is the longest living mushroom in the world, number one or number two, some debate about that grows exclusively in the old growth forest, northern California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, and a few Sky Islands in Europe. And, and um, the outs as the Slovenia, uh, um, and Austria on large trees, but it is an indicator species of an old growth forest. And those three anti ox results came from three different separate strains of a Garrick con than isolated, um, from my many adventures in the old growth forest. So whoa, this has got people very excited. Now I love to be taken to the mat. I'm referenced driven. Okay. So anybody out there is skeptical of this. You can do two things. You can Google my name Stamets national public radio and PR and POCs and you'll see a vetted press release interview on National Public Radio with me.

Speaker 3:          00:40:56       The former deputy director of the FDA and the head of one of the research division is about shield by defense program, Dr Jack Secrets from Southern Research University. So, and then so because I'm in competition with Pharma and I'm a lone researcher, how the Little Company and um, I thought, well, I'm like, I checked into this and I already had this entimopathogenic fungi patents that were just, you know, tremendous achievements because the entire pesticide industry missed all of that. Um, so I thought, well, this is novel. I should protect myself. So I filed a patent it on a gear icon against viruses, uh, particularly pox viruses, flu viruses, herpes, these are all the other results that we received. These extracts are highly active against multiple viruses. It's national, not pox viruses. Quick question for you, is that prevent for preventative use? Curator to use both. What are the applications? This is Tim where I have to draw the line, um, because these are in vitro, in vitro tests with human cells and taking through three different, uh, uh, testing protocols to the point where the next task is in, uh, in, uh, in Vivo model, right?

Speaker 3:          00:42:13       And it was an animal. So this is the best pharmaceutical drug discovery that you can go through before you get to get to go to a living host. These are living human cells, uh, in, in vitro, not in Vivo. In Vivo means this, you know, as small mammal, like an, uh, uh, a mouse, you know, a rat, you know, a monkey or, or it goes into human clinical studies. So these are vitro testing and to be, even though we have identified now the molecules that are active against smallpox, we worked with the University of Mississippi School of pharmacy under Dr Cmr Ross. We did come out and guided fractionation over many years and we have identified two new anti POCs molecules, more potent than side Dapa beer, which is the preeminent, uh, comparative antiviral drug control with less toxicity. And more efficacy than sendoff at Vera. But that being said, there's clearly an upregulation of the immune system and so what is the contribution of these molecules versus upgrading of the immune system is a combination of both.

Speaker 3:          00:43:23       Is there a synergism is there's multiple molecules being engaged, multiple immune pathways. This is where you can get lost. You cannot see the forest for the trees. If you end up focusing so much on the mechanisms of action and don't see the result. If you were infected with the money's viruses, you didn't really don't care about the mechanism of action. You just wanted to know whether you can overcome the virus or not. So we have found the anti epox molecules. We have not yet found the anti flu or the anti herpes molecules today. And I have another really good example of is specific to your original question. The mycelium being active against viruses. Can I pause for one quick second and see. I have to know what happened after the lieutenant call because I imagine someone on his end had to have their head role for that type of security breach, mailing FedEx to the wrong place with those research reports.

Speaker 3:          00:44:23       What happened after that? Oh my God, I don't have to make up these stories. I don't have to make up any stories are too good to be true as they are, but this is what happened. I was in Canada. I'm speaking to you right now from Cortez Island, British Columbia. I was up here on Cortez Island and one of my employees called up and said, Paul, there's a helicopter buzzing around the laboratories. I go, no big deal. Helicopters fly over all the time, and he goes, no, it's really low. And I go, how low? And he goes, listen. He puts a cell phone up to the back of your tongue. I go, well, I go, what are the numbers on the tail? He goes, there are new numbers as a Black Hawk military helicopter that's right on top of the laboratories. I go, oh my God, you're kidding. I go, and this is right after we got the pox results.

Speaker 3:          00:45:12       Right after I talked to the colonel, you know, like two weeks later or a week later. And I said, okay, listen, shut down the business. I knew immediately, you know, the government is going to screw up here and they're going out there and an abundance of caution, they're going to end up overstepping their bounds. And I said, this is crazy. I've already been vetted. I've already been permitted. I've already in dialogue with these people. Uh, and they, they're trying to spook me. I mean, what's going on here? So I shut down the business at the time, only had 10 employees. Now I have a hundred. Um, and I said, so shut down the business, give the cultures of Americon to several of the employees. I never want to know who has them. You know, let's decentralize our self as a target right now. And so I shut down the business, all of the employees left, you know, and the helicopter is still buzzing around.

Speaker 3:          00:45:56       And so the next day I called up pretty pissed off to the colonel and saying, what is going on? You know? And he got really nervous. Now he's got two black eyes, right? They delivered the wrong results, right, results to the wrong person. And now that one, you know, he goes, oh, the government, you know, on one hand doesn't talk to the other. And they got over exuberant and you know, in, you know, terrorist got this technology that could immunize themselves and their credit and it's like whatever, you know. So anyhow, it's funny because I was going through the airports. I got five stars on every single airline ticket. I joke to my wife, here we go again, I'm gonna get stopped and searched, you know, and then after this, then all those, those five stars got taken away and I stream through security to no problem.

Speaker 3:          00:46:45       But I was obviously suddenly on their radar because I'm, I'm a nonconventional. Um, but the fact that I'm here today, actually, it makes me more of a pitch Arctic American than I was before. So then he, so this is, so I found these continents I patent on, on the Cara con versus these viruses. I found it in 2004. You can look this up, go to the u s patent homepage, you'll see my filing dates. I filed this patent in 2004. 2009 11 was 2001 so I had to write to pat and get more research results. We got lots and lots of positive results from the Bio Shield program. I think they, I talked to him when the researchers last year and he goes, do you know that we analyzed 2,392 of your samples? Taiwan, I'm so I didn't have to pay for that. Um, but we got about 40 excellent hits from my 800 or so cultures.

Speaker 3:          00:47:37       Um, uh, that were surprising. Um, which has led into I think a paradigm shifting solution that for many of the problems that we face today, but I thought filed this patent in 2004, 2006 is not even on the patent application or homepage. Anybody out there who didn't know about patents. It's usually six months to a year. That patent application shows up at the U S P t o. Dot. Gov website, US patent and trademark office, a.gov website. And it didn't show up. It's over two years. So I called her hold, my patent attorney gone, you know what is going on here? He gets a hold of the patent office and the Department of Defense took the patent out of the patent office because of national security. I said, you're kidding. That's kind of a pat on my back. I was like, wow, really? You think that's not important? Um, but I said, that's not right.

Speaker 3:          00:48:25       So we did an intergovernmental agency trace and a request and the dod finally released a patent to go back into the queue. And so 10 years after I submitted a patent application, folks, usually two to three years, you get a ruling 10 years after I smoothed the pattern, it was approved. That's a long way as it has a long way. The good news is, is there a proven 2014 so I've got 17 years. And the whole thing about patents, I mean we would not be talking today if there weren't patents. People think of patents become open source after 17 years. The idea is to reward the inventor, to incentivize things to come to market because a patent that is not practiced is not useful or beneficial to society. You know, within that 17 years or outside the 17 years, it has to be brought to market.

Speaker 3:          00:49:15       There has to be a commercial center. Patents are awarded for three reasons. One, no prior art, no evidence. And then the to victor or proper literature of anyone saying is having the same idea to an obviousness. You want experts saying, Paul Stamets, you're full of BS. This will never work. And so I have a message to all my critics out there. I want to say thank you. You've helped me so much in ways that you did not intend. But I'm really happy that some people these days. And the third is usefulness. So those three things, no prior art, contrary to conventional wisdom. You know, and, and usefulness. And so, you know, obviously that fits all three of those categories so that then the, the, the molecules are, I have not patents and patented. They're open source. Hopefully we'll never have a smallpox epidemic or pandemic again. And I think that's obviously it serves a greater good.

Speaker 2:          00:50:11       So another followup question that, uh, out of self interest, I'd love to ask related to the carpenter ants. So for people who are eager to try to address something with carpenter, and specifically, are there any current recommendations

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       that you would have, number one, and then talking about conventional or contrary to conventional wisdom? I think at this point people are wondering, how did this guy become so obsessed with this stuff? Uh, so I do want to roll back the clock and talk about, among other things your stutter, but first I have to know, is there anything you would recommend as it relates to carpenter ants or is it a waiting game?

Speaker 3:          00:50:53       Well, they, they test him. A patent is that it's reproducible. The EPA and Usda now are allowing this fungus and food handling facilities, the first fungus ever to be allowed for controlling insects and food handling facilities. It has that safe. The safety, the safety documents supplied by the EPA are now, uh, open source and then public domain. So the companies that did all the research proving that this fungus was not dangerous. Uh, now I released all of our commercial interest in it. This train of met [inaudible] called [inaudible] two is that public domain strain? Um, so what I'm saying is you're not legal for you to go out and use this and commercialize it without EPA administration. Uh, but that Tesla, the patent is reproducible. And so all of the methods for doing this is published. And I'm, and I'm, I just submitted my entire portfolio with all my research on all eight or nine patents, all the documentation of all these companies that have done the research, you know, in themselves.

Speaker 3:          00:52:02       Um, and I've submitted to a very, very well known company that has an extremely potent, uh, insecticide that many people know that use it on the market. And as the word I got back is why would we want to disrupt a proven profit wheel is something that we, my aunts did not reinvented for 10 years because after the ants were killed, the carpenter ants, they sporulated. So the spore repellency property prevented future invasions. That's not a very good economic model when you can treat a house once and they don't come back a far better economic business plan is having consumer buying it every month and spraying toxic chemicals that killed the workers, but don't kill the queen. The whole, the whole key to this is the mycelium is taken back into the nest. Like a Trojan horse is presented to the queen who then presents to the brood and they're all living in this honey.

Speaker 3:          00:52:58       This sort of my ciliated uh, um, um, uh, a palace. Uh, and then before they realize it, it's sporty lates and it kills the queen. They can kill the queen. You can control call the colony after a spoiler lace. The spore repellency property prevents other were carpenter ants from coming into your house. So it's a 10 year solution for about 25 cents. Um, that's what it costs to produce. Of course, the packaging and all that stuff. You'd add up the numbers pretty quickly, but is incredibly, it's very inexpensive to produce and it can be produced in huge quantities. So it did not make it to market. And I, I, I'm exasperated. Um, I one really great story on this that this woman named Chris and that works for a company that has three letters in their name. She was, she was given the mandate because of the stockholders were really upset because of the reputation of this company causing toxic spills that harmed thousands of people and they wanted it to grow green movement.

Speaker 3:          00:54:04       Can you find green solutions? She was given the mandate to find a green solution to replace toxic insecticides. He says, given a budget. And she found me, we dialogue for months. I gave her samples, she set up experiments to the researchers who were so excited. They called me up at home and both of them said, I'm not supposed to be telling you this, but this is the most exciting thing we've ever seen in our life. You know, as as as entomologist and fighting these problems, she went to the board of directors are the priority, were going, we, we connected whenever the data together and messaging, you know, how to create, you know, the most clear communication to the board of directors, all men. And she was a steal at Magnolia, Magnolia. I've never met her in person. I wanted to hire her immediately. She ran these, these, these meetings just so professionally and she was really excited and she went, go down and the next day in the afternoon, I'm waiting for her call and she calls and the person on the phone is so angry.

Speaker 3:          00:55:01       I'm going, who is this? And I go, this is Chris. She goes, I'm so angry. I can't see straight. I go, I mean, she's totally composed before and she's lost her composure. I go, Chris, what happened? She goes, I went in there, I made my presentation, all men and looked at me steely-eyed and she said, this is the best you gave me this mandate. I have found something. It's a game changer. They can, again, we can come with an ecologically rational and sustainable solution based on nature. Um, and they looked at her and a dour face and then the chairman of the company looked at her and said, Chris, you're a budget. Never was in research. It was an advertising, very much similar to BP, beyond petroleum. How much of the BPS budget actually is an alternative fuels versus how much is an oil? Now, how much of their advertising budget is in alternative fuels as opposed so oil, I mean, clearly it's called greenwashing. And um, and so, so that, that was, and that just so that, that happened like seven or eight years ago. And then this past month I just had the same thing happen again. It's a disruptive technology. It rocks the apple cart in many of these insecticides are coming from the petroleum industry as byproducts from their waste material.

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       So, so I want to talk disruptive and something challenging to the status quo and contrary to most conventional wisdom. But that requires going way, way back. And talking a bit about perhaps your childhood, which you described in part already, but when did you develop a stutter and why don't you still have a stutter?

Speaker 3:          00:56:51       Uh, when I started stuttering, when really when I was, um, probably about five years old, I mean I started from the time that I could talk, um, my family was this fun, dysfunctional and I've been told that sometimes the type of stuttering that I have is that is related to a defect, um, and neurological development in the seventh and eighth months. That's one possible reason. But the type of study when I have anyone seen the king's speech, I had that and worse. So I just could not speak and I'd find alternative pathways to trick my brain with a preposition or adverbial phrase because your brain gets further ahead in your mouth, can articulate and then you become self conscious. And the type of stutterer that I am as most observers, we don't stutter when we sin. We don't stutter if I start speaking in that British accent, uh, or you create an accent and you don't stutter when you talk to animals.

Speaker 3:          00:57:56       So it's a very interesting, it's a, something that's triggered by social contact. And so it was very difficult for me to date ladies. They wanted the super jocks, the self assured men. And I was a stutterer. And so I used to always start at the ground and I found fossils I found mushrooms on, but it's very difficult for me now. I grew up in a small town in Ohio and my dad was a officer in the air craft carrier and the intrepid and soda and World War Two. So after World War Two, he got the intrepid aircraft carrier radio and it was in our basement. And so my brother John, who was very interested in chemistry, uh, he created this huge, you know, huge, like three racks of chemicals, you know, in the basement and his laboratory. He had bunsen burners, all sorts of experiments going on all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:58:50       And, but he never let me quote unquote play in laboratory. I can play on the radio. And I could watch him, but he's, my older brother was the youngest one in my family. So, and so John went on to Yale, my brother built on to Cornell and they left and they left me in this laboratory. So I, my dream was always to have a laboratory, you know, and living in the country and that kind of what I'm doing now. But John, when he came back from Yale, came back with a book called altered states of consciousness by Charles tart and it was an anthology of research articles on changing your consciousness of them, either drugs or from spinning or from dreams. One of the early books from years of California at Davis. So John lent me this book and I said, Johnny, I'm there like to see it, but he says it well cause I'm on break for two weeks, but I need the book because part of our class.

Speaker 3:          00:59:40       So I got this book and I'm just devouring this book, you know. And, and John was my hero. He was my mentor and John went to Mexico and Columbia came back with incredible stories of magic mushrooms and consuming them. You know, I just, I adored him. Of course I wanted to do the same. Then it gave me this book. And so I'm really getting excited about this, but my best friend Ryan Snyder wanted also to read this book. And so Ryan Goes, can I borrow your book now? Your Brother's book? I go, sure you can borrow it, but I need it back. And I started to give it back to me in two or three days. So several days passed and I asked Ryan about the book and he hemmed and hawed and a week later, where's the book? And he wouldn't respond, sort of looking at me in the eye and I always a good sign. Yeah. So I go, where's my book? And remember my, my is booking though. Then two weeks at my vagina, not pressuring me, Paul, I need that textbook, you know, as part of the class stuff, I finally got, I had got a hold of Ryan and I said, where is my brother's book? And my Ryan said, Paul, I can't give it back to, and I said, why? So my dad found it and burned it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:49       I said, your dad burned my brother's book, what? He goes, yeah, it was center to be counterculture and threatening, you know, to our family, you know, structure or not. I could not believe it. I was so upset and I was so apologetic to my brother who did not take it well, you know, like last time I'm going to trust you. They see you then. So I was really bad and so, so, but I thought to myself, you know, if this was so disturbing to this Alpha Male, you know, conservative, you know, neo-con like personality than I think I found the subject I'm going to explore more. So that got me into, into magic mushrooms and um, from my experience and also tremendous amount of guilt for my brother trusted me, but there's textbook and I couldn't return it to him. So John was really interested in this subject.

Speaker 3:          01:01:44       He inspired me. And then John went on to chemistry, then neurophysiology and University of Washington medical school on full scholarship. And I was left in the laboratory. And so I started experimenting with marijuana. I remember the DEA came to Columbia in Ohio. They had a whole display of drugs and a whole bunch of me and my friends just went there to look at them. Wow. Wow. Look at that one. How old were you at the time? 14. 15 years of age. I mean, drugs on display, drugs you've heard about, you've never seen. Huh? Look how small that LSC is. That's incredible. So I still had this really bad stuttering habit and it was really socially the ability dating, um, on multiple levels. And so I ended up, and I was in Ohio and I ended up buying a bag of magic mushrooms and I've never really into the drug scene, so I don't know if I know how much things should cost, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:02:36       So for 20 bucks I bought a bag and I just, I knew set and setting was really important, but I had no guide and nobody else in my little circle was into it. And so there was a really great walk that I would like to walk in the woods up on the hills and beautiful rolling hills and Ohio, northern Ohio. And, and I thought, okay, sentence I think is important. So I took the bag and, and um, I thought that would be one dose was not one of those folks. I probably ate about 20 grams of a slice of events. US. Now in defense of this, I need to make it clear that these were not grown and these were harvested and so there were exposed to the sun. So they may have been on the equivalent to like 10 grounds of cubensis for people who are listening, five grams, that's lots of, he commences to the hero's journey and you know, you're full blown.

Speaker 3:          01:03:25       You're into star scape, you're changing dimensions, you're fractal patterns. The error becomes a sea of mathematical formulas and your mind is opened up. Your hearts opened up your feel one with the universe. That's the, that's the hero's journey. That's five grams. You know, you don't get that until it was going over three grams. She started getting into it. But so 10 to 20 grams is, is the super hero's journey. I've never eaten these before. And so I walked, I was walking into this place about an hour walk. I started consuming them and drinking water because they were dried. And then, um, I saw a tree that I love climbing and this tree had his limb, so it was a perfect climbing tree and at the very top of the hill. So I thought that's a great place. I mean set and setting a, getting a good view.

Speaker 3:          01:04:11       That's what I need and I could feel the mushrooms coming on and I, as I climbed up the tree, you know, stem branch by branch, I got higher and higher. So it was kind of a ascending euphoria, you know, that kind of kind of went with everything. It was very cool. And I got to the top of the tree and beautiful landscape and I'm up there and then just the mushrooms are coming on and getting higher and higher. And, and I've realized when I'm really getting high here and a little dizzying, so I'm holding onto the tree and on the horizon. But this being Black Bank of boiling dark, angry clouds, it was a summer storm coming in. And Ohio, when you see the summer storms are hurt, they're terrifying. They're lightening bolts coming down and thunder and lightening there was off in the distance, but it was coming at me really quickly. But I'm getting higher and higher as a thunderstorm. Lightning storms coming closer and closer. I'm getting vertigo and I'd go, oh my God, I, you know, I can't get off the tree. I don't want to fall. It's like held on the tree for dear life. And it became my axis Mundi sort of my access to write into the earth and I just an amazing experience. I mean, just beautiful experience,

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       but also the threat of lightning coming closer and closer and every lightning strike it would hit them, be fractal patterns would just emanate out from every lightning striking. This is a synesthesia occurred, you know, where there, you know, uh, it sound and, and, and, and visions were merging together and, and um, it sounds, had visions and visions that sounds, and it was just an incredibly complex, you know, the, one of my favorite books are the glass bead game by, by Hermann Hessa. I'll also called a master Ludy and some other area died. He got the Nobel prize for it in 1955. Um, but that, that was a deep dive into, into inner space exploration. But I felt like I was part of the glass bead game and I, there I was, I was descending into this higher state of consciousness and then I realize, oh my God, I'm in the highest point in miles during a lightning storm.

Speaker 5:          01:06:14       This is not a good place to be. And uh, and then I was up there, I was terrified and the lightning storm came closer and closer and I had these can pathogenic, you know, just empathy for the universe one, everything is fine. If I die here today, my life is complete now I understand. I'm part of the fabric of all the matter that surround me. I'm one with everything I made of stardust. Everything's made us start us. This is a continuum of nature. Death is natural, birth is natural transitions or, or just the way of way of existence. And then the lightning storm and the wind came up. I'm washed with warm rain and it was just terrifying. A lightning storm and I that meant that there. And I'm thinking, Oh, I'm going to die, but if I don't die, Paul, what are you going to learn from this experience?

Speaker 5:          01:07:04       Challenge yourself right now. This is all great and wonderful, but let's get down to brass tacks. What's your biggest issues? You're not going to die? What's your biggest issue? I stuttering. So I'm having this dialogue with myself. I just can't overcome this stuttering habit, you know, I'm not stupid. And I went to for people to understand how bad it was, I was interviewed for special education because of my stuttering because I couldn't read in class. And so when it's my turn to read, I, I, they would pass on me because no one had the patience to hear a stutterer and please don't finish a or a sentence. Look at them, smile and engage. Help them finish their sentence, don't finish it for them. That robs them of the opportunity of overcoming this speech deficits. Um, so I scored high on my test, so I didn't get it put into special education, but it was a pretty demoralizing to realize I'm going to go in to the special education class.

Speaker 5:          01:08:07       Um, but I didn't. So I thought stuttering is my issue. And so I started saying to myself, Paul, stop stuttering now. You can do this. You're not stupid in it. Come from a very smart family. You have, you know, you can do this. And so I said, stop stuttering now over and over and over again. Hundreds if not thousands of times, and there's storm washed over me. I felt like I achieved a state of godhead. I felt enlightened. I come from a Christian background. So I had this empathic empathy with Jesus. You know, and now you understand why Jesus went into wilderness. And I don't understand why Jesus said, don't go into churches, go in the nature or whatever. You know, that's my cultural background. But I saw it, I connected on that level and I realized, oh my gosh, this is something that I can overcome.

Speaker 5:          01:08:55       So I came out of the tree, obviously did not get electric and went back home. And then the next morning there's this girl that I greatly admired and she was super sweet and nice to me and I really love her to this day because of her kindness. Um, and, and I didn't want to talk to her because every time I talk I, you know, and then you get these half breaths going on and then you can't get out of this loop. And, um, she's coming on the sidewalk and in the morning and she looks at me and she's so sweet. He said, good morning Paul, how are you? And I cast my eyes up from the sidewalk and I looked at her and I said, I'm doing fine, thank you for asking. And I stopped stuttering just like that. Now I do have, I've had about four or five relapses, you know, um, if that's a lot of noise and I've been drinking and somebody asks me, how do you grow mushrooms?

Speaker 5:          01:09:57       It's like filling a well with a teaspoon. I like, where do I begin? You know, like so, or if I mean somebody super famous or something like that, you know, it's, but that's natural. You know, people get stage fright, um, when they're, you know, and so, but if it's something that I think is really important because there's one other aspect there's related to hearing that I want to mention and I have a really good friend, he just passed on now named Bill Webb. He lived in big Sur California and I was 19 years old when I wrote my first book, Salafi mushrooms and their allies. I was self-trained, I got involved in University of Washington with Dr. Daniel Stones, part of a taxonomic key council. And I adopted the taxonomy of psilocybin mushrooms as my special reality. Yeah. That the time, there's very little literature on it.

Speaker 5:          01:10:46       Most of the books in libraries have been raised. The pages had been raised it out. Doctor students had an intact library, so I could study with them. I became a taxonomist. I wrote talks about Mickey's starting when I was 19 or 20. And that became the core of my book. So I'm uh, have this manuscript and I go to Montana books in Seattle to pitch the book and Montana books is pretty soon some, some gay friendly literature and they were on the cutting edge. I was recommended that I see them. And so I made an appointment, I go up to Seattle and I'm in a meeting, the head of Montana books and he goes, you know, this is not, our market is an interesting subject. Really what you need is a book agent and it goes to the best book agent I know. Cause Bill Webb and I haven't seen him in two years.

Speaker 5:          01:11:32       And at the sounds of those words, a little bell jingles on the front door of Montana books in walks, Bill Webb and the publisher one. No. So bill and I became tight friends, invited me down to big Sur. He was a friend, uh, of, uh, of uh, Henry Miller, um, and um, and just a really fantastic individually become a father figure to me at a really critical time in my life. And so bill and I did journeys together, you know, sacred journeys without any alibi. Obi wan Kenobi. You're realize I'm 19, 20 years old of age. I'm with a 75 year old, you know, who is a friend of Ansell Adams. He had Ansell, Adams Library of, of uh, of many of his implants and working with his wife and curating them. I mean really cultured intellectually interesting guy, beautiful place. And so bill and I tripped several times and it was a wonderful experience for me and it brings tears to my eyes is talking about bill.

Speaker 5:          01:12:37       So bill, he died about 15 years ago and bill calls me up about three or four months before he dies and he goes, Paul, I for telling you something that's so important. I'm jealous. I haven't heard from you in years. How's it going? He goes, well, frankly, life socks. I've lost losing my sight. I'm losing my hearing. I can't hear the waves. So this equals now I live above the cliffs of big Sur except for this damn hearing aid, which has always malfunctioning. They say, I hate it, but I've got to tell you something. It's so important that you know, I go, okay, Bill. And I said, what is it? Bill goes, no, I really want you to listen, Paul. This is important, Bill. I understand. And then he kind of kept on emphasizing ends. And finally I got frustrated and bill, I got the message, okay, I know what you're gonna tell me.

Speaker 5:          01:13:22       It's important because I want to make sure that you tell other people, will you promise me? And I go, I promise you. He said, Paul, I think I found something medically very important about Saul Simon. I go, what? He said, well, you don't run on the hero's journey. I was, you know, took out my hearing aid. I'm laying, you know, in full bliss and one with the universe. You know, he's like 80 years age or 82 years of age when he was doing this by himself as I know. I could hear the seagulls, I can hear the waves. I know, oh my gosh, I can hear everything. And he reached for his hearing aid. He didn't have it in. And he goes, oh my gosh, I can here. And then he heard this, click, click, click, click, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. He looked around going, that's, that's weird. It doesn't unusual sound and pick, click, click, click, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, click like. And he goes, he couldn't figure out what it was. He looked around, he looked around and finally he saw what it was. There are ants walking on the deck and it was hearing their footsteps. That is wild. Now this is where even I, and I'm a liberal kind of guy, I'm like, wait a second, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:14:29       tell me that again. You know, and that's why bill set me up by saying you have to tell other people this. So I'm in work working with youth, with Roland Griffiths at Johns Johns Hopkins University, the clinical studies on Psilocybin, etc. And I am really emphasize this to the many of the researchers they could easily do attached, you know, why these patients are in session, uh, to test their hearing. Is He, if they have increased sensitivity, increased range, tonal ranges, is it very easy metric? But I think what happened with me on the tree and the lightening storm is that I created a new neurological pathway of articulating my thoughts and overcoming this social phobia. The social phobia is a trigger is definitely an environmental trigger. And then we get locked into these loops that are really, really strange. Another good thing to tell a study room is can you demonstrate different ways of stuttering? They'll do it. You want me to start her different ways of stuttering? I'll give you three different ways and stuttering and it is so it's really weird because that act as a pattern interrupt that helps them to overcome at least temporarily the stuttering or is it just a useful for a nonstarter order here, different ways of stuttering.

Speaker 6:          01:15:51       Hmm.

Speaker 5:          01:15:52       I haven't thought of that. That's, I'm not sure how to answer that, but I do think that once a new neurological pathways are established, you can capitalize on them.

Speaker 6:          01:16:04       Okay,

Speaker 5:          01:16:04       bye. Were you remembering them? And this is the thing that John Hopkins University, some of the most surprising results is 14 months after these experiences when many of the patients said there was the most important spiritual experiences of our lives. 14 months afterwards. Not only they have demonstrated will benefits being nicer, people being a better parent, a better husband, socially more well adopted. But the fact that they reremembered the experience re enforced those benefits that they experienced directly after the experience. So a lot of people, people are listening may not understand, these are not drugs of abuse. You eat these mushrooms one day, the next day, you'll no way. I'm mark one near those things. You look at them and you've got the repellency property, right? The psilocybin repellency property. Like I'm not talking about it for months, but boy, that was a great experience. You know, so these are not substances of abuse, but there are shockingly powerful to the point that you're not ready for the hero's journey for a long time.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       So these are not drugs of abuse by any stretch of the imagination. They really should be recategorized as a therapeutic drug.

Speaker 4:          01:17:17       Definitely. Uh, and this, this in many ways relates to your, well, it relates to a few of your previous stories very well in so much as a silicide is very challenging as a medical model in, in several respects, one of which is that it does not require, say, daily or weekly administration. And it is economically difficult to create a for profit model unless you are monetizing a therapy and adjunct pre and post support and things of that type a but not in the, the sort of one and done or three times and done aspect of it actually makes it very challenging to commercialize and make widespread unless you're relating on, uh, or relying on donations. Excuse me. Uh, I would love to hear your thoughts. Just to expand on this a little bit. Do you think, say psilocybin or another that I know very little about but wanted to discuss with you, but we can talk about both or either say lion's Mane, are there in this case, should I say mushrooms or should I say my psyllium or my Cilia? What would be the right way to art and we won't be the right term to use here? Well, yeah, the

Speaker 3:          01:18:39       mushrooms are like white people know, is it emerging as a tremendously important reservoir of many bioactive molecules that are supersede the benefit of mushrooms, 25 and whole genome sequencing of a Reishi mushrooms and the genus. Again, a Dharma, um, uh, these, uh, the common links link g lyncher a ratio of men and talking 10,000 year a mushroom, the mushroom of immortality. These are all common names out of Asia. Um, they're 25% more genes are active and expressed and the mycelial form than it is. And the fruit body form that they fruit buys a mushroom form as the end of its lifecycle. So much of our research as found going side by side comparisons of mushrooms, which are protein rich, uh, they're a Beta Glucan, a rich, they have lots of carbohydrates and then polysaccharides, they're nutritionally dense. But the mycelium is, is articulating constantly I bio shield of defense and uh, if I'm the exposure when the mushrooms form good luck to any bacteria and it's going to rot it. It's got to, it's got to spoilating four or five days and then gives himself up anyhow. Moreover, I think that the sequence of bacteria that rots mushrooms is absolutely instrumentally and uh, important for the evolution of the ecosystem that give rise to the trees that create the debris fields that feed the mycelium. So these are deterministic microbiomes and the micro biome, the, the fungal is determining

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       the micro biome because many of these bacteria are adversarial and some of our commensal somewhere actually mutualistic beneficial. So that mycelium is this articulation of this network that because of EPA genesis, the ability to respond to environmental stimuli and upregulate and express nude and gene expressions, it is a fertile ground for, uh, learning for being able to articulate a responses as new challenges and the environment, the mushroom fruit body is at the end of the thing. But you know, people are attracted to mushrooms and they fear that typically nature of that, which is a femoral. Now we're around trees and around dogs and animals and plants for weeks, months, years. So the familiar either factor of constant exposure day to day gives us some confidence and oh that animal is not going to attack me. Or that plant is one that my answers have been using and, and we understand it, but mushrooms that come up and disappear in four or five days, some can feed you, some can kill you, some can heal you, some can send you on a psychoactive journey that which is so powerful, but so ephemeral is naturally to be afraid of them.

Speaker 5:          01:21:17       So we have about 200 species of mushrooms that are edible, medicinal. I don't know the difference between edible and medicinal anymore. I'm all edible. Mushrooms have medicinal properties, but the mycelium expresses a lot more of these compounds. And with lion's Mane, there's a group of uh, Aaron Ne Scenes. Now the lion's mane mushroom is called Harris Iom. Erinaceous. That's the Latin binomial. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:21:40       Paul, I don't interrupt, but I just want to pause for one second to plant a seed and we can come back to it or spore and come back to it later, which is potential applications to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. But I don't want to interrupt. I just want to plant that seed so that I don't forget it myself. So please continue.

Speaker 5:          01:21:57       So the [inaudible] are some of the strongest and nerve growth factor is ever discovered by science. Ngf factors are called neuroco factors and they regenerate Myelin on the axons of nerves. So now lion's mane is perfectly legal. Um, it has a long history of use, multi thousands of years. History of you. It looks like a, a casket. It looks like pom poms that cheerleaders shoes. Yes, a white casket and crystals, uh, a descending, uh, um, um, teeth. Um, and it's a beautifully beautiful mushroom. It tastes like shrimp or lobster when you add butter to it and when you cook it. But the compounds that are most neuro generative are from the Mycelium, not from the mushrooms. And so the era ne scenes are from the Mycelium Harvison knowns are another group of Norwest factors there from the mushrooms, but the [inaudible] is by far, much more neuro regenerative. There's been several clinical studies that have come out on mild cognitive dysfunction out of Japan.

Speaker 5:          01:23:00       Um, and they are very promising isn't as the, it's the first smart mushroom wall. Silicide mushrooms, maybe the first smart mushroom in my mind, but, but, but lion's mane mushrooms is one mushroom that I take on a daily basis. My mother takes it on a daily basis. She's almost 93 years of age and a few days. Uh, she's smart as a whip. She beat my two brothers and scrabble and not too long ago, which was a lot of fun. I went really, I told them my brother's mom beat you is gravel, you know, and my twin brother go low. You know, she got lucky and I go, oh, that was a clean wind then who? My brother was very defensive. But, but nevertheless, my, the lion's Mane Mushrooms I think are extremely helpful, uh, to for rent, neuropathies. And I think stacking them with silicide.

Speaker 5:          01:23:47       And something I'm really keen on is doing microdosing of psilocybin stacked with lion's mane, the lion's mane in and of itself. We know as neuro regenerative properties is a big subject of research. If you go to pub med or Google scholar alerts, you know, put in lion's Mane and neuro regeneration or an NGF factors and you'll, you'll, there's several dozen peer reviewed articles extensively exploring the regeneration of Myelin, which is the conductive sheath on the axons of nerves and those where I gets Alzheimer's if for instance, have amyloid plaque formation that interrupts in the roads, the Myelin sheath prevents neurotransmission. And so lion's mane mushrooms have been demonstrated, uh, behaviorally and people with cognitive tests, but also, um, through a dissection of mice, uh, prior to using lion's mane, they would inject these mice with a polypeptide that induces amyloid plaque formation. It's a very, very potent toxin.

Speaker 5:          01:24:53       There's neuro neurotoxic, but mix out of the, what happens to the nervous system of Alzheimer's patients because amyloid plaque formation can be, yeah, it can conform their behavior changes, they lose the ability of the navigating through mazes. They lose the novelty, inquisitive, and in fact factor, the short term memory is basically erased, um, uh, or much of it. And then when they've had the lion's Mane Mushrooms and they dissected, doesn't mice and then sure enough they saw that the amyloid plaque formation was there and then there's fully a diseased mice when they would then feed them lion's Mane mushroom for 23 days. They regained the ability of navigating through maize. They, we engaged inquisitiveness is called the novelty, a response, then all the tea experiment. Um, and then upon dissecting those knife, uh, and the resections of the tissue, they could see that the amyloid plaque had largely resolved [inaudible] nation had occurred.

Speaker 5:          01:25:51       And so you bundle that with, you know, you've got to behavior as well as physical evidence of regeneration of Myelin. So lion's mane mushrooms are, it's just a very, very fascinating mushroom I think about and his last days I think about some of my mentors and my collegey and their very last days, we are losing encyclopedic knowledge. These are mental giants that have so much to give to the next generation as part of our national heritage or intellectual national heritage. And to lose these, these geniuses with all this experience, all this knowledge, all this sense of being and contexts to lose them at the end of their life is us losing a library that just as the library books fall into pieces in your hands. And, and I think it's so important for, of our culture is to preserve that knowledge. And I think lion's mane mushroom is a huge one.

Speaker 4:          01:26:44       The slow descent into sort of cognitive malfunction, uh, is, is what I would site when people ask me what I'm afraid of. I mean that that is it. I mean, being trapped in your body without the cognitive capabilities that you would want or need to not just function but thrive. And I completely agree with you. This is something I've been fixated on for quite some time. If you were to, uh, if you were to design a study involving the microdosing micro administration of psilocybin under a proper supervision and uh, you know, sort of researcher controls, what, do you have any idea what that might look like? What the protocol might look like?

Speaker 5:          01:27:32       Very timely question because in two hours from now, I have a group of, uh, uh, of financial people, uh, that are key in supporting the current psilocybin research at Johns Hopkins and elsewhere. Uh, they're arriving here, uh, specifically and saying with me for three days to talk about exactly this. I had an idea and I'm going to probably open source this. Sometimes I filed patents, I call them blocking patents. I filed a patent. I think she'd be open source in order if the other people can't get a patent on it. And this might be in that category. Um, it's this whole patent landscape. I'm, I'm, I, I see both sides of the arguments of open sourcing and then also keeping things close source. But I found a patent on neurogenesis. You can look it up and stacking lion's mane, psilocybin and Niacin, nicotinic acid. Now, uh, I spoke before what is patentable.

Speaker 5:          01:28:25       It is no prior art is speaks against conventional wisdom. So, and when I gave a talk at maps, um, uh, recently I asked the audience about 800 people. How many people remember during the 1970s and eighties, it was well known, especially on the west coast. If you want to come down from a bad trip on psilocybin or Lsd, you could take a bunch of Nice, then you'll get a hot flush flush and people who don't know what may take 500 milligrams of Niacin. You get red and you get tingly all over your skin and you've got this nice and flush and now about 50 people raised their hands. I actually recorded that. I needed that for my patentability because that was common knowledge that Niacin counteract the effects of soul side. I think not number one, there's no evidence that that's true, but it was common knowledge.

Speaker 5:          01:29:17       Number two, because it excites the nerve endings and Rob Kathy's oftentimes occur then the deadening of the nerves at the fingertips and the toes. It struck me that if I could excite the nerve endings, perhaps I can drive these lion mane and lion's mane air a scenes and the psilocybin to the end points of the nervous systems if the vascular system still intact to deliver these compounds to create neurogenesis. Uh, and prevent neuropathy, uh, at the end points of the nervous system. So I filed a patent, a stacking Niacin silicide and lion's mane. This psilocybin a dosage is about one 20th of a gram now that is below the threshold of what people would experience any change in consciousness. So I know lots of people who would not dare take us all type of mushroom, but the idea of taking one 20th below threshold dose that would create neurogenesis and perhaps make them cognitively more astute and make them a better person.

Speaker 5:          01:30:17       You know, socially and intellectually. I knew a lot of people were interested in that. And plus it's kind of groovy. It's kind of sexy. He's older people say their kids, I'm micro dosing, you know, my go to thing. Extremely popular right now as you probably are well aware, but that's something that I, that we would like to see a clinical study now the clinical stuff we already know for there, any conditions out there. You have too many variables and you're in your clinical study and I agree. And so we were looking at silicide alone. That's a lion's mane alone. Silicide and stock with, uh, with lion's mane. Niacin will have to come later because it's just you and you need enough cohorts, enough people enrolled in the clinical study in order to have us statistical significance almost stuttered there. Um, uh, so that's, that's what we're looking at is looking at stocking this and, and we maybe do this clinical study in Canada.

Speaker 5:          01:31:13       Uh, right now the FDA is very favorable to the clinical studies. I had a, a report from somebody met with the FDA regulators and they're scientists and they said they have never seen a drug that was so nontoxic, so effective from one treatment and the history of they're looking at approving new drugs. Uh, and they were like, so the FDA scientists are quite focused on that. And it's something we all in different between medicine and a toxin. This dose, I wouldn't call it silicide went of toxin. Well, there's maybe one, one funny example that just came out in the literature of that, but, um, I wouldn't call it necessarily a toxin, but having a sub threshold dose I think makes a

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       is it is a really valid approach because, um, and you probably shouldn't take these every day because you had normalized their receptors. And so Washington said the receptors and having them recalibrate themselves is probably a good thing to do. So pulse therapy, three to four days on three to four days off is, I'm probably a better approach than taking them every day so that the jury's out on that and a lot of different opinions of it, of it. Some,

Speaker 4:          01:32:29       it's, it's endlessly fascinating though. And you are right on the, on the money, so to speak, or lack of money given how effective they are in limited number of sessions at the combination, which is certainly has been studied in, is being studied of efficacy and low toxicity. Um, and as you mentioned earlier, if a rat, if you put, and you know Michael Pollan and I have chatted about this a little bit in his, his podcast, but if you were to administer say to a rat and a box, cocaine or heroin and they, they have to choose between those drugs or food, they will consume these types of opiates or stimulants until they die. It did to the absence of food. Whereas with say Lsd, I would also assume psilocybin, they, they take one dose and that's the last time they touched that particular battle. And, uh, this is, uh, I don't want to take us too far field and focus on this exclusively, but, uh, I, I really appreciate you having spent so much time to thinking about how these natural companions who have coexisted end of an ingested by humans for thousands of years can be applied for some of these.

Speaker 4:          01:33:46       Uh, that's the epidemic scale problems that we're experiencing. And, uh, I wanted to, uh, ask, we are going to talk about some of the applications of mushrooms outside of human medicine, but I would love to read a description of you and then it, it relates to something we were chatting about a little bit before we started recording and talk about the decisions that made Paul Stamets Paul Stamets because there are so many of my colleges out there. Uh, I've certainly don't know the exact number, but you are, if not the best known and certainly one of the best known and the description is from mother Jones, says, uh, uh, Paul Stamets is a modern example of the amateur scientist from the 17th and 18th century who made a wonderful, who made wonderful contributions with only their native curiosity and keen sense of observation. And you can certainly comment on that if you don't feel like it's accurate. But what, what are the decisions you made, if any, come to mind or habits you've cultivated that have allowed you, helped you to arrive where you are? I mean, you, uh, has made many discoveries, youth, uh, you've excelled in multiple fields. Why is that? How did you become who you are in this current moment? And you can start anywhere. I'd want to be one of the people who asks you, how do you grow mushrooms at a cocktail party?

Speaker 5:          01:35:13       I have been exposed to a circle of kindness and I believe in Karma. I was a child who had a lot of problems and I want a big debt of gratitude to my professor, Dr. Michael Buble. He never humiliated me and not at the Evergreen State College. I make some dumb statements. He was entertained by them, but it entertaining by them in a humorous way that engaged me to explore, you know, um, you know, in dive more deeply into the subject matter. But I was never humiliated and as a circle of kindness. And I really believe in Karma because this isn't meant as, it has been a huge thing in my life is the fact that, um, I believe evolution is an extension of gratitude and Sharon, and there's not this necessarily this, this, um, neo Darwinian concept of competition and first to food wins. It's that collaboration of people who are allied together with common interests.

Speaker 5:          01:36:19       And we needed a shepherd, all of our ourselves from our weaknesses to become stronger. What very few, uh, lots of people know this, but very few different schools that people know. This. I got into the martial arts when I was 14. I have two black belts. I had schools for 30, 40 years. Um, I have long haired Hippie, the nice person and I kind of turn it into a different individual. I've been in thousands of fights. Um, I started to aspen, the category martial arts. I first got into Goto, she showed con Szeto, got my first buckle belt in taekwondo, and then begin on black on one Rango, which is by far one of the most sophisticated styles in the world, similar to have Quito and, and, uh, some of their styles, Cook School. But that I had one experience that I think is emblematic of this is that I was an early young black belt in taekwondo and big biker came in.

Speaker 5:          01:37:13       He was just seething with anger and wired on fed amines and, and, um, and he wants to fight a black belt, you know, just a biker dude and he's just pissed off at the world. And he came in and, and number that hadn't, instructor does not fight at a challenge like this. They have too much to lose. And you know, if they screw up, you know, I lose face in front of students. So, you know, many of them, my, my head instructor, Jean said it, Paul, I got another one. Okay. And, um, so there's Michael Kamen and, and then inside Lao lecture, fight one of my black belts and it's fine. So Paul come over here. And so I came over there and was really polite and, you know, I extend my hand, shook my hand, and he went to shake my hand. He just was all piss and vinegar and wanting to fight me.

Speaker 5:          01:37:53       And I said, well, we have a few rules. Take off shoes, you know, um, and, and then we got out on the mat and this guy just attacked me for Roche mostly. I mean, it was, no, no, sort of like a boxers, you know, they have a little bit of like, okay, let's do it. And you know, we have a little compassion for each other, you know, the little simpatico or another fellow warrior. Now this guy was like out to hurt me. That's how I block block, block, block block and him and this guy is just, you're just swinging and kicking in and he can't kick well number one, but he's just like overly aggressive and, and you know, after a while, you know, you can block 10 or 20 times, but you know, you started getting hurt, right? You know, these are these guys just emotionally trying to hurt me.

Speaker 5:          01:38:33       And so I looked over at the, my head instructor and he nodded his head and said, okay, Paul, time to take them out, you know, the three or four punches, you know, um, sucker punched him, did a jumping hook, kick, Bam, hit him in the temple, Bam that he went down on the ground, you know, semi-conscious. And then I'm hovering over and I put my hand onto his trachea. I put my middle finger into the inside of his eyeball and that way I could pop his eyeball and pulling his trache at the same time. Now people are really concerned about their vision and also in their face, you know, so the, when you block your finger into the eyeball and ready to take out the eyeball, people want to give up really fast. He was terrified. He had the look of like, Oh my God, I'm going to lose my eyeball and this guy's got it.

Speaker 5:          01:39:21       You know, he didn't, he was just waking up from being stung from this kick, you know? And I got him like that and I knew I had to, okay, this is it. No, I can take him out right now and this is the end of his life, you know, end up, you know, basically he's done. And then I go, I released, I said, you know, you actually did really well and I extended my hand in friendship. He's laying on the map, big burly biker guy started crying because I was nice to him. I took him down but I wasn't glorifying and my, when I was extending my hand in friendship changed his life. When I left the school, he was a brown belt. He became this big teddy bear. You shepherding. Yeah. All these little, I told him, listen, this girl here, she's got a yellow belt.

Speaker 5:          01:40:05       You've got a white belt, you bow to her. That's the way it works here. Just based on your experience and respect. Totally changed his life. So, so that's a story of my life is that you know the extension of, and I think siliciden mushrooms make people nicer people. I just really believe that there is this understanding that your life is not just your life, your life is in the context of nature and how are we going to do inspire and lead and promote the forces of good and generosity and mutualism and how are we going to get away from the people who want to tear it all down by my work with bees I think is is the, is the cost of lab of my life and we're definitely going to dig into that. I absolutely want to explore

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       it. I was just going to echo what you said about the power of kindness. A friend of mine, very good friend of mine was just telling me recently who perhaps not surprisingly has a lot of psychonautic experience. Uh, it's mileage with, uh, certain mushrooms that we've been discussing. And also for anyone who doesn't know what maps is, it's the multidisciplinary association of Psychedelic Studies. They're also, uh, focused, very heavily on phase three trials for MDA in the treatment of Ptsd. Uh, which is, is fascinating and I encourage people to take a look at that at, at maps.work. But what my friend said to me is not too long ago, several weeks ago, he went into a coffee shop, uh, and it was some Dunkin donuts or something like that in an airport. And this woman said, thank you at the end of the transaction. And he looked at her in the eyes and he said, no, thank you. And he was just kind of being a joker and he's a charming guy, but he meant it very sincerely and she just broke down crying. Similar experience. Like she had not had, didn't seem anyone express kindness to her and God knows how long, I mean weeks, months. Who knows? And it, it just was such a stark reminder, just like your story about the power of those little acts as tiny little micro decisions that we all make thousands of times a day.

Speaker 5:          01:42:10       And that's what, you know, I have a business, you know, but anybody who was ordered from our business, I own the business. So I run it and I had several years ago I got these little stickers that say you are beautiful. And every time someone orders from our business and their order are too, you are beautiful stickers. And I've had so many people right saying there was just a horrible day, a physician or just wrote recently he had said, oh my God, I cannot believe this little messaging I sent too because then they can pass one forward. So every order and every box there are two. You are beautiful stickers. And so many people have written saying that's what they needed to see that changed their entire day. That again, an extension of gratitude and affirmation. You know, and we are all on this planet together. We lifted live in this time and space.

Speaker 5:          01:43:04       Tim, you're going to die. I'm gonna die. Everybody listening to this podcast is going to die. But we ran, we enter into the fabric of nature from which we sprung. And I think that fabric an Hra is based on the extension of goodness. I just know it empirically and all the noise we have around politics and everything else is just so narrowly focused in the context of the greater being. I think that we're on the verge of where science and spirituality are converging and now we're understanding nature and the extent of the cosmos, the hundreds of billions of galaxies. I mean just, um, I always wanted to be an astro mycologist. I kind of am now in some sense, but I've always wanted to, I think we'll find fungal networks throughout nature, throughout the universe, on multiple planets. Multicellular organisms will form is networks. Networks will give rise to animals. And I think that the, we are a descendant of this network based paradigm that's represented not only and mycelium and a neurons, the computer internet. The Organization of the dark matter. This is a continuum and a keen continuation on different orders of magnitude of the way of being. We are all involved in this network of being and this is just one of our strands in that network that we're living today.

Speaker 4:          01:44:23       And I want to get to bees and I'm going to get to it by way of laying out some illustrations of these, these webs, these strands of interconnectedness. And this is from discover magazine from a few years back. And I'm just going to quote here, it'll take 30 to 60 seconds probably. And then I want to talk about bees specifically. Uh, it starts with this, and this is a very incomplete list of course, but stem is, is researching a wide variety of ways in which fungi could help solve human problems. Here's a partial list. One, environmental cleanup. Mushrooms could be used to break down petrochemicals or observe radiation from contaminated soil and water to wastewater filtration. A mushroom Mycelia could cleanse runoff from storm grims farms or log logging roads. They can be used to filter out the nitrates, endocrine disruptors and pharmaceutical residues that disrupt ecosystems and damaged human health.

Speaker 4:          01:45:17       Three pesticides, fungal bug killers or treat discuss could be used to target troublesome species while remaining nontoxic to other four medicines which we've we've discussed could provide new antibiotic, antiviral, and immune boosting compounds and even chemotherapies. Five forestry planting symbiotic mushroom species could speed reforestation and clearcut woodlands. Six agriculture adding, Ooh, this is the word that I can never pronounce. Adding Myc, o. R. R. A. H. E. A. L. How do, how do we say that? Microrisal microrisal thank you. Adding microrisal fungi to soil could improve crop yields without the need for toxic chemical fertilizers. Seven famine relief. Mushrooms can be grown rapidly in refugee camps in disaster zones using just woodchips or salt water soaked Straw. Eight biofuels growing mushrooms for biodiesel could require far less soil and other resources and commonly cultivated fueled crops. Nine which segues to what we were just chatting about. Space travel because of their usefulness and soil creation and the tolerance of many species for radiation.

Speaker 4:          01:46:17       Mushrooms could be grown by interstellar voyagers and use to terraform other worlds. So I'm going to pause here for one second just to let people, so in that and then second in both preparation for this conversation but also over the last two years reading various descriptions of what has been called the the Wood Wide Web I think is what they call it, the, you know, the mycelium and how they facilitate communication between trees and other organisms. It's really mind bending stuff. I mean it's, it's, it's the type of narrative and description and discovery that if described, I'm just making this up perhaps, but like 50 years ago would have been thought science fiction and uh, I would love for you to describe what you have done in the world of bees, but I just find this so not only staggeringly fascinating and much of it counter intuitive but important. Um, so that's my, that's my soapbox for the moment. But then in any case, would, would love you to take that wherever you'd like.

Speaker 5:          01:47:21       Okay. Well I would recommend that people read my book, mycelium running, how mushrooms can help save the world. It covers into these subjects a very, very deeply, um, and, and a book is using it now as an introductory mycology book had many universities. Um, I typically don't promote a product from stage. He, there's no lectures out there. You can find this, but I do want to draw people's attention to fungi.com [inaudible] dot com there's an amazing letter from a Syrian refugee. And I want people, we obscured his face because we don't want him to be targeted by Assad Assad's assassins. Uh, but he has brought in mushroom cultivation and in refugee camps using recyclable materials from the cardboard and all the paper. And he literally, you have to read the letter to it just brings tears to your eyes. He's over a thousand people now engaged in growing mushrooms, oyster mushrooms and refugee camps, and then, uh, from the Syrian crisis that are helping people feed themselves.

Speaker 5:          01:48:19       And, um, and um, think about all of those thousand people now understanding how to grow mushrooms, what the downstream effect will be with their children when they get out of this camps. They'll have skillsets that can really expand this. And in a huge way. Um, I believe that mycelium is the foundation of the food web. It is essential for food biosecurity. I mentioned that the mycelium creates the micro biomes. We've done next gen sequencing and we've been able to prove this. I have not published it, but people can see my talks on it showing that different mycelium Mycelial, mass control and uh, destined populations of bacteria are uniquely specific to the mycelium that had growing, uh, in, in, uh, wood chips are in Straw. And so they actually articulate the populations and bacteria a downstream from the mycelial networks. But this is going to segue. So we talked about the, the antiviral stuff and over the bio shield bio defense program and nine 11.

Speaker 5:          01:49:27       Well, and I had this entimopathogenic fungi patents and they're working against termites, carpenter ants and bedbugs and mice. And so a good friend of mine, Louie Schwartzberg, he actually has finished a movie called fantastic fungi is coming out in the next few months. We've been making it for over 10 years, um, with a linear Lynn Lear, Norman Lear, and isn't that group. And the, I just saw the final cut, um, a few days ago. It is quite good. I'm really happy we're where it's going, but it talks about the wood wide web and Susan's Tamara is a British Columbia mycologists and I'm a total fan of her work and in a big Kudos to her because she and I are two peas in a pod and she was doing her work parallel to my doing mine and, and we ended up, you know, really and the, and the, the same, uh, intellectual ecosystem so to speak.

Speaker 5:          01:50:20       Um, but so when Louie was doing a movie and he was looking at butterflies and then he got into bees and Connie claps and colony collapse is really a client. Claps disordered is a euphemism created by the media, but it does speak to a very serious issue. Um, and Oklahoma last year, 74% of the beehives died. I'll think of it. If you were having a cattle or sheep at your ranch and you lost 75%, or is your sheep are accountable. That is devastating. Let's also devastating to beekeepers. Um, 35% or more of our food is directly dependent upon bee pollination. 70% is indirect. Many people don't realize that most of our dairy products are dependent upon bee pollination because I'll fall flat and hey, it depended upon bees. All the almonds that you consume, every one almond that you consume was visited by a B on that flower.

Speaker 5:          01:51:18       And so the almond industry specifically needs honey bees in particular. And so, and then Louie came and he said, Paul, this is a huge problem with colony collapse and bees are dying. What can you do about it? Well, I had a series of events, um, and these events, when you string them together and led to me and to an epiphany and the, I am a controversial mycologist. I have been trained academically in Mycology as an undergraduate student. But I married a woman 11 years older than me who had three kids, a 12, 14, and 16. When I was 22, I couldn't afford to move my kids to other cities to go to graduate school. I got accepted into several graduate schools, but I couldn't afford to move. So I started this little mail order business impact 30,000 boxes before I had a single employee. Now I have over a hundred employees.

Speaker 5:          01:52:09       So it's a real testimonial to stamina and good luck and also the extension of generosity by some very kind people who came to my rescue a few times over my life. But in the course of looking at, uh, at the situation with bees, I started looking at it and there's, there's many cofactors now, health or disease in my mind is a series of coefficient variables. Factors which are strung together at the end of the equation means health or disease. So there's not a single cause for colony collapse is a perfect storm of unfortunately bad things are happening to the bees habitat loss one neonicotinoids we already know they'd been banned in Europe, ironically from a study that Berenson Genesis sponsored thinking that neo nics would not be toxic and they found out they were toxic and so they were abandoned. Europe last month. Mnemonics are still used in the United States and Canada.

Speaker 5:          01:53:05       Um, these, there's so many, 70% of the food has talked to me. Uh, absolutely critically dependent upon bee pollination services. You know, um, two arms length away from direct bee pollination contact. So bees are dying because of a confluence of variables. Last Hub, habitat, neo nics, pesticide exposure, factory farming. It's not natural for me. It's been put on trucks and traveled a thousand miles to the almond orchards of California. They all are concentrated. They spread diseases amongst themselves. Uh, and then they disperse. And so it's a, that's the great, great, uh, scenario for diseases be spread. But by far, the biggest one that's been identified in the scientific literature is the Varroa Mite. The Varroa mite was introduced in 1987. It came from Asia. Varroa destructor assessed this Latin by no do I know the binomial. It injects a whole slew of viruses into the bees. And these, uh, these now all bees in the world have these viruses working with the USDA, Dr Jay Evans and a, it was a USDA neurologist who's widely published in a senior scientists at the Usda ag has not seen a virus Freebie more than 10 years.

Speaker 5:          01:54:21       What's happened now is a virus that's being spread by the Varroa mite. The Varroa Mite was controlled by might aside that was used to control ticks on cattle called amtrust. Now Amma tries is not legal to use by beekeepers, but they use it. They were soaking their beehives with this. Emma is toxic, you know, tick might aside and they're drenching it twice per year to control the Mites and now they're up to eight times per year. Within 10 years, the Mites have developed a resistance. The mites are like having a pancake on your back. They attach themselves, are extremely hard to dislodge. And now 27 viruses have been identified being vectored by Mike. What's the big surprises? All the wild bees now have these viruses and 80% of the pollination services that we benefit from, from bees pollinating are actually coming from wild bees, not the honeybee, which is [inaudible], which is a huge colony.

Speaker 5:          01:55:23       So the wild bees are oftentimes called solitary bees are very small groups of a dozen B's or two dozen bees or ground dwellers. And those bees provide over 80% of the services that are benefiting a APP called culture. So the honeybees demand, we have about 2 million hives and the United States, the average loss right now is over 50% nationally. A few hot spots where there's hot spots then emanate out and epidemics become pandemics. And so now we have evolved into a viral pandemic, uh, of these viruses spreading throughout the world. And it was just discovered in the past two year, three years that these bees are infected with these viruses. When they visit a flower and they get the pollen on them, they also spread the viruses to the palm. They leave. And so when the wild bees come, they become infected. So this is a direct threat to worldwide food biosecurity.

Speaker 5:          01:56:19       The loss of bees is such an important issue in interestingly is the number one bridge issue between liberals and conservatives. So I like to delve even Ui, thanksgiving dinner. You don't want to talk about Hillary or Trump. Talk about the importance of bees is the number one issue that brings liberals and conservatives together because everyone recognizes the importance of bees. Uh, as it is for food biosecurity. So my friend Louis came to me and I started studying this subject and I had five experiences in row that led to me to an epiphany. And no matter what my critics say, and I, you know, I've been wrong, sometimes I'm not right all the time, so I accept that, but I pushed the envelope because I don't have to worry about tenure. I'm self employed. I can risk to be wrong. But the more I speculate, the more I test, the more I do research, you know, that's what it takes.

Speaker 5:          01:57:10       It takes the efforts to see if something will work. And so I failed a lot of times in the failures, the price of tuition. I paid to learn a new lesson. All that being said, this is what happened in 1984 I had the garden giant mushroom growing in my garden. It's a wood chip mushroom that grows in wood chips, prisons, mushrooms, up to five pounds per specimen. People can look it up. Um, and I had these, which shifts permeated with mycelium and I have two beehives and one day in July come out and I see the bees all over my wood chips and I looked really closely and they're moving the wood chips to aside, it's like you pushing a semi truck through side some of these, which was really big to expose the mycelium. I looked very carefully and from dawn to dusk for 40 days, there's a continuous convoy of bees to the my wood chips of the garden.

Speaker 5:          01:58:00       Giant mycelium in my garden traveling about 800 to a thousand feet as a, I went out there, I photographed up, thank God I found the photographs. There were Kodachrome 64 slides and sweltering heat. You know, two years ago I found him up in the attic. But I published this in Harrison's magazine, 1988 I published this in 1994 in growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms. One of my books. And I speculated, oh the bees are going after the sugar rich extra dates. Cause the mycelium is producing these polysaccharides that are sweet and they're fragrant. And maybe that's why the bees are going there. Okay, that's, that's one. I'm going to give you a Michael factorial equation. So that's the first Michael Factor. Factor number. Paul sees B's attractive, the wood chips in his garden, I forgot about it, Michael. Factor number two, Paul gets involved, the Bio Shield program discovers that Pauline for mushrooms have antiviral properties and many patents have issued.

Speaker 5:          01:58:58       Now I have more patents on this. People can look them up. Um, and so that was another experience that I had a number three and by getting rid of the carpenter ranch than my house Cz entimopathogenic fungus, we lighten that insects are vectors of disease. And then moving forward, I'm looking at the research articles and and plus it's an open source, you know, an online journal, Scientific Journal. There's an on the cover of the plus was a big article on the discovery that Sema colony collapse happens. Most people don't know this is that you got your beehives on Monday. Everything is fine. You go out there on Thursday and they're all gone, they're gone. It's not like there's a whole bunch of dead bees lang in front of the beehive. They're gone. They fly away. It turns out that the bees are the deformed wing virus, which is the number one virus of concern that's been identified by researchers.

Speaker 5:          02:00:00       Almost a dozen papers have been published in the past three years identifying the deal. You've worn deformed wing virus as the virus that is the most debilitating to the bees. It normally, we just did a tensile strength of their wings, but they're deformed. They can't fly it all. We see bees on flower, it's the last days of their life. These used to go out, they get pollen for nine days and now they're going out for four days, so they can't enough pollen back to the hive. So the new [inaudible], which are nurse bees are prematurely recruited to go out to get pollen because the colony is stressed and then the brood as Mites on them and the bees can't attend to the brute. They abandoned the babies and the mites then freely go around injecting these viruses into the bees. And so at some point it comes to a tipping point and then the bees leave the hive and they don't come back.

Speaker 5:          02:00:55       So imagine if you were again, a cattle rancher or a sheep rancher, he loses more than 50% of your estate is psychologically damaging. It's all economically damaging and people just give up. So I had these experiences and then I saw in this journal that when they looked at the honey and the abandoned Pete beehives, it lacked a certain chemical called peak tumeric acid peak. Americ acid is the chemical trigger that governs the detoxification pathway in bees. It's called the cytochrome p four 50 pathway. All animals use it. We have it mostly in our liver is how we break down toxins. Without peak Americ acid, they found these bees hundreds of pounds of honey, no bs in the beehive. It lacks essential nutrient peaking Americ acid. I'm not a chemist, but I'd seen peak America House and before, because in the research I've done, look at what's called the d lignification of wood, how fungi gobble up wood and break it down.

Speaker 5:          02:01:54       And I recognized he America acid as a chemical constituent that was present, uh, in breaking down wood. And that's why you see my ciliated would, is smells fragrant and no difference. There's a lot I outgassing of chef Michael Flavanoids, a phenol phenolic compounds that are going into, and that's why after a rain and the the woods, the wood steel, it smells so good. That's the outgassing of mycelium. All these sent trails are being created to entice us in insects and other animals to follow centrals and part of the outgassing of the mycelium. Okay, I had all those four experiences and then I go to sleep and I have a waking dream and then it's waking dream hit me like a lightening bolt. I said, oh my God, I woke up, I think. I said, I think I know how to save the bees. And so I first called a very good friend of mine, Lee Stein.

Speaker 5:          02:02:46       I said, listen, that's how this a waking dream. I just shook me to the core. He said, stop everything you're doing. Focus on this. This is too important. So call it the universe of California. Davis is never a good idea to start a conversation. But then there are scientists that you're not, not met with words. I had a dream that a conversation went nowhere. It's like crazy person. Goodbye. So I called the abortion state university. I was at Ted, I think I have to Ted that you spoke up. And I was at Ted and I went out and I was given Steve Sheppard's name from Washington University. He's a chair of entomology in Pullman, Washington, uh, Washington University's Agricultural Science College. And I said, listen Steve, please just give me a half an hour. It's going to sound crazy to you at first, but let me talk to you about this.

Speaker 5:          02:03:34       About 15 minutes. And he said, stop and go nowhere else. We want to work with them. So the end result of this is we tested this on 532 beehives in southern California two years ago. We've done seven tests now and outdoor beehives. We have found something. I think that it's extraordinary breakthrough with our mycelial extracts of these poly pore mushrooms, these, these Woodcox. They look like they're called him hooked shaped mushrooms that grow on trees. Everyone's seen them. Um, with the mycelium that's extracted and water and ethanol, the very same extracts that we use in the bowel. You about defense program, we gave it to the bees and we've submitted an article to a renowned scientific journal and from one dose at 1%, all beekeepers feed sugar water to their bees is 50% sugar fish without water. So one milliliter per hundred, you know, one unit per hundred, 1%, we give it to the bees in the seven to 12 days later.

Speaker 5:          02:04:37       Those viruses are reduced by thousands of times in the article that we submitted, reduced the Lake Sinai virus by more than 45,000 times the deformed wing virus by more than 800 times with one dose and a doubles the lifespan of bees. Uh, think of the implications of this. This means that I think I have a window now and understanding something fundamental to the foundation of nature. The mycelium not only controls a microbiomes and are deterministic and the downstream evolution of ecosystems, but they also control the immunological health of the animal inhabitants because the very same extracts that reduce viruses that harm birds, bird flu, h five n one h three h one n one in pigs that harm people, pox viruses, herpes viruses, birds, pigs, people bs. This speaks to something I think that is very deeply profound and understanding that within nature of these mice, a little neck and it works everywhere.

Speaker 5:          02:05:50       Every tree is infused with mycelium. Every vegetable you eat is infused with fungi. This is part of the mutualistic relationship that we have with these fungi. They increases the host defense of resistance against disease. There's a plurality of fungi and such diverse populations that create a matrix of defense. We have found that these individual species, now we've tested five different poly pore mushrooms. They're all active but to do different degrees. What we have not reported in the scientific article that we submitted as that we have one result, there's over a hundred million times reduction of these viruses with one treatment. Many of these viruses, herpes viruses are known as uncle viruses that cause cancer. Uh, lots of them caused inflammation that destabilizes the immune system. This is something I think is so critically important. Everyone's talking about bad news and we are in the six x the sixth grade extinction.

Speaker 5:          02:06:46       Knowing that life on this planet, we have 8.3 million species with leaves losing more than 30,000 a year. Do the math on a hundred years. That's more than a third of the biodiversity as unraveling all around us. What can we do? This is actionable ecological solutions as paradigm shifting, that scalable, ecologically rational, economically sustainable. I can all of these fungi grow on every forest of the world and we all grew up with Winnie the pooh and everybody missed this. Now, I've been issued now 10 patents, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Eurasia. When I first got the first patent award for five seconds, I was excited, literally, and then it became horribly demoralized. I said, you've got gotta be kidding. There's no prior art, no one they did the, the patent office is the most massive search engines and every language, Chinese, French, Japanese, English, German. And there's not a single mention anywhere out there that bees benefit from my silly, I mean logically let alone reducing the viruses that have been vectored by Mites.

Speaker 5:          02:07:57       The fact that I'm the one who discovered this is horribly depressing. It means that we are, we're truly neanderthals with nuclear weapons and people talk about climate change and biodiversity is a bunch of liberal scientists. Are you freaking kidding? This is so fundamental to who we are and where we've come from. So I've opened sourced at the all the developing countries, but you know, Europe and Eurasia, um, uh, not, not Asian, not South American, not Mexico, Not Africa. You know, in order for a solution to be effective, it's got to be practiced in order for it to be practice, it's got to be commercially successful in order. If we're going to be commercially successful, it's got to go to market with some protection to have your idea. But the fact out that these patents are issuing is an, and I'm, I'm, I made mistakes and there my colleague out there whose eyes roll, but I'm very happy to receive several rewards, one of which from the Michael [inaudible] Society of America for bringing more students in the field of psychology than anyone in history.

Speaker 5:          02:09:00       So there are kind of schizophrenia about me because I'm a psychedelic researcher and not trained and you are bringing all of these students into their classrooms. They want to save the world. And they said, Paul, you could have a huge problem. We want to study yeast and these students want to save the world. What did we do? So, um, but, so I think this is something that is actionable solutions. And I think I can make the argument, and this is very provocative, but I can make the argument that natural products can be more powerful in pharmaceuticals with a greater bio shield of defense, less toxicity and more utility in a sustainable way. And that I think is paradigm shifting.

Speaker 4:          02:09:43       I hope you're right. I hope you're right. And I look forward to learning more about this as the discussion opens. Is there anything for people listening who are not my cologists nor future mycologists who want to help in some fashion, meaning they want to make personal decisions, maybe think of policy changes or types of support, uh, that would enable them to be part of an environmental and a systemic solution rather than simply compounding the existing problems or their new behaviors, things they can do. Anything that you would suggest to people who are listening?

Speaker 5:          02:10:25       Absolutely. I would assemble. The thing that people can do is let wood rot give up this idea of there's a beat then in yard as highly and managed nature likes fractal faces, in fact, realization of nature at different orders of magnitude. And it gives all these new issues to microorganisms and microbiome biodiversity that's critical for sustainability. So rather than letting, calling the wood off, having a running a lot, but let raw logs rot in your, in your garden and your yard mushrooms will come up. That'll help feed the bees. They'll help build these fractally intense environments that are really important for biodiversity. That's one. Uh, we have a campaign for supporting Washington state, uh, university, uh, DVD at Wsu A. Dot. Be a BS. Dot. wsu.edu. We've raised over $3 million and now a four be researched, uh, at Wsu. We have just begun to explore the rule and he's probably per mushrooms.

Speaker 5:          02:11:30       Uh, there's hundreds of them to test. Uh, we've hit the home runs on our very first ones. We're extremely lucky, but the fact that, you know, this is, it speaks to them and we can reduce these viruses 45,000 to one with one treatment. I mean, what antiviral drug will do that, you know, um, that is a complex soup of constituents are, you know, the contrast is this a surprising, so supporting, uh, uh, B company B nonprofits joining a mushroom society. These, the North American mycological association was the apparent Organization for a called an Ama. And their website is [inaudible] dot org and a m Y C O. Dot. O g. They have a listing of all the local mycological societies, you know, and the Canada, United States and Mexico. Um, that's one, uh, joining your B and get involved in supporting frankly a farmers and developing biodiverse landscapes and the march to monoculture and the marsh to the industrialization of agriculture is sacrificing the very biodiverse networks that have evolved to help plants grow.

Speaker 5:          02:12:46       When you add lots of fertilizers and insecticides, you defeat the natural systems of the mycelium that has engaged and help plants for hundreds of millions of years. When you have my psyllium helping plants, you do not need external kind of can, puts as much as fertilizers, et cetera. And I think there are ecologically rational solutions to many of the problems that we face today, but it's really speaks to the concept of seven generations and first peoples really have this so much as a pillar of their understanding and dealing with nature. We shouldn't give up this idea of making money in the short term and we should embrace the idea of creating sustainability. And the longterm true conservatives should be conserving natural resources and thinking about downstream generations. Right now we have hungry, greedy people who has, whose morals have been hijacked. Um, for whatever reason. And I think that this, this nature loving movement with all of it's strange, you know, characterizations. Yeah. It really is based on something that's fundamentally good for the Commons.

Speaker 2:          02:13:59       Well, it makes me think of what you said at the very beginning of certainly in the earlier portions of this conversation, which is the war against nature is a war against your own biology. And ultimately what is best for what you're discussing is also best for us, which means it's best for me. It's best for you. It's best for each person listening to this. And certainly if you're thinking out multiple generations, these problems can be solved in a very pragmatic, holistic fashion. Or they can be compounded to the point where they become, uh, exponentially more difficult to unwind and to solve for. Uh, so,

Speaker 5:          02:14:39       and we just want to stay in the field of mycology. I have no, no other science that is underfunded, underappreciated, and yet has such an enormous elasticity of benefits. And if I was a Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos and know I met these people, it's just not part of my DNA to pitch. And I look at them going, I could do so much benefit for hundreds of millions of people, but I can't even begin to talk about this because I don't want to pitch. But thankfully my company is soaring. And, um, I'm great group a community of individuals who are, who believe in this, who see the results and, um, Michael Pollan's book and fantastic fungi and you know, you're, you're in support, et cetera. It's to help spread this message. But, you know, I'm 63 years of age and I want to die with a smile on my face because it's a heritage that we leave, not, not the material possessions that we own during this short lifetime. We all need to create legacies. There were our names, will we heralded in the future as a person who cared more about other people then they cared about themselves. That is truly a Christian, a Buddhists, uh, a zen like attitude. And I think that, um, it's time for people to take action. We need a revolution.

Speaker 2:          02:16:01       It is time. It's time for people to take action. Could not agree more. Uh, and you've given a number of recommendations that I will link to in the show notes as usual. So everyone listening, everything we've discussed, all the links to everything that US certainly that I can track down and that my team can track down. We'll be in the show notes at tim.blog/podcast for this episode. And Paul, you've been very generous with your time. People can find you@fungi.com fungi.net host defense.com and on social media on Instagram. You're Paul Stamets, Facebook, Paul Stamets, Youtube with Paul Stamets. Is there a a for people who want to know where to go for what? Is there one best place for certain things? A certain best place to say hello? If people want to reach out to you somehow,

Speaker 5:          02:16:49       oh, that's a complicated like, did you tell him, you know, we get so many people, why in the contact us? But for the, I'm, I want to feed some of the researchers out there and people who want to get into some of the detailed research articles. We have a website that we populate called mushroom risotto, mushroom, references.com, mushroom references.com. I several hundred peer reviewed articles, um, that we linked to the abstracts that talk about their most recent research of the, uh, from mycelium. Um, and as I'm and deep dive, many physicians are unfamiliar and because the public expects that there will be experts about everything on health, they're actually quite ignorant. And so I have found this has been a challenge is why I speak to a lot of, uh, academic and a lot of academic conferences that a lot of medical conferences is that there is a desperate need by these physicians to get on board and be familiarized with some of the latest research.

Speaker 5:          02:17:49       So, um, but otherwise, you know, fungi.com is a hub and we have a resource section, uh, at the end on that website that links to many other, uh, nonprofits, uh, lots of other resources, uh, including, uh, Cornell University. And I said particularly a good one. Um, there is, uh, Miko Web, which is extremely good. M, y. K. O. W. E. B. Michael Web's a really good one. And I'm, so there's a lot of my colleges out there that are genuinely really, really good people, but they have, I've in a sense have tasked them with expectations greater than some of which they can deliver. And I apologize for that, but time is short, is every, it's so important that everybody gets a aboard the starship and, and try to do. Good.

Speaker 2:          02:18:38       Well thank you so much for your time today. Paul. This has been really fun for me and I'm sure for for many, many people who are listening. Is there anything else that you would like to share or recommend before we wrap up at least to this, this first conversation on the podcast?

Speaker 1:          02:18:57       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:18:58       Um, if you see somebody being abused or somebody being shamed, stop up, extend a hand of generosity and show people a better way of acting

Speaker 2:          02:19:12       here, here. So that is an excellent way to wrap up. And, uh, once again, Paul, a real pleasure to spend this time with you. I have pages and pages and pages of notes, follow ups for myself and for my family and also many

Speaker 7:          02:19:28       different avenues that I want to explore. And to everyone listening to find the show notes at tim.blog/podcast and until next time, keep experimenting and express some kindness. It is time to take action. So get off of the ear phones, get off of the ear buds, get off of the pages in those books that you might consume, one after the other, and actually taping. Take a meaningful step forward, uh, with, with somehow bending the reality around you in a positive direction. And until next time, thanks for listening. Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a few more things before you take off. Number one, this is five bullet Friday. Do you want to get a short email from me? Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I found or that I've been pondering over the week.

Speaker 7:          02:20:25       That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered. It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've somehow dug up in the, uh, the world of the esoteric as I do. It could include a few articles that I've read and that I've shared with my close friends for instance. And it's very short. It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend. So if you want to receive that, check it out. Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled out and just drop in your email and you will get the very next one. And if you sign up, I hope you enjoy it.

If you want to hear my favorite collection of letters of all time as well as the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman, which is a fiction book I used to reintroduce nonfiction purists to the beauty and truth and enjoyment, affection graveyard book. It is incredible and I liked the version that Neil reads himself, but the entire ensemble cast is also fun.

This episode is brought to you by Peloton, which I've been using probably for about a year now. Peloton is a cutting edge indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into your home. You can also do on demand, which is what I do. We'll come back to that so you don't have to worry about fitting classes into a busy schedule or making it to a studio or gym with a hectic or unpredictable commute. I for instance, have a Peloton bike right in my master bedroom at home and it's one of the first things I do. Many mornings I wake up and meditate for a bit.

Speaker 7:          02:23:38       Then I knock out a short 20 minute ride in my undies. Hard to do that at the gym, take a shower and I'm in higher gear for the rest of the day. It's really convenient and has become something that I look forward to see. You have a lot of options for one if you'd like. You can ride live with thousands of other writers across the country on an interactive leaderboard to keep you motivated. There are also up to 14 new classes added every day with more than 8,000 classes on demand and you can pick based on length, 45 minutes, 20 minutes, whatever music, hip hop, rock and roll or say low impact versus high intensity or interval. You can pick the class structure and style that works for you and in my case I quite like Matt [inaudible] and I tend to do on demand and listened to a lot of and watch many of the same classes over and over, but I'm kind of promiscuous and also enjoy classes from a lot of the other instructors.

Speaker 7:          02:24:27       They have Peloton and amazing roster of incredible instructors in New York City with a whole range of styles and personalities so you can find what you're in the mood for. You also get real time metrics that you can use to track your performance over time and that will help, I would say, catalyze you to beat your personal best. Now that all sounds good, right? Gamification, Yada, Yada, Yada. I didn't think that it would work for me or in any way incentivize me, but they really 100% hit the nail on the head. I was very, very impressed with how motivating it was and it worked tremendously. T keep me pushing, uh, which quite honestly takes a fair amount. I can get quite lazy, particularly with anything that edges on endurance, which is kind of more than five reps of anything for me. So check it out.
