Speaker 2:          01:37          Good day. This is Tim Ferriss. I'm sitting in a park. It's a beautiful park in San Francisco. In the fall, weather is upon us. The leaves are turning color and the eucalyptus are still standing tall. The foliage has not yet fallen. It's a beautiful day. For those of you who have not listened to the Tim Ferriss show before. This is where I tried to use all of my contacts and research to dissect excellence, to figure out whether it's a billionaire investor, a chess prodigy and actor, or in this episode's case and actor and a comedian. How do they do what they do? What are the tools and tactics and tricks that you can use? So we dig very, very deep, but I'll start off with a bit of linguistic trivia and I will ask apologies, or rather not apologies, that'd be a weird way to phrase it. Forgiveness from the Turkish speakers.

Speaker 2:          02:28          I love the Turkish language. It's a fascinating language, fascinating culture, a real collision of European and Middle Eastern cultures. And I also have found the similarity between Turkish and Japanese. Very, very interesting. But I'll give you an idea of how I deconstruct languages just by memorizing phrases. You can pick out patterns. So for instance, if you say, good day as translated into English and Turkish. And I guess again, I've read, not, not set it a lot, but it's Egan, Eagan large. Okay, good evening is [inaudible] [inaudible] and then the, the way you would say child, I believe it's choke Cho Cho took or choke hook and then you have a choco color. Okay. So you noticed the lot at the end. So to churn child into children, you have the Lord at the end and it turns out that literally good day is good days or good evenings in Turkish.

Speaker 2:          03:29          And so you can start to piece it together without a dictionary, without a gram reference just by memorizing a handful, even like a hundred words or phrases. Anyway, I'm a nerd. There you have it. But we're gonna move on to Brian Kellen who's the guest for this episode. He is a prolific actor who has acted in more shows than I can count, certainly, but includes pretty much all the shows at the, at the top of the rankings, Frasier, uh, Nyp de Bleu entourage law and order, CSI sex and the city king of Queens. It goes on and on and on. He's also a worldclass comic who travels the globe performing standup comedy for sold out audiences all over the world. He's also one of the best read people I've ever met. So we're going to dig into all sorts of things. The craft of comedy, how he boost his boost is boosts his own creativity, which sounds like I could stand to gain from ideas for improving education, both self education and institutional education. Uh, many different, uh, book recommendations, influences of his. We really dig into a lot of details that I found fascinating. Brian's one of my favorite people to hang out with. So without further ado, here's Brian, Callan.

Speaker 2:          04:45          Ladies and gentlemen, this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to the Tim Ferriss show. But we also have 50% of this episode, which is the Brian Collins show. Brian, welcome to the show. Thank you sir. I am excited to have you on for many different reasons, not the least of which, as we were discussing before we started recording, uh, you are known as the best body and comedy, if I'm not mistaken.

Speaker 3:          05:09          That's right. And so just think about, you guys don't have any videos. Just think of a, if you were to take human skin and stretch it over a Cheetah, I think that's why that's not me. That's just what my critic,

Speaker 2:          05:20          the critics, that's what, that's, that's, that's the worst they can come up with.

Speaker 3:          05:24          Well, my admirer say, but that's just, that's just what the critic

Speaker 2:          05:29          and uh, you know, I'm trying to piece together, it's been a number of years now, but how did we first meet, what was the first

Speaker 3:          05:38          Neil Brennan who is the creator of the Chappelle show, knew I was in the fitness and all that and he sent me, I believe a Ted talk you had done about a guy named Tim Ferriss. He said, what do you think of this guy? And I, I watched it and I, and I was very taken with the way you were explaining things and, and how you use your body as a, as a human Guinea pig. And I, I think I texted him back. I said, well, I know one thing. I'm going to go out and get the book, the four hour body. And, uh, of course that sent me, basically, I started with the four hour body and then I got into the four hour work week. And then of course I listened to, uh, uh, and then I read the four hour shifts. Um, so I became sort of this, but what I really, some of the concepts.
