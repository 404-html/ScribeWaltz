I take fish oil or Krill oil, a whole handful of things. I mean, literally a handful of things. All right, 10,000 steps per day. My take on this, I don't think it's necessary. It depends on what you want to do. For some people that's very motivating, but I'm happy to just do kettlebell swings three times a week and watch my diet a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:59          And, uh, sorry, I'm seeing multiple questions at once and trying a monkey mind. Have you ever started monkey mind to find you had nothing?

I also would like to use recurve, but for my purposes right now, I need a compound, uh, isle au Haut it whole life insurance, not educated enough. I don't have any thoughts. Do you have any tattoos? No, I don't. Why or why not? Haven't found anything I want to permanently put in my body at this point. I'm not averse to it.

I took off the cone of shame and I have a bit of a kind of sort of soc impromptu macgyver thing that I've done in her foot, which is working just fine. Uh, can I do have log with Seth, which Seth are we talking about? Seth Rogen a favorite place in South America to visit. You know, Patagonia is very high on the list. I would say Columbia is great. Chili's great for skiing. Um, how'd I get into archery?

Speaker 1:          03:32          And uh, for those people who get all up in arms about hunting as I was for decades, read the four hour chef. Uh, and uh, that'll make more sense. All right. What's the deal with Poo air? It's a great black tea that helps with fat loss and alertness. So I use that in the mornings almost all the time.

Um, but I've not seen a persistence of effects, so seem to be massively effective and uh, the issues have returned shortly thereafter, so I'm not sure how to evaluate it. Uh, starting a podcast. Any advice? Yes.

Speaker 1:          05:38          Uh, look up how I built a number one podcast in my name and you'll find it, uh, probably like 10,000 words on exactly what I recommend. A UNC, Yay.
