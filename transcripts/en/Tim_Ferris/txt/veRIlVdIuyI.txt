People who are icons, legends, and ask them all the same questions. These are people in some cases I wanted to reach out to. My whole life ranges from many, many billionaires, cofounders of every company imaginable, elite athletes ranging from surfing to tennis to power lifting. Everything else, country stars, actors, directors, and you can spot the patterns. So some of my friends have said this is the easiest to read, most useful book that I've put together yet.
