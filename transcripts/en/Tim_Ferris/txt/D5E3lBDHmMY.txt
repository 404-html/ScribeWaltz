Speaker 2:          01:45          Hello Ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to a very special episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where each episode I attempt to deconstruct world class performers to find what makes them tick, the tools and tricks that you can use in your daily life ranging from professional athletes to chess prodigies to billionaire investors to in this episode. That's right, Arnold Swartz and Negar the man himself, the governor later the terminator, the man who killed the God Damn Predator people. This was an amazing experience for me. Of course there are many things that I associate with my upbringing, if you want to call it that in the 80s guns and roses, but of course there's commando, there's Predator. The list goes on and on. This man is a force of nature and I had the opportunity, the rare opportunity to visit him at his home in southern California at the kitchen table.

Speaker 2:          02:38          We dug into everything and I really wanted to dig into areas that had not been explored widely in any other interviews that I could find and that ranges from the art of psychological warfare. He is a master. How did he apply that? What phrases to use questions that he used to get inside the heads of his, we cover that. What was his most lucrative movie? I'll give you a hint. Twins. How the hell did that happen? Well, there's a lot that goes into the backstory of that. How did he make millions of dollars fresh off the boat before his acting career took off? A lot of people don't realize he was a millionaire before his acting career took off. How did that happen? We dig into it. How did Arnold use meditation for one year and just one year to completely reset his brain and prime the stage for massive success.

Speaker 2:          03:32          And of course mailing cow balls to politicians, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. This was an amazing episode. I want to let you get right into it. The show notes, links, all that good stuff will be found at four hour workweek all spelled out, four hour work, week.com click on podcast or you can just go to four hour workweek.com forward slash Arnold and without further ado, please enjoy a wild romp through the life of Arnold Schwartzenegger kind. Sir, I want it to start with a thank you for welcoming me to your house, number one. But number two, I felt awkward all morning because I don't know how I should address you and I wanted to ask you how I should address you.

Speaker 3:          04:18          Well, are you going to visit me in any way you want? You can call me governor, the governor Schnitzel. I'm old, but I think would be right.

Speaker 2:          04:30          Go with Arnold. It's, it's, I felt like my first year in Japan when I was 15, cause I didn't know how to address anybody. Uh, so I figured we could start with a favorite topic. Well, it's become a favorite topic is I've been thinking about this, which is big balls and cow balls and bull testicles. So you've mailed, uh, sculptures of bull testicles to people before. Is that right?

Speaker 3:          04:58          Well, there was one incident, uh, and uh, but the color, this was when I was governor and there was a, you know, one of the leaders, legislative leaders, John Steinberg, uh, and I, we both had the huge challenge. Uh, California was hit then and norm was, uh, you know, economic decline. There was a worldwide recession that was hitting us in 2008, and everyone kind of was caught by surprise of what effect that had, did. All of a sudden we had $20 billion less in revenues, therefore we had to make big cuts in education and in various different areas that really hit the vulnerable citizens, um, of Cody fornia. And so when we did the budget, I basically sent him up before we negotiated in know a set of balls and, uh, and uh, you know, kind of just be the note that say, I hope you have that when we negotiate the budget.
