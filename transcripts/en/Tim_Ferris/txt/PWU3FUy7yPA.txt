Speaker 2:          05:56          Hello boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job each and every episode to deconstruct world class performers of all different types, whether from chess, athletics, entertainment, military or otherwise, to tease out the habits, routines, favorite books and so on that you can test and apply in your own life. This episode is a little bit different by popular request. We have Rhonda Patrick Phd at found my fitness on the socials who is an American biochemist and scientist. Now, whether you want to extend life inexpensively by a stem cell insurance policy, you have read about that in tools of titans or guard against cancer. Rhonda has some very valuable insights and experiences as well as recommendations in this episode. She tackles many of your most popular requested topics. This includes many things I've talked about before that you guys have wanted more detail and specifics on best practices for fasting.

Speaker 2:          06:53          For instance, what blood tests are most important for analyzing overall health? The minimum effective dose for the benefits of Sauna and different types of heat exposure, heat versus cold exposure. We've talked about cold baths before, how can they be used and how should they be used effectively? The most effective smart drugs nootropics, thousands of you have asked me for this, the latest fat loss research and much, much more. A little background on Rhonda. She is known for her studies of the mechanistic link between Vitamin D and Serotonin production research that may have important implications for the understanding of autism and other disorders and she also has a very popular podcast found my fitness. Dr. Patrick also conducts clinical trials, has performed aging research at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and did graduate research at St Jude's Children's Research Hospital, which I've had some involvement with where she focused on cancer, mitochondrial metabolism and apoptosis. So I hope you enjoy this conversation, which is really a master class with Rhonda Patrick as much as I did. Thanks for listening.

Speaker 3:          08:02          Hi Guys. Rhonda, Patrick here. Happy to be here today to get things started. Let's take an opening question from Tim Ferriss. Tim Asks, what new areas, experiments, discoveries, or hypotheses are you most excited about these days? Thankfully because I put a certain percentage of my brain out here on the Internet, much of what I'm actively interested in these days or have an interested in is actually elucidated a little bit as necessary context for some of the questions I'm going to answer here shortly, but Tim's question does sort of give a nice opportunity for an overview. As a rule, the things that usually get me really revved up are ultimately optimizations that we can make to our lifestyles that might increase our functional health span, our wellbeing, and lastly, cognitive and physical performance. Usually through deeper understandings of biology, health span or healthy functional lifespan is especially of interest to me.

Speaker 3:          08:51          I sort of lead with that. To me, health span is living for as as we can while doing our best to prevent deterioration from the diseases of aging. Talking about increasing health span is one thing though often achieving it is a different thing altogether. The reason this is tricky is that the most reliable way to treat aging is to try to instead prevent it and natural extension of that fact means that the earlier we start the better shot we have of making a large cumulative effect over the course of our lives. Now the specifics of how to best mitigate the damaging effects of aging specifically is subject to a little bit of individual variation as a consequence of each of our little genetic idiosyncrasies, the combination of which are unique to each of us. This is an area that I'm especially interested in and that I plan to invest a little bit more into intellectually in the coming months, especially the interface between nutrition and genetics known as nutrogenomix.

Speaker 3:          09:40          But the good news is there are certain rule of thumb strategies that are able to have a positive effect on health and possibly even longevity. In some cases it might mean optimizing our diet around inclusion of specific nutrients. One of the most interesting and exciting of which to me right now is a compound known as Sulforaphane, spelled s, u, l, F, O, r, a, p, h, a, n, e, but also other related compounds that fall into the same class of compounds, broadly known as isothiocyanates, all of which including sulforaphane being derived from cruciferous vegetables. What's interesting about so for Fran is at this compound richly found in Broccoli sprouts at about 50 to a hundred times. What's found in mature Broccoli is that it activates a special genetic pathway in our cells known as NRF two and it does so more potently than any other known naturally occurring dietary compound.

Speaker 3:          10:30          This gene, a master regulator controls over 200 other genes affecting whether or not they're activated and doing work. These include genes that are affect our own antiinflammatory processes, antioxidant processes, and even the ability to inactivate potentially harmful compounds that we're exposed to on a daily basis from breathing in carcinogens like benzine from air pollution. In a sense, we're talking about an on switch from some of our most native stress responses. Our ability to cope with physiological stress down to the cellular level ultimately affects how rapidly we accumulate the damage, which we often refer to as aging. But, and here's the interesting thing. The reason NRF two a stress response pathway is activated by Sulforaphane is because the compound itself functions as what we know as a Xeno hormetic a compound that by virtue of being actually slightly stressful to cells elicits a biological stress response, it has a cumulative effect that is otherwise a net gain in resilience that creates a benefit to the organism as a whole.

Speaker 3:          11:29          This is actually somewhat unintuitive if you really think about that. We sort of have this very natural notion that because excess stress is bad, we should venture to avoid stress at all costs. It turns out though that in fact, perhaps as a consequence of having received stressful compounds in our diets for millions of years, things that evolved in plants such as insect Antifa dance that help ward off insects, we sometimes function better for having them. They can even induce neuro stress responses that boost neurotrophic factors that lead to the growth of new neurons and promote the survival of existing neurons which may function to help make compounds likeso for her pain, potentially a candidate as a mild nootropic. We'll probably come back to this in a little bit, but the bottom line is is that if we take this same concept that stress can be beneficial known as hormesis and apply it to other things like exercise, fasting, heat, stress, cold stress, some of the various benefits that may be had from these many strategies similarly come about as a consequence of sometimes overlapping stress response pathways.

Speaker 3:          12:28          This idea of hormesis and trying to improve our capacity to be resilient to environmental stress and even the stress generated as a byproduct of normal metabolism and immune function in particular is a very useful framework for evaluating the potential strategies that might have promise in preventing even aging. Okay. All of that said, this is a great opportunity to jump from these sort of big picture ideas back to things of a more practical application variety. Specifically. The next question evaluates a straightforward technique that has caught my interest and also happens to be broadly applicable to almost anyone. All right, so Brandon Beckett asks, Doctor Rhonda Patrick, you interviewed Doctor Valter, Longo, doctor Satchin, panda and Dr. Ruth Patterson on time restricted feeding and fasting. Can you summarize your best practices for time restricted eating and who it might not be a good fit for? Okay, this is a fun question, but before we dive right into best practices on time restricted eating, it probably helps to know what it is.

Speaker 3:          13:24          For the rest of you that may be listening. Time restricted eating as it's called an humans or time restricted feeding as it's referred to an animal research is this idea that by constraining our eating within a certain time window during the day, ranging from only eight hours up to 12 hours per day, usually earlier in the day, to align better with our circadian rhythm, we stand to benefit from a variety of different angles. On the more extreme end of eight hours, you're engaging in a slightly more extreme type of time restricted eating, which is more well known in the fitness world in particular as 16 eight intermittent fasting simply maintaining a slightly more conservative time window than you usually might has started to show advantages as well potentially functioning as a lifestyle intervention that may be able to protect people from obesity, metabolic related disease and more at the population level.

Speaker 3:          14:08          For example, even an 11 hour eating window has been associated in one study with a reduced risk of breast cancer and potentially recurrence by as much as 36% in women. We'll get back to what the research both mouse and human says about the duration of the time windows involved, but first, let's talk a little bit about the circadian aspect. When healthy adults eat meals that are identical in terms of both their macronutrient and calorie content at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the postprandial glucose increase is a lowest after breakfast and highest after dinner, even though the meals were a hundred percent identical. This is just one example that suggests metabolism changes throughout the day. We also know that in humans, metabolic genes are more active during the day and less active at night. The underlying reason for this is because humans are diurnal creatures, which means that we conduct most of our activities during the day including feeding, exercising, and working, and then resting at night.

Speaker 3:          15:01          What makes humans diurnal creatures is the presence of an internal clock in the brain referred to as the super charismatic nucleus or Scn for short. The part of this internal clock that interacts with the external cue of light. The SCN is also referred to as the master Oscillator, but light isn't the only external cue we have. We also have food influencing what are known as peripheral oscillators that occur in peripheral tissues such as the liver and influence metabolism, whereas light is the major cue for circadian rhythm. Timing of food intake regulates circadian rhythm in peripheral tissues as well. This facts sort of helps to explain why time restricted eating as it's defined by doctor Pan does work and that of others begins with the eating period with the very first bite or drink of anything non water because even compounds that exist in black coffee such as caffeine can be reasonably expected to produce metabolic effects that influence these peripheral oscillators including activity in the liver.

Speaker 3:          15:56          Everything from making neurotransmitters to insulin to glucose transport inside of cells to oxidizing fatty acids to repairing damage is on a 24 hour cycle clock that is influenced by these external cues involving metabolism. To sort of illustrate the importance of circadian rhythm, these clocks regulate thousands and thousands of genes, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of around 10 to 15% of the expressed human genome, which means that our most basic metabolic physiology is meant to be tuned to behave differently depending on the time of day that it is. Even the bacteria that we harbor in our guts have circadian rhythm with the species of bacteria changing according to the time of day. Some bacteria dominate during the morning and others during the evening. Unfortunately with the invention of artificial lighting and the varying work schedules, it has extended peoples eating times to occur much later in the evening, and this can have very negative consequences. Eating late at night may also reset peripheral clocks and result in misalignment of metabolism, which means when you wake up, your metabolism is already at the end of its cycle.

Speaker 3:          16:53          So that's the logic behind the circadian aspect, which gets left out of some of the intermittent fast and philosophies that are popular and explains why time restricted eating emphasizes an earlier eating window and includes [inaudible] xenobiotics as breaking the fast. Something I've learned as a specific point if it contention for people. Okay, but shifting away from the xenobiotics and circadian aspects to talk more about the time window itself. Animals that have been limited to a nine to 12 hour feeding window in which they can eat, but otherwise allowing them to eat the same amount of calories that they normally would. They have shown that they can attain some pretty amazing benefits including decreased fat mass, increased lean muscle mass, improved glucose tolerance, improved lipid profile, reduced inflammation, higher mitochondrial volume protection from mild age related fatty liver protection from obesity, generally favorable improvements in gene expression and increased production of ketone bodies, which is interesting for another reason we'll get back to in a minute time.

Speaker 3:          17:47          Restricted eating also has a growing body research in humans. Recent studies suggest that mentioned briefly earlier, eating within an 11 hour window was associated with a decreased breast cancer risk and reduction in recurrence by as much as 36% earlier meal timing associates with improved effectiveness of weight loss therapy in overweight and obese people for each three hour increase in nighttime, fasting duration was linked with a 20% lower odds of elevated glycated hemoglobin Hba one c which is a more longterm marker for Blood Glucose levels for each 10% increase in the proportion of calories consumed after 5:00 PM there was a 3% increase in the inflammatory biomarkers. C reactor protein, otherwise known as CRP eating one additional meal during the day instead of the evening was associated with an 8% decrease in c reactor protein. Eating within a 12 hour window improves sleep and increased weight loss in normal weight people. As a rule of thumb, anything that has the potential to mitigate chronic systemic inflammation is something I personally consider worth trying to dial in.

Speaker 3:          18:49          Since depression of inflammation is thought to be one of the most important predictors of successful longevity that increases importance with advancing age and also influences the risk of cancer and even potentially mental health. So putting aside the potential to have better blood glucose control or protect myself from obesity without actually changing the composition of my diet. Reducing systemic inflammation has a lot of appeal to me now that we're all on the same page in terms of what some of the research shows on the benefits of time restricted eating, I would like to go back and address Brandon's question about what my best practices are surrounded time restricted eating, how you choose to implement some of this information is ultimately going to be dictated by life circumstances that include practical realities surrounding work schedule and probably a million other things. The flexibility of my schedule, however, has made implementing time restricted eating admittedly a bit easier unless I have a social reason that forces me to eat later in the day.

Speaker 3:          19:41          I usually start my clocks as soon as I wake up. Thus I don't concern myself a whole lot about what counts as breaking the fast and what doesn't and I go by the strictest of definitions. If it's not water, it breaks the fast unless it's just brushing my teeth. I don't count that. If I wake up at 8:00 AM and have my first sip of coffee at eight 15 then I make a note to myself or I set an alarm on my phone to go off one and a half hours before the clock ends, which is usually around 6:15 PM since I aim for around a 10 hour eating window and a 14 hour nighttime fasting window when I'm feeling especially motivated, I eat within an eight or nine hour time window and fast. We're 15 or 16 hours during the night, which means if I have my first sip of coffee at 8:15 AM that I stopped eating by either four 15 or 5:15 PM I follow the same procedure on days I sleep in.

Speaker 3:          20:28          Even though animal research shows that this pattern has benefits, even if you cheat on the weekend. Now, the reason why I chose a 10 hour window is because it's a sufficiently tight window of time to likely confer some of the advantages of time restricted eating without being unduly burdensome. Personal compliance here being the issue stretching for the nine hour or even an eight hour window. However, it can be also be interesting and may appeal to some. Some animal research has shown that a certain aerobic endurance benefit for time restricted feeding in this nine hour range but not for shorter fasts, and if you think about it, mice that only feed for nine hour periods and are fasting for the other 15 hours. It makes sense. It takes around 10 to 12 hours for liver glycogen stores to be depleted, which is then followed by fatty acids being liberated from adipose tissue.

Speaker 3:          21:12          These fatty acids are then transported to the liver where they are converted into ketone bodies like Beta hydroxybutyrate, which are then transported to a wide variety of other tissues such as the muscle and used for energy. So it sort of makes sense that eating within a nine hour window and fasting for 15 hours overnight may lead to endurance enhancements. If we've managed to kick off a little more ketone production the evening before a run. Anecdotally I've observed that personally I feel an improvement in endurance ranging from slight to pretty significant in my morning runs when I've tried a little bit harder to eat strictly within an eight or nine hour time window. Just as a closing thought, I think there's still a lot of room for more emerging research in this area to teach us things that may be important. Questions like what influence later day endurance or weight training has on mitigating the deleterious effects of other suboptimal parameters like a later in the day eating window.

Speaker 3:          22:00          How large the effect of xenobiotics like caffeine and black coffee is compared to potentially more important factor like just keeping an otherwise tighter time window with a slightly looser definition of what is considered eating. If you'd like to see interesting questions answered about time restricted eating, you can actually participate in a mobile APP powered distributed clinical trial by heading over to doctor Satchin Panda's lab website, which can be found@mycircadianclock.org available for iPhone and android. Basically you commit to a baseline and then one of the patterns of time restricted eating and then proceed to submit timestamp pictures of your food over the course of 12 weeks. Of course, I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention that a mutual friend and someone that has repeatedly been on the Tim Ferriss show, Kevin Rose has developed a cool mobile app to help keep track of intermittent fasting in time restricted eating windows.

Speaker 3:          22:49          You can also check that out if you're an iPhone user, it's in the APP store under the name zero as in the number of calories you consume while fasting. To sort of finish off this question, as for who time restricted feeding may not be a good fit for, I'm not sure as an intervention, I believe it is actually broadly applicable. However, I'm 100% certain that there is someone somewhere for which a unique medical condition may make time restricted eating inappropriate, especially if you expand the definition of time restricted eating to me long multiday fast, which should the subject of Doctor Valter Longo, his research in particular. Definitely checking in with the physician, particularly if you're going to do a prolonged fast or if you're thinking of trying time restricted eating but may have a medical condition that for some reason might somehow make it unsafe. Okay.

Speaker 3:          23:32          Next question. Jassi seeing asks for all those that don't understand the benefits of fasting, how does doing a fast differ from say eating a diet low carb, high fat that puts you into Ketosis and what key metrics, for example, blood tests should someone look at to know it is benefiting you? Very interesting question because as implied by the question, there are at least a few similarities between a low carb, high fat diet and fasting, but there are also obviously some key differences. Probably the main similarity between the two is that metabolism shifts from using glucose as the major source of energy to primarily oxidation of fatty acids and ketone bodies as energy. When it comes to fasting, there are a few things that really differentiate it from a low carb high fat diet. One of the major benefits of fasting, particularly prolonged fasting, which is around four to five days in humans that is not found on a low carb high fat diet is a dramatic increase in autophagy and a pop ptosis followed by a massive boost in stem cell production.

Speaker 3:          24:31          I toffee g is a genetic program that is very important. It clears away damaged cells to use for energy while a pop ptosis is a genetic program that causes damaged cells to self destruct. Both of these processes prevent damaged cells from becoming cancer cells. When we clear away damaged cells, this also means those cells are less likely to become senescent, which is what can happen when too much damage accumulates. A senescent cell is technically a living cell, but it is not functioning in a way that is consistent with maintaining the overall health of an organ. In fact, quite the opposite. Senescent cells can accelerate the aging of nearby cells and promote tumor growth by secreting proinflammatory.
