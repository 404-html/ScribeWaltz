Speaker 3:          00:02:38       Hello midnight mad hatter's. This is Tim Ferriss. It's very late and I am sing songs in my intro to you in a sultry voice because there are people sleeping in my house and I don't want to wake them up, but I had to record this intro because I want to get this episode to a s a p. It is a really fun one. For those of you who are joining the Tim show for the first time, don't take my lack of seriousness for lack of content. We have a very important mission here on the program, which is to deconstruct world class performers, to interview people like billionaire investors, just prodigies, actors like Arnold Swartz and anger and so on and so forth and everything in between. We have athletes, we have memory champions, and there are commonalities across all of these different disciplines and my job is to tease out the beliefs, the routines, the rituals, the favorite books, all of the tidbits that you can apply in your own life.

Speaker 3:          00:03:39       And this episode is no exception. Had a blast with this. My guest was a friend and very impressive entrepreneur and investor, Brian Johnson. That's Bryan with a y. He is the founder of Ostp Fund, which I'll explain in a second and brain tree. He sold the ladder to Ebay in 2013 four 800 million in cash. Now that is more than enough to retire and kickback and a hammock and lather yourself with coconut butter for the rest of your life, but he is not one to rest on his laurels. He took the Elon Musk approach and took $100 million of his personal capital to launch the OSTP fund that was in 2004. And the entire fund is intended to support crazy inventors and scientists who aimed to benefit humanity by rewriting the operating systems of life. And in this interview, it will explain what that means, but it is going to stretch you to think very, very big, hopefully much bigger than you thought possible for yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:04:40       So if his investments to give you an idea, include endeavors to cure age related diseases and radically extend human lifespan to 100 plus human longevity inc. And we talk about this in this episode, making a biology, a predictable programming language. So how can you program Dna, uh, and biology to produce what you want? Like Ginkgo bioworks and synthetic genomics, uh, replicate the human visual cortex using artificial intelligence companies, vicarious mine, precious resources off of asteroids with companies, planetary resources, and many others. So Brian is not only a scrappy rags to riches story, but he is someone who, who succeeded and had a massive success story in a technical field without technical training and also just a very deep, soulful good guy. And all of those things combined make for a fun conversation. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. And without further ado, please meet Brian Johnson. Brian, welcome to the show. Hi Tim. Thanks for having me. And this is, this is our take two. We had a rough auditions start. We were sitting in a park

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       and we had this guy fooling around in the bushes who then asked us if we had a spare backpack. I thought that was an odd request. Yeah, I think we are missing something. He, I don't think I was the real request and we did not have a spare backpack. Uh, but we, we were put sufficiently on edge by this guy in meandering around us, like doing concentric circles, like a shark around somebody in a lifeboat. Then I decided it was better to do it inside. So we're at Casa Ferris and, uh, I want to look at this and kind of a medical context because I've been hoping to have you on the podcast for so long. And we were talking just before starting recording about what questions I might ask and giving you sort of an overview. And I had no idea that you'd done any prep, but I wanted you to tell me a little bit about it because you asked, how can we make this a home run?

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       And I said, well, I think we will want to focus on stories. And uh, I will also typically judge it by how many notes people take. And you're like, well, that's really interesting. You should say that. So maybe you could talk about, since we first discussed doing the podcast together, how you've been thinking about it. Yes, I guess I, I love efficiency. And so as I contemplate if I'm going to spend 60 minutes of my time listening to something, I want some value. And so specifically I want to have, you know, five, six, seven takeaways. And so I thought ahead of time, what could I do in the shortest amount of time that would create the most value in someone's life. And, uh, so I think I, this made me very excited because I wanted to have you on, first of all, but second of all, you'd thought about it very methodically, which shouldn't have surprised me at all.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       Uh, we've, we've taken a lot of hikes together and had a lot of long talks, very wide ranging, and I think we'll get into a good amount of it. Uh, let's start kind of at the beginning and, uh, we'll, we'll bounce around sort of memento style throughout your life I think. But what are some of your earliest, most formative memories from your childhood? So I, my family and I, we were really close. Um, I have four, three brothers and one sister and we were always up to no good. We live in a small town in Utah and we had nothing really to do but get into trouble. But we're also very close when we were best friends, um, it was through truth, through a high school, for example. Most that, you know, when people are in high school, they don't like their parents will shun them.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       They're embarrassed by them. But I would walk down the hallways with my arm around my mom and she'd give high fives to my friends cause she was there if, you know, being a substitute teacher, watching over her rambunctious boys. But um, we had a great time as a family and um, for fun we would watch the Dukes of hazard and the a team, uh, on Friday nights and we'd go get a special combo meal at Hardee's. We didn't really have much money, but we just, uh, I guess I have a lot of sweet memories from growing up to being close to the family. And what it sounds like your mom was one of the cool moms. What do you think, I correct me if I'm wrong, but I mean what, what characteristics of hers or habits of hers or otherwise enabled her to be the cool mom and not the shunned

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       mom? You know, what, what were the contributing factors? All right. So one time I wondered what if you filled a gallon, a milk gallon jug full of gasoline and you lit it on fire. I wondered what would happen. And so I went out into the street, and this is just in front of your house or, yeah, exactly. I took the gasoline that was otherwise used for the lawnmower and I filled out this carton and I went out on the street and I lit it on fire. And as expected, you know, it was producing quite a flame and then her green Taurus rolled around the corner down coming down the street coming home. And I thought, oh no. So in haste I kicked over the jug and now the gasoline spills on the street and into the gutter and now it's rolling down the gutter. Uh, and there's cars there.

Speaker 4:          00:09:36       So I'm having these images of like cars blowing up, right? So I walk them to the gutter and I stomp on the gasoline to put it out. And of course that splashes. Now the lawns on fires, like it's getting worse and worse. So anyways, we put the fire out and then the only thing she says to me, she says, Brian, you probably shouldn't do that again. And I said, all right. That's, that's fair. That's a very, that's typical. My mom, she was a supportive and kind. She kept us out of trouble the best she could, but she wasn't over the top. And we responded to that. Do you, so do you think it was a very Dalai Lama, like response to potential gasoline bomb? Uh, do you think, uh, you know, from the time that I lit the Dalai Lama's loan on fire, I can say, ah, I'm kidding.

Speaker 4:          00:10:17       That's not what I did. But the, the, uh, do you think then that that kind of moderation in discipline prevented the rebelliousness that you would otherwise see? Or do you think that it was, that she was closer to you guys in some way that then other parents were to their kids? We trusted her implicitly and I think when she let go and we owned ourselves and our own behavior, I think we behaved accordingly. And so I did feel responsible for my own behavior and it didn't, I was still just as mischievous, but I also knew there were boundaries and how mischievous I could be and it was out of respect for her and that she did give us a lot of freedom to do what we wanted to do. Did you ever get in, did you get in trouble at school or not so much so I successfully avoided really serious trouble my whole life, but, uh, just below the level that I think could have been a really dangerous, but we did all sorts of things.

Speaker 4:          00:11:10       And um, even now I guess as I look at my children as they grow up, the world has been sterilized dramatically in terms of what is and is not acceptable behavior. Um, in many ways I'm grateful for the things we were able to do because we able to explore and try new things out. But um, yeah, I stayed out of trouble mostly. Did you collect anything as good a baseball cards? Baseball cards. How long did you collect baseball cards for? Seven years. I remember going down to the store and buying the tops, you know, 25 cards for a dollar 25 and was it, was it mostly an obsession for you as a baseball fan? Was it a business? Was it a combination of that and more? I just loved having it and knowing that I had value, some rare card to show to friends when they came over.

Speaker 4:          00:11:56       But no, it was just simply a way to splurge. I didn't like spending money very much, but that was the only thing I've really spent money on. Uh, were you a popular kid in grade school? High School? No. So, well, so in eighth grade I remember I had these good friends in my neighborhood. We were best buddies and I was annoyed because in school there were these cliques forming of Jackson's donors and nerds like these typical things, how people organize themselves. And they had these ingroup characteristics where they would conform with each other's behaviors and say similar things. And I was bothered because I wanted to be friends with everyone. And so I did this like scrappy big data analysis where I went out and I evaluated all the different groups and the power structures within each groups because there's always people within the group to allow new members to join the group.

Speaker 4:          00:12:44       Sort of the alpha. Exactly. Border Guard. Yes. And so I would befriend these people and I would say like, I'm, I come in peace and I just want to be friends. I have no agenda here. And I became friends. I think honestly with everyone in the whole school. I just loved having friends and I love to dance in between the different groups because they saw the world so differently, right. There wasn't just like this, this mono, um, understanding the world. And so, um, I really enjoyed maintaining friendships and that was my first experience in and learning like social dynamics because it wasn't natural for me. I wasn't good looking, I didn't have expensive clothes. My parents, we actually, we had very little money. I wasn't funny, I wasn't witty. I wasn't necessarily super smart. So I didn't have the natural things that gets you entrance into that kind of club.

Speaker 4:          00:13:29       And did, did your analysis, when you're looking at say the power structure, when you went and interacted with the, whoever it was, the rockers, the stoners, the skaters, yeah, in the blank, did you take on sort of the characteristics of that group or did you have a, uh, did you have a base sort of personality instead of behaviors that went, that traveled across the groups? I just took an interest in them. I want it to understand how they look to the world, what they experienced, what they liked, what they disliked. I just was, um, sincere and I've, I've always been curious. And so I know I didn't try to become like them. I just wanted to be friends and understand them. Did you think of yourself or, let me rephrase that. When, when did you first start thinking of yourself as an entrepreneur?

Speaker 4:          00:14:17       Um, I think when I, when I kit light, well I guess I lived in Ecuador for two years and I came home to the, to the states. And, uh, I guess this is probably not the answer you're looking for, but I, after living in Ecuador and seeing these people shackled and extreme poverty and seeing that they really didn't have a shot at life, I came home with this burning desire that I wanted to spend my life improving, improving people's lives. And so I assessed what I could do is I looked at all the things you find in college, like model Un and helping do our projects in Africa or wherever else. But nothing really spoke to me. And so I thought, you know what? I'll just become an entrepreneur. I'll build a successful business. I'll retire by 30 with the abundance of resources and I'll have a freedom of time.

Speaker 4:          00:15:03       And then I'll figure out a way to improve people's lives. And so I think it really, at the age of 21 was the first time I set my sights really on that I can become an entrepreneur and build something of value. What gave you that confidence? So I assessed my skills, what I was really good at and I couldn't really find much. This is when you were at 21 or was it before that? Okay. Well, because I wasn't good at necessarily great at school or science or biology, I didn't really have any skills in of note. And so I figured, you know, I, what I do have is I'm persistent, I'm determined and I'm smart enough that I can figure stuff out on the fly. And so entrepreneurship seems like a good path for me. And then what was, so you, so you've decided on the, on the, on the report card, the skill assessment, the self audit of life, you're like, okay, persistence check.

Speaker 4:          00:15:50       Yeah. Good on tap dancing with uh, with uncertainty. Yeah. Check box number two. Uh, where did you go from there? So I, I was trying to find a, a cell phone and I was really frugal. I've always been very frugal and I found this guy in the yellow pages. I met him at the mall and I bought a cell phone, those super cheap and he said, hey, you look like you're smart and energetic. Why don't you come sell phones for me? I'll pay you 40 bucks per activation. And I thought, perfect. Like I'd never, I never understood this whole idea that I would trade 60 minutes of my time for $8 and 25 cents an hour. I seemed crazy to me. And so he'd said that to me. I thought, okay, I'll make 80 bucks an hour. I can do two per hour. And I said, deal.

Speaker 4:          00:16:30       So I sold phones for him for two days and then I was on the porch of this lady's house and she had screamed two screaming kids. And I had this thought, I thought, wait a second, if I'm selling phones for him, why can't other cell phones for me? And I left the sale. I ran home and I spent almost two solid days figuring out how to become a wholesale provider of cell phone service. And I figured it out and I started a company and now I, I changed the commission structure. So now he's making $300 per activation. And there was a first company I started and I hired college students to sell phones for me and I paid my way through college doing that. And when you were first selling to people, like this woman with the kid screaming on the porch, was that like I door knock type of sales approach or how are you no kidding, the knock, knock and wipe the feet on the doormat like I what was, what was the opening, what was the opening line when somebody opened the door?

Speaker 4:          00:17:21       While I was ab testing the different approaches, I could walk throughout campus and ask students, I could walk door to door. So this was my second day and this was the data test going up and down the street. So yeah, it was do you have a cell phone service? And if you don't then I've got a plan for you. Yeah, so one of the, uh, one of my very close friends, um, uh, fantastic systems engineer I started working with when I graduated from college and went to mass data storage startup mass. At that point it was like five terabytes, 10 terabytes. Big Deal, right? Big storage area, network installation at the time. Uh, he was so effective as a systems engineer because he had to do integration, but he started off as a door to door encyclopedia salesperson. That was his first entrepreneurial gig. So he had to get really, really good at overcoming objections and interacting with people socially, even though he is his sort of bedrock skill set was technical.

Speaker 4:          00:18:18       Uh, now did you, so let's see, you have the cell phones. That was your first business. Uh, what happened between there, and this is obviously a very large, uh, we're maybe not so large, but it's a lot happen, I'm sure between that and Braintree. But what was the sort of montage version of that? Well, the short version is the cell phone company went remarkably well, but it was not going to make me enough money to retire by 30. Right. So I had to find something bigger. So I started a voice over Ip company with three founders and it was just before Skype and Vonage. And the short of that is we had the wrong team. Wrong product, wrong timing. We did, we didn't, sounds perfect. We did everything wrong now. But we did have a problem. We actually built something. We got customers and this was also in Utah?

Speaker 4:          00:19:00       Yes. Yeah. And we had revenue side. We actually built something, but in reality that we were not set up to succeed. So that felt, and then on the heels of that I started, I joined another guy to do real estate development. And the short of that is we that failed because of some bad decisions we made. And so without income for two years I was dead broke. And so I applied for 60 jobs and found a monster and the other job sites at the time, nobody would hire me. Like it was just, I think it was so clear that I was, I had no intention of staying a long time. I tried to make the resume look like it, but just never was the case. So now nobody would even give him an interview and then write additional skills, loyalty, fierce loyalty to your employer.

Speaker 4:          00:19:40       Um, and then I read, I saw the newspaper one day, I had a list of the 50 richest people in Utah and I thought, Bingo, that's what it is. I will write an email to these 50 people. I'll say I'm young, I'm smart. I, I'm trying to become an entrepreneur by just need some money on the side so I'll be coming right hand, man, I'll do whatever you want me to do. And no one responded. It's at this point I'm like totally desperate. I'm sure you, I'm sure you get a fair amount of those emails these days. I do. And I'm empathetic to it. Yeah, I totally am. Um, so at this point I have no income. I have a child at home and so I need to make ends meet. And so I find this job posting in again, I think it's monster. It was selling credit card processing door to door and basically it was like if you go business to business, yes. Yeah. Like marching up and down the street, walking into a retailer or restaurant. Let me help you set up a merchant account. Yes. Or get a point of sale system. Yes. Or mostly change. Everyone already had existing service. Got It. Got It. And so I, the requirement was like if you could fog a mirror, you can work for these guys. It's a hundred percent commission. Like what? They don't care if you don't succeed. Right. But

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       to your point on the sell side, um, I would go to inside of business, I figured out pretty quickly the industry was really messed up. Like a technology was terrible and um, people were just generally plagued by the industry because it's just unscrupulous all this dishonesty and complexity. As I figured out, that was the hook because my product had zero differentiation. It was exactly the same as 500 other providers that walked in the door, you know, every day. Right. And so I'd walk in, I'd say, all right, Tim, you saw me walk into, you'd be like, all right, sales guy. All right. And not interested. I've got stuff to do. Then when you heard me say credit card processing, it's like, please leave strike too. Yeah, like leave. So I would say, Tim, if you give me three minutes of your time, I will give you $100 if you don't say yes to using my service.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       And usually they'd say like, okay, that's interesting. Like what does this guy have to offer? And I would open my pitch book and I'd walked him through the industry here, the providers, here's what to do, here's what they do it, here's what I do. I'm the same as everyone else except with me. You get, you know, honesty and transparency and great customer support. And so I became this company's number one salesperson. I broke all their sales records falling this really simple formula of just selling honesty and transparency and a broken industry. That's super interesting. And uh, so a couple of questions. I just want to rewind for a second. With the real estate company, what were, if you're comfortable talking about them, like what were the bad decision? What were the worst decisions? What were the, the fatal mistakes? So I'm really proud of actually of what we did.

Speaker 1:          00:22:12       We launched a $50 million mixed juice project in one of the best places in Utah. Makes to use means residential plus commercial. Exactly. Yup. Bottom floor of the small shops and Fannie Mae came in. They were our equity investor. We really put together a great project. The single biggest flaw was storage space. So empty nesters showed up to buy and there wasn't sufficient storage and storage for just all of their extra stuff that they want it to take out of the big house and move into exactly this community living space. So then sells stalled and phase one, the bank got anxious, so got it. So just didn't account for that. Yeah, that need, that was the big blunder, uh, with the sales. So I'm fascinated by sales because there's the, the good, the bad and the ugly. And you often see it within one industry. Right. And, uh, so this brings back a lot of memories for me because I was the, the lowest paid as base salesperson at the startup that I worked for out of college.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       And they're like, hmm, you're really persistent. You're in sales, you're really persistent, you have no technical background, you're in sales. Congratulations. And I was like, ah, okay. Here we go. So smiling, smiling and dialing. Yup. And one of the things I did was very similar to what you did with, uh, taking the potential objection. And putting it right up front, which was like I'm the same as every other guy. Yes. Product, different label. Same thing except for this press, which was the relationship piece. And I took a very approach when I was cold calling, which I did between like I want to say like seven and eight and six and seven. So I avoided the Times that the gatekeeper would be manning the phones. Yes. And only called when I thought I could get the higher ups who had worked longer hours. But I would, um, I would, I would do my homework so I could guess what they were currently using, like Solaris boxes or whatever that's right on the industry.

Speaker 1:          00:24:07       And then I would say, well not sure that if this is the right fit at all, um, if you're using this type of system, the step system or this ties up system, it is not at all. Um, and I would take all of the potential weaknesses and just put them right up front. Uh, what you, you at that point had already had experience hiring salespeople. How did you, what did you look for in salespeople? Or how did you, how did you hire the people who have the highest likelihood of success or train them, their ability to connect with other people and earn their trust? And what are the correlating, uh, behaviors or qualities that allow them to do that? That they had to be genuine and it, it couldn't be that they were manipulating them and to believe in them. It had to be truthful, right?

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       That if I trusted you that you were saying something that I could believe you and that would be true tomorrow as well. So I think that sincerity and being genuine go a long ways. And I think even, you know, it spans differences of personalities and experiences in life. But if someone feels like someone who's really trustworthy, and how do you read that when you meet someone? If I trust them. Okay. I'm just gonna I'm gonna, I'm gonna dig a little bit more. All right. So what, is that a visceral spider sense or is it a, that guy's not looking me in the eye. What is the, is it a gestalt of all those things? What is, what is it that leads you to feel that you can trust or not trust someone? Yeah, I don't know. I guess, um, yeah, I've always had an interest in people and makes them curious and I've always enjoyed friendships and I don't know if I could even articulate this.

Speaker 1:          00:25:41       It's just this subconscious process that happens that I read whatever the hundreds of data points that you read when you meet someone and you intuitively feel like, yeah, I, I could trust this person. And the more you gather the, of course, the higher confidence level it becomes, of course, like I make mistakes. I can what else? But, um, I think it's a fairly accurate, I think most people can read that. How this works. This is a bit of a lateral step, but I just saw, and I want to say it's called x Makina. Yeah. Which made me think of, I guess it's Deus Ex Machina, which is the, the machine or God from the machine, which is when it's a theater expression. I'm all over the place because I've had enough caffeine and coconut oil. But it's, it's when there was a plot, a plot problem that needed to be solved and the writer couldn't find any other solution besides having like God descend from the rafters on a wire and be like, be gone problems.

Speaker 1:          00:26:36       Therefore act three, it comes to a close good night everyone, but uh, x Mokena I think that's, there's a lot of debate about how Latin has pronounced but no idea. And then in case, how long do you think it is? And we're in 2015 and last I checked before it computer can read all of those micro expressions and so on and come to the same type of trust or not trust conclusion. If you were a betting man and this was the price is right. Yeah, with technology, I don't think I'm qualified to answer. I will say that the other day I watched a video online where robots, we're walking along and then people were kicking the robots are tripping them or doing something to put up an obstacle. And I had this emotional reaction watching this happen even though I knew they were robots. But watching humans be cruel to robots.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       Like if this visceral reaction inside of me. And so as you've talked about, you know, Xbox net and the progression of robotics to read our emotions and for us to interact with them, the emotions real, right? Like the, our ability to connect with robots. As significant as I watch my kids interact with Siri and even other low tech, um, you know, computer, the interfaces, I think that we will generally be surprised at how seamlessly the technology's role throughout society and how we just interact as we normally what it will appeal to our emotions and all these things we read. Do you think we will have those are touring test level interactions with machines within the next five years?

Speaker 1:          00:28:16       I find that Betty, Matt, I'll, I'll go longer. I'll say I'll say a decade. At least decade at least. Interesting. All right. Uh, did the credit card processing business or that experience you became the number one salesperson? Yeah. Uh, where did obviously very interrelated, not exactly the same, but how did that, how did you go from there to bring tree? I did it for a year. And it was amazing because it was this terribly broken world over the technology you just was years behind and no one trusted at a different providers. It was fragmented with hundreds of providers. And after doing it, I thought this is a perfect industry to start a company. And so I started Braintree to disrupt it. So just so ripe for it, for the right technology and the right disposition as a company to to be honest and transparent and treat customers. So they were thrilled. And did you have any technical background? I didn't know it did not, no. So no computer science? No. No. Mechanical engineering. Electrical engineering. What was the, and you had one kid at home at that point to two kids at home. So what was the, do you remember the moment or the conversation or the walk in which you decided, yes, I'm going to forego this sales job where presumably you're making pretty good income and start this company?

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       Yeah, so we, what I did to start Braintree is I had these customers in Utah. I was in Chicago at the Times where I built Braintree Chicago and I went back to my 10 best customers in Utah, best meaning like most loyal and also making me the most amount of money. And I said, hey, I just started this company, Braintree. I would love it if you switched over your processing to eat. And it was restaurants, retailers, so it was just terminals. I could use backend processors for it and I think I had like nine of the 10 say yes, if I remember right. And they collected, we've made me $6,200 a month and it was enough for me to get going to hire some part time help and start the company. And the biggest transition we had, his open table showed up and they said, hey, we have 11,000 restaurants around the world that we just, where was open table based California?

Speaker 4:          00:30:27       It was, yeah. And they somehow found you. So the cofounder of the founder of open table, Chuck Templeton was an advisor and he knew of the problem they had internally with, they had this huge global network of restaurants and they stored credit card data when people made reservations and they had the compliance issue. And so they came to us and they said like, we have this big problem and we said we can fix it. And of course, like I had no idea if I could fix it, but we did a deal with them and that's when we became a software company. But it was, it was a bet the company decision. So in the beginning then Braintree was like your previous company that you worked for as a salesperson. It was kind of a commodity. That's right. Business, but you had the relationships. That's right. So, so at a couple of related questions, how on Earth as, um, I assume, but correct me if I'm wrong, kind of an unknown quantity at that point.

Speaker 4:          00:31:17       Did you get Templeton as an advisor? We met at a local meetup in Chicago and we, what kind of meat? It was actually Matt Maloney and Mike Evans from grubhub. They just went public and, um, Korangal who was at local entrepreneur, but there's like five or six of us and people were just getting together to have breakfast. And he and I hit it off and he was clearly a great guy. I mean, he had the right disposition, the insights. He was advising people around the table. He was an advisor for Matt and Mike at Grub hub and he came on and he was my only advisor, uh, for the whole duration of when I was building Braintree. No kidding. And, um, how did you get so connected with the, these tech guys when you were not, at least from the first glance as an outsider looking in, not in the tech space per se?

Speaker 4:          00:32:10       Yeah. Or were you, I don't know. No, I wasn't, I wasn't connected to software engineers that at all, actually. And so I had one friend who I trusted as a good developer, people he a high, you know, he has a good reputation. And I would make, I would post jobs online and then, uh, he would help me interview these people as they came in. And as I listened to the questions he asked and how he discerned what, what made a good engineer. I learned over time how to decipher. And it took me a couple hires to get down and then I found a couple of really good core engineers and I know how to benchmark to know what exactly to hire Bolton personality but also coding skills and we can then build up from there. And so that's how you developed the, that's how you sort of got your foot in the door with the tech world.

Speaker 4:          00:32:52       Yeah, that's right. And then the, then, so when I started Braintree, I, I have three main goals. One is that I wanted us to be the best payments butter in the world for developers too. That I wanted our employees to say he was the best company that ever worked for. And three that our customers would write us love letters. And so on the employee side, I wanted people to literally go home and rave about work. To be so excited about the stuff they were working on and what they did and how they did it in their peers. And so having high quality engineer's was really important because no one likes to work with someone who is incompetent or causing a problem. So it was extremely important. We got like exceptional people to work and do any of those, those questions come to mind? Kind of high level vetting questions for good engineers on the technical side.

Speaker 4:          00:33:36       Sure. There's a lot on the personality side that, so we would, what I would try to communicate when we hired someone was at we payments was not necessarily changing the world. It wasn't like we're going to provide clean water for everyone in the world or whatever else. The stadium objective that we were going to build an exceptional company, like a company with a soul that we really cared about. And so I wanted people who really cared about what they did, the quality of the product, the quality interactions, working with other engineers. So we're in it for the longterm. It's, I try to flush it out and interviews of we're here to do something epic and special. So if that appeals to you, great. If not, then how do you, now maybe this comes back to the uh, the spider sense, but how do you vet people who are bs singing and acting in an interview to get a job versus people who are the true believers for?

Speaker 4:          00:34:26       Well, so I guess for non engineers, I would write this, these posts on craigslist to recruit people and at the very top of the page, so the assumption was first the person reading your job ad is not the person you want to hire. That was the assumption. Yes. Okay. That the person reading the ad knew the person you wanted to hire. Ah, so the very first statement was, uh, I will pay you $5,000 if you refer the most capable person, you know, and then it's, then below it it would say, please do not apply if, and we've list out characteristics of people who just weren't compatible fire environment. So we wanted to be clearly distinctive. And who we were. And then we had a section that said please do apply f. And so the goal was, but the do not apply was first it was first.

Speaker 4:          00:35:06       Yeah. Which had this great psychological effect. And then the police do uh, apply if we want people to jump out of their seats and say, this is the environment I've been dying to be in. Because the most exceptional people love to work with exceptional people and they have a hard time dealing with people who are not that exceptional. And so if you build critical mass around everyone around you, it's just really good. Then it feeds upon itself. And so we wanted to put that signal out to say, if you feel like this and your current job, like you're the best guy in the whole company, Best Gallon, the whole company and everyone else around you is kind of driving you nuts. Like you can come over here and feel really good about, about, you know, what you do every day and who you're working with. How did you choose the name?

Speaker 4:          00:35:47       Braintree. I, so it's funny being the small company, I went through this thought process of like, Hey, I'm small and I'm insecure so I'm going to come up with like national federation of Merchant Services or using big words that connotates strength and stability and nothing felt right. And I had just read the biography of John Adams who was born in Braintree, Massachusetts, and I really admired John for his contributions to the world. And so I wanted to come up with a name that was meaningful to me personally. And it was Braintree. No kidding. I didn't realize that. Braintree Massachusetts. Yeah. Wow. I had no idea. Uh, so you, so you have this advisor, open table opens a lot of doors or changes the direction of the company, it sounds like. That's right. Did it make you nervous that you were betting the future of the company on one person effectively?

Speaker 4:          00:36:44       Who is, I suppose making promises or pointing to the future and saying, this is what we can do together? Well, so it was a big decision because I think I was 28 at the time and I grew up poor. We knew we'd have any money. And as an entrepreneur, of course I had never had any money. And so I've been broke my entire life at this point. We're making really good money. We were making I think something like, I dunno if 200,000 of net income a year. So it was the first time I actually made money my entire life and deciding to become a software shop meant we've pointed back all the cash back into the business because I was bootstrapping. I hadn't taken any outside capital and so it was a huge decision on what to do. But, um, it was also, I knew that I intuitively knew the industry is broken.

Speaker 4:          00:37:24       I intuitively knew that if we got the right people there, we could build good software. And so to me it was a, a Moscow. Are there any, um, so you mentioned John Adams. Are there any, uh, books, biographies or otherwise that gave you confidence and I kind of quit spa to go for it in those early formative years? Yeah. I, personal hero of mine is Ernest Shackleton. Oh yeah. I'll let you, I'll let you reintroduce people. Yeah, we probably share a mutual love. Yeah. So 1914, he went on to the Trans imperial and Arctic expedition where he tried to cross coast to coast, the South Pole and Antarctica and the, what I like about Shackleton and there's a whole bunch of things like my shackle, the basically to this question is when he imagined what he wanted to do in the world, he chose the most audacious thing imaginable. At the time it was, it was nearly inconceivable that somebody could do that.

Speaker 4:          00:38:28       And he chose to do it and he prepped and he did it and they failed in their, in their debit. Right? But he's not remembered as a failure. He's remembered as, as the grit and, uh, how they actually overcame all the obstacles that came about during the expedition. He's hugely inspirational in my life because I, I apply what I call the Shackleton Sniff test to everything I do in life that I contemplate if I'm going about on this endeavor, does it meet the threshold, the Shackleton applied that, is this the most audacious endeavor I could possibly conceive? And in time we'll iterate, we'll change, we'll pivot that happens of the course, but I want to start with that as the contemplation. So it's kind of like a a what would Shackleton do? Bracelet. Yeah. Yeah. Better said Shackleton. Uh, why did you move to Chicago to pursue an MBA?

Speaker 4:          00:39:17       Oh, no kidding. Yeah. Why did you, are you glad that you got an Mba? I have mixed feelings about it. School, I've, I was always so bored of school because I felt like the data rate was so slow as like a 56 k connection, right. Sitting in the classroom and the pace of speech and the data, it just, I wanted like a gig data transfer. It, I wanted to learn so much faster and so school, which was boring to me and um, I mean the NBA Mba was, was helpful but I don't know, um, I guess I had learned in different ways, mostly from doing and I'd been in the trenches of entrepreneurship my whole life and that's really how I prefer to learn. Then of course, reading on my own and stuff like that. Let me ask you this. If you were counseling a young entrepreneur who was living somewhere they felt was, and I'm not saying you taught us this place cause I've, I've actually spent quite a bit of time there, but if they're living somewhere they feel doesn't allow them to surround themselves with other, uh, highly ambitious, capable entrepreneurs.

Speaker 4:          00:40:16       Yeah. And the only way that they could relocate was to get an MBA say to Chicago, New York Sf. Yeah. Uh, do you think the hundred and 20 k or whatever it might be would be worth it if someone, if someone, if one of your kids was considering getting an Mba? Yeah. And let's just say they were kind of of that age now. Yeah. What, what might you ask them or, so I remember the very first case study we did in school was about these guys who were the Kim Up, I think of the new new golf ball that was better than the golf balls. And it was about their struggle over two year period of time to work through patents and Ip and all get distribution channels and stuff like that. And then we got together with the study group to talk about the case. And there were certain questions we are trying to answer, I forget what they were, but in my group with our five of us and we had contemplated things like cost models and distribution channels and my mind immediately went to like, how have these people paying for their rent, other marriage is still intact, right?

Speaker 4:          00:41:19       Like are they emotionally just too stressed out to function? The way I thought was sewing was, was uh, so colored by my experience as an entrepreneur and it was such a dramatic difference in how my peers thought. Uh, people coming in from like Ernst, Ernst and young to logical operations, yeah. Make their pay grade dramatic. And so I guess I would say to my son that the skills you need to succeed in a certain track of life may not require that education, that the course out of persistence and determination and then just the ability to learn and adapt quickly are much better suited for trying to do this. And it doesn't have to say that education is not helpful. The certainly isn't certain regards, but there are different types of education. That's right. Yeah. What's the most valuable thing you took from business school or from that experience? Let me say that.

Speaker 4:          00:42:09       We can come back to it. Yeah. You're giving me the look or we can drop it. I'm not sure. Okay. Well that's, that's, that's fine answer. Uh, I think more people should have that as an answer. Quite ab. That is the answer. Uh, I was telling my brother were talking about some really kind of deep philosophical questions and I said, I just haven't figured it out. And he said, maybe that's what you figured out. Exactly. Totally true. Maybe that's not an answer you need to find. Um, so with, with brain tree then let's, let's kind of look at, uh, what, what turned rain tree into a rocket ship or what was, what led to that perception at the very least. So I am already on, I had to figure out how to get customers without any money, which is a hard problem to solve carbon problem.

Speaker 4:          00:43:02       Right, exactly. And so what I did is I, I knew that computers, you know, computer software engineers were the target that I needed to appeal to them. And I knew there were different communities like python.net ruby on rails, Java, they all hung out in the different committees and each community had certain characteristics about how they work together, how collaborative they were, how chatty the war. And my theory was if I could find a community of engineers that were chatty and that helped each other through a word of mouth referral basis and I could get a few of the leaders in that group to come on board, then it would spread throughout the community and then we'd go to adjacencies. And so I did this analysis of looking at the characteristics and I found that ruby on rails was the most conducive, that they were very tight net.

Speaker 4:          00:43:47       Did you figure this out by looking at message boards? How did you go about doing it? No, I found actually a couple of sites, academic research papers that yeah, that actually measured sociability and interconnectedness and had like these maps, the diagrams that showed what these nodes were and who, how they inter connected. And then I focused on Ruby on rails and we've got a couple liters in there like, you know, 37 signals and a few others get hubs. Good one, hang on, get. Jason and David were amazingly good to us. Like they would tweet out all the time and they refer it out. All their friends, they were fantastic. And so we basically built a business on word of mouth because, uh, we, we tried so incredibly hard to be exceptional. We did. So they come on and they would love it, what we will be built and how we treated them and they would tell others. So I want to do, I want to really underscore what you just said

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       because I think it's so important for anyone who's considering launching a product or service or business. And that is that the, your first target is not the entire market. Right. And when I talk to people about say book launches, a lot of people want everyone to love the buck and when they write and promote and market a book to appeal to everyone. When everyone, when you want everyone to be your customer, customer, no one is your customer, especially when you have no money, you need the kind of cost per acquisition to be as low as pos, right? Ideally zero. And uh, so when I launched you the four hour workweek or is formulating the marketing plan, I mean you and I have a lot of shared DNA. We've observed this before because a lot of different areas, but I wanted to identify the market I could communicate with that would have the, the highest rebroadcasting ability and uh, very much actually similar to your, your chattiest checkbox.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       Right. And I determined that I always want it to be a market that I understood ideally belonged to. And that was the kind of 20 to 35 year old tech savvy nails and San Francisco, New York. Right. Primarily. And, um, and then after, if I, if I hit a critical mass in that, in that particular demographic and psychographic, say my goal was I think it was 10,000 bucks per week for two weeks and I could try to identify kind of the conversion rates and so on to hit that number, then I knew through word of mouth that would bleed out both an age range. It would jump from male to female. Exactly. Uh, but I wanted to identify the people who are kind of disproportionately creating the most online content exactly. At that time. Yep. And um, okay, so you target ruby on rails and uh, was there a particular tipping point where you were like, holy Molly.

Speaker 1:          00:46:20       Okay. Well any, any, any particular kind of hockey stick or breakthrough moments that come to mind? Yeah, so we, let me think. So we got as customers within the first couple of years, um, yeah, 37 signals get hub, Uber, Airbnb, living social when they were on their tear. And we had so many, do you have the All star team? We did. We had some of the best companies in the whole world using us and that their growth fueled of credibility, of course in our brand that we are able to provide great services to them. So we had this exceptional client base. That's, that's what it was, is once these guys hit their growth trajectories, right. And then once the reputation started spreading that we were a great provider, people loved using our service, they just really built upon itself. Who were you in that period of time competing against?

Speaker 1:          00:47:09       Who are your primary competitors? Initially it was the old guard, like cybersource and authorize.net and then processors like first data and global, uh, which were really great targets because they were dinosaurs and technology. Um, and then stripe launched, uh, I think about a year or two after us. And they're obviously a fantastic company and so they became formidable competitors. Um, and then of course paypal is always there, right. Doing their thing. And so when, when you met with the Uber's, the airbnbs and so on, how did you convince them to work with us? Um, many. So we did do some outbound, like we did track a lot of these companies down, but most of these companies sign up on their own that we just found out they were customers when they were going through the underwriting process. Um, but we, we did, we did target some of these companies individually, but most of it was organic.

Speaker 1:          00:48:00       Got It. And what do you, to what do you, aside from the word of mouth, what are other things that facilitated them finding you natural naturally? The being exceptional that I, this was the thing I said continually again, it again internally is that if we paid attention to creating an environment where people who interacted with, interacted with us would walk away and say unbelievable, right? The software's amazing. The support is amazing. That I just love this company and I so much so that I wanna write them a love letter. If we solve that, everything else will take care of itself because they'd walk away. And in Catholic in that night when they're out with their friend getting to bear, they're gonna bring us up because they had this amazing experience with us where we solved all the problems and we did small things like we would the integration team, we would see when someone's coating to the API and if they were having problems with it, we'd reach out and say, Hey, like we see your code into the API and the Kevin Problems, uh, can we help if what?

Speaker 1:          00:48:55       Like who does that? Like who, who proactively reaches out. So we tried to do small things at credit. He's really great experiences for people that could you explain just for people who are non technical out there? So application programming interface equal, yeah, sorry. Yeah, no, no, no. We're, we're fine. I love to kind of, uh, it's a very important concept right in, in a lot of tech. So what, what does coding to the API mean? So they are programming their software to speak to our software and there was a certain way that they would do that. And so there's a lot of the value of how that's done. Would be, is our software easy to work with? Does that make sense? You know, it's just, yeah. And so your software is, is behind the scenes. Yeah. Handling transactions. So it's kind of like you have in a restaurant, front of the house, the Maitre d of the waiters and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:49:38       Then you have back of the house, the restaurant, and you need those. The people in the restaurant never see the people on the back with all the flames and cuts out on them. You need a very reliable way for the front of the House to talk to the back of the house. Exactly. That's the API. That's right. Uh, and it's super, super important concept. It's how also, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, it's how a lot of companies grow very quickly just by making that a seamless, that's right. Experience. Yeah. Making your services broadly available to a broader ecosystem of engineers. It, um, your story reminds me of a story told by one of my favorite people out there. A guy named Derek Sivers. I don't know if you know Derek. So Derek is a, uh, it certainly hope to have him on the podcast sometime, but sort of a philosopher king in the programming world, a really fascinating guy, great teacher, also really great teacher. But he

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       had a very similar focus on details with CD baby, the company that he started grew and then later sold. And uh, I remember he, he told me, and he wrote about this in his book as well. And if you guys search, I think I put this on my blog. If you just search search Derek Sivers letter and then Ferris, I'm sure it'll pop up. Sivers, s I v e r s sivers.org. Really Amazing Guy. But when people would get their order confirmation email, it was just hilarious. Kind of elaborate story of like your CD has been carefully pulled off the shelf and placed on a satin pillow and then wrapped in paper by a Japanese origami specialist. And it was this just very personable, uh, email confirmation and no one was doing that. Yes. And so it, it spread, it was such a small detail with, with huge implications. Yup. Uh, for, for a brand loyalty, for Pr, for us acquisition, for all of these things. And it was so easy to do. Yup. Right. It was not something that a big company couldn't do. It was just something a big company wouldn't do. Yes, typically. Right. What are other, uh, what are other, um, whether it's, I, and I hesitate to use this term, but growth hacks or, uh, say, uh, rituals, routines or rules in within Braintree that allowed you guys helped you guys grow as quickly as you did?

Speaker 4:          00:51:52       It's a one we, one thing I focused on a lot was the second goal, which was that employees would say it was the best place they've ever worked and it was this ongoing quest to figure out how to make that happen. Again, my goal in my mind was they go home and rave about what they do on a daily basis. They feel good in life, that they love it. And so I always wanted to know what, what people were feeling and thinking because if I didn't know that, then I couldn't change or, or build, you know, certain things. And so I tried all the normal things of like we did town halls every week and it was more like group therapy than it was company updates where I would let these long awkward silences persist until like the fain came up though everyone was worried about or what they want to talk about, but no one dared.

Speaker 4:          00:52:36       So what would be an exam? When would those awkward pauses come? I would say it does it does. Anyone have any questions and you just let it sit? Exactly like we're going to, we're going to wait until we have some questions and like I knew there's like one or two things on everyone's mind because I could feel the pressure build all week. Right? I mean the one thing I learned is pink elephant expanding. Exactly. The thing is true in life is that everyone always has a pebble in their shoe, always. Right? There's something bothering us and that sometimes by just acknowledging it, it take, it addresses the problem. But it seemed like every week we'd built up this tension in the startup, then we, you know, in the company and if we addressed it openly in the town hall setting, it would be great. And so I would look as long pauses go and someone would find that was a hand and see like, all right, like I'm really bothered that we hired someone for this role instead of promoting some of them internally.

Speaker 4:          00:53:23       Right? Like what's going on? Right. And it was great because you have a really hard question to answer. And so I encourage like brutal honesty back and if they criticized me even better, right? If they could criticize me than anything, it was full up and game. But one thing I, I, I was at this Christmas party one year and I was talking to the significant other of one of my employees, this was added company Christmas party company Christmas party. We're in the buffet line and I say, so like, how's you know, stolen. So doing like he, he's four months in and how's he enjoyed life? And she says like, it's amazing. Like, he is happy and I, he comes home and he's energized and he loves his coworkers. And it's so different from what he was, how he felt before. And I thought, yes, like this is the data I want.

Speaker 4:          00:54:09       I cause I want to know the significant other, knows the most about how that person feels in life based upon what they do on a daily basis. And so it was a constant quest of trying to find out the right data source of how people feel in life to build an exceptional company and knowing where to go for that data, how to get it. And now of course, like I couldn't go interview everyone all the time. That would be awkward. But just knowing that the data sources are out there to gather, to build, you know, a good team was really helpful. So you said, you know, if they, if they criticize me all the better, what would you, how would you prompt people? To be brutally honest, because you're the, you're the big boss, right? Right. Uh, would you send out an email outlining the goal of the town hall or would you get up and talk for a few minutes in the beginning and try to encourage people to let that stuff out?

Speaker 4:          00:54:57       What, what, what did you say in either case? So one, I think it's a, a disposition I tried to be self deprecating where I would make fun of myself for things I did or mistakes I had made. I tried to open the broadcast those so that they felt comfortable that I owned up and I wasn't, you know, sensitive about it. And then I would just, um, I guess in dialogue I would try to typically own things myself and to make them feel comfortable that they could bring it up. We can discuss it openly. How would you do that? So if we talked about, um, I'm trying to think of like a recurring theme that came up. Um, maybe if it came up like two or three times I can say like, look like this. Honestly, he's like my deal because you guys have brought this up two or three times now.

Speaker 4:          00:55:37       I've not done something about it that's adequate. So clearly I'm not doing what I should be doing because you're doing your job of being honest and transparent with me. I have not taken the responsibility of actually acting on this. So I'm going to go think about this, put together a plan and do up in the meantime like this is my problem and my mistakes. So I'd tried to own things like that. So it's not, it's no longer your job to worry about it. It's my job to worry about that. Like I hear you. You did a good job. Thank you for being honest and transparent because that's what I asked of you. And you don't have the power to fix that yourself. This is like a more community problems. So it's in my, so the, um, the observation I've had on multiple occasions and, um, is, uh, you're very persuasive, but I don't think you'd be very good at lying. And I could be, maybe you're so good that I would never notice. I don't know. But I'm, I'm making, I'm just kidding, obviously,

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       but I don't think you'd be good at lying. And you seem, even though you don't have technical training, you seem very scientifically minded and sort of an engineer at heart. Does that make sense? I mean you, you're very methodical and one thing that I've personally struggled with is, Eh, maybe this is through a lot of competitive sports. Maybe it's just from being a working solo so often, uh, I don't want, I generally don't want, or it's a personality type. I don't want people to tell me what's going right. I want the bad news because I feel like the good news we'll take care of itself. Does that make sense? Yeah. And I think as a result of that, uh, I recognize that one of my kind of deficiencies as a manager of people is that I'm not very good or consistent in giving positive feedback.

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       Uh, I don't feel like I erroneously believe that because I don't necessarily need that other people probably don't get it right or I just forget about that. Yup. Uh, how, how did you address that within brain tree? Because I think it's, at least in my experience, it is important, uh, to maintain morale of the troops. And so on. Uh, what did you do to help kind of maintain morale and, and that level of happiness that the significant other, yeah, important. I would tell stories, I would tell stories about people and exceptional efforts. Now it's always a double edged sword because if you tell a story about one person, you're not telling a story about the other person. And one person that was in it, Phil left out because like I was just involved as you know, him or her and doing this. And so, um, it is tricky, but I, I always highlight, we did, I did a weekly emails as well and I want it to tell stories that people who went above and beyond the call of duty, I either in building our software or a customer service interaction or even helping a coworker do something.

Speaker 1:          00:58:13       And those stories resonated with people, right? They saw with their peers were doing and it was influential in how they behaved. So I wanted to build a culture of a certain behavior and I told stories to reinforce that right at the positive written for us. And you did. How often did he do the town hall meetings? We did either weekly or biweekly. We kind of fluctuated over the years. What Day of the week or Friday? Friday? Yeah. Why Friday? It's a different vibe in the company. People are kind of reflecting upon the week. Um, the tension is kind of built up. We're going into the weekend, Monday mornings, a little bit frantic Friday. I find people are more pensive and reflective and that it was a good time for us to dig deep and find out what was really bothering us and how and re and I guess regroup on the essence of why we existed. Right. That if we weren't just there to make a paycheck, we were there to build something exceptional and to continually talk about that was important. When you were building brain tree, when do you feel like you were at your, your seek powers? In other words, like when were you pitching a no hitter in the world series? Like at what point in building brain tree was, I don't

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       think I could identify it. It was just so gradual. And over time that we started these companies like Uber and Airbnb, they hit their growth stride and it was amazing that we were powering all their payments and um, it was just so gradual and slow because companies come on brand new and it takes them a couple of years to ramp up to SAR processing, you know, significant cells. So I don't know if I could identify a single point. It's just this slow, steady build. When were you under the most, when did you feel under the most

Speaker 3:          00:59:50       pressure?

Speaker 4:          00:59:53       Always. Okay. So the, the, the, uh, where I'm trying to lead this is

Speaker 3:          01:00:01       when, when you can try to think of when you were operating at a very high level, under very high stress. What did your morning routine look like? The first say hour of your day or 10 hours of your day. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:00:17       Yeah. So I guess if I think about the broader context of life, I mean, I had two children when I started brain tree and then, um, you know, I had three by the end and we had my first two children with colicky. So they're crying all night and so not be able to sleep very well at night and get into the next day and going to work. And the Dylan with all the stuff you deal with, it was a pretty tough time in life. And um, I mean there were some dark moments. It's, it's, I guess something you and I have talked about on our walks is that I generally view advice. I'm very skeptical of advice because it's so contextual and it can be deceptively um, unhelpful because you don't understand what's packed into that advice. But one piece of advice I think is helpful for entrepreneurs, I wish someone would have told me is the importance of surrounding yourself with fellow founders, people who get you and understand you.

Speaker 4:          01:01:12       Right? That all those years as a founder, I felt like I owned everything. I owned energy, I own growth, I own the success. It was all me and I had, it didn't have any cofounders of, so there's not to say people, my team didn't shoulder that bright. But as the founder you deal fill an a extra level of burden. And I had no outlet for it. I owned energy at home. I owned energy at work and it did, it was tough. It took a toll. And so over the past couple years, I have critiques, friendships, like, you know, like, like you and I have where we can talk as if we were journaling. Right, right. I mean, to get to the real raw and good stuff of life. But, um, I think that that would have been very helpful during the dockers times during the theme, the moments where it was the hottest. Yeah. I, um, had a, a book inscribed reaction. It's right there. The psychedelic explorer's guide had Jim Fadiman on the podcast and, uh, I thought it was, inscription was so great. He said, uh, you know, to Tim a companion on the path. And I was like, that's, yeah. And I think, I mean, we're literally companions on the path. Yeah. We go on these hikes, but having

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       those people who can identify with the pressures that you're feeling. Yeah. What were other coping strategies that you had or routines that were helpful when you felt you were shold shouldering all of that burden? Yeah, so I always look for hobbies that would consume my mind, where I could escape myself because these things, you could change the channel. Exactly. Yeah. For a brief period of time. Totally. Because it's like it loops and loops and loops and if you try anything else, it just loops. Even when you're having conversations and I cured, is obsessed with trying to build your company. And so one day I had a hard day at work and I was walking home. I thought, you know what? I'm going to go fly an airplane. Like maybe that'll do the trick. And I did this discovery flight and the guy took me up and he's like, if you can do the following things, you can fly.

Speaker 1:          01:03:01       And he did like this really hard turn up and down. I got sick and I was like, oh, I can never do that. So crazy and hard. But I thought about it the next morning I thought, no, I can actually do this. And so I started flying and I lost myself in aviation. I absolutely love it. And so that really helps that I could find a different place to park my mind. And focus is, is a discovery flight where like you're in the passenger seat of a new car and they show you what the car can do. Is that what a discovery flight is? It basically, yeah, you go up and he's like, hey, so if you want to get your license, you have to perform the following maneuvers. Like here's a steep turn, you know, 30 degrees. And, and so he was just showing me basically how the plane operator and what I would need to do.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       And I think for a lot of people listening, they think of learning to fly as a very, very, very, very expensive thing. I think they associate it with say, owning a private jet. But that is not the case. Right. I mean, as far as I understand that, I mean, I have friends who work jobs here who have gotten into aviation. Yeah. He is it, uh, how, how cost prohibitive is it to become involved with aviation? In some capacity. So I think I paid a few thousand dollars over the course of the lessons. Got It. Something like that. Over what period of time? I believe it took me 90 days. Got It. So I mean, all in all, not pocket change but not like buying a Gulf stream. That's right. Uh, this is something I've, I've, I've, I've a number of friends here, uh, in the bay area who use aviation is their way of changing the channel, right?

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       So they're not constantly watching sort of yes. BBC News or whatever the hell their world happened. That's right. Um, let's see. The, um, when you were 21, I think you said 21, when you were 21, and you thought of the word successful, who is the person who came to mind at that point for you were in that rough range? I admired people who had, I guess I had a number of buckets in my mind of who I admired. But one bucket that appealed to me because I thought I could potentially be like them, was those who had acquired significant amount of resources and through building businesses. And we're now using those resources to do good in the world, that they had freedom of time,

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       they didn't need to show up for a job and they didn't write all that kind of stuff. And so I identified with that because I think I thought it matched up with my potential skill sets and something I could potentially achieve in life. So it really, it was freedom of time to do the things that you could about the most in life. So who were, who were some of those people are, who are some of those people growing up in Utah? Jon Huntsman was, I don't know who that, so he built, um, I'm not even sure what company he built, but he was enormously wealthy. And of course the Marriotts are on there as well. But there were a few families in the community that had accumulated a significant resources and they, they like one, I think Huntsman has a cancer institute at the University of Utah and others that they able to move the needle in significant ways that other people just couldn't. And I thought that was a, I thought that was really remarkable that you could make huge contributions potentially to humanity.

Speaker 3:          01:06:10       So this is, this is actually I think a good segue to one of your current projects. I think it's fair to say primary projects, the Os Fund.

Speaker 4:          01:06:18       It is. Yep. So could you explain to people what the Os Fund is? Yeah, so the context is I guess at 21 I made that goal that I wanted to spend my life improving people's lives. And over the 14 years or so as I was building my companies, I thought a lot about this. Like what would it look like, what would it feel like, what it tastes like, what areas, what I focus on? And I looked through thousands and thousands of ideas and uh, I mean I was always thinking about it and I studied during that time a lot of about science and technology. And the realization that I came to is that the reason why our time and place is so unique and the arc of humanity is we literally now have the tools to build the kind of world we can dream of. So if you take computer software and biology, genomics, AI, virtual reality, three d printing, we can literally program our existence.

Speaker 4:          01:07:07       So I think oftentimes if like Davinci where he had his great sketchbooks, where he designed a flying machine and then these really amazing ideas, but he couldn't build it. He didn't have the tools. We can literally build anything today. And so as I realized that, I thought this is like the one of the biggest moments in the history of mankind or humankind. How do we, the biggest question for me was what kind of world are we going to build? And that's when I started the Os Fund is, is trying to invest in these tools of creation that will still dramatically effect the kind of world we build.

Speaker 3:          01:07:38       Yeah, it is really a fascinating time. And we were able to sort of a Cambrian explosion of potential where you know what, what happens when you can create virtually anything. You can download a recipe for a, an a, a virus that could cause an epidemic that's right. Or weapon. That's right. Or at the same time obviously use that knife, that surgical knife to repair or build as opposed to damage. Right. Uh, what now? Oh, s refers to operating system. Yes. Why operating system?

Speaker 4:          01:08:12       So it's a metaphor I like a lot that the biggest changes in history, the biggest improvements in history have happened at what I call the operating system level. So for example, like germ theory that we tried to figure out what was causing disease and death for a long time. And when we figured out there was this thing like bacteria that cause infections and death. And then once we figured out sterilization and antibiotics and vaccines and good personal hygiene, we radically extended healthy human life. But it was finding out there was this core problem of bacteria and every major change we've had have, it has been at this level. And so instead of playing with things out of different level, um, my, what we think about is the companies we invest in are doing world changing things at the operating system level. So if they're successful in their endeavors, it would radically change the world.

Speaker 4:          01:09:00       We're in sort of the foundational that's right level upon which everything else does. Right? So just like a computer has an operating system at its core, the determines how it works and there's applications that sit on top, everything in life has an operating system. And what, what are some of the investments that you've made thus far in the Eos Fund? Yeah, human longevity, uh, led by Craig venter is they're trying to radically extend healthy human life, you know, into the hundreds and they're doing it by using the whole human genome and then adding data like the metal biome and phenotype data. And then using advanced machine learning to learn about disease and create personal therapeutics. If they're successful, it would change a medicine as we know it. And it really is fundamental way. Yeah. Uh, any others? Uh, yeah, we just made an investment in a gingko bioworks, which they're basically making biology programmable.

Speaker 4:          01:09:54       So just like we use computer code today to render a website or process a credit card transaction or fly on autopilot system at an airplane. We can program the same thing in biology for today. They're doing fragrances and flavors. The producing in a lab, the otherwise would be required in nature. And as we climb up the complexity scale, we can do much more complicated things like um, work on antibiotic resistance and Carbon Capture. But the idea, Tim, like your biology, I'm biology, our world runs on biology, right? The fact that this could be a programming language we could actually predictably use is remarkable. Right? Well, what does it, I mean, I guess DNA is what Atcg, right? I mean it's something along those lines. Some of them getting out of my depth here under the my ignorance pool and pretty quickly, but the, uh, to the fragrances for instance, that would be considered, is that considered synthetic biology? No. So they design the organism just like you, you take yeast for brewing beer, right? Um, you take an organism and you can alter within the production that organism, what it produces. So it's actually a natural in production. You're just altering the organism that produces it, so it's not synthetic biology. Interesting. Okay. So you're just kind of removing a few ingredients in a preexisting recipe and letting kind of the chef he's Africanism yes. So let's take those different food product. Exactly. It's this new

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       era of industrial engineering where it's going to change all the processes we created during the first industrial revolution. Now what is your, and you may not have a strong opinion here and if not, that's totally fine, but people get, uh, very, uh, excited, positively and negatively about, uh, the term Gmo. Yeah. Uh, and genetically modified food. Uh, what is your perspective on that? So I think that because I just from personal cause yeah. A personal standpoint, there are cases where they can change the genetics slightly to make something say more resistant to that's right. Pests. That's right. Uh, then we, there their start, I, it seems like we get into an area also where they're taking something from like a fish and putting it into a plant or something like that. Yes. And then I get a little uneasy and I'm not sure if that's well founded or not.

Speaker 1:          01:12:05       Yup. Uh, because if we start getting into, uh, you know, I think of all of the, um, all of the, sort of a horrifying mad scientist novels that I read when I was a kid. Yeah. Uh, but do you think any of those fears are well founded or, or what are the risks of that going wild? Okay. So I'll answer your question in a different way. Perfect. You may not find satisfactory, but I think it was a very, very poorly worded question. So thank you for saving my ass in the first place. So if we start with this premise that we have these incredibly powerful tools of creation, we can program anything. Okay? That obviously means, and, and couple that up with, we have this distributed environment now where anybody can pull the computer terminal and anyone in the car in the world and whatever age and program, right?

Speaker 1:          01:12:53       Either through biology or computer software. So we have all these tools so we have a world full of makers to have these powers. So with that, what you build affects me and what I build affects you. And so one thing that I'm exploring now with Eos Fund is what I call societies are social operating systems. And there are systems of cooperation and reconciliation. So in that category falls like governance and capitalistic systems, right? These belief and value frameworks that drive our behavior and allow us to reconcile our differences. So we're going to have some really big questions to answer and we have to decide as a society through our reconciliation systems, do we modify our genetics and our children? Do we do GMO? Right? What is appropriate for AI in terms of what people build? So we have really big questions to answer. And uh, I think that one of the best areas we could focus on would be how these social operating systems are constructed and calling attention to them as being technologies that can in fact be built, changed and, and, and, um, better aligned with the realities of our current time. The big question topic is a really fascinating one to me for a whole host of reasons. I remember as an undergraduate,

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       some of my favorite classes were philosophy classes, introduction to metaphysics or whatever. And you had say, utilitarian philosophers. I think that's the right term. Like Peter Singer for instance, very controversial. I think most of his controversies, unearned, I think it's a politicized and so on. But you know, the question of doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people, how do you make decisions if that's your objective? Right. And a, that would mean if there's like you're stuck in a cave and there's one fact I plugged in the exit and they're 10 people in the cave, we're going to starve to death. That's right. You killed the fat guy. I mean just it's mathematics, pure and simple. Um, and that used to be primarily just a thought exercise, sort of an academic ivory tower thought exercise. And now you have companies working on say, autonomous vehicles.

Speaker 3:          01:15:01       Yup. And Ai hiring philosophers to try to advise that's right. How to answer these questions when say an autonomous car is barreling down the highway or the Golden Gate Bridge. And all of a sudden it has to choose between, you know, hitting the five, uh, you know, octogenarians in the sidewalk, the old ladies or swerving the other direction and hitting a car that has a four year old. Yes, yes. So how do you make those value judgments, right? Yep. And what I'm so curious about, number one, that's a, that's a very multifaceted, thorny, potentially subjective question to tackle, but you have to program these vehicles are entities that's right to behave. That's, that's, that's the, you know, the set of rules. They're programming. At the same time, what I really worry about and, uh, is not, not only the, the complexity of the technology on its own is, is a, is a, is a big audition.

Speaker 3:          01:15:57       A sort of big audacious challenge and problem to tackle right by. Good. Let's just say, Eh, sort of ethically wired, uh, technicians and technologists in the valley and elsewhere, right? That's challenging in and of itself, but how do you address the ultimately a lot of say these, whether it's like a bill of rights or an arbitration agreement to, to manage these social contracts where everyone's a maker yes. Will be dependent on it would seem, and I want you to challenge me on this, if you don't agree with this, uh, would be dependent on legislation and there will be sort of the, the way that Sh, you know, economics is how humans among other things respond to incentives. Right? Right, right. It's like the reward in a capitalist society say, and then the punishment of a love legal system. Yes, exactly. Yup. When politicians, many politicians are completely incentivized in the short term for reelection and not envisioning the longterm implications of some of these massive decisions. That's right. Massive decisions. How do you contend with that? Like, or how have you, how have you thought about this? That's why I, it's such a

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       hugely important area to focus because when people make decisions, you're looking to really at the surface layer, but the beliefs and values that are driving that are embedded very deeply, right. Oftentimes that's why it, that's why, for example, like social operating systems are so incredibly powerful, but also they're invisible. Like they just are woven into the fabric of our lives and we don't know they exist. And when we do see them as existing, we just consider them as givens are fixed. And so what we're hoping to do is to call attention to what they are, right. These massive, powerful influence in our life that drive our decisions. And we don't even know it. Right. But our subconscious, exactly. Yep. And that identifying them that they really are social technologies that are driving these decisions. And so if we go to use, I guess a technical, you know, turn, like if we go deeper in the stack, if we go down to the operating system level, like what are these core beliefs in these core values, where they come from, what are they assuming?

Speaker 4:          01:18:08       Yeah. What are the assumptions? And the if then is that are built into the lowest level. Exactly. That affect our decisions on, you know, the eighth layer. Exactly. And we've never tracked it back to that low level because maybe we absorbed them during childhood through sac religion that wasn't of our choosing, whatever it might be. We're over choosing for that matter. How do you personally try to identify as those for yourself in your own personal decision making and so on? Yeah, so at Braintree, one of the principals I consistently communicated was challenged all assumptions. And the story that I accompanied with it was there's five monkeys in a room, there's a basket of bananas at the top. And the monkeys of course, want to climb the ladder to get the banana. But every time a monkey tries, they're all sprayed with cold water. And so after a few times be sprayed by cold water, the monkeys learn, don't climb up the ladder to get the bananas can we get sprayed by cold water?

Speaker 4:          01:19:03       And so they take one monkey out and put a new monkey in and the new monkey of course sees a bananas. It's like, Hey, like I'm going to go grab a banana. But when it tries to go up the ladder, the other monkey grab it and pull it back. Like, I don't wanna get sprayed by cold water. You're a new guy here. So like don't mess with, teach you the rules. Exactly. So then they systematically pull every monkey out, um, and have you, and now you have five new monkeys in. Anytime a new monkey comes in and tries to climb the ladder, they grabbed the monkey, pull it back. But none of the five have ever been sprayed by cold water I've ever experienced. Exactly. And so what I was trying to wonder is, where is that in my life? Like what am I assuming that isn't visible that I cannot see?

Speaker 4:          01:19:40       And uh, of course, when the circumstances change in a situation like that, you have learned helplessness, right? Or they would say, take a, I mean, these are horrible experiments, but ultimately the data, I think it's very valuable where they would have say a, I think it's a Skinner box. It was used where they, uh, subject to animals to shocks. Yeah. And there some animals who could move from one side to the other and avoid the shock, you know, from a pain on the floor to another pain. And then others would get shock no matter what. And then if they moved them into a new box

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       where that was no longer the case, where they could avoid the shock that those who had learned it was futile to try to move, would just lay on the floor. Yes. And get shocked. Yes. So where does that exist in your own life? Uh, what, what have you, what are some cases if you're comfortable discussing them, where you've discovered that, whether it brain tree in a business capacity or otherwise? Yeah, let me think about that. Um, so many, I mean, I guess being human is remarkably tough, right? You get, we just, so like you and I, before this discussion we were talking about all the funny, irrational things. You and I both do inconsistent with our thought patterns, right. And, uh, I guess I it a couple of years back, maybe a decade ago, I got into irrational behavior reading Dan Ariely's book predictably irrational and thinking fast and slow thinking fast and slow.

Speaker 1:          01:20:53       Danny Conoman. Yes, exactly. So I started reading all these books and I became increasingly convinced of my own, um, what I was fickleness and inability to actually act rationally in life. And once I became aware of that, I think I became much softer in my opinions and confidence levels in life where I, I want to question thoroughly everything I do all the time. And of course I miss all layers a lot of time, but I try to be present and knowing that when I make a decision, there's all kinds of layers behind it. Many of us are probably flawed and if I went back and evaluated it, so I suppose it's just being present and knowing it exists and how flawed we are in our abilities when really we think we're perfectly logical and consistent all the time. We're just not. Yeah. There's um, Dan Ariely's book is great, predictably irrational.

Speaker 1:          01:21:39       Also a lot of really solid business takeaways in terms of Hess show. Uh, how people, I remember the example he gave in a presentation, I'm not sure if it's in the book, I'm blanking of the checkout process that the Economist magazine tested it all. That's right. And it was like, you know, get the print edition for this amount by itself. Get the digital edition is mount by itself or get both for this amount and how you're changing the pricing and removing or adding options affected the, the average order size. Yes. So fascinating. Yes. Uh, or adding in basically a not a red herring. It's not that, I don't think the right term, but a a, a straw man of an option that they don't even really want you to choose, but they'll add the cheaper option just so they know you'll cause they know that 50% of the people will take the middle option totally.

Speaker 1:          01:22:24       Just would have been the cheapest before, but you would have then exact not chosen. It just like restaurants, I think put like the most expensive pricey item in the top right corner to say like, here's a $75 option. Everything else is cheap at $32. Same thing with one. Yeah. Very common. Uh, when you are feeling, and maybe maybe the answer is you don't feel this way, but when you're feeling say overwhelmed, how do you unpack that and try to reduce the sources of that? Overall, I've gotten so much better over the years now I just call a friend and just say, you know what? I'm feeling overwhelmed and I feel terrible and I don't think I can do this. And right just saying it out loud like, yeah, I actually, I can, I got this, but I just need to get that off my chest. And I'm all, and so when I deal with, when I work with entrepreneurs now, people I'm invested in or otherwise they say like, if you want to chat anytime the day and say anything, right, no judgment on my side.

Speaker 1:          01:23:14       Just say it out loud, do it. And I think there's just, it's, it's hard to do hard things. I guess is has been Horowitz would say, and having the ability to be vulnerable and honest and transparent and raw with other people is immensely helpful for me. Yeah. But you weren't always, no, not always do that. Now I was extremely private and guarded and I owned everything. I didn't dare come out of let go. And I think men are particularly bad at that. Uh, I agree. I, uh, yeah, I've struggled with this myself and, uh, you're so on point and it's such a simple answer, seemingly self evident and obvious. Right. But, uh, I think it points to something I've noticed about myself and I tend to be stuck in my kind of prefrontal cortex. Yeah. Yeah. But if, if you haven't kind of thought your way, if you haven't rationalized your way or that's not the right reasons your way into a problem, it's hard to reason your way out of it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:15       I agree. Uh, just by, by relying on the sort of internal pro and con list and like schematic of something that is purely emotional or maybe based on some operating system flaw that you're experiencing it. Yeah. Uh, so yeah, just calling a friend. Yeah. But that's like what I love about the friendships that I have is I can go into a conversation and I know when I leave, two things will happen. One is they will have challenged my mental models that I can't change it. I can't see my mental models and I can't challenge myself very well, but someone else can see it. So clearly they can just call it out. Right. And number two is when I leave the competition is saying like, I want to become a better person, right? And I want to do more in life. And I went to work harder.

Speaker 1:          01:24:53       Like those are the two things I think I value the most and the attractions. And so it's, I want to be that for other people, right? That when they bring something to me, I can flip it and say, yeah, here's a different model for you to contemplate and to hopefully when they leave they say, you know what? Yes. Like, I can do this and I've got that much more energy to go about it. I find also, uh, you know, my version of talking to someone very often is a journaling in the morning. Yeah. Just to take what I feel. For instance, if I'm feeling overwhelmed or having some type of problem or source of anxiety, putting it on paper makes me realize how absurdly unfounded it is. I, that's magical. And I think that, you know, it can be, if you don't have a friend to call, who's going to challenge you in that way?

Speaker 1:          01:25:35       Just putting it freezing your thought on paper can provide you with a sufficient mirror in which you can see. It's completely ridiculous. Like I thought I had, you know, I looked like the elephant man and in fact it's just the tiny little pimple on the side of my head. Like, stop freaking out. It's not a big deal. And it's transient or reversible or both. Um, so a couple of 'em just to shift gears for a minute. A couple of a rapid fire questions that you can you, which don't have to have rapid fire answers. Okay. You didn't, so you can take an hour you want. Uh,

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       but I'm not very witty quick. Okay. So I'll try my best to get fast enough. Uh, in the last, say six months to year or the first thing that comes to mind, what is something a purchase you've made for less than a hundred dollars? So it had a significantly positive impact on your life.

Speaker 2:          01:26:24       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:26:25       I have water. So take your time. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:26:28       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:26:29       Um, I would probably say,

Speaker 4:          01:26:34       I don't know. Okay. We'll come back to it. All right. We'll come back. Uh, do you idea, I mean that's, that's, that's not the right question because it gives you an out, what historical figure do you identify with? So I love biographies. I read probably a hundred plus biographies and I don't know if there's one person in particular might be just a collection. Actually, no, actually I would say there's, there's a few, um, one we talked about before Shackleton, he resonates with me, uh, at a deep level too. I've read this book called a good man by Mark Shriver about his dad, sorry, Trevor, who worked in the Johnson administration and started the Peace Corps and, and um, he was a remarkable man and an exceptional father, a good friend, loyal. And he is a mental model of the kind of person I want to be in life.

Speaker 4:          01:27:33       So, um, that three I'd probably say, uh, Viktor Frankl's man's search for happiness. That happiness or meaning, meaning. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So thanks very interrelated though. Yeah. But the [inaudible] one of the driving philosophies of life thing it drives me the most is the stuff I guess I find the most beautiful is the, we have the ability to author life in life. Don't worry about it, but we, we can choose not to take default fault routes. We can choose to take different paths that we can design and do whatever we want. And I find that's why I find entrepreneurship so appealing is that you get to design your own world. And so in my office actually I hired, I commissioned a graffiti artist. I, you send me a photo of this, I remember. Yeah, no, explain it please. Okay. So on one side is get off the gray and the other side is, is Harry Potter.

Speaker 4:          01:28:23       And they have their wands and staff's pointed up and it's is exploding energy in the middle of the air with his book that's open blank pages for the pen. And then above it, and graffiti is the word dream. And the concept behind it is, is Jrr Tolkien and, and J K Rowling created worlds that we inhabited through the tool of text, right? They wrote this stuff down and then we inhabited. And so they literally authored worlds. And we have that same ability as entrepreneurs to build companies, right? In everything we do, we have that. And especially our tools of creation now that we're invested in at the Os Fund, as I wanted to use pop culture figures because I wanted my kids see this, that they have that ability to do that in life. That they don't need to say yes to the default options, that they can carve her own path. And even though it's incredibly hard, it's gonna be painful to me, it's so much more fulfilling than a secure and safe way to live life. And I think it is,

Speaker 3:          01:29:20       it's also just worth kind of rewinding and pointing something out to folks, which is, you didn't come from, as far as I know, I mean a wealthy family where that was the kind of a default. I was that the default belief system, maybe it was maybe a, despite the, the financial challenges. Let me, because I think I recall you telling me that, uh, your, your mom made some of your clothing that you wear to school dead. Yeah. So it's, it's not like you sort of came in with every possible advantage that people might assume is required to think that way. Uh, the authoring of your own world. So I'm going to come back to that and I realized the, the successful question I think could be broken down a few ways. So you just brought up with that biography. The first one, a good man. The, the thought in my head that you can model different people for different traits. Yeah. Right. Which has its own risks because you might absorb bad habits. That's why spending time with those people without realizing it. Uh, sort of like viruses in here, you know, bugs in the [inaudible], but uh, but that person correlated to the values, right? So modeling that person based on values. If you were modeling who is an entrepreneur or who are entrepreneurs that you admire for their aggression.

Speaker 4:          01:30:42       So I'd say actually like a bunch of names pop up. Yeah. People I've invested in at the less fun. So a mean Craig venter. Yeah, I hit longevity at Peter Diamandis. Uh, there's, well Josh Tetrick, Hampton Creek, Jason Kelly, Gingko bioworks, Daniel Fong at Lightsail, Scott Phoenix at vicarious. I mean we have a great roster of incredibly passionate entrepreneurs. Mustafa Suleyman deep mind. I wasn't an investor there, but I find him immensely inspiring. But, um, these entrepreneurs think differently about the world and, um, they're going after extremely hard challenges and I'd say there are Dacia send determined and very aggressive.

Speaker 3:          01:31:27       Got It. Okay. So now let's see. Do you define, would you describe yourself as aggressive? I am. Uh, in what ways are you most aggressive?

Speaker 4:          01:31:40       Um, when I see something I want to go after,

Speaker 3:          01:31:46       be relentless. And, um, which entrepreneurs do you most admire for their end? I'll have to say, you'll have to choose either a smaller subset of the people who invested with or,

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       uh, you can choose other people, which might be safer, uh, but for their resourcefulness. All right, so

Speaker 1:          01:32:13       let's come back to that. I know I'm going to have a lot of examples to think of people who, who have faced near and a certain death countless times was somehow they figured out to maneuver right around the problems, right? To sort of a neo in the matrix, do the backbend and dodge the bullets and come back to that. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's the essence of entrepreneurship. So that, that's actually a, that's actually a good segue. So what do you think an entrepreneur is? What does an entrepreneur, someone willing to us like? Um, I think entrepreneurs and explorers have a lot in common with like Shackleton that they chart that he, they head off an uncharted territory and they maintain this ability to adapt to circumstances that are chaotic, unknown, an extremely challenging and they can maintain some order in all the chaos to actually achieve a goal.

Speaker 1:          01:33:12       What are practices, uh, experiments maybe that people could perform to help them develop those characteristics? Is there anything else that you find sort of ports well over to that chaotic, uncertain nature of startups, small companies. So I guess we, I have a lot of conversations with people who want to start their own thing. And one of my favorite questions to ask is, is this an itch or is it, you know, burning, right? So it's just an itch. It's not sufficient and it gets to this point of how badly do you really want it? And for me, I burned the boats. Like there was no way I was going to get a job and so fell you with never an option. I had to make this work and I did have jobs on the way, but that was just to simply to pay the bills. But, um, failure just wasn't a solution I would accept.

Speaker 1:          01:34:11       And so I think I want to get it entrepreneurs that how badly you want it, what will you do to get there? Yeah, I find it very difficult in the current environment to identify those people because things are so frothy right now. A lot of people who would otherwise be risk intolerant and fearful of uncertainty are jumping into the fray as founders. I mean you have in this look, I, lot of my very close friends come out of Mckinsey and places like that, but when people with very high paid consultants, consulting jobs are then jumping into startups, I started to wonder what, uh, what is on the, what is on the horizon? And if I look back, a very kind of macro timing way to at least narrow down the field a bit. So it's easier to find. Those people seem to be investing during recessions.

Speaker 1:          01:35:03       So that sort of investing right after crashes it left sort of the people who couldn't conceive of doing anything else. Standing on the playing field. Yeah. And the sort of fairweather investors, the fairweather entrepreneurs all went back to doing whatever they perceive to be charted territory. Yeah, exactly. Me, I guess I want to be careful, like I don't want to be like an entrepreneur definition snob and right. And suggest that I was going to come out and pound the table and yell at you about that. But these attributes are held by people within companies who are starting their companies who are working with larger institutions. Right. But it's, it's, uh, it just inherently people who can create, do and see what others cannot or will not do. Right. That they will blaze something to others will follow or benefit from. And, hmm. Uh, let me, let me dive in to a couple of other questions also.

Speaker 1:          01:36:00       Uh, do you have a, uh, a book that you've gifted often? Are there any books that you've gifted to other people? Often? I have gifted a good man to quite a few people and Shackleton and Victor Frankel's book. Um, they're good man. I gift because if we contemplate how, like I wonder what would my son or daughter say about me? Why kind of biography would they? Right. And that's a model for me. I would want, um, Shackleton. That's how I want to behave in life. And Frankl, uh, that's how he, he, his basic point is no matter the conditions we surround ourselves in, we can author our life, right? We can offer whatever, how we respond. And then I guess it also love throwing their set. Artha yeah. Have you had that Herman Hesse, women Hesta I guess in German. I love that book that came up yesterday on a, on a walk with someone.

Speaker 1:          01:36:57       I won't name because it was a private conversation, but very, very successful guy that I also admire a lot for his sort of deep, deep thinking or unimportant philosophical questions sit harder came up. Um, that's also come up I think with my conversation with Josh Waitzkin who is on the second interview ever on this podcast, who is the basis for searching for Bobby Fischer known as a chess prodigy. But yeah, really, I don't think it's appropriate cause he's applied is going to learning framework to many different areas. But that book comes up a lot. It's a very, uh, sort of allegorical. But, um, oftentimes I think that deep truths can be explored more effectively in fiction and nonfiction. Right. Uh, because it pulls you out of your normal context. Yes. In a way. Yes. You're, you're not, you're your programs. You're problem solving software isn't running. So that blindsides you new mental models.

Speaker 1:          01:37:48       Yeah, exactly. Uh, the, um, I had a profound that just escaped my semi ketogenic brain or Qatar, Bahrain. I'm probably right on the, I think we were talking about this just before and I had 0.6 millimeters cause I fell out of Ketosis and then I'm just getting back and had some coconut oil. But I think that's kept me going for about 60 minutes. So I'm probably in the, in the, the no man's land, the gray zone of substrate suffering. Uh, what's, uh, if you could have, if you had a huge billboard you could place anywhere and uh, you can put whatever text you want on it, where would you put it and what would it say?

Speaker 2:          01:38:34       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:38:35       Uh, let's see. I would put it in New York and it would say,

Speaker 2:          01:38:41       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:38:42       do an anonymous and random act of kindness today. Why New York?

Speaker 2:          01:38:50       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:38:50       For if, if you're giving me the constraint of a single billboard, that's right. And I want the broadest exposure I'll get to New York where the density is highest. Got It. Uh, I like it. Good answer. Um, if

Speaker 1:          01:39:05       you were giving advice to your 30 year old self, what advice would you give

Speaker 4:          01:39:21       that? Um, no matter what comes your way, no matter how hard things Phil, that I had the power to overcome and be at peace with it.

Speaker 1:          01:39:41       Good advice. I think that's a great place to, uh, to start wrapping up. Is there, um, anything else you'd like to share with the audience? Resourcefulness, examples, anything else?

Speaker 4:          01:39:55       Yeah. You know, one thing. Um, so I do a lot of projects with my kids and like, for example, we started a few businesses together and we wrote a children's book together. And as I think about the coming generation of makers and doers, that they're the people who will define our world so dramatically. If I think about who they aspire to be like and what kind of things they want to do and how we write the operating systems of their app or aspirations and, and endeavors, I think that, um, I'm encouraged by watching my own kids grow up, that I see a bright future that we can trust these incredibly powerful tools of creation can be used for, for good things. They go to subjective of course, but, um, but that we can actually change a humanity in fundamental ways and that the rising generation, if we do it right, we'll have amazing ability to contribute to, uh, to our wellbeing.

Speaker 4:          01:40:57       And if, if there are, and I'm sure there are new parents listening to this, uh, and in fact, I have someone I know very closely who's about to have his first kid. Yeah. Um, what are a few activities or experiments or collaborations that you would encourage them to have with their kids or habits? It could be anything but just general try these two things. Three things, whatever it might be with your kids. It's like my personal philosophy is I try to be relevant in my kids' lives as self example. My, in my, my sixth grader, he's in a public school and they don't have any technology in the school. And so I've been working with a principal to bring technology in the school. And the way we're doing it is we're running a test in his class where they are using the scientific method to say if we bring technology in the classroom, will it improve educational experience?

Speaker 4:          01:41:48       And so they have to test it out and use pros and cons and go thought process. And then each of the, then there's six groups making a documentary. And so I'm with the teacher working with six groups of students. Yeah. Six groups of students within the class and they each are making like a three to four minute documentary on the process of testing. The scientific method of does is technology in the classroom. I posit for nave experience or what are the pros and cons. And so I'm working with his teacher to do that and doing the filmmaking and plotting out the storyboarding and identifying what the scientific method looks like. And that gives me all these opportunities to talk about everything that's relevant in his life, in ways that are meaningful. And so when we have conversations, I'm not just saying, hey, how's your day?

Speaker 4:          01:42:27       Fine. And that's the end of compensation, right? But it's relevant. So, uh, the same is true with my fourth grader and my, and my daughter who's in preschool. But I would say parents, they get engaged in the children's lives to be truly relevant, to understand the underlying context of who they like, who they dislike, who are the friends, who are the people who are, you know, saying mean things to them. What are they worried about in school? So that's been a helpful my, they ship with my kids and I think it's really helped us form a very strong bond. Are there any traditions that you've built into the family that are nonobvious? Christmas is very common for a lot of people of course, but are there, are there any other traditions or rituals that uh, you've developed with your kids? Yeah, so when we sit down for dinner, I always have a question for them.

Speaker 4:          01:43:19       Like, uh, last week, uh, on Saturday night we had this discussion of what does it mean to be good? And they're jamming like, you know, it's like, uh, 11, nine and five and they're jamming on this question of what it means to be good. And I raised all kinds of questions like, what you think is good is not necessarily what I think is good. We have these different interpretations and is there a single definition of good? And so Mike by five-year-old's raising her hand, offering up her in, but which is amazing, but they walk away, they're surprisingly bright and had an amazingly good insights. So I tried to have these conversations with them and sometimes it lasts like 10 minutes before chaos breaks out in the house, you know. But at least we have this moment where we can connect on really serious questions and they can explore these philosophically, which I have found to be beneficial in both their development but also our relationship.

Speaker 4:          01:44:09       What in your mind are common mistakes that parents make aside from doing the opposite of the two things you just described? So we were, this is up for opinion of course, but we were at a, uh, my five year old had this little party for her preschool and I took her over and we were at the park and there was this merry go round and there was like 20 kids on the merry go round. It's like there was some older kids going really fast around and like sometimes a kid would fall, like fall in the dirt and get trampled by their friends. Just friends or for exactly. So, but there was like two camps of parents and broke out. One camp was like, no way is my child going to be involved in this terribly dangerous endeavor, which is a reasonable thing to say, right?

Speaker 4:          01:44:50       Because it's pretty dangerous. And they could, someone could, could really hurt. And there are other parents more like myself, like, look, they figure it out. Like if they get hurt, I'm sure that the recover and it'd be a great experience for them to learn about, about big objects moving very fast and right. These principles of physics and the flesh. So, I mean, my daughter got on and she was in the mix of all this stuff, but um, I'm certainly of the philosophy that I like kids to go explore and do on their own. And if they make mistakes, that's fine. They can learn. But if we, if there's too much inherent protection structured that they just forego those learning experiences that will, they're taught that they're fragile and I think therefore they develop the belief that they're fragile. Yeah. I mean now granted I think back to, I mean I'm sure you probably have this like juke gasoline, gallon of gasoline and the street example.

Speaker 4:          01:45:37       I think back to some of the stuff I did where I'm just like I cannot believe I was allowed to do that. Exactly. Yeah. Skateboarding off of ramps in the middle of the street, wear like flip over and smashed my head on the asphalt and Cognac hus myself. Exactly. She's like, oh my God. But yeah, all of those things taught me ultimately like the, either this too shall pass or like okay, like you earned your lumps now you know not to do that. But you also know like you, you were able to weather the storm and get through it. Exactly. Yeah. So we got an a four wheeler, uh, two weeks ago, my 11 and nine year olds and I said, okay, I'm going to put your helmets on. I'm going to give you a two minute lesson on how to go, how to go forward and how to go backwards, how to break.

Speaker 4:          01:46:16       I'm to give you some lessons, like don't go into a ditch, don't go on a hillside though. You'll turn over. But I'm an expecting you to now go out for five minutes and come back safely and tell me how you did it. Like what were your thought processes? How'd you stay safe for the risk you took? But I want them to do it and I'm not going with you. Right? So you go and come back and they came back in one piece. But it was a good experience for them to tell me like, look, Hey dad, this is how we looked at the risk. This is how we thought that we'd potentially going to get into a problem. They ran into a tree going slowly, but right. What they talked about it, which was, I thought it was really helpful. Well, you know, and uh,

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       I just think it's, I think you're a fascinating guy. I think you're very inspiring guy. And as I think forward to at someday having kids myself, I, I love asking you these types of questions and uh,

Speaker 3:          01:47:03       this has been a blast. So number one, thank you very much for taking the time. I always love having these conversations. This is our first one on the record and a second, where can people learn more about you, about the [inaudible] fund and so on. Ios fund.co cl is where all of our investments are. And um, I'm active on Twitter, so happy to have ongoing discussions about the various things we talked about. But what's your Twitter handle? Uh, Brian Underscore Johnson with a y. Got it. At Brian and Square Johnson. I'll put that in the show notes as well. Uh, any, any parting thoughts or comments? Now, Tim, I just love this. I mean, we've, we've had fantastic conversations, you know, uh, over time. So this is fun to actually do this. I'm formally and, uh, you know, I've really enjoyed the friendship. Likewise man. And this is a, it's I'm so glad that I was able to, uh, to try to give people a view into these conversations that we have a, it's so much fun for me and I always come away with a bunch of things that I want to try or a bunch of assumptions I want to test.

Speaker 3:          01:48:04       And I think you really good at not only helping to prepare people for what could be a very glorious future of sort of infinite creation, but also giving them the belief in the first place that is possible. And so, uh, I really believe that you're a force for good. So thank you for spreading

Speaker 2:          01:48:26       mmm.

Speaker 3:          01:48:28       Confidence, uh, in, in the world. And I think you're, you're trying to really leave set and sort of a, a dent in the universe and an impact. So thank you my friend. Appreciate that a lot. I appreciate it. So to be continued, everybody hope you enjoyed this. This was a blast for me. Uh, we're going to continue to hang out, but off the record and if you'd like to chat with Brian, ping him on Twitter and let us know what you think.

I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers, including sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body, which later became number one New York Times Number One, Wall Street Journal and the brainstorming. A lot of it took place with designers from around the world. And here's how it works. Whether you need a t shirt, a business card, a website, an APP thumbnail, whatever it might be. You submit that project and from around the world we'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs. You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your money back. It's that straightforward and many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing things that I'll be sharing it in the future.
