Optimal at this altitude,

00:00:02.831 --> 00:00:06.010
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.283
Question.

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.490
Now it does seem like I'm a cybernetic organism.

<v 1>This episode is brought to you by helix sleep.</v>

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.900
I recently moved into a new home and when I needed beds,
where did I go?

8
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:34.710
I went to helix and I paid for them with my own monies.

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.020
I tried all sorts of mattresses.

10
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:40.830
Some of you saw me soliciting feedback and ideas on social media.

11
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:43.530
I tested a ton and I ended up on Helix.

12
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.610
They offer mattresses personalized to your preferences and sleeping style

13

without costing thousands of dollars.
It's chicken out.

14
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:55.080
He let's sleep.com forward slash Tim and you can take,
they're very simple,

15
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:57.720
two to three minutes sleep quiz to get started.

16
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.220
That's a diagnostic and they can build your mattress from there and ensure that

17
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:04.200
it is something you will absolutely love.

18
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.410
The quiz helps determine the type of mattress that is best for you by asking all

19
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:09.720
sorts of questions about your sleep behavior,

20
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.010
such as if you tend to lie on your back side or stomach as well as your body

21
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:18.360
type for couples,
they can even personalize each side of the mattress there.

22
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:22.860
Customer service is phenomenal.
My assistant,
my researcher,

23
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:27.000
I had them all test helix and the customer service is really outstanding.

24
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.510
The mattress arrives within a week and the shipping is completely free.

25
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.560
You can try the mattress then for a hundred nights and if you're not happy,

26
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.410
they'll pick it up and offer a full refund.

<v 2>Good evening.</v>

53
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.590
This is Jocko Willink and I am standing in as the host for the Tim Ferriss show

54
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.600
and I'm doing some talking because right now Mr Tim Ferriss can't talk to you

55
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:33.571
himself because he is in a a silent retreat where he's remaining in complete

56
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:40.741
silence for I think 10 days and it's not just silence,

57
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:46.270
it's actually also no books,
no computers,
no phones.

58
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.500
Obviously it's just pure silence alone with your thoughts.

59
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.180
Not exactly,
but what I would want to do,

60
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.860
but it sounds kind of crazy and it sounds like something Tim Ferris would do,

61
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.250
but in the meantime,
like I said,

62
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.330
I'm here to guest host this show,
which is awesome.

63
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.600
I appreciate that opportunity and thanks to Tim Ferris for giving me that

64
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:18.040
opportunity.
Now,
a little bit about my background.
First,

65
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:19.630
if you want to know about me,

66
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.100
one of the best places to find out about me is actually on this podcast as well.

67
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.510
Tim Ferriss,

68
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.510
episode number 107 and that was released in September of 2015 and that was the

69
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:37.510
first time I was ever interviewed really for anything.

70
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.640
And I had been in the seal teams for 20 years.
I'd never done any interview,

71
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:46.000
I'd never had any social media,
didn't have a website.

72
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.970
I really didn't exist in the public eye at all.

73
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.230
And so my background is that I grew up in a small new England town.

74
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.680
I enlisted in the navy after high school.
I went through boot camp,

75
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:00.790
I went to seal training,

76
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.120
I spent some time at seal team one in the 90s and eventually got picked up for a

77
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:08.110
commissioning program,

78
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:11.320
which meant I was going to become an officer in the seal teams and move into a

79
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:15.400
leadership position.
And eventually once I did that,

80
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.540
the war started in September,

81
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.000
September 11th,

82
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.530
2001 and from there I deployed to Iraq as a seal platoon commander.

83
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.300
And then as a seal task unit commander when I was a task unit commander,

84
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.370
I fought in the battle of Ramadi,
Ramadi,
Iraq,

85
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:37.900
the capital of Al Anbar province,

86
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:42.901
and very tough fighting in incredible effort by the soldiers and Marines on the

87
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:45.040
ground.

88
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.040
And also the guys that were with me as well from my seal task unit and ended up

89
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:56.410
being the most highly decorated special operations unit from the Iraq war.

90
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.110
And incredible sacrifices were made for that victory.

91
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.120
And when I got back from that deployment to Iraq,

92
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.600
I took over the training for the west coast seal teams and the training that I

93
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:13.820
took over as the training where you've got the boat on your head or you're

94
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:18.821
carrying the logs around or you're doing a bunch of pushups and pull ups and

95
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:20.300
runs and swims.
It's the,

96
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:25.301
the real training we're seals actually learn to be seals to shoot,

97
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:30.140
move and communicate to fire,
maneuver to close with and destroy the enemy.

98
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.820
And they learn about combat leadership.

99
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.000
And I did that for my last few years in the seal teams,

100
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:40.001
taught that and then I retired in 2010 and when I did that I started working

101
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:47.021
with companies with businesses and helping out with their leadership and their

102
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:50.780
management and that developed into a leadership and management consulting

103
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:51.350
company,

104
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.350
which is called echelon front that I run with my buddy and former teammate Leif

105
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.210
Babin who was one of the platoon commanders that worked for me in the battle of

106
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:05.720
Ramadi.
And we wrote a book together which was called extreme ownership.

107
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:10.430
And that is how I ended up being on Tim's podcast for the first time.

108
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:12.470
We had some mutual friends,

109
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.890
Kirk Parsley and doctor Peter Attia and they made the intro and that's how I

110
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:20.270
ended up on this podcast the first time in that book,

111
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:22.490
extreme ownership is a book about leadership,

112
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.720
really it's combat leadership lessons learned and tested on the battlefield that

113
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:33.050
that we then talked to the next generation of seals and now we're out there

114
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:38.051
teaching these leadership principles to businesses and teams and organizations

115
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.540
throughout the civilian world.
And also in law enforcement,

116
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.650
in fire departments,
in any type of organization.

117
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.550
So that's what we're doing now.
And as that book was launching,
like I said,

118
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:56.450
I went on Tim's podcast.
It was awesome.
And when we got done with that podcast,

119
00:07:56.451 --> 00:08:00.860
when Tim Press Stop on the recorder,
he said,

120
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:04.730
you should really have your own podcast.
And I kind of like,
you know,

121
00:08:04.731 --> 00:08:07.970
I listened to him but I had a bunch of stuff going on in the book was coming out

122
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:08.804
and whatnot.

123
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.970
And then Joe Rogan heard that podcast and asked me to come on his podcast.

124
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:16.970
And in the middle of that podcast,
Joe Rogan said,

125
00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:18.200
you should have your own podcast.

126
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.730
So I guess when Tim Ferriss and Joe Rogan tell you,

127
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.170
you should have your own podcast,
then you should listen.
And I did.

128
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.020
And so I started my own podcast,
which is called Jocko podcast.

129
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:35.021
And really it's a podcast about human nature and it's human nature as viewed

130
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.200
through the lens of war and other human struggles and is definitely focused on

131
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:46.634
leadership.

132
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
But it also often reveals the dark side of mankind.

133
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:59.520
And the podcast can get pretty heavy and pretty dark,

134
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.950
but it's not all like that.
And I also know as we did the podcast,

135
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:06.360
as I continue to put it out there,

136
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.770
I also talked about all kinds of other things about life and in how I live about

137
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:15.771
surfing and about Jujitsu and about working out and about eating in how I eat

138
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:20.370
and sleeping and how I sleep and how to wake up earlier and how to overcome

139
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:24.810
procrastination and how to accomplish goals and how to get the most out of life

140
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:29.760
and all those kinds of things.
Your basic winning.
And in there I,

141
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.970
I wrote a book for kids and a book that I wrote for kids is called the way of

142
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:36.210
the warrior kid
and it's,
you know,

143
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:39.470
it's about a kid that's having a tough time at school.
He didn't know how to,

144
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.210
couldn't do any pull ups and he didn't know his times tables,

145
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:46.050
so he kind of felt stupid and he didn't know how to swim because he was afraid

146
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:50.190
of the water and he was getting picked on at school.
And the last day of school,

147
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:55.191
everything kind of comes crashing down on him and he goes home all sad.

148
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.660
But when he gets home he remembers that his uncle is coming to stay with him for

149
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:03.840
the summer and his uncle was a seal in the seal teams.

150
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.710
And so his uncle finds out what these problems are that the kid is suffering

151
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.290
through and says,
look,
oh you can't,
you can't swim.

152
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.240
You don't know how to do any pull ups or you can't do any pull ups.

153
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:17.220
You don't know your times tables,
you're getting picked on at school.

154
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:22.350
We can handle those problems.
So they go on a little journey and the uncle,

155
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.610
Uncle Jake teaches young mark how to overcome all these challenges.

156
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.380
And so that book came out,

157
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.710
but people were asking for sort of details on the aspect of my life about,

158
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.590
you know,
not about the leadership stuff,

159
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:41.640
but about my sort of kind of operating system.

160
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.740
And so eventually I put that down,

161
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.940
kind of my mode of living into the way I live.

162
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And this book is called discipline equals freedom of field manual.

163
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.240
And it just came out October 17th and that's how I ended up doing this podcast

164
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:01.020
for Tim because like I said,
Tim is,

165
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.220
I guess fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you're looking at it.

166
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.810
Tim is not allowed to talk right now and so he,

167
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:14.811
but he had read the book just before he went into his period of silence and he

168
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:20.220
wanted me to come on while he was not able to speak and talk about some of the

169
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.450
high points that Mike,
he,

170
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.200
that he thought would be a useful introduction to people that listen to his

171
00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:31.710
podcast.
So that's why I'm here.

172
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.500
If you were expecting Tim,
I apologize.

173
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.910
I know that's always a bummer when you're expecting to have that person that
you,

174
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.240
you know,
and you're,

175
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.100
you're anticipating hearing their voice and then it turns out not to be that

176
00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:46.560
person.
So if you've made it this far,
thank you.

177
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.170
And here we go.
The book is broken into two sections.

178
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.033
The sections,

179
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:58.140
first section is called faults and the second section is called actions.

180
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.960
And the faults section is about,

181
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.410
well basically it's what goes through my head.

182
00:12:06.411 --> 00:12:11.411
It's how I view and how I think about things and Tim wanted me to focus on the

183
00:12:14.661 --> 00:12:15.650
actions part,

184
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.830
but for one example of what is in the thoughts category.

185
00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:23.720
I'm going to the book here.

186
00:12:23.721 --> 00:12:27.860
This is directly from the book discipline equals freedom field manual.

187
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.720
Here we go.
People want to know how to stop laziness.

188
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:38.510
They want to know how to stop procrastination.
They have an idea in their head,

189
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.240
maybe even a vision,
but they don't know where to start.

190
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.720
So they ask and they say,
where do I start?

191
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.240
When is the best time to start?

192
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:55.650
And I have a simple answer here and now that's it.

193
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.890
You want to improve.
You want to get better.

194
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.980
You want to get on a workout program or a clean diet or start a new business.

195
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:10.060
You want to write a book or make a movie or build a house or a computer or an

196
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:14.500
APP.
Where do you start?
You start right here.

197
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.850
When do you start?
You start right now.

198
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.460
You initiate action.
You Go,

199
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.730
here is the reality.
That idea isn't going to execute itself.

200
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.290
That book isn't going to write itself.
Those weights out in the gym,

201
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.020
they aren't going to move themselves.

202
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:40.210
You have to do it and you have to do it now.

203
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.050
So stop thinking about it,
stop dreaming about it,

204
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.140
stop researching every aspect of it and reading all about it and debating the

205
00:13:49.271 --> 00:13:52.420
pros and cons of it.
Start doing it.

206
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.250
<v 0>Okay,</v>

207
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.400
<v 2>take that first step and make it happen.</v>

208
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.140
Get after it here and now.

209
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.310
So that's the kind of things that are in the book.

210
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.600
The first part of the book,

211
00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:15.860
which again is called thoughts and like I said,

212
00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:20.861
the second part is what I actually do to implement those thoughts into my life.

213
00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:26.051
And of course Tim being Mr Pragmatic,

214
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.820
like how do we get to it,
how do we make it happen?

215
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.830
He asked me to detail some of those for you and one of the things that he wanted

216
00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:38.831
me to talk about was early morning training and what role getting up early

217
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.930
because I get up early in the morning,

218
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:48.010
what role that plays in my life and why I kind of maintained that and have

219
00:14:48.291 --> 00:14:50.090
maintained that for a long time.

220
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.780
And there's one section that talks about kind of a,

221
00:14:54.781 --> 00:14:59.781
a little psychological edge that I believe the waking up early in the morning

222
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.770
gives anyone that wakes up early in the morning.

223
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:09.310
So here's a little chunk of the book where I talk about that psychological edge.

224
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.673
<v 3>Okay.</v>

225
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:17.620
<v 2>There are a slew of psychological advantages that come from early morning</v>

226
00:15:17.621 --> 00:15:19.990
physical training.
First,

227
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.760
there is a psychological when over the enemy.

228
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:30.130
Knowing that you are working harder than your adversaries gives you an
advantage.

229
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.150
It gives you confidence that you can overcome them and battle.

230
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.560
Another advantage to waking up early and working out hard is that it demands

231
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:42.350
discipline to do both.
Now,

232
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:46.100
some scientists have claimed that discipline dissipates.

233
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:47.420
The more it is used,

234
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:52.570
that willpower is a finite resource that is reduced every time it is used

235
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:56.030
throughout the day.
This is wrong.

236
00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.870
That does not happen to the contrary.

237
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:05.470
I believe and studies have shown that discipline and willpower do not go down as

238
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:09.380
they're called into action,
they actually get stronger.

239
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.880
This is obvious if you actually try the experiment yourself before you go to

240
00:16:16.551 --> 00:16:20.570
bed.
Plan,
what workout you're going to do in the morning stage,

241
00:16:20.571 --> 00:16:24.170
your workout clothes so you don't even have to think about them when you get up.

242
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.880
Write down a list of things you need to accomplish the next day.

243
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.260
Set your alarm clock for 4:30 AM and go to sleep

244
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.910
when the alarm clock goes off,
get up,

245
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.480
put on your pre-staged clothes,

246
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.140
brush your teeth and go get your workout on hard.

247
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.630
Get done,
shower,

248
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.700
get dressed and begin to crush the lists of tasks you made for the day.

249
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.990
When it was time for breakfast,
see what happens.

250
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.900
You won't want to eat junk.
You won't want that disgusting donut.

251
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.030
You will want some eggs and bacon and that will happen a lunch too.

252
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.940
You're feeling good,
energized.

253
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.590
You don't want to eat that worthless calories of pizza or French fries.

254
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:21.080
You want fuel,
good fuel to rebuild your body.

255
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.080
Clean fuel that keeps your mind sharp.

256
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:29.240
When you're on the path,
you want to stay on the path.

257
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.360
Unfortunately,
the opposite is also true.
Once you step off the path,

258
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:40.220
you tend to stray far.
When you don't prepare what you need to do.

259
00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:44.510
The next day when you sleep in and skip your workout and you don't start

260
00:17:44.511 --> 00:17:48.290
attacking the tasks that you have because you didn't write them down the night

261
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.730
before.
That is when you make bad decisions.

262
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.960
That is when your will and discipline fail.

263
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.040
You figure you might as well have that donut,

264
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.580
have that doughnut for breakfast and once you've done that,

265
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.540
might as well put down four or five pieces of pizza for lunch.

266
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.350
It doesn't matter anymore.

267
00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:13.040
You're off the path and that is a disaster.

268
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:19.020
Do your will didn't break.
It never showed up in the first place.

269
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:25.380
So get on the path of discipline and stay on the path.

270
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.620
Discipline be gets disciplined,

271
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:34.220
will propagates more will hold the line across the line and victory will be

272
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:42.330
yours.
So

273
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:48.830
that's why I wake up early in the morning and workout.

274
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.260
And also in the book I talk about how you actually start getting up early in the

275
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.430
morning because this is a big challenge for a lot of people.

276
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:04.550
I know I get it and there's a bunch of ways to do this and one of the most

277
00:19:06.121 --> 00:19:10.230
important things to allow you to get up early in the morning is to go to bed

278
00:19:10.231 --> 00:19:13.830
earlier.
But going to bed earlier is also a challenge.
And again,

279
00:19:13.831 --> 00:19:16.020
I talk about this in the book,
but how do you,
how,

280
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:17.530
what's the most important thing to,

281
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.700
to put into place to go to bed earlier is number one,

282
00:19:24.181 --> 00:19:28.200
you want to be tired when you get to the end of the day,
you want to be tired.

283
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:30.750
That's how you get to go to bed earlier.
Number two,

284
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.730
turn off the Internet because they've got these little people that are

285
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:40.731
programming things into the interwebs that are truly just meant to get you to

286
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:45.420
click.
One more time.

287
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.870
Just click one more time and watch one more.

288
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.300
One more video,

289
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.800
one more stupid video that's not getting you anything,

290
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.900
not improving you in any way.
So turn off the Internet.
And if you,

291
00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:03.570
if you need to do something than read a book,
pick up a book and read a book

292
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:10.240
and the most important thing to allow you to go to bed earlier,

293
00:20:10.241 --> 00:20:14.530
the most important thing you can do is actually get up earlier,

294
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.910
right?
That's what happens you when you get up earlier,

295
00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.750
well then you're more tired by the end of the day and then you can go to sleep

296
00:20:22.751 --> 00:20:27.160
and that that gets you in the right pattern.
So the way you start getting,

297
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.720
the way you start going to bed earlier is by getting up earlier.
And again,

298
00:20:31.721 --> 00:20:36.721
I detailed this and the way that pattern kind of unfolds itself in the book.

299
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:44.910
Now another thing that Tim wanted me to hit on was my actual workouts,

300
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.910
like what my workouts look like from week to week.

301
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.040
And I'll say this,
I have a bunch of,

302
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.850
a bunch of kind of standard workouts that I use and they may vary a little bit

303
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:07.300
depending on what I'm feeling like or what is needed.

304
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.930
Or maybe I've got some little injury that I have to cover up or,

305
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.140
or maybe I'm really tired from some other workout that I did,

306
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:17.100
so I need to make an adjustment or maybe I haven't worked out in a few days so

307
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.660
we need to go even harder.
So there's little adjustments that go by and,

308
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.250
and I actually took a lot of these standard workouts that I have and I put them

309
00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:28.270
in the book.
Again,
this is something that people really wanted to hear from me,

310
00:21:28.271 --> 00:21:30.340
what my workouts actually were.

311
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.640
And so I put them in there and,

312
00:21:33.641 --> 00:21:36.960
and they go from the beginner level from,

313
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.410
from people that really haven't worked out before,
all the way to intermediate,

314
00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:44.110
all the way up to advanced.
And I've been able to,

315
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:48.010
I actually own a gym in California,

316
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.300
a big mixed martial arts gym,
but we've got all kinds of,
you know,

317
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:54.460
we've got Olympic lifting,
we've got,
we've got everything in there.

318
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.390
And so I've seen people and train people at all levels from do you know,

319
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.480
total non athlete that haven't done anything active in years all the way to the

320
00:22:03.671 --> 00:22:07.270
highest level athletes that are fighting professionally in the UFC.

321
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:10.660
So I've seen and brought people through those different,

322
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.990
those different categories over,

323
00:22:13.991 --> 00:22:18.990
over the past 10 years that I've been training civilians.
So,
uh,

324
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.480
that's,
that's what this book contains,
is what those are like.

325
00:22:22.481 --> 00:22:27.481
Now I also go after different goals because you want to be chasing something.

326
00:22:28.901 --> 00:22:30.580
I,
at least I do.
I want to be chasing something.

327
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:32.740
I want to be trying to achieve something,

328
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.120
but I don't just continually chase the same thing.

329
00:22:37.121 --> 00:22:39.100
So sometimes I'll be trying to,
you know,

330
00:22:39.101 --> 00:22:41.650
maybe I'll spend a month trying to increase my dead lift and get,

331
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:43.180
get my dead lift up up there.

332
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.020
And then sometimes I'll be just trying to run and get my,

333
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.650
my three mile time grown or my four mile time run down.

334
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.560
Or sometimes I'm trying to Max out and pull ups and see how many pull ups I can

335
00:22:53.561 --> 00:22:54.394
get.

336
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.110
And so I'm kind of always chasing some goal of some kind.

337
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.740
And I never go too far in one direction because I think that that would not suit

338
00:23:07.691 --> 00:23:09.250
me for the way I live.
For instance,

339
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:12.400
if I was just trying to get a massive deadlift,
which is awesome,

340
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.380
but if that's my sole purpose is to get a massive dead lift,

341
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:21.550
well then I'm going to be as big and strong as possible.

342
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.130
But that's obviously going to hurt my mobility.

343
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:29.230
It's going to hurt like my cardio.
And so I get to a point where,

344
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:29.531
you know,

345
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:34.531
I'm maybe some percentage of my percent of my capability and then once I get to

346
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:38.291
that percentage and,

347
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:41.740
and I get to that point where I'm really going to have to change my lifestyle in

348
00:23:41.741 --> 00:23:45.650
order to increase beyond that.
That's when I say,
okay,
you know what,
I've,

349
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.900
this is one of my dead lift is out right now.

350
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.910
Let's start looking at how many pull ups I can do or let's,

351
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.710
let's start seeing one other exercise I can move on to and find some other

352
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:59.300
challenge.
So that's sorta what my,
my workouts are like.

353
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:00.620
I'm always chasing something.

354
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:05.680
The other thing with this is people get really fanatical about working out in,

355
00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:08.030
in they get into the,

356
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:12.130
where their workout becomes a form of religion.
And,

357
00:24:12.131 --> 00:24:15.710
and that's one of the reasons that I never really talk specifically about what I

358
00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:18.320
do for my workouts because,
um,

359
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.250
don't really like to preach about,
you know,

360
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:26.060
you should do this or you should do that.
So I'm,
but people are interested.

361
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.430
So that's,
that's why I put it out there and it is,
you know,

362
00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:29.930
the kind of training that I do at depth.

363
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:34.400
It definitely has been effective for me over the years in my various jobs.
So,

364
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.680
but I'm not a person that says,
Hey,
my way is better than everyone else's way.

365
00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:42.020
I'm not one of those people.
I'm not saying that at all.

366
00:24:42.021 --> 00:24:44.930
Actually there's people that know more than me and there's people that have the

367
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:49.250
better methodologies are different methodologies that work well for their system

368
00:24:49.251 --> 00:24:52.360
and that's cool.
That's cool.
If you,

369
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.770
if you want to text you or whatever,

370
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.720
put on social media 8,000 times that you have something better.
That's awesome.

371
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.610
I appreciate your,

372
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:06.630
your input but I've been doing what I'm doing done for a long time and it's not

373
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:10.400
a religion to me it's just a cool way of working out.

374
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.520
So my workouts are are kind of split into some broad movements.

375
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.930
The broad movement movements are pull,
push,

376
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.080
lift and squat and how those breakout pole is basically centered around pull ups

377
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.540
and in seal training you do a lot of pull ups and pull ups.

378
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.450
Are obviously important because you've got to be able to pull yourself up,

379
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:38.570
climb ladders,
all those things and so,

380
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.810
and it's also good to know that you can move your body weight around.

381
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:47.410
So pull ups are a huge part of my workouts and pull ups is what the pull day is

382
00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:51.200
centered on that and do all different kinds of pullups,

383
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:56.230
close grip and narrow grip and wide grip and ring pull ups and and climbing

384
00:25:57.051 --> 00:26:00.990
ropes and and obviously pull ups on the pull up bar.
And so,

385
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.540
so that's what the poll day is,

386
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:07.520
is based on the push day is again it goes back,

387
00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:09.410
it's rooted in seal training,

388
00:26:09.411 --> 00:26:13.490
which is the push day is basically centered around pushups and dips.

389
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.200
And so again all the different kinds of pushups and all the different kinds of

390
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:22.190
dips,
ring dips,
bar dips,
pushups,
close grip,
push ups,
wide grip,
push ups,

391
00:26:22.191 --> 00:26:25.310
dive bomber pushups,
all of these different types of pushups that you can do.

392
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.370
That's what that push day is centered on.

393
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.180
The lift day is,

394
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:36.050
for lack of a better way to explain this to the lift day for me is primarily

395
00:26:36.051 --> 00:26:40.110
about getting things off the ground and over my head.
So,

396
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:44.850
so that means dead lifts,
it means cleans,
it means clean and jerk.

397
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:48.330
He means press,
it means snatches,

398
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.320
it means handstand pushups,
those kinds of exercises.

399
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.850
That's what the lift the day is to me.
And then finally squat,

400
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.790
which could also be called leg day,

401
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:05.150
but that obviously focuses on all different kinds of squatting for back squats

402
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:11.040
and front squat and overhead squat and all the other types of variations of

403
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:11.910
squats that there are.

404
00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:16.911
But also it's not just squatting cause I'll do plyometrics and sprinting and

405
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.980
calisthenics that are leg focused.

406
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:25.140
So those are the kind of the four categories,
pull,
push,
lift and squat.

407
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:27.810
And then on top of those I do gut,

408
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.830
which I guess it's what normal people kind of call core or abs,

409
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.870
but
I just have always called a gut.
Again,

410
00:27:39.871 --> 00:27:41.070
that's rooted in the seal teams.

411
00:27:41.071 --> 00:27:45.870
They would when I was a new guy in 1990 whatever,

412
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.970
they'd say,
we're going to do some gut work.

413
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.610
And what that meant was you were going to work out your abs,

414
00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:53.460
you're going to do sit ups,
you're going to do Russian twist,

415
00:27:53.461 --> 00:27:58.080
you're gonna do all flutter kicks,
all those things.
And,
and then on top of that,

416
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:04.240
I do metabolic conditioning and,

417
00:28:04.241 --> 00:28:05.730
and the way I do metabolic conditioning,

418
00:28:05.731 --> 00:28:08.310
which is basically that means you're going to be breathing hard,

419
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.380
really hard for either of short,

420
00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:12.840
intense amount of time or maybe a little bit longer.

421
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.640
But that's,
that's what I definitely do metabolic conditioning.

422
00:28:17.641 --> 00:28:20.850
And the reason I do metabolic conditioning is still that I'm in good shape so I

423
00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:25.851
can sustain a high output for short bursts and multiple short burst and over

424
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:27.930
longer periods of time.

425
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.220
And I'm mixed that in sometimes with the workout itself.

426
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.300
And sometimes I do it before the workout,
sometimes I do it after the workout.

427
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.120
And I mean if you,

428
00:28:39.121 --> 00:28:43.890
if you talk about what my workouts consist of as far as time goes,

429
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:49.140
my workouts just depend on what's going on in my world.
In that day,

430
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:54.390
some of my workouts are very quick and I can get them done in less than 10

431
00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:58.800
minutes and they make you want to throw up.
And at the same time,

432
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.310
some of them,
sometimes I'm working out for three hours,
you know,

433
00:29:02.311 --> 00:29:05.810
maybe doing singles and doubles and triples on,

434
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:10.770
on weights for heavy exercises.
So,
and it depends.

435
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.700
It depends on what I'm doing,
what my current goal is,
how I set those up.

436
00:29:14.701 --> 00:29:16.770
And it also depends on what life is throwing at me.

437
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.840
Obviously all out on the road somewhere,

438
00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:23.841
you can't always do heavy squats because your hotel gym only has two 35 pound

439
00:29:26.251 --> 00:29:31.230
dumbbells,
which really puts the heavy squats out of the picture.

440
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.650
So you gotta be able to adapt and make something else happen.

441
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:40.370
So Tim asked that I talk about what an actual series of workouts from me would

442
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:47.800
look like.
And so like I said in the book,

443
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:51.040
I actually put they'll workouts in the book.

444
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:56.380
And so I'll kind of read through some of these workouts a few days.

445
00:29:56.381 --> 00:30:00.100
So you get the feel for,
for what it is.
And these are,

446
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:04.860
I went right to the advanced workouts.
Again,
there's beginner,
intermediate,

447
00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.630
advanced.
Maybe I'll talk a little bit about some of the beginner ones too,

448
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.230
but there is a place to start.
If you can't do anything,

449
00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.740
you can still get started,
but the advanced,
here's a,

450
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:19.630
here's an example of what I would do on a pole day for,

451
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.010
for an advanced workout.
So here we go.

452
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:30.100
The primary work is going to be 30 muscle ups and a muscle up is on rings.

453
00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.260
You can do them on a bar too.
I do.
I'm usually on rings.

454
00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:36.370
I'm muscle up is where you hold on two rings or a Bar,
like,

455
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.530
like you're going to do a pull up,
you do a pull up,

456
00:30:38.531 --> 00:30:43.531
but you pull yourself all the way up and then press through until you've done a

457
00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:49.051
dip and now you're in the dip position either on top of the bar or on above the

458
00:30:49.541 --> 00:30:54.190
rings.
So it's called a muscle up.
If you can't understand my description,

459
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.550
then you can go to youtube and look up muscle up and you'll see him.

460
00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:02.760
So 30 muscle ups and then a hundred dead hang pull ups and then a hundred

461
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:08.050
kipping pull ups and I'll do all those four time as fast as I can.

462
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.490
And then when I get done with those,
I'll do some hang cleans,

463
00:31:12.491 --> 00:31:16.030
which again this is a place where you want might want to go to youtube and check

464
00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:20.110
out what a hang clean is.
Youtube is an incredible instrument and tool for,

465
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.540
for trying to learn.
That being said,

466
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.030
when you go and you look at the youtube video,

467
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.820
what you think you're doing is not what you probably are doing.

468
00:31:30.821 --> 00:31:33.640
And that's why getting a coach to help you as very important.

469
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:38.440
I remember one time I was coaching a guy in boxing and inboxing you,

470
00:31:38.441 --> 00:31:40.450
you're supposed to move your head from side to side.

471
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:43.960
There's certain movements that your head is supposed to have.
And I was,

472
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:47.260
I was watching him do it and he said,
hey,
you know,
how's my head movement look?

473
00:31:47.261 --> 00:31:49.360
And I hadn't trained him in awhile.
He said,
he said,

474
00:31:49.361 --> 00:31:53.300
how's my head movement looking at him looking?
And I said,
well,
go ahead and,

475
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.930
and let me see it.
And so he started doing it and his,
it was,

476
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.440
it was hilarious because his head was staying absolutely still,

477
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.260
but his shoulders were low.
He would lift his left shoulder,

478
00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.220
then lift his right shoulder,

479
00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:05.050
then lift his left shoulder than lift his right shoulder.

480
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.980
But his head was staying still.
And I said,
okay,
it's okay.

481
00:32:08.981 --> 00:32:11.950
Just come here and look in the mirror.
Because when you shadow box,

482
00:32:11.951 --> 00:32:14.950
you use a mirror.
And he looked in the mirror and he saw what was happening.

483
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.400
And in his mind,
his head was moving back and forth from left to right.

484
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.760
But in reality,
the only thing that was moving was his shoulders lifting up.

485
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.640
So you have to be very careful when you're,

486
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:28.590
when you're lifting weights that you,
you,

487
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.870
you truly are doing what you think you're doing in.

488
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.020
The easiest way to do that is to have a coach coming to watch you do your

489
00:32:35.021 --> 00:32:39.800
movements.
So for instance,
the hang clean is a,

490
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:40.280
is a,

491
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.280
is a movement that I would do next in this workout and I would just do probably

492
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:51.620
six sets,
six sets of between three to six repetitions.
And again,

493
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:56.140
I'm just trying to maintain good form and then get done without.

494
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.410
So I've done 30 muscle ups,

495
00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.050
I've done a hundred dead hang pull ups in a dead hang,
pull up.

496
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:01.420
If you don't know what that is,
that's where you,

497
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.450
you don't use any motion of your body,
you're using pure strength.

498
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.070
And then I do 100 kipping bulbs.
Oh.

499
00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:11.750
And before everyone thinks I'm lying or a or whatever,

500
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.270
I can't do a hundred dead hang pull ups in a row.

501
00:33:14.271 --> 00:33:15.710
I can't do 30 muscle ups in a row.

502
00:33:15.711 --> 00:33:18.650
I can't do a hundred kipping pull ups in a row.
I,
I'm what I'm,

503
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.880
when I talk about doing these,

504
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.560
I talk about doing as many as I can and then I have to stop and shake it out and

505
00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:25.760
then I jump up and do some more.

506
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.650
So maybe for my hundred dead hang pullups maybe my first set,

507
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.330
I only get 14 dead.
Hang,
pull ups,
I drop off the bar,
I shake it out,

508
00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:40.390
I jump up there and I do another 10 so now I'm at 24 and then I can't do it

509
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:41.990
anymore.
So I dropped off the bar.

510
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:44.760
Maybe I get another set of 10 then I'm at 34 and so that's what I'm gonna do

511
00:33:44.761 --> 00:33:48.500
until I get to a hundred when I get to a hundred dead hang pullups and now it's

512
00:33:48.501 --> 00:33:50.570
time for me to do kipping pull ups.
Then I'll do the same thing.

513
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.330
Maybe the first set I do 40 kipping pull ups.

514
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.360
Once I've done 40 I shake off the bar,
our jump off the bar,

515
00:33:56.361 --> 00:33:58.850
shake it out a little bit,
I'll jump up back on the bar.

516
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:03.110
And now I do 20 so I'm up to 60 and now I drop off the bar.
I'd do it again.

517
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:04.910
I got up to 80 so,
so that's what I'm talking about.

518
00:34:04.911 --> 00:34:08.840
You're going to break up these sets until you can get the number that you're

519
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:13.670
aiming for.
So then after I'd done 30 muscle ups,

520
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.980
a hundred dead hang pullups,
a hundred kipping pull ups.

521
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:21.070
Then I jump into doing some six sets of hang cleans with a weight that allows

522
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:26.870
you to do three to six repetitions per cent while you're still maintaining good

523
00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:29.060
form.
And it's,
again,
it's critical to maintain good forms.

524
00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.720
And then I would do five sets of reverse curls followed by regular curls.

525
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:39.410
Now
I used to,

526
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.980
I went through the stage of saying all curls,
you know,
those are,

527
00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:45.530
those are just the exercise for looking good.

528
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:49.610
And I was kind of derogatory on doing curls,

529
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.260
but I changed my mind,

530
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:55.670
I would say a few years ago I changed my mind because,

531
00:34:56.090 --> 00:35:00.830
well I hurt my bicep and when I hurt my bicep,
I said to myself,
well,

532
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.530
maybe my bicep isn't as strong as it should be.

533
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:06.320
And the tendons going into it maybe aren't as strong as they should be.

534
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:11.570
And so maybe I should do a little bit of isolation training on those muscles to

535
00:35:11.571 --> 00:35:13.820
make them stronger.
And so that's what I started doing it.
And it's,

536
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.440
it's worked out well.
My,
my bicep healed and it's hasn't been injured since then.

537
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.660
So.
So that's an exercise that even though people might think,
oh,
curls,

538
00:35:23.661 --> 00:35:26.990
that's a bodybuilding exercise,
why would I do that?

539
00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:29.060
I don't care about looking good,
I just want to be strong.

540
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:33.470
Well it makes you stronger too.
So that's,
that's the curls.

541
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.010
Then from there I would do some gut work.
The,

542
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:41.250
the gut work I have listed on this particular workup is a hundred v ups,

543
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:45.540
which is when you're laying flat on your back,
arms extended above your head,

544
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.740
feet extended as far as you can,

545
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:54.770
and then you close up like a Jack Knife in a v position until you touch your

546
00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:57.570
toes to your fingers.
And then you lay back down,

547
00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.810
do a hundred of those and then a hundred Russian twists,

548
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.700
which is when your feet are up in the air,
your,

549
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:07.080
your torso is up in the air and you're bringing your hands back and forth from

550
00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:09.480
side to side.
Get done with that.

551
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.890
And then I would do a little metcon work.
So metabolic conditioning.

552
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:19.190
And for this one here I have listed do four sets of cleans and pull ups with the

553
00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:25.350
following repetition.
So I do a set of 20 cleans,

554
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.380
followed by 20 pull ups than 15 cleans,

555
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.450
followed by 15 pull ups,

556
00:36:30.451 --> 00:36:35.451
then 10 cleans followed by 10 pull ups than five cleans followed by five bulbs.

557
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.473
And that's what I would do.

558
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:41.690
And for the cleans I'd use probably about 60% of my body weight to do cleans.

559
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.140
And there you get a little,

560
00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.470
you get a little cardio work during that you will be breathing hard,

561
00:36:46.471 --> 00:36:48.870
I promise if you give that a shot.

562
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:54.170
So there's an example of a workout that I would do and for my pole day,

563
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.800
you know,
um,
I'll talk about for let's just do one more,

564
00:37:01.801 --> 00:37:06.210
go,
go for a push day,
push day,
here's a,
another workout.

565
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.280
So for this push day,

566
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:13.110
I would be doing three minutes on and one minute rest of the following

567
00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:17.310
exercises,
ring dips,
which are dips using gymnastics,
rings,

568
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:21.570
ring pushups,
dips,
clap pushups,

569
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:26.700
deep pushups.
So I do those deep pushups in,
in parallettes,

570
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:28.100
which are something or you,

571
00:37:28.101 --> 00:37:30.660
something where you can go deeper than your normal range of motion if you're on

572
00:37:30.661 --> 00:37:33.780
the floor.
And then just regular push ups on the floor.

573
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:39.240
And so I'd set my timer for three minutes of work and followed by one minute of

574
00:37:39.241 --> 00:37:42.420
rest,
and then I'd go through the ring,
dips as many as I can in three minutes.

575
00:37:42.421 --> 00:37:45.690
Then rest of minute,
and then do the same thing for the,
the ring pushups,

576
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.110
the dips,
the clap,
push ups,
the deep pushups,
and then regular pushups.

577
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.560
And once my time is up,
and this is something I always do,

578
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:56.670
is when it gets to that last set,
the last set is kind of the easiest exercise.

579
00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:01.790
So regular pushups are easier than clap pushups and they're easier than deep

580
00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:05.640
pushups.
But I get there,
I'm always going to do a hundred at that last,

581
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:09.270
that last set.
So,
and again,

582
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.310
that doesn't mean I can do a hundred pushups in a row,

583
00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:13.350
especially after I've done all this other work.

584
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:18.350
But I will continue to take rests and break up the set until I can get to what I

585
00:38:18.451 --> 00:38:23.451
want to do until I get to that number of 100 now I get done with that and I

586
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:28.440
would do some repetitions of the snatch movement,

587
00:38:28.441 --> 00:38:31.830
the snatches a really hard movement to do.
And again,

588
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:36.100
youtube has some good visuals of what looks like to do is snatch.

589
00:38:36.101 --> 00:38:37.480
But if you're going to start snatching,

590
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:42.070
you really need to get someone to watch you and a good qualified coach that can,

591
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.890
that can watch you and make sure that you're doing these exercises right.

592
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.000
And you know,
I would do some repetitions of that just to keep,

593
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:52.960
just to build my own muscle memory and try and get better at the exercise I'm

594
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:54.850
not great at at at that exercise.

595
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.360
And then do some gut hold a plank for five minutes.

596
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.770
And then for the metcon,
for the metabolic conditioning,

597
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:08.190
I do three rounds of Max burpees in three minutes with one minute of rest

598
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:13.180
between the rounds and that right there,
that'll inflict some damage on you.

599
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.020
If you go hard,
you're actually two minutes of burpees can crush people.

600
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.590
If you go as hard as you possibly can for two minutes of burpees,
it can.

601
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.540
It can leave a mark and leave a mark.

602
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:27.550
I will tell you now for the lifting,

603
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:31.810
again,
you gotta be really careful and make sure that you're,

604
00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:36.400
your technique is absolutely critical and you gotta.

605
00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:40.360
If you sacrifice your form,
you will.
It will not make you stronger.

606
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:43.270
It will actually make you injured in,
I wrote that in the book.
That right,

607
00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:46.390
they're sacrificing proper form will not make you stronger.

608
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.190
It will only make you injured.

609
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.790
So try and find a good coach that's going to teach you these things.

610
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:57.010
And for this,
for instance,
on a lift day in this,

611
00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:01.270
in this workout that I've gotten the book,
it's you get,

612
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:06.300
I would do eight to 10 sets of clean and jerks building up to four sets that

613
00:40:07.331 --> 00:40:10.840
with a weight that allows me to do two to four repetitions.

614
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:15.040
So I'm just doing eight to 10 sets,
taking some time in between.

615
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:17.170
You said this is a day where I'm trying to get stronger,

616
00:40:17.171 --> 00:40:19.960
trying to build my strength,
trying to build my clean and jerk.

617
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.830
So it's pretty simple.
It's pretty straight,
straightforward.

618
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.020
Eight to 10 sets of clean and jerks and I'm doing,

619
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.800
I'm trying to build up to where I do four of the sets are with a pretty

620
00:40:29.801 --> 00:40:34.480
heavyweight that I can only do two,
three,
maybe four times get done with that.

621
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:39.100
I'm going to do some hanging windshield wipers for my gut,

622
00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.810
which is when you hang from a bar and you bring your legs back and forth,

623
00:40:43.811 --> 00:40:47.890
like I said,
a windshield wipers,
they're brutal by the way.
So be,
be uh,

624
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.310
be ready for that.
Sounds all sounds all easy.
They're not.

625
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.320
And then for the Metcon,

626
00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:58.900
I would do this here about 60% of body weight,
30 reps,

627
00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.650
repetitions of clean and jerks without putting the bar down.

628
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:05.560
Once you get done with that rest,
two minutes,

629
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.220
do 20 repetitions of clean and jerks with the same way.

630
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.120
Get done with that rest,
two minutes,
all those without putting the bar down.

631
00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:17.560
Then the last one you performed 10 repetitions,
so you do,

632
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.250
you get about 60% of your body weight.
You do 30 reps,

633
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.240
don't put the bar down during the 30 reps.
Once you're done with a third rupture,

634
00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:29.740
you can put the bar down,
rest for two minutes,
then pick up the bar again,

635
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.800
do 20 reps,
same weight.
When you're done with that,

636
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.550
put the bar down rest for two minutes,
two minutes is up,
do it again,

637
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:40.340
10 repetitions and then you're done.

638
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.930
That's going to get you something.

639
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:49.520
It's a tough workout I can assure you.

640
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.460
And lastly for for a squat day,

641
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:58.460
what I would do here is just going to do some,
some,

642
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.140
some squats.

643
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:04.940
I would do 50 overhead squats with about 60% body weight.
And again,

644
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:06.950
this is something you're gonna break up.
You're going to do what you can.

645
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:09.260
You get done with 50 reps of that,

646
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:13.730
you're going to do 50 front squats with about 80% of your body weight and then

647
00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:18.380
50 back squats with your body weight.
That's it.

648
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:20.030
Pretty simple.
Get done with that.

649
00:42:20.031 --> 00:42:25.031
Do some gut hundred sit ups with 20% of your body weight sitting on your chest

650
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.190
and the metcon is to run two miles.

651
00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:31.760
And I usually like to do some kind of a run when I get done squatting because it

652
00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:36.350
kind of loosens up the legs and get some of that lactic acid moved out of there.

653
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:42.110
So those are some examples of the workouts that I do.

654
00:42:42.111 --> 00:42:46.340
And then I would,
I normally just go right back into the workout.
However,

655
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:50.690
sometimes after a brutalized myself for multiple days in a row,

656
00:42:50.691 --> 00:42:52.880
I feel like crap.

657
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:56.420
And so I might take a rest day and what I do on a rest day is I'll still do

658
00:42:56.421 --> 00:42:59.270
something.
Maybe we'll just go for a jog.
Maybe we'll go for a swim,

659
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:01.190
maybe let's go in there and do some,

660
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:04.310
some burpees to warm up and then just do some good stretching.

661
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:07.280
But I don't like to take a lot of days off,

662
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000
scheduled days off because I think life brings me days off when the more often

663
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:15.283
than I need.

664
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:20.030
So whether it's your traveling or whether it's your water heater breaks or your

665
00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:24.080
car broke down or your kid got sick and you have to miss your workout.

666
00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:27.440
That's when I take my days off when I'm forced to buy life.

667
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.670
Now again,
inside this book,

668
00:43:31.671 --> 00:43:34.910
I've got beginner routines as well.
And the beginner routines,

669
00:43:34.911 --> 00:43:39.890
or actually I'll look at one right now.
Um,
for instance,

670
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.140
if for a pullup workout,
all you're going to do is eight sets of Max pull up.

671
00:43:43.141 --> 00:43:47.360
So you might only be able to do three pullups and guess what?

672
00:43:47.361 --> 00:43:50.090
You're going to do three pullups then and then you'll rest for a few minutes,

673
00:43:50.091 --> 00:43:51.620
then you'll do another three.

674
00:43:51.621 --> 00:43:54.770
Or maybe you're only doing two and then you do that eight times.

675
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.650
And if you can't do any pull ups at all,
there's an answer to that as well.

676
00:43:57.651 --> 00:44:00.740
You jump up on the bar and you hold yourself up there as long as you can and you

677
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:04.730
just do the negative work.
So,
and then you get done with that.

678
00:44:04.731 --> 00:44:08.900
You do some sit ups,
as many as you can in two minutes and then run 400 meters,

679
00:44:08.901 --> 00:44:13.490
two times.
That's,
that's a beginner workout up out inside this book.

680
00:44:13.491 --> 00:44:17.570
So I started off pretty easy and then it escalates as you get in better shape.

681
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:20.960
And by the way,
you can do that workout right there.
It's a beginner workout,

682
00:44:20.961 --> 00:44:23.360
but you can do it if you do it.
If you're advanced and you do it,

683
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:26.270
you'll still crush yourself.
Cause instead of doing three pull ups,

684
00:44:26.271 --> 00:44:30.950
your first set,
you'll be doing 58 and then you'll,

685
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:35.100
you'll be getting your workout on.
So again,

686
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:39.270
that's,
that's the way the,

687
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:42.630
the workout book or the book is set up as far as workout goes.

688
00:44:42.631 --> 00:44:45.420
I also talk a little bit about training on the road cause I spend a lot of time

689
00:44:45.421 --> 00:44:47.760
traveling with the echelon front,
our consulting company.

690
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:52.910
So I'm in hotel rooms a lot and I got some stuff in there about the kind of

691
00:44:53.341 --> 00:44:58.080
workouts that I do in hotel gyms.
You know,
sometimes I'll,

692
00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:58.921
for instance,

693
00:44:58.921 --> 00:45:01.950
throw a towel over a piece of gym equipment if they don't have a pull up bar or

694
00:45:01.951 --> 00:45:06.510
I'll go into a parking garage because just about every parking garage has some

695
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:10.650
kind of plumbing or piping up in the ceiling.

696
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.910
And so you can find a place that you can jump up and you can do some pull ups,

697
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.780
be careful,
don't,

698
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.840
don't break the plumbing and cause massive amounts of damage.

699
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.540
But you find a good pipe where you find,
uh,
an I beam that you can get,

700
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:26.970
you can get ahold of and you'd go there and you do some followups.

701
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:31.470
So there's that of the,
I spend many times doing dips between treadmills.

702
00:45:31.471 --> 00:45:35.850
I don't really like treadmills if I'm going to run them and go run.
But the,
the,

703
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.940
the treadmills have big handles on them.
So I'll,

704
00:45:38.941 --> 00:45:42.030
I'll kind of move those around the floor a little bit and get some dips on
those.

705
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:43.830
And sometimes,
in fact,

706
00:45:43.831 --> 00:45:48.831
oftentimes it's just a hotel room floor with their nasty carpets.

707
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.650
And on those nasty carpets,
I'll do burpees,
I'll do push ups,

708
00:45:52.651 --> 00:45:56.460
I'll do gut exercises,
handstand pushups,
squats,
pistols,

709
00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:57.990
which are one legged squats.

710
00:45:57.991 --> 00:46:02.490
I'll do whatever and I'll just get crazy with the calisthenics.

711
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.700
And a lot of times also when I'm on the road is I don't have a lot of time

712
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:09.210
because I'm meet with a client and then I'm speaking and then I'm going to a

713
00:46:09.211 --> 00:46:13.080
meeting.
And so my,
my work and I flew in and I got in late.

714
00:46:13.081 --> 00:46:18.000
And so lot of times I'll just be doing some kind of a quick workout to maintain

715
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:19.170
the discipline,

716
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:25.340
to maintain the discipline and to get some level of workout and to get the blood

717
00:46:25.681 --> 00:46:29.190
flowing because I think it's bad when you don't wake up and do something.

718
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:33.720
I always feel groggy for the day.
So one of my favorite quick workouts to do is,

719
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.070
is a hundred burpees for time.
One minute rest a hundred burpees for time.

720
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:39.870
Get some of that again,

721
00:46:39.871 --> 00:46:44.700
it should probably take you less than less than 20 minutes for sure.

722
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:47.140
And once you get done with that,
you'll,

723
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:51.210
you'll have the blood flowing and you'll feel better about yourself.
Again,

724
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.710
all those are in the book and yeah,
you can check them out.

725
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.520
Now another section of the book that Tim wanted me to talk about was,

726
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:02.520
I talk about martial arts in the book,

727
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:07.610
and I've been training martial arts for a long time and there's various types of

728
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:12.360
martial arts.
There's striking,
there's grappling and there's weapons.

729
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:13.740
These are the kind of the broad,

730
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:18.180
the broad martial arts categories,
right?
Striking,

731
00:47:18.181 --> 00:47:19.800
which is when you're hitting people grappling,

732
00:47:19.801 --> 00:47:22.320
which is when you're grabbing people and using weapons,

733
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:26.100
obviously there's all kinds of different weapons from knives to swords to sticks

734
00:47:26.101 --> 00:47:30.970
to firearms,
guns and it.

735
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:35.050
So I talk about those things,
but I,
I talk a lot about Jujitsu,
which,

736
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.030
which I think is the best base to have for martial arts.

737
00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:45.031
And Tim liked this part where I talked about why to start with Brazilian Jujitsu

738
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.860
and how it should be taught for self defense.

739
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:56.220
So here we're going to the book where I talk about why to start with Brazilian

740
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:59.160
Jujitsu.
Start with Brazilian Jujitsu.

741
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:04.090
It is a form of grappling that is highly advanced because for the most part the

742
00:48:04.091 --> 00:48:06.790
actual fighting takes place on the ground.

743
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.940
This is a key point because our first form of self defense is to get away yes to

744
00:48:15.071 --> 00:48:19.390
run.
If you are confronted by another person or a group of people,

745
00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:23.890
the best thing you can do is run away.
Avoid the conflict.

746
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.230
This is relatively easy.

747
00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:29.140
If someone is trying to strike you with punches or kicks,

748
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:33.700
they do not have control over you so you can simply run away from them.

749
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:35.463
You have one.

750
00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:36.960
<v 0>Okay?</v>

751
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.810
<v 2>The problem comes in a self defense situation.</v>

752
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:44.990
When someone is grabbing you now they are preventing your first line of self

753
00:48:45.531 --> 00:48:49.800
defense running away.
As soon as someone grabs you,

754
00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:54.920
you are in a grappling scenario and one of the most critical parts of Brazilian

755
00:48:55.381 --> 00:48:58.830
Jujitsu is escaping from someone's grip.
So you can run.

756
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:04.890
Oftentimes an attacker will take you to the ground in order to prevent you from

757
00:49:04.891 --> 00:49:07.740
escaping their grip.
When this happens,

758
00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:12.960
the ability to ground fight is used not to stay on the ground,

759
00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:16.650
but to get up and get away from the attacker.

760
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:22.640
The first goal of a beginner in Jujitsu is not to get the fight to the ground,

761
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.950
but to get up off the ground and get away.

762
00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:31.380
This is an important distinction from people who believe the goal of self

763
00:49:31.381 --> 00:49:35.250
defense and Jujitsu is to get the attacker to the ground.
This is not true.

764
00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.080
The goal is to get away,

765
00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:42.220
but as has been seen over and over again,

766
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:47.290
fights often end up on the ground and therefore a person must be prepared for

767
00:49:47.291 --> 00:49:48.124
it.

768
00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:52.410
Not Training in Jujitsu because you don't want to go to the ground is like not

769
00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:55.060
learning how to swim because you don't want to go in the water.

770
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:56.410
It doesn't make sense.

771
00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.970
The safest way to deal with the water is to be comfortable in it.

772
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:05.530
Just as being comfortable on the ground is the best way to deal with that

773
00:50:05.531 --> 00:50:09.040
scenario.
Should it unfold in real life.

774
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:15.440
So that's one of those things that people understandably so if,

775
00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:19.190
if they learn that,
if they think that Jujitsu,
if you get attacked,

776
00:50:19.191 --> 00:50:21.710
what you're gonna do is grab someone and pull him to the ground.
That's,

777
00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:26.210
that's not what the goal is.
The goal is to get away from people.
So,

778
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.980
uh,

779
00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:31.940
unfortunately in many fights they end up on the ground because if you start

780
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:35.270
hitting someone,
their defense might be to grab you and when they grab you,

781
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.740
now you're in a grappling scenario.

782
00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:41.450
So that is why Jujitsu is very important.

783
00:50:41.451 --> 00:50:44.900
Now there's other great martial arts and I talk about them in the book as well.

784
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:50.500
One of the things that Tim asked me about is if I was teaching a Jujitsu to a

785
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:55.400
sort of a semi athletic person,
not,
uh,
not,

786
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.850
not an Olympic decathlete,
but not a couch potato.

787
00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:03.680
We either what would the first week look like?

788
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:07.310
And the first,
the first week would be pretty straightforward.

789
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:12.370
The things I would want someone to understand or the fundamental positions of

790
00:51:12.501 --> 00:51:15.680
Jujitsu.
Jujitsu is a grappling art.
You're,

791
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.080
you're wrestling with another human being.

792
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:22.040
And there's certain positions and they have certain advantages and disadvantages

793
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:26.300
and so I would want them to understand these fundamental positions.

794
00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:28.880
One is called the mount once called the guard,

795
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.520
one's called the back ones called side control.

796
00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:36.320
One is called half guard and I would want people to understand what those

797
00:51:36.321 --> 00:51:41.270
positions were and how they related to Jujitsu.

798
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:43.850
And the next thing I would understand is this position.

799
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:46.910
I would want my student to understand this position called the mount.

800
00:51:46.911 --> 00:51:51.911
The position is a position of dominance in Jujitsu.

801
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:57.380
The person that is mounted is on the top position and they have a lot of control

802
00:51:57.381 --> 00:52:01.700
over the person that's beneath them.
And you,

803
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:04.070
if you are trapped there,
you weren't a lot of trouble.

804
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:09.110
And so one of the first things I would teach people is how to escape from that

805
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:14.230
mounted position when you're on the bottom and how to get back up to their feet.

806
00:52:14.541 --> 00:52:18.110
That's the next thing is how do you get back up to your feet effectively so that

807
00:52:18.111 --> 00:52:22.160
you can get away.
And then I would want them to learn if they are,

808
00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.680
if they are in the mounted position,

809
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.170
how would they do some kind of a submission hold?

810
00:52:27.171 --> 00:52:29.180
That's one of the best things about Jujitsu is there's something called

811
00:52:29.181 --> 00:52:34.181
submission holds in it where you can make the person tap out or you can break

812
00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:37.510
their arm or put them to sleep through a choke hold.

813
00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:41.720
So I'd want them to start to learn to understand what submissions they are

814
00:52:41.721 --> 00:52:45.290
threatened with in the mouth.
That means you need to know what the offense is

815
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:51.590
and then I would want them to understand how,
how this other position,

816
00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:56.000
which is called the guard and the guard is where you're on the bottom position.

817
00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:59.930
So someone has taken you to the ground and you're on the bottom and they're on

818
00:52:59.931 --> 00:53:01.100
top of you with their weight,

819
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:06.400
but you've managed to get your legs around their body so you have some control

820
00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:09.670
over their body weight.
And then once I,

821
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.770
they understand how important that position is,

822
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:17.750
then I would say teach them some submissions and some sweeps,

823
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.190
which is when you change position you,
you put the person on,

824
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.910
you put your opponent on the bottom,
you were on the bottom and then you,

825
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.070
you sweep them and you put them on the bottom.

826
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:27.870
And the whole time that I'm teaching these things,

827
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.160
I think it's very important in Jujitsu that you actually spar with other people

828
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.580
because people need to believe that Jujitsu works.

829
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:39.150
And one of the best ways to convince people that judges who works is to actually

830
00:53:39.151 --> 00:53:42.930
have them participate in it and actually have them train against another person.

831
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:46.950
That's good because when you train with someone that's good,

832
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.880
that's 40 pounds lighter than you and clearly weaker than you are,

833
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:55.230
and yet they can tap you out over and over and over again.

834
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:59.460
It is a real eyeopener and it will make a believer out of just about anyone.

835
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:01.950
So it's good to roll.

836
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:05.910
Now you do have to be careful because when people first start,
they go crazy.

837
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:11.460
Their ego gets out of control and everyone wants to just go 1000% against their

838
00:54:11.461 --> 00:54:12.150
opponent.

839
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:15.840
So it's usually better to pair up someone against someone that's a little bit

840
00:54:15.841 --> 00:54:18.930
better than them or maybe even quite a bit better than them so that they can

841
00:54:18.931 --> 00:54:22.620
understand how effective it is and they can understand that no matter how much

842
00:54:22.621 --> 00:54:25.290
they panic,
no match,
no matter how much they thrash around,

843
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:27.510
no matter how much they use,
all their strength.

844
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:32.490
That doesn't work in comparison to good Jujitsu technique.

845
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:38.490
So that's what it is for me.
How I would kind of have,
that's how I actually,

846
00:54:38.491 --> 00:54:41.160
I do start people in Jujitsu now.
There's something else to be said.

847
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.870
When you go to a school,

848
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:47.670
the school whenever you go does not revolve around you just showing up there.

849
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:52.080
So you may not get this basic information.

850
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:56.070
But what's cool about Jujitsu is I look at it sort of like learning a language

851
00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:59.220
and one of the best ways to learn a language is through immersion training.

852
00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:02.190
And that's what's going to happen.
You show up at many Jujitsu schools,

853
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:06.900
you are going to get immersed in something.
You don't know what anything means.

854
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.540
Just like if you showed up in a foreign country with a foreign language,

855
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:11.820
you wouldn't understand anything at first.

856
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:15.960
And then you start to recognize a word here and a word there,

857
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:18.030
and then you recognize the little sentence fragment.

858
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:20.640
And then eventually you start putting the pieces together and then you can speak

859
00:55:20.641 --> 00:55:22.590
the language.
The same thing happens in Jujitsu,

860
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:26.550
so you start recognizing a move and then you see where another move ties into it

861
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:29.340
and eventually put together a fragment of a series of moves.

862
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:32.370
And then eventually you learn the language of Jujitsu.

863
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:36.750
So it's good to get the basics of,
of all the different positions,

864
00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:39.930
and there's a million places to see those online so that you'd kind of

865
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.750
understand fundamentally what's happening in Jujitsu.

866
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:47.940
But the immersion training is very important as well.
And you get in there,

867
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:50.640
you get on the,
on the Mat,
and you start training.

868
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:54.900
Now people also always ask,
where should I train?

869
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.170
What's a good school?
And there's,

870
00:55:58.171 --> 00:56:02.700
I talk about this in the book and I'll go over some of the highlights of where,

871
00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:06.030
how to find a good Jujitsu school.
Again,
cause I get asked this all the time.

872
00:56:06.031 --> 00:56:06.310
And there's,

873
00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:09.840
luckily in America there's so many really good Jujitsu schools nowadays.

874
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.690
Jujitsu is very popular in America.

875
00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:17.940
And when I started there was very few schools in all of America and I was lucky

876
00:56:18.061 --> 00:56:20.730
to have a good school in San Diego,
California.

877
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:24.550
But that has spread now and there's really good schools all over the place.

878
00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:29.820
So number one thing I look at is actually proximity from home or work.

879
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.580
I think it's very important that wherever you're going to train as close enough

880
00:56:33.581 --> 00:56:38.581
to you that you can get there conveniently without an 87 minute transit to get

881
00:56:39.101 --> 00:56:43.240
there.
No,
if I've got a place that I want my place to be as close as I can,

882
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:46.780
I think that's one of the primary things you look at.
How close is it?

883
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.950
So it's easy to get to whether you go there after work and it's so it's close to

884
00:56:50.951 --> 00:56:54.970
work or whether you go there after when when you get home,

885
00:56:54.971 --> 00:56:56.410
because it's close to home either way.

886
00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:01.180
But having to drive 97 minutes to get to train somewhere is not going to be

887
00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:04.480
beneficial for your training.
So look for some way some where close.

888
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:07.180
The other thing is now you need to find a qualified instructor.

889
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:10.990
There's a lot of qualified instructors out there.
There's an,

890
00:57:10.991 --> 00:57:14.710
and you might have a black belt and there's a lot of outstanding black belts,

891
00:57:14.711 --> 00:57:18.250
but you might only have a brown belt or a purple belt depending on where you are

892
00:57:18.251 --> 00:57:22.750
in the world and how much did you get to is where you are.

893
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.550
And so you might only have a purple or Brown Boulton and that's actually fine.

894
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:31.990
And back in the back in the 90s there were many schools in America that were run

895
00:57:31.991 --> 00:57:34.900
by purple belts and they were very successful and taught a lot of great guys.

896
00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.410
And now there's more black belt.

897
00:57:37.411 --> 00:57:41.470
So that's more common as far as the legitimacy of the instructor.

898
00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:42.971
You can really,

899
00:57:42.971 --> 00:57:47.500
there's a lot of really good Internet police out there that keep the,

900
00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:52.750
the fakers in check.
So a quick Google,
maybe ask some people,

901
00:57:52.751 --> 00:57:57.010
check some forums and find out if the person is legit or not.
And that's,

902
00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:01.030
that's very beneficial because you definitely want a good qualified instructor.

903
00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:06.040
Now the other thing is with schools is there's two different extremes on the

904
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:06.491
schools.

905
00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:10.330
There's very traditional schools and there's very nontraditional schools.

906
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:13.990
The traditional schools are,
everyone's wearing the same uniform.

907
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.760
Every thing is done the same structured way.

908
00:58:16.761 --> 00:58:21.761
Each class the instructors are called Sensei or master or professor and,

909
00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:26.050
and that's one type of school and they're great.

910
00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.210
Some schools that are set up like that are great schools.

911
00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:32.650
There's also very non traditional schools that are very loose and everyone's

912
00:58:32.651 --> 00:58:36.070
wearing a different kind of uniform and people are kind of coming on and off the

913
00:58:36.071 --> 00:58:38.800
mat and instead of calling the instructor,

914
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:41.320
professor or master or Sensei,

915
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:46.360
they'll just call them Jocko or dean or Jeff,
you know,

916
00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:48.810
just,
it's all good.
We're all friends and we're good,

917
00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:52.570
we're training hard and there was no formalities,
there's no bowing.

918
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:55.660
There's all kinds of different schools and,
and again,

919
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:57.940
both those types of schools are,
are good and they,

920
00:58:57.941 --> 00:59:01.570
both those types of schools have absolutely produced world champions.

921
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:03.310
But it kind of depends on what you like,

922
00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:05.630
what type of personality you have and where you think you'll fit in.

923
00:59:05.631 --> 00:59:08.290
And by the way,
there's,
there's schools everywhere in between as well.

924
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.580
There's schools that are kind of in the gray area between the,

925
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:16.480
the very loose school to the very traditional school.

926
00:59:16.481 --> 00:59:17.620
There's some schools that are in the middle.

927
00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:20.950
And then you want to check that atmosphere out.
You,

928
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.280
what does that atmosphere like?

929
00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:26.870
And does the atmosphere match the goals that you have as a person?
You know,

930
00:59:26.871 --> 00:59:31.310
if you just want to learn some Jujitsu and start to train and you don't want to

931
00:59:31.311 --> 00:59:33.740
compete,
but you want to know some good self defense,
Eh,

932
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.380
that's a one type of school.
When you can find a school with that attitude,

933
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:41.650
you can also find schools that are crazy competitive and that's all they're

934
00:59:41.781 --> 00:59:45.020
focused on is sport,
Jujitsu.
And how can I win the next tournament?

935
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:49.940
And they'll have very intense training.
So,
and,
and again,
everything in between.

936
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:52.610
So you want to find a place that goes and matches your goals.

937
00:59:52.611 --> 00:59:56.870
And then I would recommend you when you go into a gym,
you try some classes,

938
00:59:56.871 --> 00:59:59.540
you see what they're like,
you meet the other students,

939
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:02.810
you ask the other students what their goals are in Jujitsu.

940
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:07.580
And I think you would,
you,
you,
you can make a good decision.

941
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:11.450
And another thing is,
I always say this,
Jujitsu is,

942
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.790
Jujitsu is not a religion.
It's,

943
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:21.230
and your instructors are not gods.
There are people that are good at Jujitsu.

944
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.480
So if you start feeling there's a cult scenario happening,

945
01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.910
just be careful that you shouldn't feel like that.

946
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:31.580
Jujitsu is fun and it's a great sport.

947
01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.760
So you shouldn't be feeling that cult scenario happening and you shouldn't be

948
01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:44.240
looking at your Jujitsu instructor as a religious deity.

949
01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.540
Um,
so that's how you pick a school.
And,

950
01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:54.500
and the book also discusses other martial arts,
boxing,
wrestling,

951
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:57.200
Moitai and like I said,
firearms training and,

952
01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.130
and what's interesting about all these different types of training and,

953
01:01:00.131 --> 01:01:02.660
and you might be thinking that I don't want,
you know,

954
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:05.450
I'm not interested in martial arts,
which is fine,

955
01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:09.500
but I will tell you that first of all,
martial arts are great to train.

956
01:01:09.501 --> 01:01:12.500
Not only are they great for self defense and you learn how to handle yourself,

957
01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:16.700
they actually also make you a better person and a lot of different ways you're

958
01:01:16.701 --> 01:01:19.160
able to handle yourself in any tough situation.

959
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:22.940
You get confident because you know you can take care of yourself and just the

960
01:01:22.941 --> 01:01:26.330
physical training,
they make you sharper,
both

961
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.220
mentally and physically sharper and,
and tougher.

962
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:34.190
And so that's,
that's why I think training,

963
01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:37.240
martial arts and Jujitsu and boxing and wrestling and,

964
01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:42.220
and firearms training and all these different martial arts type training,
they,

965
01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:44.990
they will help you,
not just in those specific arenas,

966
01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:47.960
but in everything that you're doing in your life.
And I think that's,

967
01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:51.110
I think that's really why a lot of people listened to Tim,
you know,

968
01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:51.944
myself included.

969
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:57.400
We all want to hear ways to get better in every different aspect of life and the

970
01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:05.420
one thing that I know will make you better is discipline.

971
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:10.070
The discipline to get up,
the discipline to work out every day,

972
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:15.110
the discipline to eat right and the discipline to make good financial decisions

973
01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:20.140
and make discipline choices about how you spend your time doing productive

974
01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:21.264
things.

975
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:27.500
I think that discipline is the true pathway to improvement and the like the book

976
01:02:29.851 --> 01:02:30.684
says,

977
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:35.280
discipline is ultimately the pathway to freedom.

978
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:42.600
So a bunch of stuff in the book.
I appreciate everyone listening.

979
01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:48.020
I supremely appreciate Tim for inviting me on to do this show while he's not

980
01:02:50.461 --> 01:02:52.230
allowed to talk,
I still am.

981
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.750
I appreciate that and appreciate everything that Tim does and has done to

982
01:02:57.751 --> 01:03:02.250
support me and what I'm doing and for continuing to put out all the great

983
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:08.060
content that he puts out to the world to help everyone out there learn,

984
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:12.780
implement and improve.
That's all I got.

985
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.680
Appreciate everyone listening.
Have a good one.

986
01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:18.720
Y'All out.

987
01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:24.610
<v 4>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

988
01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.610
Number one.
This is five bullet Friday.

989
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:30.820
Do you want to get a short email from me?

990
01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.020
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

991
01:03:35.021 --> 01:03:38.560
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

992
01:03:38.561 --> 01:03:42.910
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

993
01:03:42.911 --> 01:03:44.230
pondering over the week.

994
01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.230
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

995
01:03:47.231 --> 01:03:50.680
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

996
01:03:50.681 --> 01:03:54.970
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

997
01:03:55.270 --> 01:04:00.270
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

998
01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.640
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

999
01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:08.710
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1000
01:04:08.770 --> 01:04:10.960
So if you want to receive that,

This episode is brought to you by helix sleep.

1004
01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:28.630
I recently moved into a new home and when I needed beds,
where did I go?

1005
01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:32.440
I went to helix and I paid for them with my own monies.

1006
01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.750
I tried all sorts of mattresses.

1007
01:04:34.751 --> 01:04:38.560
Some of you saw me soliciting feedback and ideas on social media.

1008
01:04:38.561 --> 01:04:41.260
I tested a ton and I ended up on Helix.

1009
01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:45.280
They offer mattresses personalized to your preferences and sleeping style

1010
01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.980
without costing thousands of dollars.

1011
01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.000
It's checking out let's sleep.com forward slash Tim and you can take,

1012
01:04:52.001 --> 01:04:55.480
they're very simple,
two to three minutes sleep quiz to get started.

1013
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:59.920
That's a diagnostic and they can build your mattress from there and ensure that

1014
01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.810
it is something you will absolutely love.

1015
01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:05.140
The quiz helps determine the type of mattress that is best for you by asking all

1016
01:05:05.141 --> 01:05:07.420
