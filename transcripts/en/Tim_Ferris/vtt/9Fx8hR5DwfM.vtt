vimeo.com forward slash business Promo Code Tim,

23
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.120
this episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.

24
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.890
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way,
set it and forget it.

25
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:44.270
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

26
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:44.990
investors.

27
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.710
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

28
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:51.740
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

29
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.090
some of my very good friends,

30
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.300
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

31
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.360
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

32
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.200
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy,

33
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:05.660
but only pay pennies on the dollar for them.

34
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.380
And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

35
00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:12.110
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

36
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.270
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

37
00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:20.510
assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for

38
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:24.350
free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their

39
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:28.250
advice,
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

40
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:30.140
you can set it and forget it and here's why.

41
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.460
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

42
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:38.900
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't great investing

43
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:40.520
is a marathon,
not a sprint,

44
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.210
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax

45
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:46.370
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

46
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.840
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

47
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:54.560
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

48
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:57.170
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

49
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.870
etc. Can offer all of this low costs that were previously completely impossible

50
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.380
right off the bat,
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

51
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:10.381
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

52
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:14.740
free.
If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

53
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.870
that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.
Now,

54
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:21.490
normally when I have a sponsor on this show,

55
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:25.060
it's because I use them and recommend them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

56
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.350
I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

57
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.610
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

58
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.270
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

59
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.090
So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast,

60
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.200
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

61
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:48.040
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

62
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.190
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

63
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.670
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

64
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:58.570
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account.

65
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.570
But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

66
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.740
Take two minutes,
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash.
Tim.

67
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.460
It's fast.
It's free.
There's no downside that I can think of.
Now,

68
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:11.440
I do have to read a mandatory disclaimer.

69
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.280
Wealthfront Inc is an SEC registered investment advisor.

70
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:18.280

71
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:20.470
money.

74
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:30.310
most innovative companies coming out of Silicon Valley and they're killing it.

75
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.340
They've become massively popular.

76
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.260

and you can use that information however you want.

79
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.930
<v 2>Hello my friends,
you muscularly Oompaloompas.</v>

80
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.760
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

81
00:04:47.761 --> 00:04:52.590
My name is Tim Ferriss and my job is to deconstruct world class performers,

82
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.150
people who are the best at what they do,
and to tease out the habits,

83
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.180
routines,
findings that you can apply to your own life,

84
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.820
whether they are people like Arnold Schwarzenegger,

85
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.830
chess prodigies like Josh Waitzkin,

86
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.780
directors like Jon Favreau or Robert Rodriguez and hedge fund managers,

87
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.280
military strategists,
everyone in between today we have a researcher,

88
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.090
doctor Bernay Brown and you can say hi to her on Twitter at Bernay Brown is a

89
00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:25.110
research professor at the University of Houston Graduate School of Social Work

90
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.450
and her 2010 Tedx talk.

91
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.010
The power of vulnerability has more than 20 million views.

92
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.190
It is one of the top five most viewed ted talks in the world,

93
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.380
which is very hard to pull off.

94
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.800
She has other talks with millions and millions of views,

95
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.160
so once you're lucky twice,
you're good.
She is very good.

96
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.060
She has spent the past 13 years studying vulnerability,
courage,

97
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.230
worthiness and shame.
All of my favorites Bernays,

98
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:54.410
the author of two Number One New York Times bestsellers,

99
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.340
daring greatly and the gifts of imperfection.

100
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.310
Her new book is titled Rising Strong and in it she writes,

101
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.890
if we are brave enough,
often enough,
we will fall.

102
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.500
This is a book about what it takes to get back up.

103
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.900
And she interviews some very interesting folks,

104
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.570
top performers in the corporate world,
startup world,

105
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.630
military world and the gathers data to support the recommendations and

106
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:18.110
conclusions in these books.

107
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.400
So I have a copy of rising strong and encourage you to check it out.

108
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:25.790
She's also the founder and CEO for the daring way,

109
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:29.810
which is an organization that brings her work to organizations,
schools,

110
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:33.380
communities and families.
And without further ado,

111
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.420
I want to let you enjoy this wide ranging conversation that touches on some

112
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.160
sensitive topics you might say with doctor Bernay Brown.

113
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.630
Bernay welcome to the show.

114
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.200
<v 3>Thank you.
I'm excited to talk to you</v>

115
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.480
<v 2>and my fans are excited to hear all of your wisdom and dig into your research.</v>

116
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.670
Uh,
and I suppose we could,

117
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.270
we could start with some context for those people who are not familiar with your

118
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:06.620
work.
When you were asked the question,
what do you do?
How do you answer that?

119
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.680
<v 3>It really,
I actually have two answers I want,
if I want to keep talking,
then one,</v>

120
00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:15.570
if I doubt it.
So if I don't want to keep talking,

121
00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:19.950
I'm usually will just say I'm ashamed.
Researcher.
And that scares people.

122
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.280
And then they usually go on.
They usually say,

123
00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:27.330
so what do you think about the Texans this season or something?
Um,

124
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.280
and then if I'm in a normal conversation,

125
00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:32.790
I'll say that I studied vulnerability and courage,
shame and worthiness.

126
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.570
<v 2>And</v>

127
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.790
<v 3>that's,
that's kind of terrible,
isn't it?
But I do that.</v>

128
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.550
<v 2>I don't think it's terrible.</v>

129
00:07:38.551 --> 00:07:42.390
I think that you can do kind of a reverse George Castanza when you don't want to

130
00:07:42.391 --> 00:07:46.320
talk to someone if you're trapped on a planet or something.
So instead of saying,

131
00:07:46.321 --> 00:07:46.531
you know,

132
00:07:46.531 --> 00:07:50.460
picking the most interesting thing to get them to admire you and say you're an

133
00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:54.330
architect,
you can be like,
Oh yes,
no,
I'm a,
you know,

134
00:07:54.331 --> 00:07:58.620
you could bring up something extremely awkward,
right?
Like I,
you know,
I research,

135
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.770
uh,
you know,
off color,
sex trafficking or something,

136
00:08:01.771 --> 00:08:04.020
and then depending on who you're sitting next to,

137
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.860
I suppose it could be a good character check.
Right.
Okay.

138
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.130
<v 3>It's a totally,
it's a total character shot.</v>

139
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.690
Did they watch it after they hear I said he's shame.
Um,

140
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.780
then that kind of bites me on the ass a little bit,
but it's works pretty well.

141
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.110
You're

142
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.010
<v 2>like,
you're not following the script pal.
You're at your office.
Uh,
so,</v>

143
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.610
so speaking of script and,
uh,

144
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.290
I am not the only one who's been impressed with your presenting ability,

145
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:34.291
but it seems like one of the ways that you really hit the mainstream map was

146
00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:37.310
through Ted and,
uh,

147
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.260
specifically I guess it would have been the,
the power of vulnerability,

148
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.800
although that,
that has more than 21 million views now.
And,
uh,

149
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.390
some of your other presentations have more than 5 million views.
So certainly,
uh,

150
00:08:49.391 --> 00:08:52.760
you know,
once you're lucky twice,
you're good.
You're good at this.
Uh,

151
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.900
could you give people an of the components that make a hit speech or Ted talk

152
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:04.680
because you're,
you're clearly good at it.
It's not a one hit wonder.

153
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.900
How did the power of vulnerability come to be?
How did you decide on the,

154
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.580
on that,
on the content and rehearse it and so on?
Just the,
the,

155
00:09:13.581 --> 00:09:15.780
the genesis story I think would be very interesting.

156
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.480
<v 3>Um,
yeah,
I'd love this year cause it's been a,
a huge learning for me.</v>

157
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:26.481
So the Tedx talk was kind of a combination of an accident and an experiment.

158
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.463
Um,

159
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.150
the curators of Tedx Houston asked me to open their first event,

160
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.920
um,
and they called and they were really excited and I asked,
I said,
sure,

161
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:40.890
I'd love chair.
I was really excited.
Um,

162
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.660
and they have their for dual is the curator.
And I said,

163
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:47.910
what do you want me to talk about?
And you know,

164
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:49.920
when you study things like shame and vulnerability,

165
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.880
people can get very prescriptive about what they want you to say and what they

166
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:56.760
don't want you to say.
Um,
and it really has no bearing,

167
00:09:56.761 --> 00:09:58.080
actually are what I do say.

168
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.990
But they like to think in the beginning that they're going to control some of

169
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:05.130
that.
And so I said,
you know,
do you have any thoughts?
And his answer was B,

170
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:09.450
awesome.
Have Fun.
And the day before the yeah,

171
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:14.340
which is you would think it's liberating and,
but it's also kind of terrifying.

172
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.240
Right?
And so yeah,
the curse of no constraints.

173
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.250
Exactly.
Exactly.
And so I was on a flight home the night before,

174
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:27.510
a long flight with my husband and kids and I looked at Steve and I was like,

175
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.300
I think I'm going to experiment tomorrow.

176
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.430
And my husband looked at me and he said,
that sounds like a terrible idea.

177
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.590
And I said,
yeah.
And I said,
no,

178
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:42.480
I think I'm going to actually be really vulnerable while I'm talking about

179
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:47.370
vulnerability.
And he said,
you know,
again,
not sure that's a great idea.

180
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.440
So I went to the Ted Event and I experimented.

181
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:56.080
I really kind of put myself out there.
I talked about my own breakdown,

182
00:10:56.081 --> 00:10:57.300
spiritual mean,

183
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.460
I talked about having to go to therapy and how much I really hated that.

184
00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:03.810
And I kind of thought it was bullshit,

185
00:11:03.811 --> 00:11:08.640
but like I had to do it and I really put myself out there and I remember driving

186
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:11.940
home and thinking,
I will never do that again.

187
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.000
I mean,
I literally had,

188
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.110
I literally had what I thought was one of the worst vulnerability hangovers of

189
00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:19.944
my career.

190
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.300
<v 2>Okay.</v>

191
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.570
<v 3>And I was so grateful,
you know,
I have to tell you to,</v>

192
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.420
I was so grateful that there were only 500 people there and that it was recorded

193
00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:30.730
at University of Houston where I've taught for 20 years.

194
00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:32.200
So most people kind of are like,
oh yeah,

195
00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:36.880
that's Bernay I don't have any memory of that being recorded.

196
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.550
And I,
and I'm pretty,
I'm pretty sure maybe the universalist aligned and thought,

197
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.040
you know,
let's not let her know that this is being recorded.

198
00:11:45.041 --> 00:11:50.020
So when it came out on the Tedx,

199
00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.950
you know,
on the Tedx side,
I was pretty mortified.
Steve's,
you know,

200
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:57.100
it seems like no one's gonna Watch it,
don't worry.
And then several months later,

201
00:11:57.101 --> 00:11:59.510
Chris Anderson called and said,
okay,

202
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.970
hey,
we're,
we don't usually put the tedx talks that,
but we really,

203
00:12:04.971 --> 00:12:06.740
we love your talking.
We want to put it that,
and I,

204
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.830
I think the conversation like this,
which is an interesting form of leadership,

205
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:14.270
I think I said,
no,
uh,
I'm flattered,
but no thank you.
And he said,

206
00:12:14.271 --> 00:12:17.390
I think December 23rd will be great.
And then that was that.

207
00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.280
And so it went up on December 23rd and against.
He was like,
don't worry Renee,

208
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.470
I don't think that you people are not going to see it.

209
00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:29.690
And it went like one to 1 million,
1 million,
one,

210
00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:34.340
3 million.
And I was like,
oh.
And so if I look back,

211
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.330
so my learning,
my takeaway from that experience was this,

212
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.200
if I'm not a little bit nauseous,
what I'm done,

213
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.700
I probably did not show up like I should have shown up.

214
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.550
<v 2>That's great.
That's,
that's uh,
that's,</v>

215
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.190
that echoes advice from,

216
00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.230
I believe it's Neil Gaiman in the commencement speech make good art where you

217
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:02.781
talked about,
you know,

218
00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:06.260
when you feel like you're walking down the street naked and extremely

219
00:13:06.261 --> 00:13:11.240
uncomfortable,
maybe you're starting to get it right.
I'm paraphrasing of course.

220
00:13:11.241 --> 00:13:15.050
But that's a,
that's a really good,
uh,
that's really good point.
How did you,

221
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:19.710
I mean,
your delivery was so spot on.
How did you rehearse a,

222
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.740
or did you,
I mean,
maybe you're just,
uh,

223
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.500
maybe that is a language that you're naturally fluent in presentation that is,

224
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.290
but,
uh,
how did you prep for it?

225
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.520
<v 3>I don't rehearse at all.
In fact,
she rehearsing is really,</v>

226
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.930
so when I rehearse and the traditional way we think about rehearsing,

227
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.310
it's about what I'm going to say and what I'm going to say it and how I'm going

228
00:13:43.311 --> 00:13:46.330
to say it.
And so if I do that,
what ends up happening?

229
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.010
I've tried a couple of times.
I get,

230
00:13:50.011 --> 00:13:53.460
so like prefrontal Cortex,
I get so

231
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.010
wrapped up and oh it,

232
00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:01.950
I supposed to pause here and wasn't I supposed to do this there that I am not,

233
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.440
I'm not connecting.

234
00:14:04.441 --> 00:14:09.441
And so for me it is use images as the arc,

235
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.320
understand what image every image means to me and what I want to wrap around

236
00:14:15.391 --> 00:14:20.370
that image and then require that the house lights are on so I can see people's

237
00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:21.210
faces.

238
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.150
<v 2>That's a good role.
That's a really good role.</v>

239
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.930
<v 3>Yeah.
So that thing where they're,
you know,
and I rarely,</v>

240
00:14:26.931 --> 00:14:31.880
rarely allow any of my presentations to be videotaped.
Um,

241
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.890
very,
very rarely because one,
if they're taping you,

242
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:42.100
you have to be super hot under the lights and the audience has to be dark and

243
00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:47.060
then its performance,
not connection for me.
Um,
and then secondly,

244
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.950
I don't feel like it's anyone's business,

245
00:14:48.951 --> 00:14:52.250
what happens between me and an audience at given moment.

246
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.390
I mean,
I just really feel like that's an a,
that's a moment.

247
00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.790
<v 2>Yeah.
And I think that comes,
I mean I'm speculating here,</v>

248
00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:05.110
but from a lot of experience teaching,
right?
Being in,

249
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.700
in front of students as opposed to viewing yourself as being in front of an

250
00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:12.310
audience,
uh,
which,

251
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:16.060
which I think enables a very different relationship with the people you're

252
00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:18.520
trying to communicate to or communicate with.

253
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.290
Andy did to provide perhaps a little bit of connective tissue for people who are

254
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.740
curious about your research.
Um,
the,

255
00:15:26.741 --> 00:15:30.820
you mentioned vulnerability mentioned shame.
Uh,

256
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:36.810
how should we define these terms just for the purposes of this conversation and

257
00:15:37.691 --> 00:15:40.900
so people can understand and how did you research them?

258
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:47.410
<v 3>Yeah,
I think the best place to start when we're talking about kind of what words</v>

259
00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:47.831
mean,

260
00:15:47.831 --> 00:15:51.590
at least the way I use them in my work is to really start with vulnerability.
Um,

261
00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.670
if I think if you can get your head and heart wrapped about around
vulnerability,

262
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.970
the others make a lot more sense.
Um,
so to me,

263
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.420
I don't know how you were raised and how the listeners were raised,

264
00:16:01.421 --> 00:16:04.740
but I was raised to believe that vulnerability is weakness.
Um,

265
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:09.100
that you wake up in the morning,
you armor up,
you go out into the day,

266
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.540
you kick some ass and you don't let people see your emotions.

267
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.580
You mitigate uncertainty and risk as much as you can and that's the way you
live.

268
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.380
And so from the very earliest stages of my research,
you know,

269
00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:24.520
13 years ago,

270
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.660
that is not how vulnerability emerged in the data.
Um,

271
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.830
vulnerability emerged as not weakness,

272
00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:37.600
but probably our best measure of courage.
So when we asked people,

273
00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:41.560
you know,
what is vulnerability?
They would say things like,

274
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.930
it's the first date after my divorce.

275
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.380
It's trying to get pregnant after my second miscarriage.

276
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.520
It's sitting with my wife who has stage four breast cancer and making plans for

277
00:16:51.521 --> 00:16:53.080
our three year old and five year old.

278
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:58.270
It's starting my own business is taking my business public.
It's getting fired,

279
00:16:58.271 --> 00:17:02.860
it's firing someone.
Um,
it's getting promoted,

280
00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:06.790
it's missing the promotion.
And so it came,

281
00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:11.791
it became very clear to me early on that the simplest definition for

282
00:17:11.801 --> 00:17:15.460
vulnerability is really uncertainty,

283
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.800
risk and emotional exposure.

284
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.100
Vulnerability is about the willingness to show up and be seen when you have zero

285
00:17:25.751 --> 00:17:27.850
control over the outcome.

286
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.150
And

287
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.760
I think if you ask people to close their eyes and think about the last time they

288
00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:43.680
saw someone doing something truly brave,

289
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:50.650
it is very easy to see how vulnerability underpins all acts of courage.

290
00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:52.750
<v 2>Sure.</v>

291
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.790
<v 3>And yeah,
I mean I just think it's about really</v>

292
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.260
<v 2>okay.</v>

293
00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.060
<v 3>It's about putting yourself out there and which is increasingly difficult to do</v>

294
00:18:02.061 --> 00:18:05.690
in this very hypercritical and forgiving kind of media culture.

295
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:10.310
And so vulnerability is showing up and being seen.
Um,

296
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.720
courage to me,
you know,

297
00:18:11.721 --> 00:18:16.050
I love the word courage because the root of the word is Kerr and the Latin for

298
00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.190
careers heart.
And when courage first came into the English language,

299
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.070
the original definition was to tell the story of your,

300
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.630
of who you are with your whole heart.
That was an act of courage.
Um,

301
00:18:26.631 --> 00:18:27.231
so to me,

302
00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:32.231
courage is really about choosing what's right over what's easy,

303
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.600
practicing your values,

304
00:18:35.601 --> 00:18:40.250
not just professing them and choosing to be brave over being comfortable.

305
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.510
<v 2>And these,
I love this type of</v>

306
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.520
contextual cut prelude.
It's not a prelude,

307
00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:53.280
but it's a defining,

308
00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:57.480
because I think it's so important for any important conversation.

309
00:18:57.481 --> 00:19:02.481
And certainly I think for most conversations to make sure that the people in the

310
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:05.700
conversation or talking about the same thing,
right?

311
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.180
<v 3>Yeah.
It's the key to everything.
Right?
Right.
Yeah.
Right.</v>

312
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.980
<v 2>And that starts with defining very,
very end.</v>

313
00:19:12.981 --> 00:19:15.160
I've noticed,
for instance,
even in my own relationships,

314
00:19:15.161 --> 00:19:19.160
something as seemingly clear as honesty,

315
00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.960
I want you to be honest,
say an intimate relationships are actually can,

316
00:19:23.961 --> 00:19:28.460
can have a,
you had a,
no pun or Noah illusion intended,
but you know,

317
00:19:28.461 --> 00:19:32.690
50 shades of grey,
right?
If there are,
it can mean something very different.

318
00:19:32.691 --> 00:19:32.880
You know,

319
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.880
is is a mission a lie or are we talking about a misrepresentation of truth?

320
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:44.390
Right.
And,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's really critical.
And I like your description because,

321
00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.420
you know,
courage.
I remember thinking when you were,

322
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.620
when you were walking us through this,
uh,
custom auto,

323
00:19:51.621 --> 00:19:55.250
who was Mike Tyson's primary trainer who,
who,
who,
uh,

324
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.770
who brought him to the pinnacle of his success,
uh,

325
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.660
with tell Mike who was terrified before going into the ring.
Uh,

326
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.640
in the dressing room and so on that,
you know,

327
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.950
the hero and the coward feel the same thing.
It's how the,

328
00:20:09.951 --> 00:20:14.650
how it's how the hero responds that makes them different.
And you know,
the,

329
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:14.990
the,

330
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:19.990
you can't be courageous unless you are exposing yourself to a perceived risk,

331
00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:24.050
which by definition makes you vulnerable even if you're thinking about it in a

332
00:20:24.051 --> 00:20:27.950
very literal kind of physical sense.
So the,
the,
uh,

333
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.450
I'd love to segue too to shame because I was reading,
uh,

334
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.320
one of,
uh,
your alumni publications,

335
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:41.120
and you can correct this certainly if it's not accurate,

336
00:20:41.121 --> 00:20:46.121
but a quote of yours came up that I thought was really insightful and worth

337
00:20:46.611 --> 00:20:49.840
exploring bit.
And it's a shame.
Hates to have words wrapped around it.

338
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:52.840
If we talk about it,
it loses its grip on us.

339
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:57.510
And I was hoping maybe we could,
uh,

340
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.680
you could elaborate on that and,
uh,
help us to,

341
00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.800
to then understand shame.

342
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:04.451
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

343
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:09.451
And I think that that quote is so powerful because it's so true.

344
00:21:09.821 --> 00:21:13.840
Like I often when I talk about shame,
I often like to personify it and say,

345
00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:17.560
you know,
shame is a very formidable foe.
You know,

346
00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:22.561
shame is this intensely painful belief or experience that something is wrong

347
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:25.481
with us,

348
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:30.481
that we are flawed and that we're unworthy of love and belonging and we all know

349
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:37.540
it.
Everyone knows that warm wash that comes over you that makes you feel like

350
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:39.840
you're not enough.
Um,

351
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.850
we have 50 years of data that really show us in my mind and questionably that

352
00:21:47.621 --> 00:21:51.520
the only people who don't experience shame are people who don't have a capacity

353
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:55.060
for connection.
Who?
People who don't have a capacity for empathy.

354
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:59.140
So if we are capable of having connection,

355
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.940
we know shame because shame is the fear that we're not worthy of connection.

356
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:05.530
And so

357
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.720
the thing about shame that makes it so difficult is it needs three things to

358
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.420
thrive in our lives.

359
00:22:16.421 --> 00:22:21.340
If you've take a petri dish and you put shame in a petri dish and you Dallas it

360
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:26.200
with secrecy,
silence and judgment,
it grows exponentially.

361
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.070
It will,
it will grow into every corner and crevice of our lives.

362
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.630
If you have the same amount of shame and a petri dish and you Dallas it with

363
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:37.300
empathy,
shame can't survive.
Empathy.

364
00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:39.850
Empathy is a very hostile environment for shame.

365
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.090
And so to understand shame,

366
00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:47.590
I think what resonates mostly with people are the two kinds of tapes that shame

367
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:52.300
drives.
The first is you're not enough and you can fill in the blank.

368
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:55.720
You're not thin enough,
pretty enough,
strong enough,
powerful enough,

369
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.950
rich enough or good enough,
loved enough,
awesome enough,

370
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:04.450
you're not enough.
Um,
and then if we can somehow get a handle on that and say,

371
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:06.310
you know,
like,
okay,
I've got,
you know,

372
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.960
I have this big presentation and you've got the shame Gremlin and your ear

373
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.460
saying,
you're not enough.
You're not smart enough.

374
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.980
They're going to be like a hundred Mbas and that ran,

375
00:23:14.981 --> 00:23:16.840
what do you know about business?
You're not enough.

376
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.510
If you can Russell that thing down.

377
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.220
The other tape that shame drives is who do you think you are?

378
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.900
Um,

379
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.900
so it creates this amazing vice that our self worth gets caught in,

380
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.650
um,
and just squeezes us from both sides.

381
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.680
And so shame and shame is really visceral.

382
00:23:40.991 --> 00:23:45.010
I mean,
if you,
if you just say the word to people,
people can feel

383
00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.930
<v 2>no,
definitely.
And you mentioned you to fear of disconnection.
I mean,</v>

384
00:23:49.931 --> 00:23:53.410
I wrote down when I was doing some research before this call,
you know,

385
00:23:53.411 --> 00:23:56.890
being shunned.
Question Mark.
And,
uh,

386
00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:01.910
I'd love to ask you because a question that came from some of my listeners was,

387
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.600
uh,

388
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.600
what is the evolutionary need of shame or,

389
00:24:09.761 --> 00:24:12.670
or why did that develop in human beings?

390
00:24:12.671 --> 00:24:17.350
And it seems to be like shame,
Ken,
serve a useful purpose,
right?

391
00:24:17.351 --> 00:24:21.800
If you are ashamed of the fact that you think about molesting a child that sees,

392
00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.070
that serves a societal function,
right?
Uh,

393
00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:30.280
so you had are,
you know.
Okay.

394
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.720
All right.
Well,
I'd love for you to expand on that because,

395
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:39.670
uh,
I,
that's,
that's,
uh,
I,
that's an interesting viewpoint.

396
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.530
So could you,
could you expand on that?

397
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.980
<v 3>If you look at shame from an evolutionary biological perspective,</v>

398
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.890
um,
I think it did absolutely serve a function.
So 10,

399
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.500
you lead the dinosaur back to the K,

400
00:24:58.501 --> 00:25:01.170
it eats my entire family and my whole clan.

401
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.240
This is the second time you've done that.

402
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:08.370
So we are literally going to shun you from our collective,

403
00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.490
which means you'll be alone,
which means death.
Right?

404
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.330
And so because you're dangerous,
uh,
I'm just not,

405
00:25:15.331 --> 00:25:19.020
not unlike if we see even in the animal world today,
some pack animals,

406
00:25:19.021 --> 00:25:22.740
if there's a sick animal among them will literally,
you know,

407
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.730
approach it as a group and back it off a cliff,
um,

408
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.290
for the sake of the pack.
Right?
So,

409
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:36.880
so that makes sense.
As we've evolved,
um,

410
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.990
as we've evolved neuro biologically as we evolved,

411
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:45.530
shame becomes a very profoundly dangerous tool,
um,

412
00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.570
for people who have the emotional understanding that we had.

413
00:25:48.571 --> 00:25:53.571
So now what we see is you can change a behavior sometimes,

414
00:25:55.021 --> 00:25:58.050
especially with children on a dime with shame,

415
00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:03.210
but it's like hitting a thumbtack with a 500 pound anvil,

416
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.460
you are going to crush that thumbtack and the process of doing that.

417
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:13.230
Um,
so what we see now is we see shame,
highly,

418
00:26:13.231 --> 00:26:17.610
highly correlated with addiction,
depression,

419
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.330
aggression,
violence,
suicide.

420
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.230
Eating disorders very highly correlated.

421
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:27.663
<v 0>MMM.</v>

422
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.740
<v 3>What we see as the inverse is we see guilt</v>

423
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.950
and shame and guilt are very different.
Shame is I am a bad person.

424
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:42.110
Guilt is I did something bad so you go out on Thursday night,

425
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.840
you get wasted.
You're so hungover on Friday,
you sleep through your alarm clock,

426
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.460
you miss a really important meeting.

427
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:52.260
You get to work late on Friday and your self talk is Jesus.
I'm a loser,

428
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.950
I'm an idiot.
I'm such a loser.
That shame.

429
00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:01.740
If you get to work on Friday,
same scenario area and your self talk is,
dude,

430
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:04.470
I cannot believe I did that.
That was such a lame thing to do.

431
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:09.300
That was such a stupid thing to do.
The difference is shame is a focus on cell.

432
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.990
Guilt is a focus on behavior.
People who are,

433
00:27:12.991 --> 00:27:17.250
who are very guilt prem who say,
you know what,
I got a bad grade.

434
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:22.140
I'm not a loser,
but that was a loser idea to not study and go out last night.

435
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.460
They have their relationship with addiction,
depression,

436
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:33.630
violence,
suicide.
Bullying is inverse,

437
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.850
meaning the higher the level of guilt,

438
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.540
the less likely it is to experience these outcomes.

439
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.130
So the most dangerous,

440
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:48.300
if you look at shame and guilt and a criminal population,

441
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:53.330
the most dangerous people have the highest levels of shame proneness

442
00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.940
and the lowest levels of guilt proneness because guilt is holding absence.

443
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.450
Does that make sense?
That makes perfect sense.
Yeah,

444
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.720
so guilt is holding up something we've done against who we want to be or

445
00:28:08.971 --> 00:28:11.700
something we've done thought about doing our field to do.

446
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.980
I began our values,
who we want to be,
what we think is right,

447
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.280
and guilt is the psychological discomfort created by the cognitive dissonance

448
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:27.690
between our behavior and who we want to be and it's healthy and adaptive.

449
00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.060
<v 2>No,
it makes perfect sense.</v>

450
00:28:29.061 --> 00:28:33.710
I was having a conversation with Josh Waitzkin who's been on this podcast as

451
00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:35.960
well.
He was the basis for searching for Bobby Fisher,

452
00:28:35.961 --> 00:28:38.000
so he was known as a chess prodigy as a child.

453
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.170
He is a tremendous,
dad,
are really amazing.

454
00:28:42.171 --> 00:28:47.171
Parent has it as a young boy and he has a very particular parenting style and he

455
00:28:48.471 --> 00:28:53.471
always focuses on rewarding effort and not labeling his son smart.

456
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:59.420
So for instance,
he'll say that was a really good job.
You worked really hard,

457
00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.770
you did A,
B and c that resulted in d as opposed to,
wow,

458
00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:06.410
you got a great grade,
you're so smart.

459
00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:09.900
Because then when the kid gets a bad grade,
it's viewed as this,

460
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.730
this unsolvable unfixable personal failing.

461
00:29:13.731 --> 00:29:18.610
And it seems to correlate to the difference between shame.
I he,

462
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.300
I am flawed.
I am a broken toy that cannot be fixed versus guilt.

463
00:29:23.301 --> 00:29:26.480
Like wow,
I really fucked that up bad on me,

464
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.910
but next time I'll do something different.

465
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.080
<v 3>She usually he,
and the other thing is think about this as a 16 year old,</v>

466
00:29:35.081 --> 00:29:37.030
a 10 year old,
you know,

467
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:41.920
they get caught being dishonest with me and I say,
you know what?

468
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.270
You're a liar and you're grounded.
When you tell somebody they're a liar.

469
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:47.840
<v 4>Okay,</v>

470
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.260
<v 3>that's a self fulfilling prophecy.
What?
What if you're,
if you're a liar,</v>

471
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:56.240
if I Bernay brown in a liar,
what option is there for growth or change?

472
00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:57.980
<v 4>Okay.</v>

473
00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.210
<v 3>That's who I am.
Right?</v>

474
00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:03.980
<v 2>Not only that,
but what incentive is there not to lie if you're branded as such.</v>

475
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.060
Right.
Okay.

476
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:10.120
<v 3>So when you talk about the person who is thinking about committing violence or</v>

477
00:30:11.001 --> 00:30:15.920
assault on a child,
do I want that person to be more ashamed?
No,

478
00:30:15.921 --> 00:30:19.610
because I have a feeling,
I mean there's,
there's,
you know,
in your example,

479
00:30:19.611 --> 00:30:21.710
I guess there's pedophilia,
which can be an organic,

480
00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:26.740
real issue that the majority of what we see are people who are so deeply shamed,

481
00:30:26.901 --> 00:30:30.020
based,
committing horrific crimes.

482
00:30:30.021 --> 00:30:33.500
So like if I thought shaming people,
no matter how hard,
I mean,

483
00:30:33.501 --> 00:30:35.930
I hate to say this,
but I'll just be honest.
If I thought shaming people,

484
00:30:35.931 --> 00:30:39.800
no matter how hurtful and painful it is,

485
00:30:39.801 --> 00:30:42.770
if I thought that kept people safer,
I'd be all for it.
It just doesn't.

486
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:47.600
<v 2>Right,
right.
Well,
it's,
you know,
it's interesting because I've been a training,</v>

487
00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:52.280
a rescue pup for the last few weeks,
a brand new rescue pup,

488
00:30:52.281 --> 00:30:55.730
and she was at a kill shelter in South Carolina,
suffered a lot of abuse,

489
00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.240
but really got into looking at a mammalian training and looking at everything

490
00:31:02.031 --> 00:31:05.390
from dolphin training to polar bear training to dog training.

491
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.120
And the fact of the matter is,
you know,

492
00:31:08.121 --> 00:31:13.121
negative reinforcement or punishment based training doesn't work that well,

493
00:31:17.211 --> 00:31:18.200
or at least at the very best.

494
00:31:18.201 --> 00:31:22.790
It's very slow compared to a lot of the positive reinforcement based training,

495
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.720
you know,
whether it's using clickers for conditioning and so on,

496
00:31:26.721 --> 00:31:31.550
because you can only reinforce a behavior,
uh,
that,

497
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.620
that has,
that has,
that has occurred.
Right.
And when you,
I think that the,

498
00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:39.540
the shame just seems to tie to me,
uh,

499
00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:44.620
in an interesting way to not understanding what is malleable and what does not.

500
00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.070
And I'd love to come back to the I am enough,
uh,

501
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.560
because,
uh,
in your book,
uh,
one of your several books,

502
00:31:54.561 --> 00:31:57.620
but the gift of imperfection,
one of the best book titles of all time,
by the way,

503
00:31:57.621 --> 00:31:59.900
so well done on that,
uh,

504
00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:05.810
has been described as the lifelong journey from what will people think to I am

505
00:32:06.141 --> 00:32:10.920
enough now what I'm so curious to hear about and that,
and then I'll,

506
00:32:10.921 --> 00:32:14.180
I'll leap forward to daring greatly.
Uh,

507
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.750
and I'll just read this,
this quote,
uh,

508
00:32:17.751 --> 00:32:21.200
from which I believe that the title was,
um,
was adapted.

509
00:32:21.201 --> 00:32:24.260
So this is Theodore Roosevelt.
There's not the critic who counts,

510
00:32:24.261 --> 00:32:25.790
not the man who points out how strong,

511
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:29.570
how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them

512
00:32:29.571 --> 00:32:32.360
better.
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,

513
00:32:32.361 --> 00:32:36.050
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood,
who strives valiantly,

514
00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.670
who at the best knows in the end of the triumph of high and who at worst,

515
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.550
if he fails,
at least fails while daring greatly.

516
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:49.070
Now what I have had as an internal conflict for a very long time,

517
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.190
and this was brought to the surface,
uh,

518
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.030
most noticeably at the last year and a half through meditation.

519
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.680
So I practice transcendental meditation in the mornings and have friends who

520
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.650
practice Vipassana,
transcendental different types of meditation.

521
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:09.100
And these are type a driven competitive people.

522
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.930
And we've,
I've had the conversation to repeatedly,
uh,

523
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:18.230
the same conversation with different people about whether that removes a

524
00:33:18.231 --> 00:33:19.370
competitive edge.

525
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.850
And the reason being that you decide I am enough your content,

526
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:30.160
therefore you do not have discontent driving you to achieve big things that are

527
00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.760
for most of us pretty high on Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
right?
It's like we,

528
00:33:35.761 --> 00:33:39.440
we have shelter,
we have food.
So in reality,

529
00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:42.800
like in almost every capacity we have enough,
we are enough.

530
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:48.110
So how do you balance the,
the,
uh,

531
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:53.650
the wellbeing of having a mindset of I am enough versus the,

532
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.810
at least with a lot of my,
my peers and friends in silicon valley,

533
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:04.430
the kind of discontent that seems to drive so many of those people to accomplish

534
00:34:04.431 --> 00:34:05.264
great things.

535
00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:07.730
<v 4>Okay.</v>

536
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:12.410
<v 3>So I would go back to your really important insight from the beginning of our</v>

537
00:34:12.411 --> 00:34:14.810
conversation,
get out defining terms.

538
00:34:14.811 --> 00:34:18.200
I'd also go back to kind of the insights that you're learning from doing your

539
00:34:18.201 --> 00:34:20.700
training with your rescue pack,

540
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.670
which is does to me,
I am enough.

541
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:27.420
<v 4>Okay.</v>

542
00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.530
<v 3>I mean,
I'm a competitive type a person too.
What does that come as a surprise?</v>

543
00:34:31.531 --> 00:34:36.030
The oldest of four,
you know,
very ambitious and you know,
um,

544
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:39.620
I'm that person too in many ways.
Um,

545
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.240
<v 4>okay.</v>

546
00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:48.240
<v 3>I think the soul or the center of my ability to keep putting myself out there</v>

547
00:34:50.861 --> 00:34:55.861
and try new things even when I fail and I have had some big failures.

548
00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.093
Um,

549
00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:02.370
I think the sole goal of my healthy competitiveness and my ambition is the

550
00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:06.070
belief that I am enough.

551
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.233
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

552
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:13.460
<v 3>Um,
because I'm starting and I think what?</v>

553
00:35:13.461 --> 00:35:14.900
I don't believe I'm enough.

554
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.730
I engage in behaviors not to push myself,

555
00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.490
not to grow and stretch and learn,

556
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:28.310
not to strive for excellence,
but to prove to other people what I can do.

557
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:33.110
Um,
but when I start from a place that,
you know what,
I'm enough.

558
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:38.580
I'm imperfect.
I'm afraid.
I'm,
you know,

559
00:35:38.581 --> 00:35:39.840
super vulnerable,

560
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:43.830
but that does not change the fact that I'm also brave and worthy of love and

561
00:35:43.831 --> 00:35:48.390
belonging.
And when I start from that place,
um,

562
00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.400
I am completely unleashed.

563
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.240
So I think one of the things that's really important to help kind of define

564
00:35:56.871 --> 00:36:01.520
here,
because I'm not like,
you know,
on the couch,

565
00:36:01.521 --> 00:36:04.970
binge watching TV five days a week,
um,

566
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.390
writing nasty ass comments on other people's accomplishments,
on,
you know,

567
00:36:08.391 --> 00:36:11.990
Twitter and Facebook and saying,
look like you,
I'm enough.

568
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:16.790
Like that's not what I'm talking about,
you know?
Right.
I'm talking about

569
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.580
I belief of self worth that

570
00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:26.920
I am enough not based on what I do,
what I accomplish,

571
00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:30.580
what do I,
you know,
prove are produced.
I am just enough.

572
00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:34.450
And if you start from that,
that's the healthy center.

573
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.490
I think of most,

574
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.880
most of the most awesome achievements we've seen.

575
00:36:39.881 --> 00:36:43.390
And I spent a lot of time in silicon valley too.
And what I can tell you,

576
00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.190
and I know I would bet,

577
00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:50.080
I wish we could have it that right now I would bet you a lot of money that if we

578
00:36:50.081 --> 00:36:52.720
listed the names of 10 people,
which we're not going to do,

579
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.630
you could tell me which of those folks are operating and the 10,

580
00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.630
10 competitive,
ambitious Jess law,

581
00:37:02.631 --> 00:37:07.270
like crazy fighters out there in the arena.
And we listed 10 names.

582
00:37:07.271 --> 00:37:12.271
You could tell me the five who are motivated from a place of being enough but

583
00:37:12.281 --> 00:37:17.281
wanting to strive for excellence and learning and the five who are trying to

584
00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:20.590
fill a hole and their self worth and who are dangerous.

585
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:23.430
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
for sure.
And I think,
I guess the,</v>

586
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:27.990
in my mind when I think I'm just imagining this list of 10 people in my head,

587
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:33.080
when I imagine the people who fall into the less self destructive category,

588
00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.390
uh,
who have,
who are operating from a place of I am enough.

589
00:37:39.391 --> 00:37:44.391
I guess I would in their cases say that PR in the,

590
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.970
if I could hear their sort of a subconscious internal mantra,
it would,

591
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:56.040
it would,
it in my mind it would seem to be,
and maybe this is the same thing,

592
00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:01.020
but,
uh,
closer to I m I'm good or I'm really good,

593
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.160
but I can be better.
Uh,
not I am flawed.

594
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:06.803
Uh,

595
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.190
I need to impress everyone around me to make them validate me.

596
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:16.620
Um,
but the,
I guess I'm just struggling with the word enough,
but I,

597
00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:19.800
I understand the,
the point of it.
Um,

598
00:38:19.801 --> 00:38:22.470
and I think it's [inaudible] this is something that I struggle with,
right?

599
00:38:22.471 --> 00:38:26.910
I mean,
I'm the extremely,
personally,
I'm very hard on myself.
I mean,

600
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.880
I've always sort of been of the mindset that,
you know,

601
00:38:29.881 --> 00:38:34.710
second place is first loser and extremely competitive,
uh,

602
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.370
in that is not always been the healthiest thing for,

603
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.920
uh,
me and all sorts of different capacities.
Um,

604
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.560
but I don't the,
let's,

605
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:51.430
let's sort of tackle this from a slightly different angle.
So the,

606
00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:55.720
the daring greatly,
uh,
the question that,

607
00:38:56.210 --> 00:39:00.630
uh,
I think is raised in that,
that book among others is heavy.

608
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.960
You dared greatly today.

609
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.800
And a please feel free to take this in any direction,
uh,
because I,

610
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.160
you obviously know more about your work than I do,
but how,

611
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.020
what is a good way to evaluate that?

612
00:39:11.021 --> 00:39:15.820
And do you ask yourself this type of question on a daily basis?
Do you have,
uh,

613
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:18.970
um,
I'll leave it at that.
I could,
I could make this a 12 part question,

614
00:39:18.971 --> 00:39:23.640
but how does someone determine if they've dared greatly and is,

615
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.240
how often would you suggest someone kind of check in and ask themselves that?

616
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.920
<v 3>So I think for me,
daring greatly,
and you know,</v>

617
00:39:35.921 --> 00:39:38.450
that that quote from Theodore Roosevelt,
um,

618
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:41.350
I even got teary eyed while you were reading it.
Um,
you know,

619
00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:43.660
it was a life changer for me.
Um,

620
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:46.990
it was right after the Tedx Houston talk had gone viral.

621
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:51.270
I was kind of everywhere on the Internet at that time.
And you know,
everyone,

622
00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:55.090
you know,
ABC,
CBS,
NBC,
Fox,
having imposed were all writing about this.

623
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:58.690
Who is this person at the University of Houston with this Ted talk going viral

624
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:01.340
and as we could ever imagine.
And um,

625
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:06.450
all these online stories had online comments that are of course like,

626
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.990
yeah.
And so my husband and my therapist were like,
don't read the comments.

627
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:16.390
Um,
and so I read all the comments one day and yeah,
I really,

628
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:20.140
I sit down and just read them for like an hour.
And I think,
you know,
if you ask,

629
00:40:20.141 --> 00:40:22.600
if you're listening to the,
I could hear listener right now,
you know,

630
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.300
if you close your eyes and think about

631
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.820
we all have the shame triggers,
we all have two or three things.
We are,

632
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:35.560
most of us have more that you could overhear somebody,

633
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:39.510
you could overhear someone saying about you that would be sick,

634
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:44.410
so painful and so hurtful that you don't know if you could survive it.

635
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:49.010
Most of us have those things.
And so for me,
up until that point,
you know,
I,

636
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.940
those things really dictated my life.
I was like,
look,

637
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:55.240
I'm going to engineer this career to kind of be small and safe.

638
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.620
I'm going to play right under the radar because I am not willing to put myself

639
00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:02.770
out there and get criticized.
Like I know it was happening.

640
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:06.220
And so the problem with staying small,
um,

641
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.870
is it always served up with resentment and pissed off at us.

642
00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:12.910
Um,
because we're not using,

643
00:41:12.911 --> 00:41:16.360
our guests were not in our power and there's always a price for that.
Right.

644
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:21.250
And so to me,
when I read that quote,
you know,
and when I looked to the comments,

645
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:23.050
they were things like,
of course she,
you know,

646
00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.120
of course she embraces imperfection.

647
00:41:25.121 --> 00:41:27.070
What choice would you have if you look like her?

648
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:32.230
I feel sorry for her husband and kids.
More Botox,
less research.

649
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.900
You need to shake loose pounds before you talk about being worthy.
I mean,

650
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:40.880
just like really shitty,
hurtful stuff.
Um,
and then I came on,

651
00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:44.360
I came upon that.
I mean,
like the next 30 minutes after reading all that,

652
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:48.050
I came upon that comment.
I mean,
that quote from Theodore reason about,

653
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.940
and you know,
in that moment what I realized is,

654
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:57.380
you know what,
I do want to live a brave life.
I do want to live in the arena.

655
00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.780
And if you're going to live in the arena,

656
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:04.040
the only guarantee is you will get your ass kicked.
Um,

657
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.610
and the second thing is that daring greatly is being vulnerable.

658
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:11.360
So when you ask yourself,
did I dare greatly today,

659
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.800
the big question I ask is,
did I,
when I had the opportunity,

660
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:20.810
did I choose courage over comfort?
You know,

661
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:25.100
when things went sideways between Steve and I this morning over,
you know,

662
00:42:25.101 --> 00:42:27.350
who was going to pack a lunch for my son?

663
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:32.150
Did I just go into the old pattern of rolling my eyes and walk out of the

664
00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:35.210
kitchen or did I choose courage and say,
I'm sorry,

665
00:42:35.211 --> 00:42:39.200
I'm feeling really overwhelmed with the book launch tomorrow.
And um,

666
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.780
I'm sorry,
I really apologize.

667
00:42:41.781 --> 00:42:44.870
That was hurtful to I choose courage or that she's comfort.

668
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:49.460
And so to me that's the question we ask,
um,
about daring greatly.

669
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:51.910
And I think,
you know,

670
00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.350
I think one of the things that you said 10 really when you're talking about your

671
00:42:56.351 --> 00:42:58.360
friends and this idea of being enough,

672
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:03.460
one of the things that really turned my life upside down,

673
00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:06.580
there were four or five things in the research that have taken me a long time to

674
00:43:06.581 --> 00:43:07.810
get over and get through.

675
00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:12.160
And one of them was the difference between healthy striving or striving for

676
00:43:12.161 --> 00:43:15.910
excellence and perfectionism.
And

677
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.330
I've always been perfectionistic about my stuff and what I learned in the

678
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:25.331
research was that perfectionism is very outwardly defined.

679
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:29.870
It's dictated by what will people think and healthy striving is dictated.

680
00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:33.290
Our striving for excellence is internally motivated.

681
00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.200
And so perfectionism is really,

682
00:43:36.201 --> 00:43:40.520
I call it the 20 ton shield and I think a lot of them were talking about those

683
00:43:40.521 --> 00:43:44.060
10 people,
five of whom work from this place of wholeness.
And the other,

684
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.060
I think what a lot of times we're talking about is the difference between

685
00:43:47.061 --> 00:43:49.310
perfectionism and striving for excellence.

686
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.990
And I think perfectionism is this 20 ton shield that we carry around.

687
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:59.240
And it's a defense mechanism classically that just says,
if I live perfect love,

688
00:43:59.241 --> 00:44:02.240
perfect work,
perfect and accomplished perfectly,

689
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.470
I can reduce or minimize shame,
blame,

690
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:11.360
criticism and judgment.
And so we carry this thing around.

691
00:44:11.361 --> 00:44:13.010
I'm thinking it's protecting us,

692
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.730
but what it's really doing is keeping us from being seen.

693
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.710
And so I think when I asked myself personally,

694
00:44:21.711 --> 00:44:23.150
have I dared greatly today,

695
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:27.360
sometimes for me it is the question of

696
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:34.100
was I enough or am I trying to get everything perfect so that I can somehow

697
00:44:36.601 --> 00:44:39.960
think I'm mitigating criticism and judgment.

698
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:43.510
<v 2>Right?
Well,
I also find,</v>

699
00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.180
and I haven't really thought about it in these terms before,

700
00:44:46.181 --> 00:44:49.630
but if you look at say,
I think it's Barry Schwartz,

701
00:44:49.631 --> 00:44:52.340
the paradox of choice where he talks about,
um,

702
00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.590
maximizers and s I think it's satisfying answers.
Uh,

703
00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:02.250
but if I try to correlate that to my own experience being I think very much a

704
00:45:02.771 --> 00:45:07.240
perfectionist and that,
uh,
of my,
my friends,

705
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:12.490
um,
the,
the people who are perfectionists,
um,

706
00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:18.420
very often are so future focused that the perfection once achieved is viewed as

707
00:45:19.481 --> 00:45:24.340
the trigger.
That wall sort of solve their guilt,
shame,

708
00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:29.470
discontent,
et Cetera.
Whereas the,
uh,
the people who are striving for excellence,

709
00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.880
excellence are better at celebrating the little wins,

710
00:45:33.881 --> 00:45:38.470
accepting the small defeats and sometimes the large defeats a and tend to be a

711
00:45:38.471 --> 00:45:43.170
bit more present,
state focused.
And you mentioned you to vulnerability,
uh,

712
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:46.210
and you and the sort of components,
right?

713
00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:50.320
So you're facing whether it's an uncertainty risk and so on.

714
00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:54.400
Um,
and I,
I've seen it described elsewhere as,
you know,
stopping,

715
00:45:54.401 --> 00:45:58.180
controlling and predicting,
uh,
the,

716
00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:03.280
it seems very much akin to certain tenants and say,

717
00:46:03.281 --> 00:46:06.580
stoic philosophy,
uh,
of which I read a lot.
Uh,

718
00:46:06.581 --> 00:46:08.740
whether it's mark is really us or Seneca,
et cetera.

719
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.750
And then there are a lot of common threads in Buddhism,
of course,

720
00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:17.120
that would,
um,
talk about health,

721
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.080
how fruitless it is and few tile.

722
00:46:20.081 --> 00:46:23.740
It is to try to eliminate suffering a completely,

723
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.980
because we are almost by definition,

724
00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:31.570
experiencers of suffering.
Right.
And coming to terms with that,
what's,

725
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:34.570
uh,
which,
which thinkers,

726
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:39.630
philosophers or schools of thinking or philosophy most resonate with the

727
00:46:40.391 --> 00:46:43.600
insights you found in the data,
in your research?

728
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.310
<v 3>Ah,
my God.
He,
all of the above,
like,
I mean it took me,</v>

729
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:53.120
it took me probably Marcus Aurelius to Liberation Theology,

730
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:58.430
Liberation Theology.
Oh,
uh,
at,
uh,
it's a Catholic,

731
00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.060
um,
kind of,
uh,

732
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:03.680
Catholic theology of social justice and that has,

733
00:47:03.681 --> 00:47:07.070
it's had its stronghold and beginning in Central America.
But I mean,

734
00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:11.240
I think it has just one of the things about being a grounded theory researcher

735
00:47:11.241 --> 00:47:16.241
that I love and hate is we don't start with an existing theory and then go try

736
00:47:16.281 --> 00:47:17.360
to prove or disprove it.

737
00:47:17.361 --> 00:47:21.860
We build a theory from people's lived experiences and then we do the literature

738
00:47:21.861 --> 00:47:24.980
review and see where it fits and where it doesn't fit.

739
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:29.770
Because the idea between behind grounded theory is if you start with a,

740
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.310
an existing theory,
you're just kind of paying homage to,

741
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.140
they would say the theoretical capitalist that came before you and that it's

742
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.450
people's lived experiences that really matter.

743
00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.280
Insta people often comment and my books do,

744
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:47.200
like how is it that you're quoting?
I do put Marcus Aurelius,

745
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:49.210
I think in one of my books,
how are you quoting him?

746
00:47:49.211 --> 00:47:52.820
And then how are you quoting Pema Chodron,
who is an American Buddhist nun,
right?

747
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.920
And then you're quoting Disney Pixar movie from toy story.

748
00:47:56.921 --> 00:47:58.210
And to me,

749
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:04.590
I have no division and very little tolerance for like the highbrow versus low

750
00:48:05.711 --> 00:48:08.950
brow inspiration.
Um,

751
00:48:08.951 --> 00:48:13.120
I think if you're paying attention you can find truth and inspiration anywhere

752
00:48:13.121 --> 00:48:16.480
and everywhere.
Um,
and so to me,

753
00:48:16.481 --> 00:48:18.880
I'm all over the place and the literature and I,

754
00:48:18.881 --> 00:48:21.430
I think that people who really depend on polarity will hate this,

755
00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:26.431
but really some very strong common themes are across Christianity,

756
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.450
Buddhism,
Judaism,
you know,
as long.

757
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:33.063
<v 4>MMM.</v>

758
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.520
<v 3>Joseph Campbell.
I mean,
I think</v>

759
00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.110
I ended up finding myself

760
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.520
in some just profound truths from a lot of,
I mean,

761
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:47.170
I was reading something yesterday,

762
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:51.250
I'm in the data and it made me pull out my book by Kabran,

763
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:56.650
so I think it's Roomy,

764
00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.850
Mary,
Mary Oliver,
Neil Peart,

765
00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.200
the drummer for rush,
like I was,
something came up and I was like,
yeah,

766
00:49:07.201 --> 00:49:10.590
I was like,
I didn't know if you knew.
So I had to put it in there.
But,
um,

767
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:15.270
I was like,
this is when you choose,
when you choose,

768
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:18.060
when you don't make a choice,
when you choose not to decide,

769
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:22.020
you still have made a choice.
And I think,

770
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.320
I don't know that anyone says it more eloquently than rush,
you know?

771
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.270
I don't know what to say.
Right,

772
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:28.580
<v 2>Neil?
Yeah.
Just as a side note,</v>

773
00:49:28.581 --> 00:49:32.270
if people want to see just a beast of a drummer than you can,

774
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:36.770
you can search on youtube for some videos.
This guy,
oh my goodness,

775
00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.680
what a monster on the kit,
but,

776
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.370
<v 3>and appellate,
you know,
so I find my inspiration kind of everywhere.</v>

777
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.590
<v 2>And,
uh,
let's,</v>

778
00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:48.950
let's talk about misinterpretations of vulnerability for a second.

779
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.200
And I think maybe I'm getting a little,

780
00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:55.340
I'm probably projecting my own prejudices here,
but,
um,

781
00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.490
is it vulnerability there?

782
00:49:58.491 --> 00:50:03.491
I think there's some people who misinterpret being vulnerable and the benefits

783
00:50:05.451 --> 00:50:09.570
derived from being vulnerable with,
uh,

784
00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:15.400
incessant oversharing of emotions or inner dialogue or doubt.

785
00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:20.660
Um,
what would you say to those?
What would you say to those people?

786
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:23.240
Maybe my diagnosis is off,
off base,
but there's some,

787
00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:28.330
there are a lot of people who just kind of pour out every concern,

788
00:50:29.301 --> 00:50:33.320
worry,
fault,
mistake,
uh,
and,

789
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:38.990
and,
um,
okay.
It with the,

790
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.490
the label of vulnerability.
Um,

791
00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:46.700
so I'd just love to hear your thoughts on that.

792
00:50:46.701 --> 00:50:48.470
A word salad that I just dropped on you.

793
00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:54.310
<v 3>I love it.
I'm tracking 100% because I,
yeah,
it's,
yeah,</v>

794
00:50:54.311 --> 00:50:56.050
there's a very simple formula in my head.

795
00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:59.380
Vulnerability minus boundaries is not vulnerability.

796
00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:03.620
It can be desperation.
It can be oversharing,

797
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:07.360
it can be manipulation.
It can be a lot of different things,

798
00:51:07.361 --> 00:51:09.760
but it's not vulnerability.
Um,

799
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:14.260
we always have to hold awareness of boundaries and roles in our minds around

800
00:51:14.261 --> 00:51:15.094
vulnerability.

801
00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:18.730
We share with people who've earned the right to hear our story and we stay

802
00:51:18.731 --> 00:51:20.530
mindful all the time of the role we're at.

803
00:51:20.531 --> 00:51:25.531
And so one of the great examples I can give you is I'm with 50 CEOs from Silicon

804
00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:28.990
Valley and we've spent a long weekend together.

805
00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:33.550
And toward the end of maybe the first day one of them says,

806
00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:40.270
I came here thinking that I would never,
you know,

807
00:51:40.271 --> 00:51:44.080
believe in vulnerability are accepted,
but I am 100% on board.

808
00:51:44.081 --> 00:51:49.030
So I want to make sure I understand that I should stand up in front of,
you know,

809
00:51:49.031 --> 00:51:53.770
my investors,
my vcs,
and you know,
and say,
look,
I am in over my head.

810
00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:58.660
We are bleeding money and I do not know what to do next.
Right?

811
00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:03.070
And I said,
you know,
only if you don't want another round of funding,

812
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:07.870
should you do that?
I mean,
no,
that's,
that's super,
that's not appropriate.

813
00:52:07.871 --> 00:52:12.400
But let me,
you know,
let me ask you this.
If you had,

814
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.150
you know,
if you had,
I don't know,

815
00:52:16.151 --> 00:52:19.210
$50,000 invested with this leader,

816
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:24.670
wouldn't you be praying to God that he's sitting across from someone saying
that?

817
00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:28.390
Sure,
definitely hunter.
Right,
right.
I don't care if it's,

818
00:52:28.391 --> 00:52:33.391
whether it's his therapist and mentor and advisor because what the,

819
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:38.350
what the alternative is if he's really drowning in a river,

820
00:52:38.351 --> 00:52:42.250
has had and bleeding money and doesn't know what he's doing is to just keep

821
00:52:42.251 --> 00:52:45.910
grinding harder and harder on the same things he's doing

822
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:51.510
and not ask for help.
Right,
right.
Totally.
Yeah.

823
00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:56.110
And so when people say,
you know,
live tweeting your bikini wax,

824
00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:57.430
that is not vulnerability.

825
00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:00.380
<v 2>Sorry about that.
It was only once.</v>

826
00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.060
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,
if,
so,
if you could hold back a little bit,</v>

827
00:53:03.061 --> 00:53:05.970
10 we'd really all appreciate it.
Um,
no,

828
00:53:05.971 --> 00:53:10.260
or sharing intimate details of your children's reaction to your impending

829
00:53:10.261 --> 00:53:14.220
divorce on Facebook.
That is not vulnerability.

830
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:19.710
Vulnerability is the birthplace of intimacy,
trust,

831
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:23.010
connection,
creativity and innovation for leaders.

832
00:53:23.011 --> 00:53:24.930
It's the birthplace of trusted.

833
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:31.860
<v 2>Um,
but it's not permission to overshare.
Right,
right.</v>

834
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:36.780
Well,
I mean,
the,
the investor example is great because the,
if a,

835
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:39.870
if a CEO or founder gets up and says,

836
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:44.960
it provides the confession that you give us an example in front of a room that

837
00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:50.310
will almost inevitably respond by say,
Yanking,
um,

838
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:52.320
funding.
It's not a,

839
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:57.540
it's not a constructive use of that confession,
if that makes sense.

840
00:53:57.990 --> 00:54:00.540
Um,
and it's,

841
00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:05.100
I live in San Francisco most of the time and it's,
it's this,
this sort of,

842
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:07.750
this,
uh,

843
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.560
misinterpretations of vulnerability is oversharing,

844
00:54:10.561 --> 00:54:13.800
is very common among the kind of burning man,

845
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:18.450
a spiritual atheist sect.
Uh,

846
00:54:18.451 --> 00:54:23.400
and it's,
I think it's massively problematic.
I think it creates,
uh,

847
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:28.430
it's,
it appears to create many more problems than it solves a,
and,
um,
the,

848
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.170
let me use that as a segue.
So the,
the opposite.

849
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:36.660
I was interviewing a well known strength coach named Pavel Tsatsouline was

850
00:54:36.661 --> 00:54:41.610
originally from,
I think the run the Ukraine,
um,
nitty case,

851
00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:43.770
former Soviet Union.
And I,

852
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.730
one of the questions I asked him on the podcast was,
what,
uh,

853
00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:49.050
in your book,

854
00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:52.230
what do you write in your personal journal that you don't often talk about with

855
00:54:52.231 --> 00:54:55.820
other people?
And his head's there was,
well,
Tim,

856
00:54:56.190 --> 00:55:00.070
that is a very personal question.
And he proceeded to tell him

857
00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:04.860
and he proceeded to tell me that,
you know,
oversharing is,

858
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:07.980
is a big problem in the United States.
And I was like,
well,
you know,

859
00:55:07.981 --> 00:55:10.020
that's actually,
I feel like that's a fair response.

860
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:15.500
And so I wanted to ask you a question that's based on input from a number of

861
00:55:16.171 --> 00:55:21.171
listeners of this podcast and the here's the lead.

862
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:26.070
And I'd be very curious to hear your thoughts.
So

863
00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:31.920
there's lots of chatter about over feminization of boys.
Um,

864
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.910
how do you,
how do you,
uh,

865
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:41.990
how do you have vulnerability coexist with strong masculine virtues slash

866
00:55:42.121 --> 00:55:42.600
traits?

867
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:47.310
And I'm paraphrasing here and I'll just give another sort of contextual example

868
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:51.810
that a mayor,
and it may or may not be interesting to comment on.

869
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:57.200
So there's an expression in some military training that is suffer in silence.

870
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:03.570
And the idea is if you're going through hell week for the navy seals or

871
00:56:03.571 --> 00:56:04.404
something like that,

872
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:08.730
and you're carrying logs around and laying down in the freezing cold water,

873
00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:09.900
climbing under barbed wire,

874
00:56:09.901 --> 00:56:13.620
doing all of these just nausea and fear inducing things.

875
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:18.240
If you complain like,
my foot hurts,
this,
that,
and the other thing,

876
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:23.130
it will trigger more suffering in the people around you.
Um,

877
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.980
which I happen to agree with in that context.
Um,

878
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:31.930
so that's a lot at once,
but,
but,

879
00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:35.600
um,
what did,
what is your thinking on the,
uh,
the,

880
00:56:35.601 --> 00:56:40.601
the so called sort of over a feminization of boys and masculine virtues slash

881
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:47.050
traits versus vulnerability?
I mean,
how,
how do they coexist?
Um,

882
00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:48.610
and maybe that's not even the right question.

883
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.800
<v 3>It's a really good question.
And I,
I,
you know,
I work a lot with special horses,</v>

884
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:58.760
um,
and with the military and,
uh,

885
00:56:58.761 --> 00:57:00.320
and with that,
yeah.

886
00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:04.110
<v 2>May I add one more thing?
Just,
yeah.
Just so that I'm,
I'm not,</v>

887
00:57:04.111 --> 00:57:07.310
I people don't think I'm representing only the male side of this.
Yeah.

888
00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:10.250
A lot of my female friends,
um,

889
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.750
complained to me that,

890
00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:13.590
<v 4>okay,</v>

891
00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:16.890
<v 2>in a lot of urban centers in the u s San Francisco,
et Cetera,</v>

892
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:21.930
they can only find guys to date and they're looking for men to date.

893
00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:27.060
So it's not just this is,
this is a concern,

894
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.990
not just from the male side.
It seems to be coming from both sides.
So,

895
00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:32.490
sorry to interrupt,
but I just wanted to throw,

896
00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.220
<v 3>no,
I think it's really important.</v>

897
00:57:34.221 --> 00:57:37.310
So I have so much to say on it that overwhelmed.

898
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.960
I don't even know where to start,
so I'm going to just try to,
I am,

899
00:57:39.961 --> 00:57:44.000
I'm just like busting.
I've got over here.
Um,
okay.

900
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:46.513
So

901
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:54.450
these binaries,
uh,
you know,
tough and tender,

902
00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.680
masculine,
feminine,
you know,

903
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:07.930
I think we have to be really careful about this because if we,

904
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:13.130
when we start to talk about vulnerable to talk about,

905
00:58:13.131 --> 00:58:17.220
and in the context of my work,
you've gotten really wrong.
I'm like,

906
00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:20.900
okay.
Um,
if you talk about vulnerability

907
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:27.140
and vulnerability to me is courage.
And so when I,

908
00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:32.090
when I hear women talk about their inability to be with the vulnerable man,

909
00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:37.290
it's,
it makes tons of sense to me because,
you know,
I wish I could say,
you know,

910
00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:41.450
I think number one perpetrator of shame with men.

911
00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:46.580
We're all those,
you know,
shitty dads and terrible coaches and those buddies.

912
00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:51.560
But the number one perpetrator of shame with men is women.
Um,

913
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:53.300
and so I often say,

914
00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:58.540
show me a woman who can sit with a man in real fear and vulnerability.

915
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:04.790
I will show you a woman who's done her own work around vulnerability and doesn't

916
00:59:04.791 --> 00:59:07.460
derive her power or status from that man.

917
00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:13.900
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's in real fear and vulnerability.

918
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.710
And I'll show you a man who's done his own work around vulnerability and doesn't

919
00:59:18.711 --> 00:59:22.790
derive his power from being Oz.

920
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:25.250
The all knowing and all fixing.

921
00:59:25.251 --> 00:59:28.940
Because what men have a tendency to do when we're feeling vulnerable are afraid,

922
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:31.070
is try to fix it because it's how we're socialized.

923
00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:36.560
And so I think when you talk about how we're raising boys today,

924
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:38.260
<v 4>okay,</v>

925
00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:43.120
<v 3>here's what I can tell you from 150,000 pieces of data looking back,</v>

926
00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:46.120
um,
from what I've learned from men,

927
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:53.190
the men who were raised to be open and feeling and tender and loving and given

928
00:59:56.891 --> 01:00:01.891
no skills and no information on how to navigate boy culture and male culture do

929
01:00:05.081 --> 01:00:06.580
not do well,
right?

930
01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.580
The boys who were raised on how to navigate male culture,

931
01:00:12.581 --> 01:00:17.581
King of the hill and had no tools on how to be open and vulnerable and

932
01:00:18.071 --> 01:00:22.930
emotionally available do worse,
but they also don't do well.

933
01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.440
So it's about we need to stop with these fall separations between tough and

934
01:00:32.591 --> 01:00:37.060
tender.
You know,
toughen,
Tinder can coexist.
Um,

935
01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.450
and to me that's kind of this,
that's kind of the equation for Badass or it.
Um,

936
01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.540
and it can also exist in women like,
you know,
Grit and grace,

937
01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:50.320
tough and tender,
afraid and brave.
You know,

938
01:00:50.321 --> 01:00:54.240
this idea that we're either courageous or,

939
01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.330
or chicken shit

940
01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:56.660
<v 4>okay.</v>

941
01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:01.040
<v 3>Is just not true because most of us are afraid and braid at the exact same</v>

942
01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:02.390
moment all day long.

943
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:09.100
And so to take courage and vulnerability to,

944
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:14.840
to not teach that to our kids,
boys or girls

945
01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:20.750
is not teaching them how to be emotionally available or Tinder either.
Right?

946
01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:26.830
And so I think what concerns me is it about the need to drive a stake through

947
01:01:29.271 --> 01:01:32.990
the middle of these things.
Um,

948
01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:38.860
and I think that's what's really important.
I mean to be both.

949
01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:41.170
<v 2>Yeah.
No,
I,
and I agree with you.
I mean,</v>

950
01:01:41.171 --> 01:01:43.390
I think that they're not Benchley exclusive.

951
01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.990
There's no need for a false dichotomy.
It's,
um,

952
01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:52.740
I think a lot of it comes back to sort of choosing the appropriate environment

953
01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:58.930
for expressing that vulnerability,
if that makes sense.
It's a,

954
01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.350
it's a toughie.
It seems,
it seems tough.
I mean,
I,
uh,

955
01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:05.710
because you find men who have the armor plating on it and can never take it off

956
01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.060
that for what it's worth,

957
01:02:07.061 --> 01:02:11.320
the guys I've met who are operating at the highest level in say special forces

958
01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.740
do not have that problem.
Um,
they are,
they,

959
01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.980
they tend not to suffer from a lot of PTSD,
for instance.

960
01:02:17.981 --> 01:02:21.270
And they are very empathetic and emotionally attuned for them,

961
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.670
at least in this subset of folks that I've met.
Um,
but they've,

962
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.760
they've been subjected to just insane amounts of abuse and conditioning to,

963
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.690
for mental and physical toughness.

964
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:39.840
But at the same time I see them playing with their kids or with their wives and

965
01:02:39.841 --> 01:02:42.930
they're extremely present.
So that's,
but that's,

966
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:48.520
it's a tough needle to thread
as it can't be coming.

967
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:53.010
So speaking of just the challenges that people have with safe vulnerability,

968
01:02:53.011 --> 01:02:57.090
what are some daily practices or exercises that people can,

969
01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:58.523
um,

970
01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:03.780
contest to help them develop more vulnerability,

971
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.210
less shame,
et cetera?

972
01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.310
<v 3>You know,
I think it's interesting that you talk about,
you know,</v>

973
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:12.590
daily practices because I think vulnerability is a daily practice.

974
01:03:12.591 --> 01:03:15.980
And for a lot of us,
you know,
at least for me when it,

975
01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.630
when it was new,

976
01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:22.660
it was about trying on new ways of being and kind of testing it out.

977
01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:25.800
And one of the things that emerged from the data is this,

978
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:29.210
this idea of trust and the relationship between trust and vulnerability.

979
01:03:29.211 --> 01:03:31.880
And people always ask me,

980
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:36.110
you gain trust first and then you're vulnerable with people.
Um,

981
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:41.510
but the truth is you can't really earn trust over time with people without being

982
01:03:41.511 --> 01:03:45.800
somewhat vulnerable.
So it's a little bit of a back and forth.

983
01:03:45.801 --> 01:03:49.580
It's a little bit of,
um,

984
01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:53.180
sharing things that are maybe not super deeply personal,

985
01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:57.650
but are meaningful to you and seeing how that feels to share them and be open.

986
01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:01.910
One thing that you said that I've never thought about it until this interview,

987
01:04:01.911 --> 01:04:06.140
but it was such a remarkable,
um,
insight from you.

988
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:10.610
Did I want to go back to when you talk about daily practice is when you were

989
01:04:10.611 --> 01:04:15.450
talking about perfectionism being future focused,
um,

990
01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:19.070
and also kind of presenting some struggles about staying in the now.

991
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:24.910
I think that's why,
and again,
I'm just putting this insight together,

992
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:25.903
your insight.

993
01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:31.100
I think that's why a lot of people who are that Super Uber Competitive,

994
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:33.710
um,
high,
strong,
overachieving,

995
01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:38.390
don't get the same results in their personal lives with their partners and their

996
01:04:38.391 --> 01:04:43.070
children as they do in their professional kind of endeavors or their

997
01:04:43.071 --> 01:04:44.570
recreational endeavors.

998
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:49.940
Because our personal relationships with the people we love,

999
01:04:49.941 --> 01:04:54.260
those intimate relationships require a presence,

1000
01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:59.560
a focus on now that a lot of times professional success does not depend on that.

1001
01:05:00.421 --> 01:05:01.020
Yes,

1002
01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:02.520
<v 2>very true.
Yeah,
very true.</v>

1003
01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:07.630
<v 3>You can fly fast and if,
you know,
if you're in a little hole Cessna two seater,</v>

1004
01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.190
you got to,
you know,

1005
01:05:09.191 --> 01:05:13.870
you're in the here and now and you got to pay attention to every bump and every

1006
01:05:13.871 --> 01:05:16.270
gauge and pay,
you know.
But if you're in a jet,

1007
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.760
you can't afford to be thinking about now.

1008
01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:22.660
You have to be thinking about five minutes from now.
Um,

1009
01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:27.670
and so I thought it was a really remarkable and on your part because what I do

1010
01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:31.600
think about those 10 friends and Silicon Valley or I think about my own life

1011
01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:35.950
even I think what the research has changed most is it,

1012
01:05:35.951 --> 01:05:40.810
I think it has had a huge impact on my professional success,

1013
01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:46.240
but more than anything when I get home,
um,

1014
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:51.190
I walk into a marriage and her relationship with kids that is fun,

1015
01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:56.210
that are fundamentally different than they were before I became okay with

1016
01:05:56.831 --> 01:06:00.760
vulnerability and okay with less than perfect.

1017
01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:06.630
<v 2>But what does the first 60 to 90 days of a upset of 60,</v>

1018
01:06:06.631 --> 01:06:07.260
90 days,

1019
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:12.260
60 to 90 minutes of your day look like your morning routines or rituals outside

1020
01:06:12.691 --> 01:06:14.520
of book launch times and things like that.

1021
01:06:14.521 --> 01:06:19.230
Let's just assume that you have control of your,
your optimal day,

1022
01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.380
but what is the first,
uh,
what are your morning rituals look like?
What does your,

1023
01:06:22.381 --> 01:06:24.120
your first 60 to 90 minutes look like?

1024
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:28.730
<v 3>I wake up,
um,
what time do you wake up?
Six 30.</v>

1025
01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.780
I wake out,
I um,

1026
01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.330
do a lot of deep breathing to stay at off an absolute desperate need for a head

1027
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:41.570
of data,
um,
from my phone or from my computer.

1028
01:06:41.571 --> 01:06:44.810
So I tried very hard not to check email or texts cause I don't,

1029
01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:48.260
I sleep with my phone downstairs and I'll sleep with any kind of computer next

1030
01:06:48.261 --> 01:06:51.530
to me.
Um,
and then,
you know,

1031
01:06:51.531 --> 01:06:56.030
it's really super normal.
I wake up kids,
I make breakfast,

1032
01:06:56.031 --> 01:07:00.530
I pack lunches,
I go through the calendar with the day I zip up backpacks,

1033
01:07:00.531 --> 01:07:02.780
I drive carpool.
Um,

1034
01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:07.640
I usually get from Carpool pool to swim.
I'm a swimmer,
a swimmer,

1035
01:07:07.641 --> 01:07:12.560
so I like to swim and I swim and walk,
um,

1036
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:14.420
as plumbing is kind of the Trifecta for me.

1037
01:07:14.421 --> 01:07:18.640
It's not a meditation exercise and there'll be right.

1038
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:22.070
And then I usually start my day,
my work day.

1039
01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:23.920
<v 2>And what time,
what time,</v>

1040
01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:27.340
what time do you finish swimming and how long has the swim session?

1041
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:32.550
<v 3>Um,
if,
if I rent,
my best case scenario is I run and swam.</v>

1042
01:07:32.551 --> 01:07:34.530
And so I don't swim fast enough anymore.

1043
01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:37.080
A slim tight at times for many more like,
you know,

1044
01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:40.560
fifties on every 20 or anything like I used to.
So it's more,

1045
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:43.510
it's not as cardio is it used to be.
Um,

1046
01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.180
so I like to run on the treadmill for 30 minutes and then I like to swim for

1047
01:07:48.181 --> 01:07:51.600
half an hour.
Got It.
And if I was a bike rider,
I could be a triathlete,

1048
01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:52.680
but the bag,
the,

1049
01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:57.090
I tried it once and the bike going that fast next to that many people going that

1050
01:07:57.091 --> 01:07:58.920
fast is really uncomfortable for me.

1051
01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:00.540
<v 2>Yeah,
I'd imagine it.</v>

1052
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.080
<v 3>So I'm a,
I'm a do athlete.
Slow.
Do,</v>

1053
01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:09.170
<v 2>um,
what,
what book besides your own,</v>

1054
01:08:09.171 --> 01:08:12.070
have you gifted to other people?
Most,
but we're,

1055
01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.240
what book do you have you often given as a gift?

1056
01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:16.120
<v 4>Oh</v>

1057
01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:16.510
<v 3>Man.</v>

1058
01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:21.510
I have given so many copies of the outcomist two people that I should get a

1059
01:08:22.601 --> 01:08:23.610
little royalty on it.

1060
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:28.960
<v 2>Yeah,
that's a great book.
That's a great book.
Uh,
speaking of books,</v>

1061
01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:33.670
so you have a new book out,
rising strong.

1062
01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.510
And it seems to me like this

1063
01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:41.050
completes a trilogy in a sense.

1064
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:44.740
It seems like the three books go together very well,

1065
01:08:44.741 --> 01:08:49.630
but could you give people a description of the latest book and why you wrote it?

1066
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1067
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.080
<v 3>Yeah,
sure.
Um,
I think they do go together and I don't,</v>

1068
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:55.460
I wasn't intentional on that,

1069
01:08:55.461 --> 01:09:00.461
but I think the gifts is bu daring greatly as be all n and this book is,

1070
01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:05.630
it's your ass kicked to get up and do it again.
Um,
this is about,

1071
01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:06.910
<v 0>okay,</v>

1072
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:10.750
<v 3>just the physics of vulnerability.
You know,
if you're brave enough option math,</v>

1073
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:15.400
you're going to fall,
you're going to experience heartbreak,
disappointment,

1074
01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.420
failure.
It's going to happen.
And so going into this research,

1075
01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:24.421
the question for me was what do men and women who experienced falls and get back

1076
01:09:24.521 --> 01:09:29.080
up and are even more courageous and more tenacious?

1077
01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.490
What do they have in common?

1078
01:09:30.491 --> 01:09:33.760
So rising strong is about the process that emerged from that question.

1079
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.450
<v 2>And uh,
can you describe your,
your research method?</v>

1080
01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:41.610
How do you find your interviewees?
Um,

1081
01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.670
what is the sort of interview format look like?
A,

1082
01:09:46.690 --> 01:09:48.460
what do you do with the data afterwards,
et Cetera.

1083
01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.020
<v 3>About 70% of my interviews are individuals.</v>

1084
01:09:54.021 --> 01:09:58.400
And more focus groups in the last data set.
And so some of them,
like for example,

1085
01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:01.520
I went to West Point and sat down with,

1086
01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:05.880
I think there were six officers who had all come back from active.
Yeah.

1087
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:09.520
Combat duty.
So sometimes I'll do focus groups and,

1088
01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:13.520
but the majority of them are individuals.
A lot of it is snowball sampling.

1089
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:17.790
Meaning I've interviewed you 10 and I'm like,
you know what,
I'm really,

1090
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:18.920
this is really helpful.

1091
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.400
I would love to interview some of the folks that you know,

1092
01:10:22.401 --> 01:10:25.220
in Silicon Valley around perfectionism.
Um,

1093
01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.870
would you mind doing a warm introduction?
Right?
Um,

1094
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.440
and some of them are just kind of calls like this.

1095
01:10:30.441 --> 01:10:33.950
This book is a lot about the power of story and the stories we tell ourselves.

1096
01:10:33.951 --> 01:10:38.900
So I interviewed Shonda Rhimes,
the show runner for scandal.
And um,

1097
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:41.650
and so,
so some emerges,
you know,

1098
01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.270
it's a lot easier to get people now that it was when I first started and I was

1099
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:47.150
like,
hi,
my name's per day and I would like to talk to you about shame.

1100
01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:55.970
But,
but now it's more that,
you know,
I can now,

1101
01:10:55.971 --> 01:11:00.860
I just do mostly individual and in focus groups.
And so then I get the data.

1102
01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.100
I A,
we don't record it.

1103
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:07.520
I take what we call and the field anthropological field nuts.

1104
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:12.630
So I capture exact phrases and sentences during our interview.
Um,

1105
01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.900
I let participants look at them if they want you when they're done.
Some say yes,

1106
01:11:15.901 --> 01:11:16.734
some say no.

1107
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:22.040
And then I code what I learned against what I already know that for patterns and

1108
01:11:23.791 --> 01:11:25.020
saturation in the data.

1109
01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:30.210
Meaning if I am trying to study perfectionism and entrepreneurs in silicon

1110
01:11:30.211 --> 01:11:34.540
valley,
I'll start interviewing them and I'll know that I've reached saturation,

1111
01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:36.840
what I can predict,
what the next person's going to say.

1112
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:41.930
Because one of the really tough rules of grounded theory research are we don't

1113
01:11:42.451 --> 01:11:44.430
allow for any outliers.

1114
01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:50.340
And so if I'm almost done and then I sit down with you and you say something and

1115
01:11:50.341 --> 01:11:53.430
does it fit with the theory that I'm developing in my head about what's

1116
01:11:53.431 --> 01:11:54.264
happening,

1117
01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:58.440
then I have to go back to the drawing board and keep interviewing because every

1118
01:11:58.441 --> 01:12:00.510
lived experience is real matters,

1119
01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:06.060
<v 2>right?
So it would be like interviewing a hundred people in Silicon Valley.</v>

1120
01:12:06.061 --> 01:12:08.760
We're saying they're trying to democratize pizza,
ordering,

1121
01:12:08.761 --> 01:12:13.050
democratize a kitty litter delivery,
democratize this.
And then someone said,

1122
01:12:13.051 --> 01:12:16.470
I'm really looking to establish a silo of command and control,

1123
01:12:16.471 --> 01:12:20.170
like in North Korean dictator for X.
And he'd be like,
ugh.
All right,

1124
01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:21.000
well then I have to keep,

1125
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.050
<v 3>yeah.
If that happened,</v>

1126
01:12:24.051 --> 01:12:29.051
then I have to question what I'm hearing.

1127
01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.860
I have to question what I'm hearing from the Kitty Litter and the other folks.

1128
01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:37.460
Right?
And I have to figure out what,
what do y'all meaning,

1129
01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.250
what are y'all meaningfully say in co have in common?

1130
01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.160
<v 2>And uh,
it,
I mean it's,
it seems to me you're rising strong,
uh,</v>

1131
01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:50.160
is
it's a must have not a nice to have.
Right?

1132
01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:55.460
And I'm not saying that the be yourself dare greatly are nice to haves,

1133
01:12:56.341 --> 01:13:01.290
but if you don't have the resilience to recover from mistakes,

1134
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.370
you're never going to dare greatly in the first place in,
in,

1135
01:13:05.371 --> 01:13:10.140
in some respect it would seem right.
So if you,
if would you recommend,

1136
01:13:10.141 --> 01:13:12.690
what order would you recommend people read your books in?

1137
01:13:12.691 --> 01:13:16.860
I mean understanding that this is the latest of course,
but what,
what sort of,
uh,

1138
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.390
the ideal sequence?

1139
01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.790
<v 3>Yeah,
I think,
you know,
they go together,
but they don't,
I mean,</v>

1140
01:13:22.791 --> 01:13:24.620
I think they can each be read independently.

1141
01:13:24.621 --> 01:13:27.550
So I think sometimes it's helpful to pick up the book based on where you are.

1142
01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:30.470
If you're really struggling with the hustle,

1143
01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:32.880
hustling for perfection and hustle and you know,

1144
01:13:32.881 --> 01:13:35.780
proving and perfecting and pretending.
I think the gifts is great.

1145
01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.380
If you really are,
you know,

1146
01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:40.700
are the rest of us sick and tired of being afraid and you want to be braid and

1147
01:13:40.701 --> 01:13:43.670
you want to feel like,
what does that look like?
I think daring greatly is,

1148
01:13:43.671 --> 01:13:45.170
or is this place to start?

1149
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:50.030
And if you find yourself face down in the arena and you're thinking,
God,

1150
01:13:50.031 --> 01:13:51.620
I just got my ass handed to me,
I think,

1151
01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:57.020
I think strong would be a good place to start.
It probably makes sense.
You know,

1152
01:13:57.230 --> 01:14:01.610
there's a sequence.
So I think if you're just like,
wow,
I'm interested,

1153
01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:04.070
I would start with your and great.
I mean,
uh,
the guests.

1154
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:07.550
But I think I also think for your audience,

1155
01:14:07.551 --> 01:14:11.980
it's probably helpful to know that I spent the last couple of years exclusively

1156
01:14:11.981 --> 01:14:14.380
working with leaders and entrepreneurs.

1157
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:19.120
So daring greatly and rising strong have much more of my research from

1158
01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.580
organizations and from leaders that in the gifts does.

1159
01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.550
<v 2>Got It.
No,
that is helpful.
Uh,</v>

1160
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.510
just a few more questions and then we're coming up on time.

1161
01:14:27.511 --> 01:14:29.370
So I'll ask just a couple of rapid fire questions,

1162
01:14:29.371 --> 01:14:32.370
but the answers don't have to be rapid.
Um,
and I'm,

1163
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:35.760
I'm very curious about this one.
When you think of the word successful,

1164
01:14:35.761 --> 01:14:39.030
who is the first person who comes to mind for you and why?

1165
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:50.710
<v 3>You know,
what's so weird?
I don't picture anybody.
I,</v>

1166
01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:55.640
I picture the word redefine that.
That is such a,

1167
01:14:55.730 --> 01:15:00.520
that has been such a dangerous word in my research.
The word successful.
Yup.

1168
01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.400
Our success.

1169
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:06.430
I agree that I don't even use it anymore because what does that mean?

1170
01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:12.950
Like,
okay,
so I am the CEO of this company.

1171
01:15:12.951 --> 01:15:15.500
I make a shit ton of money.
This is my title.

1172
01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:17.630
This is the influence and power I have.

1173
01:15:17.631 --> 01:15:21.860
I'm on my fourth marriage and their relationship with my adult children.
Right.

1174
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:23.610
So I,

1175
01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:28.850
I think what I hear the word successful and my answer is be clear that your

1176
01:15:28.851 --> 01:15:30.860
ladder is leaning against the right building,

1177
01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:32.700
<v 2>right?
Yeah.
Bad word.
Next question.</v>

1178
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:35.050
<v 3>Yeah.
I Dunno why.</v>

1179
01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:40.060
<v 2>No,
no,
I,
I agree with you.
I think happiness is actually really similar.</v>

1180
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:44.750
Oh yes.
That's a,
that's a scary,
nebulous,

1181
01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:46.690
dangerous term as well.
Uh,

1182
01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:52.780
what $100 or less purchase has most positively impacted your life in recent

1183
01:15:52.991 --> 01:15:53.824
memory?

1184
01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:55.351
<v 3>Oh,</v>

1185
01:15:55.351 --> 01:16:00.140
a triathalon goggles because I don't know if for some reason they're softer and

1186
01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.280
so that I don't have goggle marks all day.

1187
01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:06.250
<v 2>Oh,
really?
I had no idea what a,
what do you know the brand of goggles off?</v>

1188
01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:06.900
<v 3>I don't,</v>

1189
01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:10.410
but they're like the most famous triathalon Ba and they're really patty and you

1190
01:16:10.411 --> 01:16:14.950
look like we all like swam with a speedo.
Vanquisher like little the goggles.

1191
01:16:14.951 --> 01:16:17.010
Sure.
That makes for a bad ass.
Um,

1192
01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:19.020
and the bigger your dog will the goofier you were,

1193
01:16:19.021 --> 01:16:20.990
but now it's time for the goofy Goggle for me.

1194
01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:26.340
<v 2>Yeah.
I really like the aqua sphere.
Cayman Goggles,</v>

1195
01:16:26.341 --> 01:16:30.960
k a I m a n and Laird Hamilton is this big wave surfer.

1196
01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:35.430
Yeah.
Uses,
uh,
I will look them up.

1197
01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:38.640
Goggles.
I just put them for those people interested in it,
put them in my latest,

1198
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:41.640
uh,
five bullet Friday.
You can just search my name and five bullet Fridays.

1199
01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:46.650
But um,
yeah,
it does seem like the bigger goggles coming back.
Uh,

1200
01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.970
if,
if you could have one billboard anywhere with anything on it,

1201
01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:52.890
what would it say in,
where would you put it?

1202
01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:56.463
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1203
01:16:57.250 --> 01:16:59.080
<v 3>I would put it in Washington DC</v>

1204
01:17:02.010 --> 01:17:03.450
and it would say,

1205
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:09.560
shut up and listen.

1206
01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:15.630
<v 2>That's great.
That's great that that can be put anywhere.</v>

1207
01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:18.210
I would love to put that on,
uh,
on the,

1208
01:17:18.211 --> 01:17:22.380
on the highway highway one on one to two 80 in silicon valley to cause men or

1209
01:17:22.381 --> 01:17:25.410
men or people talking a lot these days and pitching,

1210
01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:29.010
pitching really hard without asking many good questions.

1211
01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:31.840
<v 3>You know what?
I wouldn't say shut up cause my kids would be like,
oh my God,</v>

1212
01:17:31.841 --> 01:17:35.680
we're not even allowed to say that word.
So I would say talk less.
Listen more.

1213
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.940
But I in my heart I'd be saying shut up.

1214
01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:44.250
<v 2>Yeah.
We could split test.
It could,
it could be that,
that could be the Hashtag.</v>

1215
01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.730
Yeah.
Just shut your face.
Uh,

1216
01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.970
what advice would you give your 30 year old self?

1217
01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:03.610
<v 3>It's okay to be afraid.
You don't have to be so scary when you're scared.</v>

1218
01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:05.613
<v 0>Huh?</v>

1219
01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:10.480
<v 2>Meaning what?
Put on put on airs of confidence and</v>

1220
01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:15.130
<v 3>yes.
Yes.
Like the thirties or so exhausting.
It's like,</v>

1221
01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:19.960
yeah,
it is at the age of perfecting,
proving,

1222
01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:23.700
pretending.
Um,
and there's some liberation that can't.
Yeah.

1223
01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:26.020
For me that came in my fourth.
There was a breakdown of course,

1224
01:18:26.021 --> 01:18:29.470
but it followed by some liberation that came in my forties.
So I would just say,

1225
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:35.660
<v 0>you know,
every,
you know,
stop hustling.</v>

1226
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:39.190
<v 2>Right?
Yeah.
The uh,
you mentioned the breakdown,
the,</v>

1227
01:18:39.191 --> 01:18:42.160
the breakthrough disguise a breakdown.
Uh,

1228
01:18:42.490 --> 01:18:44.350
<v 3>did she say to your 30 year old self,</v>

1229
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:45.310
<v 0>okay,</v>

1230
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:48.270
<v 2>start meditating and show the fuck out.
That's,</v>

1231
01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:53.170
you don't need to,

1232
01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:58.290
you don't need to have resting pulse of 150 beats per minute to get a lot of big

1233
01:18:59.471 --> 01:19:03.910
things done.
There's similar messages.
Right?
Yeah,

1234
01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:07.390
very similar.
I think that,
well,
I think it's very easy for people,

1235
01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:09.400
and I'm sure I still do this,

1236
01:19:09.401 --> 01:19:14.401
but to mistake the symptoms of success with the things that cause success,

1237
01:19:15.970 --> 01:19:19.840
they're not the same.
Right.
Yeah.
Uh,

1238
01:19:20.230 --> 01:19:25.230
do you have any ask or request for all of the people listening?

1239
01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:29.050
Uh,
of course I would highly recommend that they check out your work,

1240
01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.630
including rising strong,
the latest book,

1241
01:19:31.631 --> 01:19:33.790
which I will link to in the show notes for everybody,

1242
01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.500
but any other ask request or recommendation for everybody listening?

1243
01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:48.220
<v 3>I would just say keep being part of the conversation about these tougher,</v>

1244
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:53.330
about these type of topics,
about vulnerability,
about shame,
about being brave.

1245
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.130
I'm just

1246
01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:01.630
lean into some discomfort because I think these,

1247
01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:07.170
what's the seemingly impossible problems that we have around race and homophobia

1248
01:20:10.591 --> 01:20:12.750
and the environment.
Um,

1249
01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:18.500
and just the lack of love sometimes are not going to be solved an uncomfortable

1250
01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:23.070
way.
We can't,
we've got to,
you know,
you have to choose comfort or courage.

1251
01:20:23.071 --> 01:20:26.670
You just can't have both.
So I guess my ask would be more of a,

1252
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:31.350
a big metaphysical ask that,
um,
give vulnerability a shot,

1253
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.510
you know,
and give discomfort.

1254
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:38.900
It's due because I think there is a really strong relationship between your

1255
01:20:40.021 --> 01:20:42.000
willingness.
He or she,

1256
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:47.430
who's willing to be the most uncomfortable is not only the bravest but rises the

1257
01:20:47.431 --> 01:20:48.264
fastest.

1258
01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:50.860
<v 2>Totally agree.
Well,
I think the,
the only,</v>

1259
01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:56.100
the only way to ensure long term comfort is to have continual short term

1260
01:20:57.610 --> 01:21:01.750
discomfort.
Yeah.
Well this has been a blast.

1261
01:21:01.751 --> 01:21:04.300
Bernay where can people say hello to you online?

1262
01:21:04.330 --> 01:21:09.250
Where can they find out more about you?
Find you on the social networks?

1263
01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:10.450
Okay.

1264
01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:11.283
<v 3>Yeah.
Um,</v>

1265

1267
01:21:19.391 --> 01:21:23.950
we just launched a new project that we're excited about called courage works,
um,

1268
01:21:23.951 --> 01:21:28.800
which is bringing all of my teachings to online,
um,

1269
01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:32.400
for individuals and leaders in organizations.
And that's just courage work,
stop,

1270
01:21:32.401 --> 01:21:36.040
calm.
Um,
and so I'm at,
I'm in all those places.

1271
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:39.350

1277
01:22:04.431 --> 01:22:07.760
continue this conversation as Bernay suggested,
but uh,

1278
01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:09.500
Pernay thank you so much for making the time.

1279

Practice discomfort.

1283
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:26.663
<v 1>Thanks for listening.</v>

1284
01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:35.190
This episode is brought to you by wealth front and this is a very unique
sponsor.

1285
01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:39.990
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way.
Set it and forget it.

1286
01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:44.340
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

1287
01:22:44.341 --> 01:22:45.090
investors.

1288
01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:48.810
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

1289
01:22:48.811 --> 01:22:51.780
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

1290
01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:53.160
some of my very good friends,

1291
01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:56.340
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

1292
01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:59.640
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

1293
01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:03.750
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

1294
01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:05.680
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

1295
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:09.460
And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

1296
01:23:09.461 --> 01:23:12.190
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

1297
01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:17.350
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

1298
01:23:17.351 --> 01:23:20.620
assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for

1299
01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:24.430
free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their

1300
01:23:24.431 --> 01:23:28.330
advice,
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

1301
01:23:28.331 --> 01:23:30.190
you can set it and forget it.
Here's why.

1302
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:34.540
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

1303
01:23:34.541 --> 01:23:37.930
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't.

1304
01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.600
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

1305
01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:44.290
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax

1306
01:23:44.291 --> 01:23:46.420
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

1307
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.920
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

1308
01:23:50.921 --> 01:23:54.640
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

1309
01:23:54.641 --> 01:23:57.250
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

1310
01:23:57.260 --> 01:24:01.450
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

1311
01:24:01.451 --> 01:24:02.920
impossible right off the bat,

1312
01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:05.470
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

1313
01:24:05.471 --> 01:24:10.471
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

1314
01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:14.800
free.
If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

1315
01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:19.960
that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.
Now,

1316
01:24:19.961 --> 01:24:21.600
normally when I have a sponsor on the show,

1317
01:24:21.601 --> 01:24:25.090
it's because I use them and recommend them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

1318
01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:29.440
I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

1319
01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:33.670
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of SCC regulations,

1320
01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:37.360
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials,

1321
01:24:37.361 --> 01:24:40.180
so I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast,

1322
01:24:40.630 --> 01:24:44.290
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

1323
01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:48.130
amount of my own money,
at least for me in the team and the company itself.

1324
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:51.220
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

1325
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:54.790
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

1326
01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:58.630
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account,

1327
01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:01.660
but just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

1328
01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:05.470
Take two minutes,
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash.

1329
01:25:05.471 --> 01:25:08.980
Tim It's fast,
it's free.
There's no downside that I can think of.

1330
01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:11.530
Now I do have to read a mandatory disclaimer.

1331
01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:15.370
