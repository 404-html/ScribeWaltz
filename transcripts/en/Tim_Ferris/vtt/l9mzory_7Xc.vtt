00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.680
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.
I know.

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.890
How else are you posting a question?

4
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.630
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by helix sleep.</v>

5
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.400
Last year I committed to making sleep a top priority,

6
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.590
trying to fix onset insomnia or continuing to fix that depth of sleep,

7
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:38.600
quality of sleep.
I tracked a lot.

8
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:43.601
I tested a lot and I revisited really everything from the daily routine to the

9
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:47.090
surface as I slept on playing with the chilly pad,
whatever.

10
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.610
And when I moved to Austin I got all new beds,

11
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.250
including mattresses from Helix,

12
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.970
working with the world's leading sleep experts.
Certainly some of them.

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.900
He looks sleep developed mattresses personalized to your preferences and sleep

14
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:04.220
style to make sure that you can have the best sleep possible without costing

15
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:05.930
thousands upon thousands of dollars.

16
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.190
He looks sleep has recently added a new layer to customize sleep with the helix

17
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:10.970
pillow.

18
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.450
The all new pillows are fully adjustable so you can achieve perfect comfort

19
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:18.380
regardless of sleep position or body type or if you're a shifty type like me.

20
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.910
I move around quite a bit when I sleep.

21
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.320
Just take their simple two to three minute sleep quiz to get started and that

22
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:28.730
will help ensure that they can build a mattress or pillow that you will love the

23
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:30.410
mattress,
whatever this be spoke,

24
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.640
mattresses that you arrive at a we'll get to you within a week and the shipping

25
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:35.540
is completely free.

26
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:39.020
You can try the mattress for 100 nights and if you're not completely happy,

27
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:40.970
they'll pick it up and offer a full refund.

28
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.170
I tested that refund policy because I test all of these sponsors and kick the

29
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:45.711
tires a lot.

30
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:50.180
We tested it and they came through and making sure that we got ultimately the

31
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:54.560
right mattress for my body.

This episode is brought to you by business wars.

37
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.480
People always ask me what podcasts I listened to and the truth is not many

38
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.050
because given all my other projects,
I don't have a ton of extra bandwidth,

39
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:27.560
but one new addition is business wars from the podcast network.

40
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.030
Wondery human history has seen hundreds upon hundreds of epic wars of course,

41
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:33.470
and often they're between nations,

42
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.690
but some wars are waged between large corporations are between startups and

43
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.330
large incumbents,
business wars,

44
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.540
which had been listening to teach you right into the middle of these battles

45
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.740
that are waged for control of your wallet and your attention ranging from say

46
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.520
the wars between Netflix and blockbuster or a Nike and Adidas,

47
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.120
two rivals and small businesses across the country struggling to survive in a

48
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:59.150
cutthroat world.
These stories really feel like dramatic.

49
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.170
I've been very impressed by the sound design also,

50
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:05.530
which I didn't think I would care about,
but it makes a huge,
huge difference.

51
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.260
And just to give you an idea of what you might discover,

52
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.100
did you know that blockbuster was actually catching up with Netflix until

53
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:12.731
corporate raider?

54
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:17.230
Carl ICAHN got involved and that episode is a fantastic one.

55
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.370
It's called sudden death.

56
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.390
It's the first episode in a multipart series that looks at blockbuster and

57
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:24.220
Netflix,

58
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.340
which I'm particularly interested in because it's not just two businesses in a

59
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:29.950
stagnant industry with stagnant technology.

60
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:34.450
There's a lot of different factors that come into play,
or did you know,

61
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.270
or do you know what marvel did to really get ahead of,

62
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:38.560
it's a much larger competitor,

63
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:42.130
DC comics of great interest to me since I was a comic book nerd and collected

64
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:46.120
comics when I was a kid or how sneakers went from athletic wear to everyday,

65
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.740
where this series explores all of that and more.
It's hosted by David Brown,

66
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.420
a former anchor of marketplace,

67
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.200
and it is an immersive sound design experience,

68
00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:01.201
not just some type of sterile business review that shares the untold and very

69
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:05.680
real stories of what went on behind the scenes with the leaders,
investors,

70
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:08.740
executives that led them to either new heights or to ruin.

71
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.240
Sometimes somewhere in between.

72
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.380
You can search for business wars on apple podcasts or wherever you're listening

73
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:19.381
to this episode right now or had to wondery.fm Ford Slash Tim that's w o n d e r

74
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:25.471
y.fm forward slash Tim to find business where it's a great show and I do not say

75
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:29.260
that lightly and I might suggest start with sudden death,

76
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.180
Netflix versus blockbuster.

77
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.850
Hello Ladies and gentlemen,

78
00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:39.030
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

79
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.440
My job is usually to deconstruct world class performers from different

80
00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:46.080
industries and sectors,
military entertainment,

81
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:51.081
business and so on to tease out habits and routines from people who have made

82
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.060
seemingly all of the right decisions.

83
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.570
This episode is very different and my hope is that it still provides learning

84
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.450
lessons and takeaways and helps you also to develop skills like empathy.

85
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.020
This came about because I interviewed a woman named cat hoke on this podcast.

86
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.110
She is the founder of something called defy ventures,

87
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:24.111
which uses entrepreneurship and job training to reduce recidivism among a prison

88
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:30.291
populations and she creates what she would call entrepreneurs in training e I

89
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.940
t's and inmates.

90
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:36.720
If you want to call them that are encouraged to use this as a new label for self

91
00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:39.690
identification and it's been very,
very successful.

92
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.490
When I spoke to her on this podcast,

93
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:45.180
I promised that I would visit a prison with her and that's exactly what I ended

94
00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:45.840
up doing.

95
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.400
Several weeks ago I visited a maximum security prison to experience the program

96
00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:51.234
that she started.

97
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.720
I struggled with trying to do this and production several times so I'm just

98
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:58.670
going to run with it and it's going to perhaps bounce around a bit.

99
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.391
It was a very,

100
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:04.391
very emotional trip and I thought I would actually borrow from my friend Dr

101
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.400
Peter Tia who also attended,
uh,

102
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:12.200
and recruited a number of people to go alongside him and he sent this out to his

103
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.710
newsletter and a,
I'm going to a bridge a little bit this week.

104
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:19.130
Tim Ferriss and I recruited a few friends to visit current state prison KRN

105
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.520
level four I he max security prison in California and the background then goes

106
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:29.150
into how to five inches is done work inside prisons like current in Pelican Bay.

107
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.591
He goes on to say,

108
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:33.500
cat is one of the most remarkable souls on this planet and nothing could prepare

109
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.660
me for what we experienced at Kern this week.

110
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.370
Rather than try to explain it in an email,

111
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:42.050
eventually discuss this in depth on a podcast,
and these are Peter's words.
Again,

112
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.140
many of the men came up to us as we were leaving with tears in their eyes to

113
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:48.200
thank us for coming to express their gratitude for the little bit we did.

114
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.650
What I don't think they will ever understand is that they gave us infinitely

115
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:52.970
more than we can give them.

116
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.290
I can not explain with words what it feels like to embrace a 32 year old man

117
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.790
who's been incarcerated since he was 13 in solitary confinement for 12 of those

118
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:05.270
years and admit our most shameful moments in life to each other.

119
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.990
So some of you might be listening to this back to Tim now and wondering what the

120
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:10.490
hell is Tim talking about?

121
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.420
And I'm going to use a statistic that I've heard several times.

122
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:18.320
Someone out there can fact check this,
but I believe it's accurate,

123
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:23.321
which is roughly 70% of people released from maximum security prisons are back

124
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.730
in prison within five years.
And,
uh,

125
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.770
this underscores a number of weaknesses and issues with number of societal

126
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:41.870
systems that we've put in place.
But suffice to say,

127
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.640
many of the people who are even convicted of murder are going to be released.

128
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.680
They're going to be your neighbors and there is a choice then rather than just

129
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:54.920
brushing it aside with,
they should just lock them up and throw away the key.

130
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:57.410
Since that's not going to be the case for many folks,

131
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.430
there's a question of whether you want people to be rehabilitated or not,

132
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.300
which type of neighbor having just come out of prison?
Do you want to have?

133
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.270
And uh,
there's,
there's much more nuance to it.

134
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:09.950
But that's one helpful at the lead into it.

135
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.400
And I began looking at programs with good results and unique approaches to

136
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:20.921
helping to fundamentally change how people view themselves and the world.

137
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.780
Uh,
and that is part of what I try to do.

138
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.880
And I learned so much at Kern that,
uh,

139
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.740
I want it to dig into it with this podcast,

140
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:35.000
but also to share with you the,
the footage,

141
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:40.001
the video footage that I recorded from the rare opportunity to actually sit down

142
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:44.840
with three men on the inside and to talk to them about the mistakes they'd made

143
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.340
when they turn things around,
what they've done when they slip up and so on.

144
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.820
And it applies to much more than people in prison are people who have committed

145
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:56.180
homicide or armed robbery.
I think it applies to everybody.
Uh,

146
00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:01.290
so I wanted to really paint a picture of the humanity in people who have done

147
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:05.250
terrible things,
no doubt about it.

148
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.900
They have suffered the consequences per the rules that we have in the societies

149
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:14.901
that we've built and are now attempting and changing their trajectories.

150
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.730
And we all have these different points in life when it's important to change

151
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:21.564
direction.

152
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.120
So I always special thanks first and foremost to all the staff and officers

153
00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:30.390
occur and including Chief Deputy Warren Goss who helped set up the interview.

154
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.523
Keeping in mind,

155
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.000
I couldn't even bring in an alligator clip because to hold pieces of paper

156
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:40.530
together because those can be fashioned into tools for cutting through doors.

157
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.640
I'm not making this up.

158
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.450
So to have the ability to walk in with cables and recorders and all of this was

159
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:49.130
really,
really incredible and unique.
I,
I again,
I,

160
00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:50.700
I knew I was going to struggle with this intro,

161
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.730
but I'm never going to get it quite right and I wanted to at least explain one

162
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:56.700
exercise we did was,

163
00:09:56.701 --> 00:10:01.701
we'll come back to Peter's words that was so incredibly powerful,

164
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.101
uh,

165
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:06.060
speaking to a number of the volunteers like me who are there to help as mentors,

166
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.390
listening to different pitches for new businesses and so on that these men hope

167
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:11.820
to launch when they get out of prison to sustain them.

168
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.870
The vast majority of volunteers I spoke with said it was one of the most

169
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.730
emotionally powerful experiences of their entire lives.
And,

170
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.720
uh,
I'm going to quote from a fast company piece that covered defy,
uh,

171
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.740
and describes an exercise called stepped to the line,

172
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:34.500
which if you have the opportunity to experience,
I highly,
highly recommend,

173
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:37.200
I cannot recommend it highly enough.
In fact.
So here we go.

174
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:39.390
I'm quoting from the piece.
The idea is this,

175
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:42.000
remember exercise step to the line hoke.

176
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.160
That's cat reads from a list of statements.

177
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:49.080
And if they ring true to any of the its I e the inmates or volunteers,

178
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.550
they stepped forward to the line.

179
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.820
And so there are two lines of tape on the ground about say 18 inches apart and

180
00:10:56.251 --> 00:10:57.660
they run for 20 to 30 feet,

181
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.850
maybe more because you could have say 50 to 100 EIT is and similar number of

182
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:05.040
volunteers.
All right,
back to the piece.

183
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.800
She'll eventually read several dozen of the statements and the group that's

184
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:09.300
steps to the line each time is different.

185
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:15.120
Or this piece took a place or was reported at Pelican Bay.
Uh,

186
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.100
I'm going to cut some of it up.

187
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.150
So she begins with statements designed to loosen folks up.

188
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.600
I was a class clown.
People step forward or not.
I'm madly in love.

189
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.240
I madly in love with Burritos.
Hahaha.

190
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.000
So people loosen up and this is important in any type of extras or interview.

191
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.080
Then she moves on to the harder stuff.
I've had my heart broken.
Again,

192
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:35.180
this is from a fast company piece.

193
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.530
Everyone in the room steps to the line except one EIT.

194
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.030
I dropped out of high school.

195
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.540
Almost every EIT steps forward with just one of the volunteers.

196
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.940
I've been in a fight to prove myself all,

197
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:48.540
but three of the EIT is move forward and then it's time for the really deep

198
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.600
stuff.
I grew up in poverty.
My mom or dad has been to prison,

199
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.520
at least one of my parents abused drugs or alcohol.

200
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.120
I was born to a teenage mother.
I became a teenage parent myself.

201
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:00.850
These are all separate questions and people step to the line or step back from

202
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:02.670
the line.
Uh,
and,

203
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.310
and pulling back just for a second to my experience or other questions that

204
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:11.311
really were a kind of a donkey kick to the psyche because they were

205
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:16.090
considerations I'd never made before.
Uh,
such as,
and I'm paraphrasing here,

206
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:20.770
but I grew up in a home with fewer than 25 books out of the volunteers.

207
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:25.120
Everyone stepped forward to the line of the EIT is two or three,
right?
All right,

208
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:27.880
back to the piece watching Hook and the EIT is you begin to understand the life

209
00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:31.840
stories of the people in the room just by how many steps align or how many did.

210
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.410
So again,
and again,
my parents talked me into bed and told me I was loved.

211
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.000
A few of the it step forward,
violence took place in my home growing up,

212
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.050
violence took place against me growing up.
Uh,
when I was 18,

213
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:47.890
I thought I wouldn't make it to 21 and it goes on and on.

214
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.260
Not forgiving others is hurting me and almost everybody is going to step

215
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:55.900
forward.
At least during my experience.
That was the case.

216
00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.240
And there are others such as have you ever sat behind the wheel of the car while

217
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:04.450
feeling the effects of alcohol?
Almost everybody's going to step forward.

218
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:09.430
And then I have been convicted of a driving while drunk,

219
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.170
uh,
and so on and so forth.

220
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.710
And then you see how circumstances,

221
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.020
certainly freewill and bad decision,

222
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:19.510
but also circumstances have led us all to where we are.

223
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.720
And that doesn't absolve anybody in prison of the things that they did.

224
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.980
But it does give you an appreciation for how things could have turned out

225
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:31.390
differently,
had a handful of circumstances,
had been different,

226
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.460
uh,
for even the volunteers.
And I know this intro is running long,

227
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.980
please bear with me.
Uh,
so this interview,

228
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.670
talking with these three men was really a profound experience for me.

229
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:48.210
And you can see the hope in these men that is created when they have an

230
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.600
opportunity to rebuild and redefine themselves.

231
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.950
Uh,
I was very,
very impressed and surprised,
uh,
by a lot of what I saw,

232
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.450
some incredible artwork,
uh,
and some incredibly well spoken people.

233
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.630
And when they take ownership of their pasts and are going to be getting out of

234
00:14:07.631 --> 00:14:11.500
prison,
the question comes back to you yet again.
Who Do you want back in society?

235
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.630
A rehabilitated person or not?

236
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.450
I'm going to mention two more things and we're going to jump into the interview.

237
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.320
If people want to go to prison and have this type of experience,

238
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.260
cat is still bringing people and now has five more prison trips lined up.

239
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.730
You can email admin at [inaudible] dot com c a t h o k e.com.

240
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:28.691
If interested,

241
00:14:28.691 --> 00:14:32.050
there are also other groups doing this type of work and make an impact like the

242
00:14:32.051 --> 00:14:34.330
anti-recidivism coalition arc.

243
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.390
You can find that at anti-recidivism dot org uh,

244
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:43.430
and I wanted to just mention one more thing and this was sent to me,

245
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:46.900
which is quite difficult through a,

246
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:49.900
I'm imagining two or three different intermediaries,
uh,

247
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.990
by one of the men who I interviewed for this podcast.

248
00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.410
And it was a followup on one of the questions that I had sent.

249
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:05.411
So this is a message from Jason who was interviewed and uh,

250
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.650
this is what he sent through the proper channels to get to me quote.

251
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:10.491
During the interview,

252
00:15:10.491 --> 00:15:14.090
Tim asked us a very important question that we feel was perhaps the most

253
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:17.330
important one of all.
He asked how we handle setbacks or slip ups.

254
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.450
And what we tell people who make mistakes along the way.

255
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.510
I felt like this was something that merited at least reaching out for.

256
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.420
If there's a way to include this,
that would be cool.
If not,
I tried.

257
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.500
It is unrealistic to think that a person could make drastic changes in their

258
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:33.260
life and charter new trajectory and then execute without failure.

259
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:36.620
Two steps forward.
One step back is not uncommon to that.

260
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:40.550
I've told others and still say that the key lies in not allowing oneself to

261
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:42.860
become discouraged to the point of a total regression.

262
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.430
Note the failure simply as a result that didn't get you to your objective and

263
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:49.010
then tweak your strategy accordingly.
Try,
try again.

264
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.490
It is often stated that those who are most successful in life are also really

265
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:53.480
good at dealing with failure.

266
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.120
We should use them as role models and view it as they do.

267
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.690
It's simply feedback that we can use to discern how our plan is working.

268
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.560
This is easier said than done,
but it's been done many times over.

269
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.320
Good luck and take heart because the best is yet to come.

270
00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:10.880
So this is what Jason would say to someone who has back slit.

271
00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:15.020
And that could be say you're trying to lose weight and then you end up eating a

272
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:15.820
box of cookies.

273
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.820
It could be that you quit smoking and you have a few drinks and much to your

274
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.590
later regret and shame that you pick up a cigarette could be any number of

275
00:16:24.591 --> 00:16:29.330
things.
Uh,
but you'll find a lot of shared humanity in this conversation.

276
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.320
And there are few quick notes.

277
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.630
The shoe is solitary confinement.

278
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:40.010
We initially only had 20 minutes allowed for this and then there was a bus

279
00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:42.200
malfunction for another group arriving.

280
00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:44.420
So I was able to stretch it out quite a bit.

281
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:49.310
I also realized after the fact that I shouldn't have asked about specific gang

282
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:52.660
names because there can be violent consequences.
Uh,

283
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.990
so I bleeped out one mention of that and with that very,

284
00:16:56.991 --> 00:17:01.280
very long introduction out of the way.
Thank you guys for the patients.

285
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.260
Please enjoy this conversation.

286
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:08.000
A very rare opportunity behind the wall in a maximum security prison to chat

287
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.700
with three men about their life stories.

288
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.980
All right guys.
So we're sitting here in the,

289
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.860
is this the visitation center sit in that?
Uh,
it looks like,
uh,

290
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.110
like I say a half circle table and it's my first time in a prison.

291
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.280
We are in a maximum security prison.
And I was hoping maybe we could start,

292
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:31.430
I know time is short.
Just on a quick round of introductions,

293
00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:34.250
just one at a time saying name.
It could be first name,

294
00:17:34.251 --> 00:17:38.810
full name and where you're from and how you ended up in prison.
Uh,

295
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.610
my name is,
uh,
Jason Holland.
I'm 41 years old.
Uh,

296
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.800
when I was a teenager I was living a reckless life,
misguided youth,

297
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:49.980
or actually I

298
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.130
<v 3>should say wayward youth because I have to take responsibility for my actions.</v>

299
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:53.964
But,
um,

300
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.300
I was making some decisions that clearly weren't good in my life and eventually

301
00:17:57.301 --> 00:18:00.720
it,
it resulted in me taking someone's life.
And at 19,

302
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:03.660
I was sentenced to life without parole for a felony murder.

303
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.460
And I've been in prison ever since.

304
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:07.150
<v 4>Thank you.</v>

305
00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:12.120
<v 5>Yes sir.
Tim,
welcome to prison.
Thank you.
My name is [inaudible].</v>

306
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:16.780
I'm 37 years old.
I've been incarcerated for the past 10 years.

307
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.520
Uh,
I am,
uh,
serving a sentence for two counts of armed robbery,

308
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.700
firearm deadly weapon.
Uh,

309
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.350
unfortunately I went through a really bad divorce in 2006.

310
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.870
I think that was perhaps the,
the significant event that kind of led me here.
Um,

311
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:38.890
I didn't cope well.
In fact,
I made all the right wrong decisions and,
uh,
I,
uh,

312
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:44.110
made some very poor choices.
Obviously I gravitated back to,
uh,
you know,

313
00:18:44.111 --> 00:18:47.940
the crowd that I used to run with when I was much,
much younger.
And,
um,

314
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.670
I'm here now and,
uh,
trying to,
uh,
trying to,

315
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.910
trying to try and make the best of a,
of who I am now.
Basically.

316
00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.040
<v 6>Uh,
my name is Brandon.
Uh,
when I was 21,</v>

317
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:03.810
I was incarcerated for murder.
I'm serving life without parole.

318
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.160
When I was younger,
I had some real issues,

319
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.250
socially reacting or interacting with people.

320
00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:15.060
It caused me to sort of compartmentalize my life among groups of people.

321
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.010
And it took an enormous amount of emotional energy to ups,
uh,
hope,
hold that.

322
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.570
And as it started to fall apart and I became desperate to latch onto these

323
00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:29.070
people,
that led me to make some really,
really bad choices.
And as a result,

324
00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:32.400
I've been incarcerated for the last 13 years in May.

325
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.270
<v 4>Thank you guys.
So I mean,</v>

326
00:19:36.271 --> 00:19:40.920
the question really in my mind as I'm getting educated here,
it's my first time,

327
00:19:40.921 --> 00:19:44.340
like I mentioned kind of on the other side of the walls,
uh,

328
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.360
is what,
what were the,

329
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:52.910
the moments or the conversations that led you guys to want to start building in

330
00:19:53.791 --> 00:19:54.870
a different direction?
Right?

331
00:19:54.871 --> 00:19:59.100
Because there are a lot of people here don't choose to change the path,
right?

332
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.190
And uh,

333
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.010
there's just recently some violence here and I understand the politics instead

334
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.780
of gang orders and so on here,
uh,

335
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.320
can be really complex.
I don't even pretend to understand it,
but like in,
in,

336
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.700
in your cases you've chosen to try to build in a different direction.

337
00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:16.850
So maybe we could just go it,

338
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:22.020
whoever wants to go first could just let me know what,
catalyze that.

339
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.150
<v 3>Okay.
That's a very good question.
Um,
I had been incarcerated for about 19 years.</v>

340
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:32.410
I was validated in issue as a shoe is the SST lockdown units,

341
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.970
a security housing unit.
Right.

342
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.440
And I was validated as a prison gang associate.

343
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:42.060
At that point I was housed in a deep seg section.
What gang were you part of?
A,

344
00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:44.720
I was associated with and

345
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.040
<v 5>in prison in this world</v>

346
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.300
<v 3>I had a lot of prestige.</v>

347
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:54.450
I had a lot of power and after 19 years I was sending in their shoe and I

348
00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:57.580
realized even though I had this much prestige and this much power,

349
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.120
I was living an empty life.
It was meaningless.
That was isolation.

350
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.450
Where you by yourself?
Yes,
I was by myself at that point and

351
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.290
one day a friend came to me and he was telling me about changes that were

352
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:15.550
happening in the law and he said,
look,
if you ever want to get out of the shoe,

353
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.250
you need to start making some decisions.

354
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.240
And I didn't want to take ownership of my life at the time.

355
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.630
And so I was arguing with them.
I was blaming everyone else.

356
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.600
And then he said something that I couldn't argue with.
He said,
look,

357
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:32.200
whether you realize it or not to your own decisions or decisions that you've

358
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:36.370
allowed people to make for you,
you put yourself in a box.
And at that point,

359
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.170
I couldn't argue with that.

360
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.500
And so I had to come to terms with that and I had to start making some real

361
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:43.360
decisions.
And that was a big moment for me.

362
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.880
And that was a friend on the inside here?
No,

363
00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:49.810
that was actually a friend from the outside.
Yes.
And uh,
he kind of hit it.

364
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.800
He hit me with the hard truth and then I started realizing what do I want from

365
00:21:53.801 --> 00:21:54.101
my life,

366
00:21:54.101 --> 00:21:56.740
where I started asking myself to a strong questions and I had to start making

367
00:21:56.741 --> 00:22:00.220
some strong decisions.
And from there it's been a path of growth.
What were,

368
00:22:00.221 --> 00:22:04.330
what were some of the first or the first kind of decision that you made that was

369
00:22:04.331 --> 00:22:07.540
different from how you would've made decisions in the past?
Well,

370
00:22:07.541 --> 00:22:09.400
first I had to start taking responsibility.

371
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.370
I had to start realizing that I was the one that was creating my circumstances.

372
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.900
It was no one else.
And then if I wanted to change things in my life,

373
00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:18.190
what were the decisions I had to make?

374
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:22.150
And so the first thing I needed to do was just get away from what I had been

375
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:25.840
accepted for myself,
and that's been involved with gangs and criminal activities.

376
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:30.310
And so once I disassociated and left and it was from there,

377
00:22:30.311 --> 00:22:31.150
what do I do now?

378
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.590
But it was just a matter of reconstructing my identity and finding new values.

379
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.540
And at that point,
when you left the gang,
you then move from one section of,

380
00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.960
was it at this prison?
No,
it was a different prison.
Didn't Corkran.
Got It.

381
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.380
And where you then you were moved to a different location within the prison,

382
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:50.710
or was this to a different unit for people that were going through that process?

383
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.850
Got It.
Yes,
sir.

384
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.340
<v 5>Uh,
for me,
uh,
God,
what I guess what I can,</v>

385
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.130
I can start in 2013,
uh,

386
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.680
back then I was a member of a prison gang here.
Um,

387
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.700
and for the most part,
you know,
I've,
throughout my prison career,
as we call it,

388
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:14.140
uh,
assimilated completely the,
my environment.
I,
um,

389
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.320
which gang was that?
I'd rather not say.
Yeah.
Okay.

390
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.470
Well fine and I can take it out later.
It's,
um,

391
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.420
I was part of the problem here.
Yep.
Clearly.
And I remember,

392
00:23:25.421 --> 00:23:28.660
I think the moment that Kinda changed everything changed for me was,
uh,

393
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.950
I was assigned to education and that education,

394
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:37.650
just regular ab one 82 83 just regular adult basic education.

395
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:42.110
I was,
I was assigned there so that I can eventually earn my GED.
Yup.

396
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.940
And I,
you know,

397
00:23:43.941 --> 00:23:46.280
was sitting in the back doing all things that I shouldn't be doing with the

398
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:49.100
homies and I just,
I feel tired.

399
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.420
I got tired of it and I just didn't want to be there anymore.

400
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:58.340
I,
uh,
had two ways of going about it to get out of education.

401
00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.100
At least that's what I thought at the time.

402
00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:05.130
There was actually a third way I decided to just take the GED test and that way

403
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.780
I would be able to get out of there.
And that's exactly what I did.

404
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.540
I took the GED test and I passed it.
I,
uh,

405
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.270
showed up about two months later,

406
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.420
I got called up to receive my certificate and we'll,

407
00:24:17.421 --> 00:24:20.810
I was standing in line waiting to get my certificate.

408
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:25.820
Somebody who was ahead of me made a comment about,
uh,

409
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:30.810
you know,
now going to college because,
you know,
now he was,
he had a GED.

410
00:24:30.811 --> 00:24:32.780
He was a high school graduate and he was going to go to college.

411
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.760
But the way that he said he was being sarcastic,

412
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:39.230
but he said in a way where someone in the room turned around and looked at them

413
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.680
with like this look of disgust,
disbelief.

414
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.280
And it just so happened that at that precise moment he turned and looked at me

415
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.690
and I caught the full force of that look at that discussed.

416
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:55.130
And it angered me because back then my mentality was completely different.

417
00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.590
And I kind of set out to prove from that point forward that,

418
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:03.080
you know what,
look at me,
how you want to look at me,

419
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.410
but I'm going to prove to you that even a gang member,
even someone like me,

420
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.720
can get a college education back then.
Uh,
the college programs were very,

421
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:14.900
very scarce.
Uh,
it took a moment for me to,

422
00:25:14.901 --> 00:25:17.090
it took a little while for me to even find,
you know,
the,
the,

423
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.830
the college coordinator on the facility.

424
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:23.090
And I wrote a couple of community colleges.
Eventually there,
they wrote back,

425
00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:26.540
I got it,
I got it.
I got into,
uh,
into lasting community college up north.

426
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.810
And I started taking correspondence courses.
And so here I am,

427
00:25:30.811 --> 00:25:33.860
I'm sitting in a housing unit filled with all my homeys because here in this

428
00:25:33.861 --> 00:25:36.710
facility,
the house,
all the gang members together,
uh,

429
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.820
just to kind of control the violence on the yard.
And you know,

430
00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:45.140
after the first year here I am,
you know,
knee deep in,

431
00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:49.910
in college work,
studying sociology,
psychology,
philosophy and just,

432
00:25:49.911 --> 00:25:51.260
you know,
really taking it on.

433
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:56.540
And the one day I just kind of looked up and I realized I don't belong here.

434
00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.880
I was completely out of place,

435
00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:02.740
meaning in the gang and bars in the gang environment.
And you know,

436
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.350
for the first time I was able to kind of see the world through a clear lens.

437
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:11.210
So for me it was definitely education and that was five years,

438
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:15.290
five years now.
And uh,
I've earned several college degrees.

439
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.830
Uh,
and,
you know,
it's,
it's,

440
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.700
I can honestly say that education truly transformed me.
Uh,

441
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:28.070
I was still stuck there and it took someone in the administration to give me an

442
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:29.990
opportunity to change,

443
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.030
to really make that transition into who I wanted to be.
A associate warden Goss,

444
00:26:35.031 --> 00:26:38.420
who's a at the time was the captain on our facility.
Uh,

445
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:42.350
he gave me that opportunity.
So it wasn't just me wanting to,

446
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:47.490
I needed help.
And fortunately I was able to find that here.
And,
uh,
you know,

447
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.480
I've,
it's been a sprint since and I haven't stopped.
Thank you.

448
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.920
<v 6>Well,
so I'm kind of the odd man out and a lot of ways.
All right.</v>

449
00:26:55.921 --> 00:26:57.820
So I was never in a gang.
Uh,

450
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.440
I came in and I was the guy who was going to be used up on the main line.

451
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.960
I was the guy they were going to give the knife and say,
Hey,
go get that guy.

452
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:08.990
What is used up on the mainland side pretty much means that I was expected to do

453
00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:11.340
the dirty work as it needed to be done.

454
00:27:11.341 --> 00:27:16.280
And then when I was caught up and washed up and done and done in or whatever,

455
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:19.890
nobody was going to really worry about it too much because I wasn't in the mix.

456
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:24.660
You know,
I wasn't in that whole politic side,
so I did that exactly once.

457
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.140
Um,
what does it,
could you just elaborate on what that means?

458
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.800
So guy came up to me on the yard and he basically said,
hey,
this guy,

459
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:35.070
we need to jump on him because he owes money.
And I tried to get out of it,

460
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:36.960
but I really didn't have a lot of options because they said,

461
00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:39.750
we're doing this in about two minutes.
I got it.
And you're like a free agent.

462
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:44.250
I was a,
I was not a free agent.
I always associated held in the matter.
Well,
yeah,

463
00:27:44.251 --> 00:27:48.240
I was,
I was a free agent who was told you're going to do this.
So I did it.

464
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.340
It was,
it was cowardly.
I hate it.
Right.

465
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:55.460
But I did it and I ended up in doing a shu term like Jason,

466
00:27:55.771 --> 00:27:58.920
but much shorter,
right?
And eat in here.
I got out,

467
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:03.180
I came to another law mainline yard and they asked me to do it again and I said,

468
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:07.890
no,
we're not doing that.
So they jumped on me instead.
So that was fun.
Uh,

469
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:11.340
I came over here a two s and why that's the,
uh,

470
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.920
when you're not associating with the mainline politics.

471
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.710
So I just kind of figured out what fly under the radar.

472
00:28:17.711 --> 00:28:20.190
I was just going to do my own thing on my own by myself.

473
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.960
And slowly but surely just started to get into a couple of things,

474
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:29.460
get talked to certain people work.
Uh,
I wrote an article for our newsletter,

475
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:30.451
things like that.

476
00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:33.900
And it eventually led to me getting offered a job in the chapel,

477
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:38.720
which if you'd had told me when I was say 21 that I'd be working in a chapel of

478
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.270
the answer would have been zero because I was 21 and knew everything and was

479
00:28:42.271 --> 00:28:44.640
this militant atheist and blah,
blah,
blah.

480
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:49.530
So the idea was absolutely unheard of.
But I was really desperate for something.

481
00:28:49.531 --> 00:28:51.300
I needed to have something to do.

482
00:28:51.301 --> 00:28:56.220
So I took the job and I remember having a conversation with my boss,

483
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.530
a chaplain Krantz or shout out to the,
you know,

484
00:28:58.531 --> 00:29:02.580
the chaplain and he sits me down and he basically says,
so tell me,

485
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.360
tell me about how you look at things.
So I gave him this really profound,

486
00:29:06.361 --> 00:29:10.170
like 30 minute conversation about how I knew everything and everything was

487
00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:13.590
relative and this and that,
and I might be paraphrasing this,

488
00:29:13.591 --> 00:29:17.790
but he basically sits back and he goes,
wow,
that's really stupid.

489
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.153
And,
uh,

490
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:26.270
I reflected on that for a while and he started to systematically over the next

491
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:26.461
few months,

492
00:29:26.461 --> 00:29:31.110
just like breakdown every stupid little belief I had and slowly but surely

493
00:29:31.111 --> 00:29:35.550
started to turn me around.
So I give him a lot of credit,
uh,
for me,

494
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.170
kind of go and positive as it were and kept kept hospital.
Sure.

495
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.340
What were some of the new beliefs

496
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.430
<v 7>that that ended up being most helpful to you?
The biggest,</v>

497
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.550
<v 6>the thing,
the biggest teaching that he gave me,
um,</v>

498
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:52.610
was the theory of a teleology Tele Os,
right?

499
00:29:52.611 --> 00:29:56.870
So all people have an inherent human dignity.
Everybody has a potential.

500
00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:00.680
And if everybody has this dignity in this potential,
in everybody is valuable,

501
00:30:00.681 --> 00:30:04.220
every human life is valuable,
we should treat them.
So,
uh,

502
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.920
so this was the basis of a morality that I never had.

503
00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.920
Everything I thought was relative.
And if it's good for me,
it's good for me.

504
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:11.240
It's good for you,
it's good for you.

505
00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:16.130
And that's a bunch of crap that doesn't work.
That leads to a very bad place.

506
00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:20.480
So this whole concept now and really driving it home,
and it was,

507
00:30:20.481 --> 00:30:22.940
it's been 16 months in the making so far.

508
00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.620
But that for me has been the pivotal thing is just understanding concepts of

509
00:30:27.621 --> 00:30:32.030
morality.
Going from an atheist to a guy who somewhat of an audit agnostic who

510
00:30:32.031 --> 00:30:35.100
acknowledges there's a higher power but doesn't know what it is yet.
Uh,

511
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.740
so for me,
that's a huge shift.

512
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:41.930
And so I credit that to me getting into the things that I recognize as enforcing

513
00:30:41.931 --> 00:30:45.680
morality or reinforcing human dignity and the idea that everybody is valuable.

514
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.280
<v 7>Thank you.
I'd love to hear from you Jason.</v>

515
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.450
Basically the same question.
I mean like how,

516
00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:57.451
how has the way you looked at the world changed or what beliefs or habits have

517
00:30:58.231 --> 00:31:03.231
really helped to keep you on a better path or to help you to feel like you're

518
00:31:04.261 --> 00:31:05.280
building towards something?

519
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.490
<v 3>Okay,
very good question.
Um,</v>

520
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:14.340
so when I first left the shoe and I was going through this process of basically

521
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.660
reconstructing my identity because I had this persona before and now it's gone

522
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.020
right when you had status too.
Yeah,
I did.
And um,

523
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:24.330
so I come over here and I didn't really know what to do.

524
00:31:24.331 --> 00:31:28.380
I started reinvesting in my education because I didn't know really what to do.

525
00:31:28.381 --> 00:31:29.610
I started getting any of these groups.

526
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.590
And then what happened was I was really lucky.

527
00:31:31.591 --> 00:31:35.940
I came to this yard and I met these guys and I started working around them and

528
00:31:35.941 --> 00:31:38.280
then I started getting introduced to this,
some of the same ideas.

529
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:41.460
How did you guys meet dignity?
Well,

530
00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:47.080
it was just kind of on the yard,
but they knew I was coming.
They knew that my,
um,

531
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:50.910
my brother and I were coming here and so we kind of make a splash where we go

532
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:55.350
and we got introduced one way or another and eventually I started working with

533
00:31:55.351 --> 00:31:56.910
them and I saw what they were doing,

534
00:31:56.911 --> 00:31:59.400
what they were doing here with the program and the pioneer and all these

535
00:31:59.401 --> 00:32:00.960
different things,
these interesting things.

536
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.810
And at this point I started changing my,

537
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:09.510
my whole perspective around in mostly the biggest thing for me was I knew that

538
00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:10.140
if I wanted,

539
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:15.140
I knew what I didn't want and I knew I had to get rid of criminality out of my

540
00:32:15.211 --> 00:32:19.350
mindset.
And I knew I had to get stopped cutting corners.
And then like I said,

541
00:32:19.351 --> 00:32:20.370
when I started working with Damien,

542
00:32:20.371 --> 00:32:25.110
started getting introduced the idea that of human dignity.
So human dignity,

543
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.620
doing things in the right way,
it's not doing it.
I'm in a criminal way.

544
00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:32.370
And from there my whole perception started changing on how I approach people,

545
00:32:32.371 --> 00:32:34.570
how I approach situations.
Um,

546
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.760
how I identify options to solving challenges and problems finding,

547
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.200
seeking out mentors,
things like that.
So that's basically,
and it's,

548
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.480
it's still an ongoing process.
So it sounds like

549
00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.010
<v 8>the three of you spending time together as,</v>

550
00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:52.200
I mean maybe I'm taking it just got a one degree further than what I'm hearing,

551
00:32:52.201 --> 00:32:56.110
but it seems like that's been important.
Absolute crucial.
Yeah,

552
00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.690
absolutely.
Uh,
it's,
we're,
we're a team here.
We've kind of,
you know,

553
00:33:00.691 --> 00:33:03.570
through all the things that we've been able to accomplish it on this facility,

554
00:33:03.571 --> 00:33:07.890
we've been able to kind of form a community of sorts.
And it,
it's,

555
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:12.090
it's really a team effort upfront.
I know that for me,
you know,

556
00:33:12.091 --> 00:33:15.290
even the whole change process,
you know,
it was a process,
uh,
by,

557
00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:18.090
I had to first come to that realization that I can do better,

558
00:33:18.091 --> 00:33:22.530
that I could be better.
Uh,
I had to accept it and I had to believe it.

559
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.280
And that's what we try to get guys to do on the facility,

560
00:33:26.281 --> 00:33:28.830
on the yard is believe it.
You know,
believe in yourself.

561
00:33:28.831 --> 00:33:31.770
Believe that you can be better,
you can do better.
You convince them of that?

562
00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.390
It's like when you approach somebody for the first time a

563
00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.700
<v 6>choose the person you approach.
And then what do you say?
And I mean anybody can,</v>

564
00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:44.110
can hop in.
Uh,
it takes a,
one of the,

565
00:33:44.111 --> 00:33:47.700
one of the things is,
is being in the right place at the right time.
Um,

566
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.800
we have self taught and picked up and question other people about everything

567
00:33:53.561 --> 00:33:58.240
from effective communication techniques to ways of getting people over twisted

568
00:33:58.241 --> 00:34:00.280
values.
I mean,
why do you guys do it?

569
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:06.210
Because I speaking for myself just because I'm a masochist and it needs to be

570
00:34:07.241 --> 00:34:12.190
done.
Yeah.
Uh,
when I look out at some people,
uh,

571
00:34:12.191 --> 00:34:15.430
here or anywhere else for that matter,
you watched the news,
you watch TV,

572
00:34:15.431 --> 00:34:20.050
any of it.
It just sometimes feels like people are skin and bones,
you know,

573
00:34:20.051 --> 00:34:24.430
there's,
they need some,
they need to be fleshed out a little.
And me too,
you know,

574
00:34:24.431 --> 00:34:29.200
I'm,
I'm just as bad.
But I think that,
uh,
it's,

575
00:34:29.201 --> 00:34:32.500
it's a communal thing everybody needs to be pitching in because nobody,

576
00:34:32.501 --> 00:34:36.520
no man is an island.
Yeah.
Uh,
so we just need to be there.

577
00:34:36.521 --> 00:34:39.160
We need to be available,
we need to be intentional.

578
00:34:39.161 --> 00:34:43.810
We need to really try to help everybody elevate themselves because uh,

579
00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.230
if we humanize everyone rehumanize ourselves and if we cut people down,

580
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.610
we're just cutting ourselves down too.

581
00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.830
And it applies here in on steroids.
Well,

582
00:34:53.831 --> 00:34:55.360
it seems like everything's magnified here.

583
00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.770
It think things are a lot more intensified.
It's a lot more potent here,

584
00:34:59.771 --> 00:35:04.330
at least in my opinion,
because everybody hears a little extreme in some ways.

585
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.440
<v 3>Yeah.
You never know.
That's the thing.
You never know who it's going to be.</v>

586
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:09.880
When the light bulbs going to click,

587
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:14.110
where it's going to go on you just one day we can be working on a guy for a
year,

588
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.930
just trying to have the right exchanges and interactions with them.

589
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.190
And one day he just gets it.

590
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.670
Or is it another guy we could think he's making progress and then something

591
00:35:21.671 --> 00:35:24.910
happens and only have to come in and try to help him and see what happened.

592
00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.320
What are some of the

593
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:32.080
<v 8>approaches or expressions or concepts that you've seen help redirect people?</v>

594
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:39.030
Like when you see people click,
and I,
if you could jump in on this,
I think,

595
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.930
I think the biggest thing,
and for me it's,

596
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.240
I've been there so I know what it feels like to not have hope and I have
purpose.

597
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.130
There are a lot of guys in here who are lacking those two things and I know

598
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:57.630
where it was like hope and purpose in there.
It's very,
very powerful.
Uh,

599
00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:01.010
and that's what we try to give them.
You know,

600
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.630
we try to give them a dose of purpose,
you know,
uh,

601
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:06.870
whether it's through some sort of program or whether it's just on one on one

602
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:10.680
interaction,
which might the program look like.
Well,
just for example,
defy,

603
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:15.590
defy ventures has been amazing on this facility because it's,
it's a holistic,

604
00:36:15.591 --> 00:36:17.280
a more holistic,
it takes a holistic approach.

605
00:36:17.281 --> 00:36:21.390
It's not just entrepreneurship training,
it's,
it teaches character development.

606
00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:24.630
It brings you closer to your family and it really gets you thinking about who

607
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:29.170
you are and who you can be most importantly.
And it's,
it's,

608
00:36:29.171 --> 00:36:31.650
it's been hugely successful here because of it.

609
00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.960
<v 3>I would add into empowerment because I think a lot of the guys that we interact</v>

610
00:36:37.001 --> 00:36:39.100
with and myself included for a long time,

611
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.580
I just didn't recognize my potential or think that I really had any worth

612
00:36:42.581 --> 00:36:45.070
investing in.
And I think that a lot of these guys feel that way.

613
00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:49.570
And a big part of what we do is we engage that and we challenged them to look at

614
00:36:49.571 --> 00:36:51.280
their potential and actually rise to it.

615
00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.200
And I think that we do that to best that we can,

616
00:36:53.201 --> 00:36:56.660
that we're currently able to do and we're trying to get better at it.
Thank you.

617
00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.380
I think one of your,
I mean the standard approach,

618
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:04.030
like on the like institutionalized kind of formal level of any of these things

619
00:37:04.031 --> 00:37:07.670
is your program that you would have defy,
um,

620
00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.830
<v 6>a,
any of these groups you have contents,</v>

621
00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:16.270
some sort of accredited content,
right?
So there's a curriculum,
there's a book,

622
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.210
there's a time honored,
there's 12 steps,
Oxford principles,

623
00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:20.620
you have a dosage rate.

624
00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:26.140
These guys will go to this group for x number of hours every week over a course

625
00:37:26.141 --> 00:37:27.640
of a year.
That's x number of hours.

626
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.940
And then you have motivation and you get a result.

627
00:37:30.941 --> 00:37:35.941
And the result could be something like 22% reduction in recidivism for substance

628
00:37:36.521 --> 00:37:38.230
abuse,
something,
right?
Yeah.

629
00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:42.850
The trick is the hard one to quantify is the motivation.
Right?
Right.

630
00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.650
So that's where the hope and the purpose come in because a guy can sit in a

631
00:37:47.651 --> 00:37:52.330
chair all day long.
A guy can answer questions on a worksheet all day long,

632
00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.780
but unless he has the hope,
unless he has the need for a purpose,

633
00:37:55.781 --> 00:37:58.120
unless he has the family begging him to get better,

634
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.810
unless he has his buddy that he's watched move on and is now,

635
00:38:01.811 --> 00:38:03.940
it's like waiting for him to catch up.
Right.

636
00:38:03.941 --> 00:38:06.610
You need to create this sense of people,
uh,

637
00:38:06.611 --> 00:38:11.380
that you can rely on and that are relying on you in some sense and the

638
00:38:11.381 --> 00:38:13.780
realization that you're part of a bigger community.

639
00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.540
That sort of step in maturity,
that,

640
00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:20.570
that growing up process because otherwise the entire formula,

641
00:38:20.571 --> 00:38:23.800
it's just going to fall apart.
Yeah.
No,
it's so true.
I mean,
you can take,

642
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.260
you can take the content and shove it down someone's throat.

643
00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.660
You can make them sit in the chair,
but if,

644
00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:33.220
if they're mentally sort of teleporting to a different place,

645
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:36.100
and like you said,
the motivation is there just

646
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.070
<v 4>because it's harder to quantify.
It doesn't make it any less important.
Exactly.</v>

647
00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:42.310
<v 5>And that's why here,
especially on this facility,
uh,
you know,
we,</v>

648
00:38:42.311 --> 00:38:43.470
we say that time and again,

649
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.620
what we're trying to do here on this facility is we're trying to,

650
00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.340
we're trying to create change,
but from the inside out rather than outside in,

651
00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:53.280
because you can throw so many programs that people just,
like you said,

652
00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:57.780
so much curriculum that,
you know,
half of it probably won't stick if that,

653
00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.470
so it's,
it's a,
it's a process.
It's an internal process.

654
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:05.430
It's an individual process because,
you know,
just like out there in society,

655
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:09.500
everyone in here,
even though there are some commonalities,
everyone's different.

656
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.540
They've been through different experiences that have led them to be who they
are.

657
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:17.130
So it's,
uh,
it's hard work,
but it works.
Uh,
you know,

658
00:39:17.131 --> 00:39:22.080
giving a person hope,
giving a person purpose.
Uh,
especially here,

659
00:39:22.081 --> 00:39:26.820
we've,
we've been able to kind of track the progress of individuals who actually

660
00:39:26.821 --> 00:39:30.000
participate in our rehabilitative programs,
educational programs.

661
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.920
Just like right now,
I can let you know,

662
00:39:31.921 --> 00:39:34.920
I can tell you that if you participate in the program,

663
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.860
the inmates that participate in the program,
uh,

664
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:42.240
that person is three times less likely to receive a rules violation report than

665
00:39:42.241 --> 00:39:45.120
someone who doesn't.
So it definitely does change something.

666
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:50.070
<v 4>And if you look at the people who have,
uh,
as a,
I think Jason,</v>

667
00:39:50.071 --> 00:39:53.990
maybe you were mentioning some people you can deliver the sermon to,
right?

668
00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:54.420
I mean,
you,

669
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.990
you communicate with and then they fall off the rails and that other people,

670
00:39:57.991 --> 00:39:59.190
you work on them for a year,

671
00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.600
you may be suspect they won't actually take to it and then they do.

672
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:04.920
Uh,

673
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.320
are there any patterns that you guys have seen in terms of say what,

674
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.770
what people fail to understand or pay attention to that leads them to fall off

675
00:40:13.771 --> 00:40:15.090
the rails?
Is there any,

676
00:40:15.091 --> 00:40:19.890
anything that really sticks out as a pattern where you're like,
man,

677
00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.870
like dammit,
I like,

678
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:26.310
I should have seen it because we've seen this 17 times or four or 200 times

679
00:40:26.311 --> 00:40:26.851
before.
I mean,

680
00:40:26.851 --> 00:40:29.430
I don't know how many people you guys are communicating with because this is

681
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.540
what you have 1500 people or something like that.
And this we

682
00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.620
<v 6>have in this facility,
we can get up to 1000 by 1000,</v>

683
00:40:35.621 --> 00:40:39.970
but it averages at about 900,
you know,
give them give or take.
As far as pat,

684
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.850
I mean for my money and I can't speak for you guys,
right?

685
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.570
I mean everybody is really different.
Uh,

686
00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:50.200
and that's kind of the reason,
at least for me,
um,

687
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.560
even if a guy lets me down 17 times out of 18,

688
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:57.640
that 18 time it might just click because I mean,
there are,

689
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.610
there are commonalities.
Usually the,

690
00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:05.320
the impetus to change is something like a,
an event where his family shows up.

691
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.970
I've seen that a lot.
Um,
but some people,

692
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:14.080
there's like another group of people that I think just eventually they hit this

693
00:41:14.081 --> 00:41:18.490
point where they're just tired and they just have this realization one late

694
00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:21.370
night and they're just sitting there and they say,
I can't do this anymore.

695
00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.430
And if you happen to show up at that moment,

696
00:41:24.431 --> 00:41:27.220
I think you can lead them back into the light.

697
00:41:27.221 --> 00:41:31.210
But if you're not there then in there,
then you probably missed your window.

698
00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.490
So I'm not sure that it's like commonalities

699
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:39.490
<v 7>in circumstances so much as it's these different circumstances lead to change.</v>

700
00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:43.500
And if you're lucky to get there,
you get there,
you know?
Uh,

701
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.700
cause it really is a time and place thing,
at least in my experience.

702
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:51.560
<v 3>I,
I haven't personally,
uh,
identified any,
you know,
hard patterns.</v>

703
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:57.280
I can't say that the times when I felt like it was starting to sink in is if I

704
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:02.420
was dealing with a guy who was constantly entertaining the wrong conversations

705
00:42:02.421 --> 00:42:05.630
in the wrong company on the yard,
and you,
you can tell what you know.

706
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:09.800
And then suddenly I had this conversation with them and out of nowhere it's

707
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:13.220
really like a mature conversation and he's talking about wanting something

708
00:42:13.221 --> 00:42:17.030
different and he's just talking to me about it.
And then the next time I see him,

709
00:42:17.031 --> 00:42:18.140
he's actually acting on it.

710
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.960
That's a good indication that he's heading in the right direction.

711
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.860
And then it from there,

712
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:26.480
I think one of the things we've tried to implement is repeated exposure.

713
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.670
You know,
going back to that guy and going back to him and just work on,
on him,

714
00:42:29.671 --> 00:42:33.170
encouraging them and open that he stays alone on the right path,
you know?

715
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:35.460
<v 7>So I have a question for you just because you're,</v>

716
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.920
you're mentioning you and your brother coming and people knew you guys were

717
00:42:37.921 --> 00:42:40.950
coming and that you had,
uh,

718
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.310
some stature within this gang that you were once part of.
No,
no,
this is,

719
00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:49.080
I mean I'm really curious about this because I've known people who have spent

720
00:42:49.081 --> 00:42:53.630
time in prison,
some very,
very close friends of mine and uh,

721
00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.040
people who've had all sorts of different types of

722
00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.610
unhealthy coping behaviors,

723
00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.390
but at a given point in time in their life,

724
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:07.530
some of those behaviors like served a purpose for them or they thought it did

725
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:12.440
right to escape from something or to survive something.
And uh,
what,

726
00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:13.270
what I'm curious to,

727
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:16.530
and sometimes within that it's like you could throw it all out,

728
00:43:16.531 --> 00:43:19.440
but maybe there's like a kernel of something that you developed that can be

729
00:43:19.441 --> 00:43:21.910
applied in a good way.
Right.
It's what I'm really curious about it.

730
00:43:21.911 --> 00:43:22.744
It's like you were,

731
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.460
sounds like had some type of leadership position or you were somewhat high in

732
00:43:26.461 --> 00:43:28.290
the,
the pyramid and this gang.

733
00:43:28.291 --> 00:43:32.910
Is there anything that you were good at then that is translated to you being

734
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:38.040
better at having these types of conversations or recruiting people to have,

735
00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:38.970
recruiting is the wrong word,

736
00:43:38.971 --> 00:43:41.490
but converting people to look at things differently.

737
00:43:41.491 --> 00:43:43.740
Do you think there's any common ground there?

738
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.753
<v 3>Networking.</v>

739
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:48.240
Networking now I was good at networking and I'm generally good at people and

740
00:43:48.241 --> 00:43:50.820
interacting with them generally.
Not always cause no one,

741
00:43:50.821 --> 00:43:52.950
no one communicates perfectly all the time.
Right,
right.

742
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:57.060
But that's just one of the,
you know,
one of my strong suits.

743
00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.180
<v 7>Yeah.
What do you think,
and maybe these,</v>

744
00:43:59.181 --> 00:44:00.800
I mean these guys could comment on it also,

745
00:44:00.801 --> 00:44:03.350
but like maybe it's easier from the outside looking in,

746
00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:05.550
but like what makes you good at what do you,

747
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.520
what are some of the skills that make you,
or,

748
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:10.640
or approaches that make you better than most do you think could tell you what

749
00:44:10.641 --> 00:44:14.950
makes Jason really good?
It's all right.
Here we go.
I'll,

750
00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.970
I'll be [inaudible] I could see here like bright red.
It's okay.
I got you buddy.

751
00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:25.220
Um,
so one of the things about Jason,
right?
I knew of Jason,

752
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:29.690
right?
I never knew Jason until here and now I,
I know Jason,

753
00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:31.470
but I knew of Jason before.

754
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.730
<v 6>Um,</v>

755
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:37.730
one of the things about Jason was that he was true to his word.

756
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:41.760
He had integrity,
right.
I'll give him that now.

757
00:44:41.761 --> 00:44:46.310
What his word was at the time.
You know what that meant,
you know,

758
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:51.180
was,
I'm going to do something,
he's going to do it right.
Um,

759
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.680
that he's brought that with him though he has a very strong sense of integrity

760
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:58.530
and the values have changed with it.
Right?

761
00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:03.590
So the thing about Jason is if he says he's going to show up to chat with you,

762
00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:05.250
if he's going to show up to help you out,

763
00:45:05.251 --> 00:45:10.050
if he's going to show up to give you a pep talk,
right.
He'll not only show up,

764
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:14.820
he'll probably give you a day and a time and then be up all night long if he

765
00:45:14.821 --> 00:45:19.170
missed it and beating himself up about it and then drag one of us along with

766
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:22.110
them to make sure he gets into the building to talk to that guy the next day,

767
00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:23.700
first opportunity.
Right.

768
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:27.300
And that's something that I think he was kind of known for before and now he's

769
00:45:27.301 --> 00:45:31.680
being known for it again in a very good way because the new Jason is,

770
00:45:31.681 --> 00:45:36.500
in my opinion,
a market improvement.
Very,
very disciplined.
Very dependent.
Yeah.

771
00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.240
So the ability to keep promises.
Yeah.
But the,
the content of those promises,

772
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.860
this changed the values underlying Yang.

773
00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.470
So my best work in progress.

774
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:52.100
So like where would you guys like to be say three years from now?

775
00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.540
<v 5>So I actually have the opportunity,
uh,</v>

776
00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:01.330
towards the end of the year to a transfer out to an mcrp,

777
00:46:01.331 --> 00:46:03.250
which is a male community reentry program.

778
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:07.810
And what that is is I would basically serve the remainder of my term in a

779
00:46:07.811 --> 00:46:12.040
facility on the streets wearing an ankle monitor and we're all where I'll have

780
00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:16.660
the opportunity to actually a gain employment work and save towards that day

781
00:46:16.661 --> 00:46:21.070
when I'm actually paroled.
Uh,
but in the meantime we are,

782
00:46:21.071 --> 00:46:23.950
we actually started a podcast here on our facility,
Kern valley one 80.

783
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.710
<v 6>I thought that's what we were doing right now.
That's what I thought too,</v>

784
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:32.010
guys in our podcast.
It was supposed to be.
So,

785
00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:36.990
<v 5>you know,
in the knee with this first year coming up,
we,</v>

786
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:42.110
we plan at least to kind of use that platform to not only show the guys in here

787
00:46:42.791 --> 00:46:45.940
what it's like transitioning back out to society step by step,

788
00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:51.100
but also kind of show society what it's like being in here and transitioning out

789
00:46:51.101 --> 00:46:55.660
into,
into the community.
Uh,
for me at least,
I want to show the guy in here,

790
00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:59.380
I want to show the guys,
look,
this is what I did while I was incarcerated,

791
00:46:59.381 --> 00:47:03.850
while I was still behind the fence behind the wall.
And this is where I am now.

792
00:47:03.851 --> 00:47:06.010
This,
these are the struggles,
these are difficulties,

793
00:47:06.011 --> 00:47:08.650
the challenges that I'm facing.
So even though you're,

794
00:47:08.651 --> 00:47:12.400
you can prepare yourself as much as,
as,
as,
as,
as you can,

795
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:16.450
if there are still going to be some challenges,
so you should prepare.
Absolutely.

796
00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:21.570
So hopefully we're,
we're able to do that through the podcast and I,
you know,

797
00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.960
in the next three years I,

798
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:28.320
I see myself heavily involved in some sort of organization that gives back to

799
00:47:28.871 --> 00:47:29.950
this community

800
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.360
<v 3>for sure.
Thank you.
Um,
well,</v>

801
00:47:34.361 --> 00:47:36.910
currently I'm serving life without parole.
So

802
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.410
I just hope that wherever I am at,

803
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:46.140
let's say a law changes and I'm somehow miraculously,
you know,
uh,

804
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.380
released to society,

805
00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:51.280
then I hope to be doing something good with a rehabilitation in either way.

806
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.690
If I'm still incarcerated,

807
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:56.570
I'm hoping it'd be doing something that's meaningful towards rehabilitation and

808
00:47:56.571 --> 00:47:57.550
the rehabilitation effort.

809
00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:00.860
<v 4>What do you,
what do you personally find most meaningful?
I mean,</v>

810
00:48:00.861 --> 00:48:03.680
this is really important concept,
right?
I mean,
it's really,

811
00:48:03.681 --> 00:48:06.920
really important because I think as you guys have noted,
it's like without the,

812
00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.490
without a purpose,
without the meaning,

813
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:14.750
it's very difficult to survive as a human in any environment.

814
00:48:14.751 --> 00:48:18.740
But I think particularly in an environment like this.
So what,

815
00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.970
what keeps you going and what would you say three years from now?

816
00:48:22.971 --> 00:48:25.220
Let's say you're still inside,

817
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:29.960
what would make you look back with some pride on the,
the three years?

818
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:34.220
<v 3>Well,
again,</v>

819
00:48:34.221 --> 00:48:39.200
anytime that you see the light go off for the guy who's been struggling,

820
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:42.710
the guy who is where I was,
you know?
Right.

821
00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:47.860
And he starts taking control or more responsibility for his life and starts

822
00:48:49.191 --> 00:48:53.690
learning tools to flourish and lead a stable and healthy life.

823
00:48:53.691 --> 00:48:58.691
I think that's a win and if we can continue to get better and better at our

824
00:48:58.931 --> 00:49:03.890
process of approaching it and helping more and more people,
that purpose for me.

825
00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:07.070
So it's a good purpose in here,
sir.
I think so.

826
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.320
<v 4>What,
what are,</v>

827
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:13.270
are there any particular tools certainly defined and we're familiar with
defined.

828
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:14.620
I have a high opinion of the Pfizer.

829
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.280
Are there any other tools that you found helpful to

830
00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.410
sort of as a,
this isn't the best term,
but like a gateway drug?

831
00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:24.401
If you're trying to,
you know,

832
00:49:24.401 --> 00:49:28.870
if you're trying to get somebody who's maybe not open and then they have that

833
00:49:28.871 --> 00:49:32.470
dark night of the soul or their family visits and there's a window and you want

834
00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:37.471
to offer them one thing to kind of nudge them towards a brighter path as a,

835
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:38.883
are there any,

836
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.700
do you have any favorites or anything that's particularly effective that you

837
00:49:42.701 --> 00:49:43.534
found?

838
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.660
<v 3>Well,
the most,
the thing that I think's been most,</v>

839
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:51.720
most effective for me has been asking the right questions so that they can get

840
00:49:54.071 --> 00:49:58.000
to the right answers.
And so if you're asking the right inquiry,

841
00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:01.510
and Brad Munson,
pastor Krantz earlier,

842
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.650
he has a method of when we take a position on something,

843
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:09.370
he asks us questions to where our position is either exposed for being

844
00:50:09.371 --> 00:50:10.600
vulnerable or being solid.

845
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.540
And I think that if you can do that in the right way to people,

846
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.720
then they are forced to come to their own conclusions about whether or not

847
00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.090
they're coming from the wrong,
the right starting place or not.

848
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:22.420
And so whether that's a tool or a technique,

849
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.210
to me that's been a really effective thing.

850
00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.940
<v 4>Any any,
any questions you could share or a,</v>

851
00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.490
I don't want to keep you on the spot like anybody can answer this,

852
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:34.040
but like are there any particular questions that you guys use?
I,

853
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:38.690
I've obsessed over questions cause I really think that whether it's interacting

854
00:50:38.691 --> 00:50:41.090
with someone else or interacting with yourself,
right?

855
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:44.540
Asking yourself the right questions which you guys are helping them to do.

856
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:47.900
<v 6>So the pastor or a chaplain currencies,
a military man.
All right.</v>

857
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:52.901
So he looks at things from that s a viewpoint a lot when it comes to developing

858
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.960
a,
an idea.
So we go to him,

859
00:50:56.990 --> 00:51:00.830
you know the idea fairy lands on the shoulder and gives us some crackpot idea

860
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.620
and we go in there and we say,
Hey,
we've got this really great idea.
Let's do x,
Y,

861
00:51:04.621 --> 00:51:07.760
z.
And he'll start running it through sort of a,

862
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.630
there'll be the practical questions,
there'll be the purpose driven questions.

863
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:12.920
There'll be,
you know,
who's going to run it,

864
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.230
where you're going to get the resources,
who's going to staff this?

865
00:51:15.231 --> 00:51:18.740
What's the idea and then it will kind of segue into what are you trying to do?

866
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.920
What's the point?
Is what you're doing,
tackling a symptom is what you're doing.

867
00:51:21.921 --> 00:51:25.280
Tackling the problem is what you're not a,
he'll really get into.

868
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:29.720
I mean it's a multilevel like systematic tear down.
Um,

869
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.700
stress tests stress that a few times we've surprised him.
But uh,

870
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:37.690
he also,
I think what you're also getting,

871
00:51:37.691 --> 00:51:41.990
what Jason was also getting at is the sort of self leadership model too,
right?

872
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:43.970
So anytime something pops up,

873
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.270
you should be asking yourself the questions too so that you know where you
stand.

874
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:51.080
Otherwise it's too easy to knock you down.
So it's two fold.

875
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:53.120
You have to have asked yourself the questions.

876
00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.560
Then once you have the idea in mind,

877
00:51:54.561 --> 00:51:58.760
then you need to ask the questions about the idea and that if it stands up to

878
00:51:58.761 --> 00:52:02.060
both those stress tests,
I think you're pretty good shape.
Uh,

879
00:52:02.061 --> 00:52:05.270
at least considering a lot of the other stuff that goes on sometimes.

880
00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:08.790
<v 5>And for me it's,
it's,
it's a lot simpler really when it comes down to it,</v>

881
00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:12.960
I ask myself and I ask others,
is it the right thing to do?
Uh,

882
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:16.200
absent the environment,
the situation,
is that the right thing to do?

883
00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:20.550
And that's basically what it boils down to.
You know,
with me it's,
you know,
it's,

884
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:24.480
is what I'm about to do the right thing is it,
is it right for me?

885
00:52:24.481 --> 00:52:26.070
Is it right for everyone else involved?

886
00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:29.600
And that's kind of the question that I always come up,
you know,

887
00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:32.670
and ask somebody when I see they're getting ready to stray or they're getting

888
00:52:32.671 --> 00:52:36.390
ready to make the wrong decisions.
It's,
is it the,
is it the right thing to do?

889
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:39.690
And if they,
they'd think that it is.
And I questioned them on it,
like,

890
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.370
why do you think that's the right thing?

891
00:52:41.371 --> 00:52:44.820
And I just kind of try to lead them through that.
You know,
those logical steps.

892
00:52:44.821 --> 00:52:47.850
Explain to me why you think putting that metal in,

893
00:52:47.851 --> 00:52:51.210
that guy is the right thing to do because he called you a name.

894
00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:56.160
It doesn't make sense at the end of the day.
And it's,
it's,
it's very,
very basic,

895
00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:58.050
but people forget to ask that question sometimes.

896
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:02.540
<v 4>Let me jump in on that because this is a,
you were talking about,</v>

897
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:06.230
it's all relative,
right.
So if we get into like moral relativism,

898
00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:10.160
one can almost argue that whatever they want to do is write,
write,
write,

899
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:14.690
given whatever story or narrative they've built up for themselves.
Right.

900
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:19.160
So you had,
it was two counts of armed robbery II,
what I was convicted for?
Yes.

901
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:20.600
Yeah.
Okay.
All right guys.

902
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:26.970
So the list may be longer,
but that's the official,
yeah.
Uh,

903
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:32.340
at the time,
how,
at the time,
why did you,
why did,

904
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:35.160
how would you've explained why you were doing those things?

905
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:40.070
<v 5>I don't,
I don't,
I could never justify what I did.
Uh,
but not now,</v>

906
00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:44.540
but like at the time,
how it was,
it was just a haze,
a cloud.
I was,
uh,

907
00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:49.400
drinking heavily.
I was using,
I was using drugs heavily.
Uh,
I,

908
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:53.690
like I said before,
gravitated back to,
you know,
individuals that I used to,

909
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:58.290
I used to hang out with and I used to run with a gang.
Yeah.

910
00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.040
And,
uh,
you know,
I just kind of,

911
00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.230
I just reverted back to old ways that I had left behind.

912
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:09.570
And,
uh,
you know,
my judgment was,

913
00:54:09.571 --> 00:54:12.740
was very clouded and I just kind of went with the flow,

914
00:54:12.741 --> 00:54:15.380
which is what a lot of guys do in here.
They just go with the flow.

915
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:19.400
They assimilate this environment,
they suck it up.
And because it's prison,

916
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:23.060
everything,
every excuse you'll hear here is you'll,

917
00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:26.120
you'll almost always here it's prison because it's prison,

918
00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.270
because it's prison will just because it's prison,
it doesn't make it right.

919
00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:33.440
And you know,
back then that's,
that's what it was.
Yeah.
It was just,

920
00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:38.300
you know,
I wasn't in my right mind,
no clear judgment.

921
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:43.310
<v 4>And so your judgment is,
seems clear.
Now,
what I'd love to hear from,</v>

922
00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.290
from any of you guys is

923
00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:51.820
how you recall how you have recovered from slipping or relapsing or when you've

924
00:54:52.011 --> 00:54:55.960
had the temptation,
what you've said to yourselves.
Right.
Because whether if like,

925
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:59.780
I know people who are drug addicts or former drug addicts,

926
00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:04.340
alcoholics,
um,
my,
my best friend growing up,
unfortunately died of an overdose.

927
00:55:04.341 --> 00:55:08.240
It's like I have not a lot of firsthand experience,

928
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:13.790
but I've,
I've watched even with,
let's just say on a very maybe mundane level,

929
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:15.050
people who are listening to this,

930
00:55:15.051 --> 00:55:17.720
they have behaviors and they tried to change the behavior and maybe they succeed

931
00:55:17.721 --> 00:55:21.560
for awhile and then they slip and maybe they slipped and they stay slipped for a

932
00:55:21.561 --> 00:55:23.180
long time or not.

933
00:55:23.181 --> 00:55:26.810
But like you guys seem pretty far on the other side at this point,

934
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:31.610
but could you talk about any times when you've either slipped and then had to

935
00:55:31.611 --> 00:55:35.690
fix,
you know,
had to come back or had the temptation to slip?

936
00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:40.220
I have,
I lead,
I think we got a bunch of time.

937
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:44.840
I gotta I gotta I got a sticky note here that says the bus broke down and we

938
00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:48.310
have a delay so that their misfortunate is our good fortunate and I'm,

939
00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:50.010
I'm afraid for them.
But still,

940
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:53.370
<v 5>I,
uh,
I,
I lead by example.</v>

941
00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:56.880
So you know,
when I,
when I feel,
when you know,

942
00:55:56.881 --> 00:55:59.990
when the anger seems to get the best of me,
I always think,
you know,

943
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.910
if I lead by example,
what's that?
What's that going to say to that?
You know,

944
00:56:02.911 --> 00:56:06.440
all the other guys.
And I'm like I said,
it's,
it's,
it's teamwork here,
you know,

945
00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.250
with team.
Um,

946
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:14.600
I always try to keep that in mind really.
Right.
It's you sitting in an example,

947
00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:18.840
whether it's good or bad.
Exactly.
And you know,
just not too long ago,

948
00:56:18.841 --> 00:56:22.590
I lost my cool and it was,
it was kind of embarrassing.

949
00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.580
You know,
we have,
we have,
we have,
one of them has been laughing here.

950
00:56:27.581 --> 00:56:30.670
So let's tell us,
let's,
let's,
let's,
if we could talk about it,

951
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:34.390
let's talk about the details.
So I'm,
you know,
I'm,
I'm,

952
00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.820
I'm not now known as very levelheaded,
you know,

953
00:56:36.821 --> 00:56:41.120
I keep my cool because I've kind of learned to do that.
Uh,

954
00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:45.610
but you know,
here in prison we have all sorts of personalities,
all sorts of,

955
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:49.920
you know,
people with issues and whatnot.
And one of,
uh,

956
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:55.240
the worst happened to move in next door to me.
And,
uh,
look,
I'm programmer man.

957
00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:58.180
I like getting out to my programs on time because you know,

958
00:56:58.181 --> 00:57:01.180
half the time I'm standing in front of that room making sure the guys are,

959
00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:04.900
you know,
heading in the direction they need ahead.
And,
and you know,

960
00:57:04.901 --> 00:57:08.500
this particular individual decided to hold this tray because he,

961
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.860
he felt he didn't get enough food.
Um,

962
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:16.140
and obviously that turns into a problem because when he has holds his tray,

963
00:57:16.141 --> 00:57:19.090
so he doesn't release this,
he doesn't really,
he doesn't,
uh,

964
00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.730
he doesn't give up his trade through the port,
which means,

965
00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:25.540
and now he has something solid that could be used as a weapon and obviously

966
00:57:25.541 --> 00:57:28.810
that's a safety concern.
So for the time being,
they kind of,

967
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:33.130
we kind of close that section down,
you know,
pending that issue being resolved.

968
00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:34.840
And that made me very upset.

969
00:57:34.841 --> 00:57:38.540
But what made me even more upset was that when they try to reason with him,

970
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.200
you know,
and told them,
look,
if you continue doing this,

971
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:43.030
you're going to mess up the program for everybody else.

972
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:45.190
And the guy started yelling,

973
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:49.450
expletives out the door and basically cussed everybody out.
And here I am,

974
00:57:49.451 --> 00:57:53.560
standing next door in full blues waiting to come out to run this program.

975
00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:59.010
And this guy's over here crying about not having enough food and I kind of lost

976
00:58:00.101 --> 00:58:04.930
it.
And he ended up giving up the tray.
AndW ,
you know,

977
00:58:04.931 --> 00:58:09.520
we had some very unpleasant exchanges and I was pumped up and I was really,

978
00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:12.370
really upset.
And I show up to this,

979
00:58:12.371 --> 00:58:14.170
to the group and these guys are looking at me like,

980
00:58:14.171 --> 00:58:17.380
what the hell happened to you?
And,
um,

981
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:23.470
it's the corner of his mouth.
He was,
it was.
Yeah,
it was,
it was bad.

982
00:58:23.471 --> 00:58:24.670
I was getting,
uh,
you know,
I,

983
00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:29.850
I felt emotionally I was ready to go there and I'm like to cross the line.

984
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:34.110
And then I took,
you know,
took,

985
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:36.910
took some deep breaths and I told myself,
you know what,

986
00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:40.330
you have to practice what you preach,
men.
And I've done it before.

987
00:58:40.331 --> 00:58:44.860
I've never allowed myself to go that for.
And,
um,
I had to humble myself.

988
00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:46.480
You know,
when I came back in,

989
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:51.070
I went up to the guy's door fully expecting that door to open,
by the way.

990
00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:55.150
And,
um,
I apologized and I said,
look man,

991
00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:58.810
I don't know what the issue was.
If you didn't get enough food,
do you need,

992
00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.870
do you need some?
It turns out the guy didn't have anything in his cell,

993
00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:06.250
so maybe he was hungry.
He was kind of a big guy.
So,
you know,

994
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:10.540
I had to humble myself,
apologize and kind of,
you know,
a practice,

995
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:14.560
that effective communication that we always try to teach others here.
And,
uh,

996
00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:18.250
it worked.
The situation was deescalated and you know,
the next morning he's like,

997
00:59:18.251 --> 00:59:19.090
hey,
good morning buddy.

998
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:23.230
So I obviously I still keep kept an eye on him for the next week cause you know,

999
00:59:23.231 --> 00:59:27.560
you never know,
but,
um,
it,
it,
it turned out well and it's really,

1000
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:30.710
it's just about practicing what I preach at the end of the day,
you know?
And,

1001
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:34.040
and again,
leading,
leading through example,
and I can't,

1002
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.620
how would that look if the guy who's preaching,
you know,

1003
00:59:36.621 --> 00:59:41.210
effective communication and resolving your conflict in other ways other than,

1004
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:45.700
you know,
the physical way.
How would it look if I got into a fight,
you know,
in,

1005
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:47.750
in the day room because,
you know,

1006
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:50.660
the guy called me this and called me that and I went there.

1007
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:51.703
It just wouldn't work.

1008
00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:56.740
<v 3>Yeah,
we have the accountability.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Thank you know,</v>

1009
00:59:56.830 --> 00:59:57.663
you guys,

1010
00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.960
I would repeat a lot of what Ian said.

1011
01:00:01.961 --> 01:00:06.910
I think that at this point we've made a lot of public statements about where we

1012
01:00:06.911 --> 01:00:10.540
stand on these types of issues.
So if we slip up on it,

1013
01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:15.130
it's a pretty big hit for one thing.
Secondly,
for me personally,

1014
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:17.380
I have to always ask myself,
what's the outcome here?

1015
01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.390
And like how does this end and once it starts,

1016
01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.080
and so it's just trying to avoid the situation from the Gecko.

1017
01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:27.970
Now regarding a m a s a scrape of like a violent nature or something,
you can't,

1018
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.420
you,
you can't possibly take in all the variables that could come with that.

1019
01:00:31.421 --> 01:00:33.220
Like anything could happen at any given time.

1020
01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.620
But I think that one thing I've tried to keep in mind is that every act that I

1021
01:00:38.621 --> 01:00:42.430
take,
I'm trying to reduce the possibility of that.
So every interaction,

1022
01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:45.010
I'm trying to keep it tore.
It doesn't even go in that direction.

1023
01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:50.020
Regarding substance abuse.
I've had a problem with that in the past.
And so again,

1024
01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:54.520
I've had people that are close to me that have a severe drug problem and it's

1025
01:00:54.521 --> 01:00:58.810
created a lot of anguish for me.
And at this point I think,

1026
01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:02.800
I dunno,
I've created enough mental leverage to stay away from it.

1027
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:04.450
But if I ever am tempted again,

1028
01:01:04.451 --> 01:01:08.170
it comes back to what's my outcome here and what are the public statements I've

1029
01:01:08.171 --> 01:01:10.420
made and how much of a hypocrite will that make me,
you know,

1030
01:01:10.421 --> 01:01:13.260
so I just stay away from it,
period.
Thank you know,

1031
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.400
<v 9>ah,
man,
let's see.
I,</v>

1032
01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.220
whereas there's the soft skill,

1033
01:01:20.221 --> 01:01:23.130
like there's the effective communication way of doing things and then there's

1034
01:01:23.131 --> 01:01:27.210
sort of like my way,
which is a,
not that all the time,

1035
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:30.210
although I think I'm getting a little better.
Uh,

1036
01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.240
so I snap at people fairly regularly and have to go up afterwards and been like,

1037
01:01:35.941 --> 01:01:39.600
Hey,
my bad,
I suck.
Right.
Um,
as far as,

1038
01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:43.990
I've never particularly had a substance abuse problem,
uh,
myself.
Yeah.

1039
01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:47.130
And that's just an example,
right?
There are many different ways.
Yeah.
Slip.

1040
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:52.190
I have an arguing problem and there are times when I get into that sort of

1041
01:01:53.161 --> 01:01:55.830
concrete thinking thing and even if I know I'm wrong,

1042
01:01:55.831 --> 01:01:57.330
I'm still going to argue my point.

1043
01:01:57.390 --> 01:02:01.740
I mean that's led to some beefs before.

1044
01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:03.370
Uh,
although I'm,

1045
01:02:03.371 --> 01:02:06.750
I'm trying to not do that anymore and that's where I'm kind of picking up from

1046
01:02:06.751 --> 01:02:08.520
these two guys over here.
How does,

1047
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:13.850
how does your process or day change when you're trying not to do it?

1048
01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.090
Right?
So what do you do to I decrease the likelihood that,
you know,

1049
01:02:18.091 --> 01:02:21.750
I find that when I,
before I say things,
it tends to work a lot better.

1050
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:25.860
And I know it sounds like kind of silly,
but that's,

1051
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:29.790
I haven't often done that in the past,
although I have now.

1052
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:33.410
So as long as I have sort of a mental checklist to run through and you know,

1053
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:36.330
ask myself questions as we go and my thinking about this clearly,

1054
01:02:36.331 --> 01:02:38.280
do I understand what he's saying?
Is He,

1055
01:02:38.281 --> 01:02:41.490
are we clear on the terms that we clarified what the heck we're actually talking

1056
01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:44.670
about injecting a pause between the response.
Yeah,
exactly.

1057
01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:47.640
So as long as I take a breath before opening my mouth,

1058
01:02:47.641 --> 01:02:50.550
which is when I usually get in trouble,
um,

1059
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:55.890
incidents on the yard kind of thing.
I mean there there's been times where,
uh,

1060
01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.790
there was the guy who clocked me in the face one day a yard and I had to walk

1061
01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:04.690
away from it and it was because of something he really news letter.
So it,

1062
01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:07.320
well,
let's dig into this.
So would you write in the news,

1063
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.790
why do you punch you in the face?

1064
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.560
And I don't know how much of this you'll have to be cut out or whatever.

1065
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:12.910
We can always edit it later.

1066
01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:17.170
There was an incident that took place back in the vocational class,
um,

1067
01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:22.200
where a gentleman had gotten heated and somebody had to step in between it and

1068
01:03:22.991 --> 01:03:27.910
stop him.
And this incident led to a conversation later on,

1069
01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:29.820
right with him.
Uh,

1070
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:34.000
cause well the guy who had gotten heated had hit the guy who stepped in between

1071
01:03:34.001 --> 01:03:36.100
him.
And the guy who had gotten hit,

1072
01:03:36.101 --> 01:03:38.680
which was another one of our pioneer newsletter guys,

1073
01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:43.500
another reporter or another editor or Madden,
uh,
editor.
Um,

1074
01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:48.130
so he had taken the hit and walked away and we applauded that.
We said,
hey,
look,

1075
01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:52.210
now you deescalate.
It it,
you,
you humbled yourself.
You took the head,
great job.

1076
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:57.530
Um,
and now you have to remember in prison if you get hit and you don't hit back,

1077
01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:02.660
that's a bad thing according to prison standards,
that's precedent.
Somebody,

1078
01:04:02.661 --> 01:04:05.630
somebody had said,
well,
should you get hit in the face?
And you know,

1079
01:04:05.631 --> 01:04:08.120
people were just coming up and stealing your store,
right?

1080
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:11.720
Your store is just a canteen.
You know,
your,
your hygiene,
your food.

1081
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:15.680
And I had written this piece about yes,
because that's what we're going to have.

1082
01:04:15.681 --> 01:04:19.340
We're going to have roving gangs of marauders hijacking people in stage,

1083
01:04:19.341 --> 01:04:23.180
coach robberies for their store.
And I'd kind of made light of it.
Well,

1084
01:04:23.181 --> 01:04:26.870
the gentleman who had gotten heated way back in the beginning somehow

1085
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:29.030
interpreted this as,
hey,

1086
01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:32.120
I was telling people to beat him up on yard and steal his store.

1087
01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:37.490
So he saw me at yard when I was out there reporting on a football tournament or

1088
01:04:37.491 --> 01:04:42.491
a soccer tournament and took a swing and he got me and I had just published,

1089
01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.630
I wanted to get them to buy.
I was seeing red,

1090
01:04:47.631 --> 01:04:50.810
my and my hackles were up,
but I was telling myself,
I was like,
dude,

1091
01:04:50.811 --> 01:04:54.440
you just wrote this thing about it's okay to walk away from taking a hit.

1092
01:04:54.441 --> 01:04:56.900
Don't worry about it.
You're not a bitch.
Right.

1093
01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.960
And I had done this whole thing and this guy cracked me.

1094
01:04:59.961 --> 01:05:03.110
I'm standing there and I had to take a breath and be like,
hey,

1095
01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:04.970
we're not doing this right here.
We're adults.

1096
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:08.110
And I had to turn around and walk away.
Right?
Uh,

1097
01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.690
and everybody saw it and I was under,

1098
01:05:11.691 --> 01:05:15.110
I was getting the blues for a while,
but then slowly people were like,
yeah,
man,

1099
01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:18.000
don't worry about that guy.
It's cool.
It's the blues you were feeling.

1100
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.950
I was just getting,
there were some people that were coming up and you know,

1101
01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:25.060
ribbon me and saying some pretty,
pretty hurtful things,
man.
But that's okay.

1102
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.710
I'm used to that.
So,

1103
01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:30.450
<v 4>so how did you,
how did you feel after that?
Were you proud that you did that,</v>

1104
01:05:30.451 --> 01:05:32.550
where you were like,
man,
I should have ripped that fucking guy's face off?

1105
01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:36.530
<v 9>No,
I was,
I felt bad that I had actually,</v>

1106
01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:38.450
that I wrote something that he could interpret.

1107
01:05:38.451 --> 01:05:40.970
I should have gone and talked to him beforehand.
I should have been like,

1108
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:41.750
hey dude,

1109
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:44.900
we're going to write an article about something that happened involving you and

1110
01:05:44.901 --> 01:05:47.630
I should have been like,
is this cool?
And I didn't,

1111
01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:52.250
and that was my screw up and that made me feel bad.

1112
01:05:52.251 --> 01:05:55.250
And I actually went back and I had talked to the guy a few times and asked him

1113
01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:59.510
if he wanted to subscribe to the paper.
And uh,
that probably wasn't smart.

1114
01:05:59.570 --> 01:06:02.420
I thought I was giving him a peace offering and he just started kicking the door

1115
01:06:02.421 --> 01:06:07.190
and yelling at me.
So I had to walk away.
But I,
yeah,

1116
01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.270
I felt bad that I had,
I felt I'd handled it badly.
Yeah,
I'd walked away,

1117
01:06:11.271 --> 01:06:15.260
but I had allowed a situation to happen with this guy was mad enough to hit me.

1118
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:17.330
And that was where I screwed up.

1119
01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.920
So I managed to not turn it into a big deal,

1120
01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:24.560
but I still EFT up in there somehow.

1121
01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:27.750
<v 4>Where would,
where would you like to be in say three years time?
I mean,</v>

1122
01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:29.910
if like three years from now looking back you're like,
yeah,

1123
01:06:29.911 --> 01:06:33.690
I did a really good job or I'm happy with my progress.
What would need to happen?

1124
01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:38.800
<v 9>I can look at the yard I'm on three years from now and 51% of the people on that</v>

1125
01:06:40.191 --> 01:06:42.980
yard.
I could be like,
yes,
these are grown up,
mature adults.

1126
01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:46.430
And I had some small part in that.
Uh,

1127
01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:50.870
if some program I helped run or come up with or bring to the yard or some sort

1128
01:06:50.871 --> 01:06:55.400
of stats that we had done to figure,
then I'd be like,
yeah,
I did a good job.

1129
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:56.240
Uh,

1130
01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:00.380
because everything is to that end for me is making people kind of realize their

1131
01:07:00.381 --> 01:07:01.214
maturity

1132
01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.890
<v 4>fists of 51% just meaning the majority.</v>

1133
01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:06.140
<v 9>Yeah.
I want to saturation rate.
That's,
you know,</v>

1134
01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:09.010
51% then I know our product is a success.

1135
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:12.040
<v 4>So many different directions.
I could go with all this.</v>

1136
01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:16.330
The first thing I probably should at least check off because I know some people

1137
01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:20.490
listening are going to be like,
wait,
they have a podcast.
So this is,
yes,

1138
01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.340
welcome to the Kern valley one 80 podcasts.
We're here with Tim Ferris.
Right.

1139
01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:27.490
Thank you for having me gentlemen.
Uh,
how,

1140
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.220
how did that come to be and how do you guys record it?

1141
01:07:30.221 --> 01:07:33.820
And what do you talk about?
I mean,
you could I be,
so do you,
do you have,

1142
01:07:34.330 --> 01:07:38.680
you have gear that you have a room,
do you,
how does,
how does a podcast,

1143
01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:42.370
does it only get distributed among the people at the prison?
It is,
it,

1144
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:44.060
is it more widely distributed?
So,
so

1145
01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:46.000
<v 8>the leadership here is very progressive.</v>

1146
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.250
When CDCR said we're going to head more towards,
uh,
you know,

1147
01:07:51.251 --> 01:07:53.530
rehabilitation,
the administration,

1148
01:07:53.531 --> 01:07:57.280
the leadership really took that direction at heart and are following it.

1149
01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:03.660
Absolutely.
You know,
the idea came about,
uh,
I think there,

1150
01:08:03.661 --> 01:08:07.900
there's one,
there's another podcast on South San Quintin,
a lower level,

1151
01:08:07.901 --> 01:08:11.230
much lower level facility.
Uh,
and,
but,
you know,

1152
01:08:11.231 --> 01:08:14.260
the things that they talk about their,
and not,
you know,
talking smack about them,

1153
01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:16.430
it's more,
you know,
average day,

1154
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:21.230
a daily occurrences on the prison yard type deal.
Uh,

1155
01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:25.370
here we're,
we're,
I think we're,
we're creating,
we're establishing more than just,

1156
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:29.690
you know,
uh,
talking about canteen,
talking about the sports and the yard.
We're,

1157
01:08:29.691 --> 01:08:34.460
we're,
we're really trying to highlight that rehabilitation,
rehabilitation.
Um,

1158
01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:35.870
and,
you know,

1159
01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:38.690
we were approached by the administration if we would be interested in doing

1160
01:08:38.691 --> 01:08:42.470
something like that.
And we jumped at it.
Uh,
it turns out that this,
this,
uh,

1161
01:08:42.471 --> 01:08:45.370
this institution has a media room,
which it very,

1162
01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:47.660
it looks very much like a TV studio.

1163
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:50.870
They have all the equipment and it's just kinda just kinda sits there because

1164
01:08:50.871 --> 01:08:53.810
they have no other use for it.
So,
uh,
you know,
they've,

1165
01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.460
they've allowed us to use that room for our podcasts.

1166
01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:01.330
We've been able to interview our warden,
which,
uh,

1167
01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:04.010
here is the first time that has happened.
You know,

1168
01:09:04.011 --> 01:09:08.360
inmates actually interview they're warning on a podcast and a we were able to

1169
01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:11.690
interview the CEO,
founder of defy ventures for example.

1170
01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:15.170
And you know we have a long list of of people and now we've interviewed you

1171
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:21.250
<v 7>cause that's what we're doing here.
So,</v>

1172
01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:21.920
Oh yeah,

1173
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.950
no we won't get to you guys are welcome to ask me it actually you guys got some,

1174
01:09:24.951 --> 01:09:28.090
anything you want the takes takes some responsibility off of my hands which I

1175
01:09:28.091 --> 01:09:30.280
like but first let me ask,

1176
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:33.910
following up on something that I kind of pass by.
Is it,

1177
01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:38.910
is this widely available or is it only for people in the facilities?

1178
01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:43.200
<v 8>We'll be,
once we record our finish,
our third one,</v>

1179
01:09:43.201 --> 01:09:47.790
I believe it will be downloadable on iTunes.
I think it's great.

1180
01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.060
There's actually two versions of it here because like I said,

1181
01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:51.930
there's video cameras.

1182
01:09:51.931 --> 01:09:56.040
It's like a TV studio and there will be a like a video podcast version of it

1183
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:59.550
available throughout the institution so that all the facilities here can,

1184
01:09:59.551 --> 01:10:03.040
can watch it and hear it.
And then out there for the public,
it will be what I,

1185
01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.300
what I believe,
just strictly audio podcasts through iTunes.

1186
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:08.570
<v 7>Yeah.
And you guys are welcome to use this audio man.</v>

1187
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.310
I'm happy to give you guys the audio too,

1188
01:10:10.311 --> 01:10:14.090
but you sounded like you had a question I wanted,
I wanted to ask you,
yeah.

1189
01:10:14.091 --> 01:10:14.924
Fire away.

1190
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:19.640
<v 8>What compelled you to come into a level four maximum security prison and sit</v>

1191
01:10:19.641 --> 01:10:22.670
down with us?
Yeah.
Ask all these questions.

1192
01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.450
<v 7>Uh,
I,</v>

1193
01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:30.710
I think that it's very common whether it's inside or outside for people to

1194
01:10:32.221 --> 01:10:35.850
separate between us and them or me and others.

1195
01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.140
And when I look at,
for instance,

1196
01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:43.140
some of the people I grew up with who were my best friends,
like I mentioned,

1197
01:10:43.141 --> 01:10:46.620
one died of a fentanyl overdose.
Others have been imprisoned.

1198
01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:49.110
And just like you were saying,

1199
01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:54.111
there's this sometimes this almost magical positive window when someone sees

1200
01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:57.300
their family or has this dark night of the soul and there's an opportunity for

1201
01:10:57.301 --> 01:11:01.710
growth.
There are also these windows that open,

1202
01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:06.360
which are opportunities to make really terrible decisions and circumstances.

1203
01:11:06.361 --> 01:11:10.020
I'm not saying you don't have personal responsibility,
we're all responsible,

1204
01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:13.030
but at the same time I think it's,
uh,

1205
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:20.240
I think it is wildly unreasonable for people to think that they could never find

1206
01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:26.730
themselves in a position if their life had been different,
if the,

1207
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.150
if their surroundings and friends had been different,

1208
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:33.270
where they would have made terrible decisions that could have landed them in a

1209
01:11:33.271 --> 01:11:34.104
place like this.

1210
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:39.240
And so I think that my hope in coming here was a to just learn about new

1211
01:11:39.241 --> 01:11:43.690
environment and to get to meet people here.
Honestly.
I mean,
I just,
uh,

1212
01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:47.530
I'm very interested in learning as much as I can about like how,
what,

1213
01:11:47.531 --> 01:11:50.610
what does human nature look like inside the walls?

1214
01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:55.260
And not because these humans are necessarily intrinsically different from the

1215
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:59.010
humans outside.
They've had,
they have very different stories.
But like,

1216
01:11:59.011 --> 01:12:01.050
what does it look like when like,
yeah,

1217
01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:04.480
you guys had mentioned when everything is intensified and magnified in a,

1218
01:12:04.481 --> 01:12:09.481
does that tell us perhaps something about ourselves more broadly speaking?

1219
01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:13.250
Right.
And,
uh,
also to,
um,

1220
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:19.790
not to say that everyone here should be completely forgiven of all of the,

1221
01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:22.420
uh,
you know,

1222
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.330
in some cases terrible things that they've done to other people.

1223
01:12:27.331 --> 01:12:32.331
But that I do think it's possible to have empathy for the humanity in each and

1224
01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:37.530
every person while still holding them accountable.

1225
01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.190
<v 8>And that's,
that's,
I think that's one of our main goals on our podcast is,</v>

1226
01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:46.430
look,
we're not trying to justify anyone's actions.
Anyone who's here,
you know,

1227
01:12:46.431 --> 01:12:49.360
what mistakes were clearly made.
But at the end of the day,

1228
01:12:49.361 --> 01:12:54.361
we want people out there to realize that people in here or just people,

1229
01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.570
yeah,
we're,
we're humans.
Uh,
you know,
we have that label,

1230
01:12:58.571 --> 01:13:02.920
prisoner or convict and you know,
and people sometimes tend to,

1231
01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:04.030
uh,

1232
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:08.980
associate who we are strictly on the crime that we committed that maybe that bad

1233
01:13:08.981 --> 01:13:12.130
day,
maybe that bad decision,
maybe a series of bad decisions.

1234
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:15.310
But at the end of the day,
we're,
we're human.
Like I've moved,

1235
01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:20.230
I'm here because I committed a crime.
And,
but I've moved past that.

1236
01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:24.430
It's,
I'm obviously reminded everyday when I wake up and I'm still in prison,

1237
01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:29.610
but I've been able to forgive myself and really worked on myself in order to

1238
01:13:32.051 --> 01:13:37.051
Sunday gain that forgiveness from my victims because there are victims and you

1239
01:13:37.931 --> 01:13:42.250
know,
I,
for me,
at least,
that's,
that's what we want to communicate out there.
Look,

1240
01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:47.140
we're just people,
anyone can make mistakes.
Sure.
There's degrees of mistakes,

1241
01:13:47.141 --> 01:13:50.290
but,
uh,
you know,
it's,

1242
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:52.150
it's tough.

1243
01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:56.620
It's tough sometimes when you watch the shows on TVs and you hear the narrative

1244
01:13:56.621 --> 01:14:01.310
about prisoners and,
and it's just always all just a negative.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1245
01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:06.920
<v 7>And the other,
another reason that I'm here is,
uh,
you know,</v>

1246
01:14:06.921 --> 01:14:11.030
with,
with defy and really want to chat with you guys,
is

1247
01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:17.410
<v 4>I'm fascinated by why people change,</v>

1248
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.720
whether it's for the better or for the worse,
or like what does that moment,

1249
01:14:20.721 --> 01:14:21.940
and what does that conversation,

1250
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:27.340
what is the chaplain say to you or ask you write,
or what happens in the shoe?

1251
01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:28.181
Uh,

1252
01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:33.181
I'm really interested in these tipping points for people and liked to study them

1253
01:14:34.511 --> 01:14:37.660
because if you study them and you can then figure out like,
all right,

1254
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:42.550
this particular tool works really well and it seems to work and you spot some

1255
01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:43.390
type of pattern.

1256
01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:48.430
I don't think that if we assume that human nature is human nature,

1257
01:14:48.431 --> 01:14:52.510
which I,
I suppose it's a bit of it like a Tautology,

1258
01:14:52.511 --> 01:14:55.840
but in the sense that the people inside are not that different from people

1259
01:14:55.841 --> 01:14:56.291
outside.

1260
01:14:56.291 --> 01:15:00.760
I think there's a lot to be learned in here that could also be applied outside

1261
01:15:00.761 --> 01:15:04.420
of here.
Right.
And uh,
I

1262
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.060
not that I like the fact that everything is intensified here,
but it's,

1263
01:15:09.061 --> 01:15:10.210
it's in a way very similar.

1264
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:15.070
I've spoken with Sebastian younger who was a war a will is considered by many to

1265
01:15:15.071 --> 01:15:16.510
be a war journalist,

1266
01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:21.511
but he's been deployed overseas and is his best friend was killed overseas with

1267
01:15:22.271 --> 01:15:25.060
a,
because it was a mortar round,
horrible tragedy.

1268
01:15:25.061 --> 01:15:28.570
And he's seen many people killed and in war either the,
the,

1269
01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:33.790
you also see the certain aspects of human nature that are just amplified.
Right.

1270
01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:36.760
And I think that gives you an opportunity to see things that you might not

1271
01:15:36.761 --> 01:15:41.080
otherwise see and learn.
Things you might not otherwise learn.
So,
uh,

1272
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:43.480
but the fact that you guys have made,

1273
01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:48.250
made a series of bad decisions that have made a series of good decisions is very

1274
01:15:48.251 --> 01:15:51.050
interesting to me.
Right.
Um,

1275
01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:55.810
so that's part of the reason some of the reasons I'm here.
Yeah.

1276
01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.113
Um,

1277
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:59.620
<v 3>could I ask you a question?
Absolutely.</v>

1278
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:04.990
So one of the things that you do,
as you were saying,

1279
01:16:04.991 --> 01:16:06.520
you're trying to basically break it down,

1280
01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.150
they're trying to figure out what it is and makes a person tick.
Right?

1281
01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:14.770
So do you have goto questions?
Are you trying to get to the thought process?

1282
01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:15.820
Are you trying to get to what,

1283
01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:18.040
what is it that you're looking for when you're asking questions?

1284
01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:19.450
What process are you going through?

1285
01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.950
<v 4>Yeah,
usually I am following my own curiosity.
Uh,</v>

1286
01:16:24.951 --> 01:16:27.200
so if,
if,
if something,

1287
01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:31.250
if someone has experienced any type of sudden change,

1288
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:35.450
I'm very interested in why that change took place.
So I'll explore that.

1289
01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:39.050
I might ask someone,
if you look back,

1290
01:16:39.051 --> 01:16:43.100
say at your business over the last five,
10 years,
uh,
you know,
were,

1291
01:16:43.101 --> 01:16:48.101
were there any specific decisions you made that you view in retrospect is really

1292
01:16:48.861 --> 01:16:49.580
critical?

1293
01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:54.500
Or was there anything you said no to that you were tempted to say yes to that

1294
01:16:54.501 --> 01:16:55.700
made all the difference,
right?
It,

1295
01:16:55.701 --> 01:16:58.730
was there something you were told you had to do that everyone told you you

1296
01:16:58.731 --> 01:17:03.110
should do,
that you decided not to do?
Was there anything like that?
Uh,

1297
01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:05.240
I like to explore the good decisions,

1298
01:17:05.241 --> 01:17:10.241
but I also really like to explore how people deal with a hardship and failure in

1299
01:17:12.441 --> 01:17:15.260
darkness.
Since I,
I've really tried to,

1300
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:20.600
when I'm talking to anyone,
no matter how successful they may be,

1301
01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.750
like eight,
if I'm interviewing Richard Branson or interviewing,

1302
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:25.700
it really doesn't matter.

1303
01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:30.700
Like any type of icon who might be thought of as this perfect superstar.

1304
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:34.430
I know they're not.
No one's perfect.
And so I will ask them,
you know,

1305
01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:35.900
rather than just going through the highlight reel,

1306
01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:37.730
we'll talk about the highlights,
but I'll say like,
can you,

1307
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.960
could you take us back?

1308
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:42.410
People may listen to this and think that you've got it all figured out and that

1309
01:17:42.411 --> 01:17:44.210
you haven't had your tough times.

1310
01:17:44.211 --> 01:17:47.570
Like could you take us to a tough time or period that you suffered from

1311
01:17:47.571 --> 01:17:52.571
depression or where you thought it was all over and walk us through what you

1312
01:17:54.561 --> 01:17:58.760
said to yourself,
walk us through who helped you and how they helped you.

1313
01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.960
Like how did you get out of that funk?
I'm very interested in that.
Uh,

1314
01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:07.100
because uh,
I think those are the,

1315
01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:11.750
that is when some of the most critical decisions are made and it's like if

1316
01:18:11.751 --> 01:18:14.380
everything's lining up,
um,

1317
01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:17.990
it's really easy to be supportive of someone else or supportive of yourself.

1318
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:21.320
But when things start going sideways,
when maybe you slip,
maybe you relapse,

1319
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.510
maybe who knows,

1320
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:25.880
you're paying too much attention to your business and you're not paying enough

1321
01:18:25.881 --> 01:18:28.850
attention to your kids and your kids make some really terrible decisions.
Like,

1322
01:18:28.851 --> 01:18:32.330
all right,
how do you,
we're all going to fuck up.
It's like,
all right,
how do you,

1323
01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:36.380
how do you then respond to that fuck up is more interesting then the question

1324
01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:38.630
have you fucked up?
Because the answer is obviously yes.

1325
01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.720
The more interesting question to me is like,
all right,

1326
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:45.440
you fucked up now what happens?
And so

1327
01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:51.300
certainly in a different context,
but you know,
I've,
I've beaten myself,

1328
01:18:51.301 --> 01:18:52.820
hop horribly at my whole life.

1329
01:18:52.821 --> 01:18:57.250
I've had that very sort of a mixed relationship with myself and have had,
uh,

1330
01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.880
been very,
very,
uh,

1331
01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:03.830
brutal with myself just in terms of self talk for the majority of my life.

1332
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:08.260
And I've only in the last few years realized how unproductive counterproductive

1333
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:13.220
that can be.
And so the way in now,

1334
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.950
externally,
if you're watching me respond to a mistake,

1335
01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.750
it might look the same as it did five years ago,

1336
01:19:17.751 --> 01:19:21.030
but what's going on in my head is very different.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.

1337
01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:23.660
And so what I tried to do then,
if I'm interviewing someone,

1338
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:29.290
is to ask them to help me step into their head to see what's going on behind the

1339
01:19:31.071 --> 01:19:36.071
scenes or if they're afraid when they're most nervous,

1340
01:19:36.081 --> 01:19:36.650
right?
If their,

1341
01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:39.530
if their championship fighter and they're getting ready for the biggest fight of

1342
01:19:39.531 --> 01:19:40.130
their life.

1343
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:44.300
Like what are they saying in their head as they're walking out to the octagon

1344
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:49.610
months of training and like their entire careers on the line.
And they could,

1345
01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.020
they could have their head caved in.

1346
01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:54.020
Like what are they actually saying in their own head when they're listening to

1347
01:19:54.021 --> 01:19:56.150
their music,
walking out the,

1348
01:19:56.151 --> 01:20:01.100
these are the types of questions that I've been exploring more and more in the

1349
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:02.660
last few years because I think that you can,

1350
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:06.410
you can learn from a real fighter like say,
you know,

1351
01:20:06.411 --> 01:20:09.990
Tim Kennedy also Greenbury sniper.
I mean,
just an incredible guy.

1352
01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.900
You can take lessons from him and apply it to business.

1353
01:20:12.901 --> 01:20:16.710
You can take lessons from business and apply it to military.
In some cases.

1354
01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:20.940
You can take lessons from chess and apply it to working with people in the yard,

1355
01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:26.070
I'm sure,
uh,
in some cases and vice versa.
Uh,

1356
01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:29.000
perhaps.
So,
uh,

1357
01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:34.880
usually I'm digging for the internal process and trying to find phrases or

1358
01:20:37.471 --> 01:20:41.430
questions or concepts that can be applied to a lot of different things.

1359
01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:47.100
Uh,
that's very often what I'm,
what I'm looking for.
Uh,

1360
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:53.790
yeah,
yeah.
That,
that's,
that'd be my first stab at it.
Okay.
Something like that.

1361
01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:58.800
And also the unit to dig out the humanity in someone.
So it's,

1362
01:21:01.150 --> 01:21:01.983
uh,

1363
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.760
to encourage people to be vulnerable when they can be a,

1364
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:12.180
or to like push to a point where they're at least a little uncomfortable.

1365
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:16.060
I think that's when interesting things happen.
Uh,

1366
01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:21.080
not in the sense of pushing yourself closer to say a red line situation.

1367
01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:25.130
Not,
not pushing in that direction,
but,
uh,
you know,

1368
01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:30.160
I remember interviewing this woman named Bernais Brown who's a researcher and

1369
01:21:30.271 --> 01:21:30.630
she's,

1370
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:35.630
she studied a lot related to shame and vulnerability and related topics.

1371
01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:40.350
And,
uh,
she said something to me that a really big impact.
She said,
we often,

1372
01:21:40.351 --> 01:21:42.390
and I'm paraphrasing,
but she said very often we,

1373
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:48.390
we think that we need to develop trust with someone and then we can be

1374
01:21:48.391 --> 01:21:51.660
vulnerable.
And she said,
but very often it's the opposite way around.

1375
01:21:51.661 --> 01:21:54.630
You have to be vulnerable first before someone will trust you.

1376
01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:57.900
And that really stuck with me.
Uh,

1377
01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:03.910
and,
uh,
in any case,
uh,

1378
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:04.471
but,

1379
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:09.471
but I'm trying to find some of the connective tissue and these commonalities

1380
01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:12.420
that can apply anywhere.
Right.
And it's like if humans are humans,

1381
01:22:12.421 --> 01:22:16.230
which by and large,
I think it's certainly the case,
and like,

1382
01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:20.400
whether you go to the middle of nowhere in the jungles of Borneo or you're in

1383
01:22:20.401 --> 01:22:24.360
New York City or you're in here,
or you're anywhere else,

1384
01:22:24.361 --> 01:22:28.400
like the same type of pain,
the same need for purpose and meaning.
Like it's,

1385
01:22:28.401 --> 01:22:31.080
it's all there.
It's,
it's universal.
So I,

1386
01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:35.520
I try to tease out hopefully things that people can apply in any of those

1387
01:22:35.521 --> 01:22:39.030
contexts.
Thank you.
Yeah,
of course.

1388
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:45.280
Uh,
well,
let's see.
You know,
I'm struggling with,
uh,

1389
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:49.760
I think this is a pretty natural place to start to maybe wrap up a bit,
but,
uh,

1390
01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:54.770
do you guys have anything that you would like to ask or say to people who were

1391
01:22:56.131 --> 01:22:56.880
listening?

1392
01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.740
<v 5>Maybe not ask,
but as I said before,</v>

1393
01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:06.400
earlier,
uh,
my change came through,
uh,
really education,

1394
01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:09.730
it really opened my eyes.
I,

1395
01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.890
credit wise I have enough college credits or I have the equal amount of credits

1396
01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:19.210
that someone halfway through their masters would have.
Um,

1397
01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:22.070
but I,

1398
01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:27.160
I can't achieve that because there is no funding for postsecondary four year

1399
01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:32.740
graduate degree levels.
So,
you know,

1400
01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:34.210
I'm hoping that

1401
01:23:36.330 --> 01:23:40.980
some legislation will gain some traction that would give the opportunity for

1402
01:23:40.981 --> 01:23:45.840
individuals in our circumstances to,
you know,
apply themselves and earn,
you know,

1403
01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:46.980
a higher degrees.

1404
01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:51.520
<v 6>Uh,
I would just say,
uh,</v>

1405
01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:56.110
I guess it's kind of an ask w it would be something like,
you know,

1406
01:23:56.111 --> 01:23:59.840
please don't write us off in prison.
Uh,

1407
01:23:59.841 --> 01:24:04.000
we've made some really,
really bad choices.
Absolutely.

1408
01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:07.810
And we are responsible and we are accountable for those and nothing can take

1409
01:24:07.811 --> 01:24:08.644
them back.

1410
01:24:09.490 --> 01:24:14.170
But that doesn't mean that we can't change and do better.

1411
01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:19.800
And I think a lot of times from what you see on TV and what you hear about most

1412
01:24:20.801 --> 01:24:23.830
often,
hard time lock up shows like that,

1413
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:29.500
it's kind of painted in the light that there's no hope for people in here.

1414
01:24:29.501 --> 01:24:33.760
And that's really not the case.
We see it.
I hope that you come to see it.

1415
01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:39.150
I hope people listening will hear it and just don't give up on people inside

1416
01:24:40.151 --> 01:24:40.984
prison.

1417
01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:45.920
<v 5>Um,
if I could say anything to anyone out there,</v>

1418
01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:52.780
it would be that I find myself now in a place where I actually have meaning in

1419
01:24:54.081 --> 01:24:56.360
my life and I feel like I'm bringing value to other people,

1420
01:24:56.570 --> 01:25:01.570
but that's mostly because of my community in here and because of my family and

1421
01:25:02.661 --> 01:25:04.130
friends on the streets who never gave up.

1422
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:09.170
So for anybody who has someone in their life that's struggling,

1423
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:12.560
I would just say don't give up on them,
hold them accountable,

1424
01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.400
but continue to give them hope and try to provide them tools and opportunities

1425
01:25:18.441 --> 01:25:21.950
to where they can make a change and start making some good decisions because you

1426
01:25:21.951 --> 01:25:26.690
just never know
who that person can really become.
So just don't give up.

1427
01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:31.700
<v 6>Thank you guys.
Thank you.
Yeah,
I mean on the inside or the outside.
Right.</v>

1428
01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:37.270
<v 7>I think those are good rules,
good recommendations.
And,
uh,</v>

1429
01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:39.180
it's,
it's,
um,

1430
01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.240
<v 6>but I consider it a real privilege to,</v>

1431
01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.080
to share time with you guys because I mean if I think about it,
right,

1432
01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.950
I mean you have the opportunity potentially.
It's like if you build up

1433
01:25:50.370 --> 01:25:51.203
<v 7>a</v>

1434
01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:56.380
<v 6>to get to that 51% potentially right and beyond.
But if you have,</v>

1435
01:25:56.410 --> 01:25:57.340
if you develop

1436
01:25:57.740 --> 01:25:58.573
<v 7>this</v>

1437
01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:04.070
<v 6>your own program of sorts and you have your approach to helping people</v>

1438
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:08.390
<v 4>develop this meaning and this hope and also tilt just slightly in the positive</v>

1439
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:11.610
direction in a more positive direction,
it doesn't have to be.

1440
01:26:11.611 --> 01:26:15.260
And they become mother Theresa overnight,
which is pretty unlikely.

1441
01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:18.680
But just like one degree better write that one degree.

1442
01:26:18.681 --> 01:26:20.610
It's like you start off here and you,

1443
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:25.130
if you change your position walking say one or five degrees in a different

1444
01:26:25.131 --> 01:26:27.920
direction,
like you walk 10 feet,
it doesn't seem like that far away.

1445
01:26:27.921 --> 01:26:31.490
You walk a hundred feet,
okay,
now,
now it's quite a bit of a distance away.

1446
01:26:31.491 --> 01:26:34.440
And then he walked a few miles.
Now it's completely different destinations.
Right?

1447
01:26:34.441 --> 01:26:38.460
And so that initial change can,
can make it make a huge difference ultimately.

1448
01:26:38.650 --> 01:26:40.430
And it strikes me that like,

1449
01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:46.670
well after you guys have left this place,
uh,

1450
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:51.650
you could leave a legacy of people who continue to do that and potentially
right.

1451
01:26:51.651 --> 01:26:52.880
And so that's the goal,
right?

1452
01:26:52.881 --> 01:26:56.630
And see if kind of like senior class teaches the junior class,

1453
01:26:56.631 --> 01:26:59.540
he just a sophomore class and that,
I mean,
that's a really meaningful legacy.

1454
01:26:59.690 --> 01:27:01.610
So Warner's there's no alumni are coming back,

1455
01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.760
<v 7>so as long as long as there are no alumni reunions,</v>

1456
01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:08.070
the graduation.
Right.

1457
01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:09.990
<v 4>Uh,
well guys,</v>

1458
01:27:10.890 --> 01:27:13.760
I really appreciate you taking the time and uh,

1459
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:18.870
I certainly wish you all the best with everything that you're working to build

1460
01:27:19.450 --> 01:27:23.160
and you know,
inside yourselves and outside and keep,
keep it up with the podcast.

1461
01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:25.860
Thank you for coming on the Kern valley one 80 podcasts.

1462
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:30.470
<v 7>We're your hosts
and good luck on your podcast.
Sure.</v>

1463
01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:32.240
It'll take off one day on the,

1464
01:27:32.241 --> 01:27:37.241
here you could be white Gus with tens of hours of experience strangling a little

1465
01:27:37.321 --> 01:27:40.950
bit out there.
Now that you've got the big interview out of the way.
That's right.

1466
01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:42.390
That's right.
Food in the room is gone.

1467
01:27:42.630 --> 01:27:43.860
<v 4>So,
uh,</v>

1468
01:27:44.190 --> 01:27:48.810
I think we should get back to get back to the excitement across the yard.

1469
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:52.260
So,
uh,
you guys want to give your names one more time.

1470
01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:54.173
Jason Holland,

1471
01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.890
<v 7>e And v Tutorial,
which you forget for a second.
I'm sorry,</v>

1472
01:27:58.891 --> 01:28:02.220
I have to disclose right,
my [inaudible].
My name is [inaudible],

1473
01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.900
but it's so strange and odd that everyone just calls me Ian [inaudible] via

1474
01:28:06.901 --> 01:28:11.150
tutorial,
but it's via guitar and I'm Brandon Menard.
Alright,
gentlemen,

1475
01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.100
thank you so much and keep it up.

1476
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:17.910
Thank you to hey guys,
this is Tim again.

1477
01:28:17.911 --> 01:28:21.090
Just a few more things before you take off.
Number one.

1478
01:28:21.330 --> 01:28:23.780
This is five bullet Friday.
Do you,
you

1479
01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:26.250
<v 0>want to get a short email from me?</v>

1480
01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:30.450
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

1481
01:28:30.451 --> 01:28:33.990
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1482
01:28:33.991 --> 01:28:38.340
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

1483
01:28:38.341 --> 01:28:39.630
pondering over the week.

1484
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:42.630
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1485
01:28:42.631 --> 01:28:46.080
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1486
01:28:46.081 --> 01:28:50.400
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1487
01:28:50.670 --> 01:28:55.670
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1488
01:28:56.341 --> 01:28:59.070
close friends,
for instance.
And it's very short.

1489
01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:04.110
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1490
01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:08.700
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.
Just go to four hour work week.com.

1491
01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:13.350
That's four hour workweek.com all spelled out and just drop in your email and

1492
01:29:13.351 --> 01:29:16.530
you will get the very next one if you sign up.
I hope you enjoy it.

1493
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:19.890
This episode is brought to you by business wars.

1494
01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:22.350
People always ask me what podcasts I listened to.

1495
01:29:22.351 --> 01:29:25.800
And the truth is not many because given all my other projects,

1496
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:27.810
I don't have a ton of extra bandwidth.

1497
01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:31.890
But one new addition is business wars from the podcast network wondering,

1498
01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:35.760
human history has seen hundreds upon hundreds of epic wars,
of course,

1499
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:37.200
and often they're between nations,

1500
01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:42.490
but some wars are waged between large corporations are between startups and the

1501
01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:43.710
large incumbents.

1502
01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.580
Business wars which have been listening to teach you right into the middle of

1503
01:29:47.581 --> 01:29:50.940
these battles that are waged for control of your wallet and your attention

1504
01:29:51.210 --> 01:29:56.210
ranging from say the wars between Netflix and blockbuster or a Nike and Adidas,

1505
01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:59.880
two rivals and small businesses across the country struggling to survive in a

1506
01:29:59.881 --> 01:30:03.270
cutthroat world.
These stories really feel like dramatic thrillers.

1507
01:30:03.271 --> 01:30:05.940
I've been very impressed by the sound design also,

1508
01:30:05.941 --> 01:30:09.270
which I didn't think I would care about,
but it makes a huge,
huge difference.

1509
01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:11.970
And just to give you an idea of what you might discover,

1510
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:15.870
did you know that blockbuster was actually catching up with Netflix until

1511
01:30:15.871 --> 01:30:16.471
corporate rater?

1512
01:30:16.471 --> 01:30:20.970
Carl ICAHN got involved and did that episode is a fantastic one.

1513
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:22.110
It's called sudden death.

1514
01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:27.150
It's the first episode in a multipart series that looks at blockbuster and

1515
01:30:27.301 --> 01:30:27.930
Netflix,

1516
01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:31.080
which I'm particularly interested in because it's not just two businesses and a

1517
01:30:31.081 --> 01:30:33.690
stagnant industry with stagnant technology.

1518
01:30:33.691 --> 01:30:38.610
There's a lot of different factors that come into play or did you know or do you

1519
01:30:38.611 --> 01:30:42.300
know what marvel did to really get ahead of it's much larger competitor?

1520
01:30:42.301 --> 01:30:43.134
DC comics.

1521
01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:46.410
Great interest to me since I was a comic book nerd and collected comics when I

1522
01:30:46.411 --> 01:30:51.411
was a kid or how sneakers went from athletic work everyday where this series

1523
01:30:51.511 --> 01:30:54.480
explores all of that and more.
It's hosted by David Brown,

1524
01:30:54.570 --> 01:30:56.160
a former anchor of marketplace,

1525
01:30:56.790 --> 01:31:01.790
and it is an immersive sound design experience and not just some type of sterile

1526
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:07.020
business review that shares the untold and very real stories of what went on

1527
01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:09.450
behind the scenes with the leaders,
investors,

1528
01:31:09.451 --> 01:31:12.510
executives that led them to either new heights or to roof.

1529
01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:17.250
Sometimes somewhere in between you can search business words on apple podcasts

1530
01:31:17.251 --> 01:31:21.850
or wherever you're listening to this episode right now or had to Wondery dot f m

1531
01:31:21.851 --> 01:31:22.621
Ford Slash Tim,

1532
01:31:22.621 --> 01:31:27.621
that's w o n d e r y.fm forward slash Tim to find business where it's a great

1533
01:31:28.441 --> 01:31:33.000
show and I do not say that lightly and I might suggest start with sudden death,

1534
01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.860
Netflix versus blockbuster.

1535
01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:39.270
This episode is brought to you by helix sleep.
Last year,

1536
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:43.050
I committed to making sleep a top priority,

1537
01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:48.240
trying to fix onset insomnia or continuing to fix that depth of sleep,

1538
01:31:48.241 --> 01:31:50.250
quality of sleep.
I tracked a lot.

1539
01:31:50.251 --> 01:31:55.251
I tested a lot and I revisited really everything from daily routine to the

1540
01:31:55.921 --> 01:31:59.980
surfaces.
I slept on playing with the chilly pad,
whatever,
and I moved to Austin.

1541
01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:03.850
I got all new beds including mattresses from Helix,

1542
01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.600
working with the world's leading sleep experts.
Certainly some of them,

1543
01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:09.430
he looks sleepy at all mattresses.

1544
01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:13.120
Personalized to your preferences and sleep style to make sure that you can have

1545
01:32:13.121 --> 01:32:17.560
the best sleep possible without costing thousands upon thousands of dollars.

1546
01:32:18.010 --> 01:32:20.050
He looked.
Sleep has recently added a new layer,

1547
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:22.360
customized sleep with the helix pillow.

1548
01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:26.110
Y'all new pillows are fully adjustable so you can achieve perfect comfort

1549
01:32:26.111 --> 01:32:29.990
regardless of sleep position or body type or if you're a shifty type like May.

1550
01:32:29.991 --> 01:32:31.480
I move around quite a bit when I sleep.

1551
01:32:32.050 --> 01:32:35.980
Just take their simple two to three minutes sleep quiz to get started and that
