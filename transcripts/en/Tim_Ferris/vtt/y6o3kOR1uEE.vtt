<v 1>Hello</v>

20
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.831
<v 0>girls,</v>

21
00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:31.220
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

22
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:35.240
I deconstruct world class performers,
whether they be billionaire,

23
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:40.070
hedge fund managers,
early stage investors like Peter Teal or celebrities,

24
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:43.070
Arnold Schwarzenegger,
musicians,
chess prodigies and so on.

25
00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:46.880
They have commonalities and they do have tools and tricks and routines that you

26
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:47.690
can use.

27
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.690
This episode I am interviewing Amanda Palmer who is a musician but also a social

28
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:59.120
media virtuoso and innovator as a musician from the standpoint of both music and

29
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:03.560
business models.
Some of you I'm sure have seen her hit Ted presentation,

30
00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:06.530
the art of asking,
which has been viewed more than 6 million times,

31
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.520
but her story goes much,
much deeper and we will plumb the depths.

32
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.110
We will talk about of course,
perhaps,
uh,

33
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.660
the Dresden dolls and where she first rose to prominence is one half of that

34
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:20.150
acclaimed pump cabaret duo.

35
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.510
Then the journey from solo album to leaving her record label all together and

36
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:30.620
experimenting with things like Kickstarter.

37
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.240
She made international news in 2012 when she raised nearly 1.2 million

38
00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:37.310
preselling.
Her new album theater is evil,

39
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.840
which went on to debut in the billboard top 10.
It's one hell of a story.

40
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.170
And she's also known as the Social Media Queen of rock and roll for her constant

41
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:50.630
and disarmingly intimate.
And I say disarmingly intimate,

42
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.930
such as standing naked in front of a room full of fans who sign your body with

43
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.820
various markers.
I'm not kidding.
Uh,
engagement with fans via her blog,

44
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:01.481
tumbler,
Twitter,

45
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:06.100
where she has more than a million followers and she has really opened a lot of

46
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:10.060
eyes to say a direct to fan or pay what you want,

47
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:12.350
business models for building and running her business.

48
00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:14.530
So we get into all of this,
uh,

49
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:19.531
and we of course dip our toe in the different tactics and stories from the art

50
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:24.400
of asking,
uh,
how she manages relationships and much more.

51
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.460
So let me stop this preamble and allow you to enjoy a very fun conversation.

52
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:33.610
I enjoyed immensely with Amanda Palmer.

53
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.780
<v 1>Cassie's cass,</v>

54
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.270
cass,
you say,
give this to God,

55
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.310
even in tow to sing that.

56
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.743
Amanda

57
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.360
<v 0>fucking Paul,
welcome to the show.</v>

58
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.900
Thank you Tim fucking Ferris.
Howard.
Fuck you.

59
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.833
I am great.

60
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.190
And the only reason I ask or rather introduce things that way is because I've

61
00:04:28.191 --> 00:04:29.360
been dying to ask you.

62
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.540
You have Amanda fucking Palmer listed as your alias or also known as everywhere.

63
00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:40.880
I've been able to really try to do homework including Wikipedia.

64
00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:44.000
How did you end up with fucking is an alternate middle name?

65
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.060
<v 2>Well,
as you know,
Wikipedia is not authored by the,
uh,</v>

66
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.660
it's not offered by the artists.
Right.
Amanda fucking Palmer is a,

67
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:56.661
is a joke nickname that Ben folds gave me while I was working on my first solo

68
00:04:58.771 --> 00:05:03.060
album.
And the,
the funny thing about the name is,
um,

69
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.830
it was,
it was actually aimed at me as an insult.
It was sort of,

70
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.620
it was one of those take back the night moments.
Um,
you know,
like,

71
00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:16.680
uh,
well,
like all the words that you're not allowed to say.

72
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.130
<v 0>Yeah,
you can,
you can say anything on this podcast doing.</v>

73
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.540
<v 2>But I mean it was one of those things where Ben Ben had someone who was a,</v>

74
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.760
uh,
uh,
a friend of occur,

75
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:34.330
an enemy who referred to me every time she referred to me,

76
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:38.330
she referred to me as Amanda fucking Palmer.
And so Ben as a joke,

77
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:41.140
because we were working on a record in Nashville together for like a month as a

78
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:43.300
joke started calling me AFP.

79
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.840
It just became the cause you and you also like,

80
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:50.530
you lose your mind in the studio and everything devolves into toilet humor

81
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.350
instantly.
Um,

82
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.560
that just became the running studio joke and then,
you know,

83
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:57.890
that was Ben's pet name for me.

84
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:01.070
And I thought it was funny enough that I started using it myself and then it

85
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:05.420
just sort of turned into a thing.
I don't even know how it turned into a thing,

86
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:08.870
but I think that's a good nickname isn't really deliberately.
It'd kind of like,

87
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:10.990
it lands on you and then it sticks like glue.

88
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.950
<v 0>Oh,
so you,
you,
you disarmed the insult by adopting it completely,</v>

89
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.620
which kind of is my life philosophy.

90
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.583
I love that.

91
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.570
<v 2>Take on the pain and wear it as a shirt.</v>

92
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.160
<v 0>Oh,
I love this.
And I'll just,</v>

93
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:31.460
I'll treat a really quick anecdote,
which is,
uh,

94
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.120
I was really bummed out at some point a few years ago when a new book came out

95
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.090
and,
uh,

96
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.320
got panned by this guy in the New York Times and I don't particularly like,

97
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.400
and I teach,
but I,

98
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:45.060
what I decided to do as retribution steel part of his,

99
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.660
that's exactly what I took.
I took part of it,

100
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.830
which was intended to be this over the top insult,
but out of context,

101
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:54.530
it sounds amazing.
It was like Tim Ferriss walks on air,

102
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.940
air and land or something at like.
Dot,
dot,
dot.
And I put it on the,

103
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.100
I put it on the inside flap of the four hour chef as a reward.

104
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.260
<v 2>I have a,
I have an indie rock friend who got panned and like,</v>

105
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.910
you know,
I don't know if it was the new year,

106
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:14.030
it was the indie rock equivalent of the New York Times,
which means it was,

107
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.340
you know,
it was pitchfork or something.
And they wrote this scathing,
you know,

108
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:22.670
no stars review of his new album's saying,
you know,

109
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:27.671
so and so thinks he is like the second coming of Christ and the most amazing

110
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:31.190
musical genius to ever walk the face of the planet.

111
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:33.460
And he just removed the kidney,

112
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.760
the beginning of that and stole the rest of the quote and a foster dad on his

113
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.940
press kit.
And I was like,
you are awesome.

114
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.900
<v 0>Yeah.
The uh,
the,
the movie poster.
Dot,
dot,
dot.
Matt Amazing.</v>

115
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.390
What magic can be worked doing things that way.

116
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.490
I have a confession and that is your book,

117
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.870
the art of asking.
I,
uh,
I,

118
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.270
I got halfway through it.

119
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.370
And the reason I haven't read the second half is because I was so inspired by

120
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:09.371
the book that I put it down to start asking people around me for all of the help

121
00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:14.600
that I've been too ashamed or embarrassed to ask for an Ezra assault.

122
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.070
I have fixed my no more time to read.
I have no more time to read,

123
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.650
so busy asking.
And I,
uh,

124
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:27.910
ended up fixing my health after a severe bout with Lyme disease lashed last year

125
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.030
and have just had these multiple quantum leaps forward.

126
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:35.930
So I wanted to thank you for putting the book out there,
first of all.

127
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.980
<v 2>Oh,
that's wonderful.
I'm so happy to hear that.
Actually.</v>

128
00:08:38.981 --> 00:08:42.340
I'd rather hear that than hear they need that you've finished my book and loved

129
00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:45.310
it,
but it didn't change anything in your life.

130
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.010
It makes me really happy.

131
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.300
<v 0>Oh,
I was,
I was,</v>

132
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.480
I was so just completely smitten with the book.

133
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.030
And the subtitle I think is really important.
Uh,

134
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.590
so correct me if I get this wrong,
but I've,

135
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.710
I believe it's how I learned to stop worrying and let people help.

136
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.540
And I wanted to ask you,

137
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.990
and of course we're going to come back to some of your background and everything

138
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:09.810
else,
but why did you book is a hard thing.

139
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.650
I mean a lot of things in life are hard,
but books are,
are uh,
are a challenge.

140
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:18.420
Why did you decide to put this book together and put it out there?

141
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.520
<v 2>I don't think I would've put this book together if I hadn't been offered a</v>

142
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.280
totally.
Um,

143
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.910
we will make this easy for you book deal because I've been,

144
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.790
I'm one of those people who's always got,
you know,

145
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:39.791
19 projects on the back burner and one of them was someday I should write a

146
00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:44.090
book,
I'll write a book someday when I have time.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Like you know,

147
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.380
somebody who tours 250 days a year and has,
you know,

148
00:09:48.381 --> 00:09:51.920
millions of unrecorded songs and you know,

149
00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:55.130
all sorts of Bizarro side projects.
You know,

150
00:09:55.131 --> 00:09:59.810
a book always seemed like a great thing in theory and in practice,

151
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.840
just a huge pain in the ass and not something that I ever really imagined

152
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.760
fitting into my life as a,
as a runner around her.
Um,

153
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.600
cause I know enough about book writing to know that it's not something I could

154
00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:18.620
like tap out on the fly on flights from one place to the other.

155
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.860
I was really going to have to put press pause on my life as I knew it.

156
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.640
And after I,
um,

157
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.900
started working on my ted talk,
you know,
I had a had,
I'd have the,

158
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.200
the vague idea of writing a book sort of the,

159
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.850
the first time I really thought about it other than the basic narcissistic,
oh,

160
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:44.070
write my memoirs someday,
which I think every,

161
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.680
every artist who lives in kind of an off kilter,

162
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:49.190
bizarre life with interesting stories.

163
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.410
Probably has the thought someday to just write the stories down.

164
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.200
But the first time I really thought about writing a book was,

165
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:03.010
was actually after my experience street performing because street performing in

166
00:11:03.681 --> 00:11:06.620
my particular experiences treat performing was,

167
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.750
it was so unique.

168
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:14.290
And I didn't know of anybody out there who had written about what it was like to

169
00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:17.480
be a living statue.
And,

170
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.870
and then later in my life with crowdfunding and the Internet and really seeing

171
00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:28.170
the connections,
the,
the,

172
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:33.230
the strange but philosophical connections between living statue work and

173
00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:40.871
stripping and starting a band and trusting fans and asking for money.

174
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.970
And I was like,
all of these things are really related.

175
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.830
They're all kind of part of one philosophy and one story and that would make a

176
00:11:51.831 --> 00:11:56.290
great book.
And it's,
uh,
and it's,
and it's unlike anything else I know.
I mean,

177
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:57.970
it's not really a book about music.

178
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:01.600
It's not really a book about being a street performer.

179
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:06.601
It's kind of a book about an approach to life that is about abundance and trust

180
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:12.580
instead of about scarcity and fear,
you know,

181
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.720
in the frame of art and performance art.
But also like,
as I found,

182
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:19.540
as I kept carving out the book,
it's,
you know,

183
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:24.430
it was also about relationships and um,
a risk and,

184
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.800
you know,
kind of the big themes.

185
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.980
And once I did the Ted talk,
you know,
while I was working on the Ted talk,

186
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:36.730
I worked together with my really good friend Jamie and Swiss who's this

187
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:41.260
fantastic magician and SAS and you know,

188
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:46.470
he sort of fell into my lap as my ted coach cause I called him one night and I

189
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:49.990
knew that he had given talks at conferences.

190
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.560
So he was one of the people in my life that I could tap.
As you know,

191
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:55.900
you understand Ted,
you understand conferences.

192
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:58.930
I can't ask most of my friends about this.
Um,

193
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.380
you know what makes a good talk?
Can I read you what I've written?

194
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:07.270
And I had what I thought was going to be a 20 minute phone call turned into a

195
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:12.271
three hour phone call with Jamie giving me all sorts of advice and all sorts of

196
00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:15.580
opinions and all sorts of,
you know,
calling me on my bullshit.

197
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.800
And by the end of that three hours,
I was like,
Jamie,
you're going to have,

198
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:24.070
you're going to be my wing man on this Ted talk.
If you help me do this,

199
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.160
I will love you forever.
And he was like,
I'm here for you.

200
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:28.300
I will help you with this ted talk.

201
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:33.450
So I would say he's sort of like the hidden hero man behind the curtain of my

202
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:38.821
ted talk because he was the guy on the phone with me every other day for an hour

203
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:45.250
while I read him draft after draft after draft of my ted talk.

204
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.120
And there's a reason my ted talk wound up so good.

205
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.230
I didn't just knock it out and read it.

206
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.260
I worked slaved on that fucker for to really like it was,

207
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:04.261
it was like constructing a perfect little monologue with no fat and just the

208
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:10.360
right cadence.
And I,
I really,
really,
really,
I really worked hard on it.

209
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.710
But one of the things that happened as I added little anecdotes and added

210
00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:19.711
stories and we cut them and we refined and honed and decided that this was a

211
00:14:20.201 --> 00:14:23.530
little too off topic,
is we came up with the phrase,
you know,

212
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.430
it'll go in the book.

213
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.330
You don't have to put it in the talk and then you only have 12 minutes that'll

214
00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:29.590
go in your book someday.

215
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:34.300
And so that was when the imaginary book took shape,

216
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:37.450
which is,
you know,
for this 12 minute ted talk,

217
00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:41.440
I was trying to condense my entire life philosophy,
you know,

218
00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:46.441
into into a teeny amount of time that there were so many other stories that were

219
00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:47.494
relevant.

220
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.830
And I comforted myself with the idea that if the Ted talk resonated,

221
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.090
I would someday expanded all into a talk.

222
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:59.560
And then I didn't have to worry about that at all because the minute that Ted

223
00:14:59.561 --> 00:15:02.660
talk went online and went viral,

224
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.960
my phone rang off the hook with,

225
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.850
with book deals and I,

226
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:12.350
and I just decided I would take one and I would do an a and then I would just

227
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:14.870
like go down the rabbit hole and figure out how to write a book.

228
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.470
<v 0>The Ted talk is fantastic.
And for people listening,</v>

229
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:22.820
I'll put the Ted talk in the show notes so you guys can check that out as well.

230
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.830
It's a great introduction to the,

231
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.430
the then expanded narrative and collection of stories and lessons.

232
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:32.150
That is the book of course.
Uh,
and I'm sure when you wrote the book you're like,

233
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.760
well,
it doesn't all have to go in the book.
This will be the online extras.

234
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:41.120
But the,
the mention of Ted and the,
uh,
the Amanda Whisper,

235
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.670
your friend who is helping you with the presentation,

236
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.800
I called him Ted Doula and then the book exactly the Ted Doula.

237
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.580
I'd be very interested to hear what some of the,

238
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.560
the best feedback or,

239
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.330
or changes were that he gave to you for the,

240
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:00.830
for the Ted talk itself.

241
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.050
<v 2>Well,
you know,
a lot of it was not unlike writing a book.</v>

242
00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:10.190
And since you've written,
I'm sure you,
you know,
this quandary,

243
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:15.191
which is you get so interested in your topic that you keep wanting to expand and

244
00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:21.560
expound and,
and,

245
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.620
and the true beauty of making a good ted talk or a good book is that you edit

246
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.530
down and you,
and you distill.

247
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.330
And so the key with the Ted talk was,
you know,

248
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:37.760
I kept wanting to add like,
oh my God,

249
00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:41.360
and then there's this and how can I not talk about this?
And you know,

250
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:46.160
there was this amazing thing that happened and are,
you know,
and our,

251
00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:51.161
and our goal was to just literally using an economy of language.

252
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.550
You know,
I would write a sentence and write an anecdote and speak it.

253
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.061
You know,

254
00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:03.380
I would be on Skype with Jamie and it would take me a minute and a half to tell

255
00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:06.430
this story about couch surfing,
you know,
with this,

256
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.780
this girl and her family down in Florida.

257
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.670
And then the goal was how do we take this story that took a minute and a half to

258
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:18.671
tell and I thought I had got it as far down economically as possible and then

259
00:17:19.611 --> 00:17:22.940
take that minute and a half story and condense it into 20 seconds.

260
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.400
What literally what words,

261
00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:30.401
what single words could we use to convey that whole sentence and it,

262
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:36.350
and it was like songwriting or poetry where instead of saying and expounding and

263
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:37.910
going off on Tangents,

264
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.240
you just pick that one perfect sentence that sums up everything you've felt.

265
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.150
And in that sense there was a,
there was a real artistry behind it.

266
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.400
And I've found watching other Ted and looking at other ted talks,

267
00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:51.630
they have that in common,

268
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.670
which was an economy of emotion and of expression.
You know,

269
00:17:56.671 --> 00:17:59.280
they didn't need to explain this and that.

270
00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:03.300
And the other thing they with a single anecdote or a single detail,

271
00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.230
they emotionally take you right there and they don't need to say anymore and

272
00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:08.390
they can get onto the next thing.
Yeah.

273
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.940
<v 0>It brings to mind a couple of things.</v>

274
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:19.860
The first was an exercise that a writing professor of mine back in college named

275
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:23.670
John,
uh,
fee used to have us do,

276
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:24.900
which would be to take something like the,

277
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:29.901
get a Gettysburg address and have to pull out five lines or six lines and a,

278
00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:33.710
which was always so torturous.
But uh,

279
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.470
separately was told very early on,
I think it was related to,

280
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.380
to teaching as opposed to writing.

281
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:42.930
Although I think that the two are very similar when you're talking about

282
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:46.470
nonfiction and that was most teaching fails from too much information,

283
00:18:46.471 --> 00:18:50.850
not too little.
And I think that,
sure Ted presentations are very similar.

284
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.100
<v 2>I think you could say that about art.
Sure.
Yeah.</v>

285
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.970
Like the best art is,
is about economy.

286
00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:04.250
And,
and you know,
even if you're,
you know,
even if your art is,

287
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.020
you know,
durational performance art,
um,
even within that,

288
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.910
there can be an economy because the artist who's just trying to do everything,

289
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.540
you know,
wines up,
uh,
uh,

290
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.940
unable to express whatever it is that's of importance.

291
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.690
<v 0>Durational performance art.</v>

292
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.240
What would be an example of durational performance art?

293
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:29.590
<v 2>Uh,
I mean,
Marina Abramovich sitting in a,</v>

294
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.500
sitting in Moma for three months.

295
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.570
<v 0>Got It.
That's a long duration.
That's</v>

296
00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:38.950
<v 2>the ration.
That's durational performance art.
But if you look at a,</v>

297
00:19:38.951 --> 00:19:43.810
if you look at Marina Abramovich sitting in a Moma for three months there,

298
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.290
there was an economy about what she did.
You know,

299
00:19:47.291 --> 00:19:50.830
she didn't wear a different costume every day and you know,

300
00:19:50.831 --> 00:19:53.080
also try to do 90 other things at once.

301
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.140
It was her and a chair and another person.

302
00:19:56.141 --> 00:20:00.850
And there was a real economy in that.
So,
you know,
I've,

303
00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:05.530
I've definitely had a battle all my life with economy.
I've,

304
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.340
you know,
I'm an,

305
00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:11.340
I'm a maximalist and I have driven collaborators and managers and boyfriends and

306
00:20:14.231 --> 00:20:14.921
girlfriends.

307
00:20:14.921 --> 00:20:19.921
And pretty much everybody in my wife crazy because I always want it.

308
00:20:20.411 --> 00:20:22.930
I want to add more and I want to do more and Oh my God,

309
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.830
if we're going to do this,

310
00:20:23.831 --> 00:20:27.280
we could do this on top of it and we could do this too with like let's add more

311
00:20:27.281 --> 00:20:30.430
dancing girls and let's add more.
You know,

312
00:20:30.431 --> 00:20:35.230
more of like more triangle,
like all the,
you know,
more cow bell,
all the things.

313
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.740
And you know,
as an,
as an artist and you,

314
00:20:38.741 --> 00:20:41.620
you see this in the wisdom of older artists as they,

315
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.520
as they talk about their processes,
they pay like your life,

316
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.110
you know,

317
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:52.110
your life goes on and you pair down and you keep paring down to the point where

318
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:53.711
you know,

319
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:58.600
you realize that it wasn't the extra performance artists that made your show

320
00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:02.890
good.
It was the ability to pair down to the detail,

321
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.540
the impactful detail.
And you know,
that's,

322
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.320
that's just true in art as in life for sure.

323
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.540
<v 0>And how,
how have you become,</v>

324
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:18.870
do you feel like you have become better at editing and distilling in your art?

325
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:25.870
And if so,
what has been the most helpful in getting you to that point?

326
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.080
<v 2>Um,
that's a really good question because it also really depends on the form,</v>

327
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:34.240
you know,
songwriting as a good example,

328
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.580
songwriting and um,
you know,

329
00:21:38.581 --> 00:21:41.730
and even recording songs is a good example.
I used to think,

330
00:21:41.731 --> 00:21:44.250
here's a really specific,
that a really good lesson

331
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
I used to think and one would think that if you were just recording a single

332
00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:53.260
song,
you know,

333
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:57.790
but let's say it's a really aggressive piano song and it's just piano and
vocals,

334
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:03.570
you would think that layering and overdubbing more piano would make for a

335
00:22:06.131 --> 00:22:09.100
stronger sound.
So instead of just having,
you know,

336
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.360
one single piano playing a baseline and a right hand and your vocal on top of
it,

337
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.720
you know,
you record the piano 10 times over.

338
00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:21.670
And so you've basically got the entire end of the piano on the recording and you

339
00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:23.320
crank everything up to 11.

340
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:28.840
And the fascinating thing about that is and,

341
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:33.930
and incredibly poetic as related to the rest of art and life is the strongest

342
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:40.220
loudest sound you can get from a piano is playing two notes,

343
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:41.031
you know,

344
00:22:41.031 --> 00:22:46.031
a low C and a middle e and banging the shit out of those two notes is way more

345
00:22:47.361 --> 00:22:52.361
impactful and striking and strong and aggressive than overdubbing 27 notes on

346
00:22:53.841 --> 00:22:58.670
top of that.
And you know,
ACDC is kind of a perfect example.

347
00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:03.050
You know,
those,
those guitar rifts and those single notes,

348
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:08.500
they burned themselves into your brain and they don't need a whole lot of extra.

349
00:23:09.771 --> 00:23:13.040
It's the,
it's the,
it's the sheer,
you know,

350
00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:17.090
epic simplicity of um,
of the,
of the,
of the minimal.

351
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.970
And you know,

352
00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:24.170
I've found that this is true pretty much everywhere in life,

353
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:27.800
especially when it comes to,
I mean you were mentioning it with teaching.

354
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.653
It was,

355
00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:34.660
it's something that I have been learning in my relationships from day one and

356
00:23:34.761 --> 00:23:39.761
still struggle with to this day and found myself even doing in the last 48 hours

357
00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.440
of my relationship with Neal,

358
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.100
which is learning how to say less.

359
00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:51.950
<v 3>And especially for someone like me who's a motor mouth and you know,</v>

360
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:55.910
wants to be constantly communicating and engaged.

361
00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.480
The ability to have a thought and not just blurted out and to have something

362
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:05.180
that you think is interesting that you want to share or to have an observation

363
00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:10.181
or a criticism and not say it and,

364
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:16.070
and deliberate and consider is this actually useful?

365
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.100
Is this actually compassionate?

366
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:24.370
This is actually necessary to the conversation or does saying less actually

367
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:29.150
leave more space for more love.

368
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.540
And I have found the best,

369
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:36.710
the best advice from my mentor.
Um,

370
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.840
who else to talk about in the book does,
and funny enough,

371
00:24:41.841 --> 00:24:45.040
it's pretty economical advice as well is,

372
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.080
is life advice to me when I'm going into a conflict or a difficult situation

373
00:24:52.351 --> 00:24:56.250
with my parents or you know,
an argument with Neal,

374
00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:02.040
his advice is say less.
That's it.
Just to say less.

375
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.970
<v 0>It's such good advice.
Great advice or emails to,</v>

376
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.150
we should just skip the next 60 minutes of the podcast.

377
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.720
Play two notes on a piano for the next 45 minutes.
Please stand by.
Uh,

378
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.190
I wanna I wanna I definitely wanna come back to,
uh,
the relationship,

379
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.110
your relationship briefly a little further down the road,

380
00:25:25.111 --> 00:25:29.820
but I'd love to rewind the clock a little bit and talk about the,
uh,

381
00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:30.683
eight foot bride.

382
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.410
Could you give people a little bit of context for those who don't know your

383
00:25:34.411 --> 00:25:38.820
story?
Uh,
just a little bit of context on the eight foot bride.

384
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:44.060
And the question I'd like to then add on that is just what your main lessons

385
00:25:45.631 --> 00:25:50.631
learned were from that experience that have translated to all of the other

386
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.330
endeavors and experiments that you've had.

387
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.660
<v 3>Okay.
Well,
the basic background is,
um,</v>

388
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.700
is that I was a living statue and most people know what that is because they've

389
00:26:03.701 --> 00:26:07.090
seen it if they've traveled to any metropolis,

390
00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:11.560
but you don't know what a living statue is.
It's a street performer.
Um,

391
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:15.890
usually monochromatically colored,
you know,
all white,
all silver,

392
00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.900
all blue face painted gloves and sometimes living statues,

393
00:26:19.901 --> 00:26:23.800
wear sunglasses and wigs.
And you know,

394
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.710
my least favorite living statues where wear masks,

395
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.370
I think that's cheating.
Um,

396
00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.510
because there's a real beauty and watching somebody frozen face,
that's a real,

397
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.150
that's a,
um,
that's a real part of the talent.

398
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.260
But I basically graduated college.
Um,

399
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.250
I knew I wanted to be a,
or a musician.

400
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:46.260
I knew I was either going to go into music or theater,

401
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:49.320
but my main passion was song writing and I,
you know,

402
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:52.860
it's working my collection of shitty jobs.
Um,
my,

403
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.430
my main shitty job being,
um,
and it was a great,

404
00:26:56.431 --> 00:26:59.460
Shitty job just in case my old boss is listening because I love him.

405
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.880
I worked in a,
in a fantastic little ice cream shop in,

406
00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:08.910
in Harvard Square that was called Toscanini's and we scooped ice cream and made

407
00:27:08.971 --> 00:27:13.890
coffee for the Denisons of Harvard Square and,
and Harvard.
And,

408
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:19.200
um,
I had seen street performers,
you know,
all my life.
And I had,
I had,

409
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.720
I remember mentally noting,
you know,
every time I saw living statue

410
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.890
who does that and you know,
who gives you permission to do that?

411
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.190
And I could do that.
You know,
anyone could clearly do that.

412
00:27:32.191 --> 00:27:35.580
You just need to paint yourself and get on a box.
Um,

413
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.250
and so one day I just,
I just did it.

414
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:43.320
I painted myself white and put on a bridal gown and avail and some gloves.

415
00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:48.300
And I stood on a box.
I was terrified.
Um,
and I,

416
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.870
and I put,
uh,
I put a hat at my feet,
um,

417
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.370
and I gave out flowers and you know,

418
00:27:56.371 --> 00:27:59.880
that first time I got up and did that,
it was a real,

419
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:05.670
it was sort of one of those life breakthrough moments where I felt so

420
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.840
I felt so fraudulent.
I was like,
this isn't,

421
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.410
no one's giving me permission to do this.
No one's taught me how to do this.

422
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.220
I'm really faking this.
I mean,
I assume you just stand here.

423
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:23.760
No.
Are there rules for being a statue?
And I,
and I just did it.

424
00:28:23.761 --> 00:28:27.210
And it was,
it was delightful.
And I really,
I,

425
00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.750
I had this moment of incredible feeling,

426
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:34.590
incredible freedom.
Just,
you know,

427
00:28:34.591 --> 00:28:39.591
taking that $17 I made that day and just going out and buying a sandwich and a

428
00:28:39.691 --> 00:28:43.350
packet of cigarettes and going,
oh my God,
this money is just mine.

429
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:46.620
People just gave it to me.
I,
you know,

430
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.540
it was such a,
it was such a um,

431
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:57.720
uh,
you know,
like a Eureka moment after only having been,

432
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.080
you know,
been given money,
you know,

433
00:29:01.081 --> 00:29:05.790
in the form of a paycheck from a boss to just have people giving you pulled hard

434
00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:10.780
cast for performing and the street was a real,
really beautiful feeling.
Um,

435
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.810
and I never went back after that.
Although being a,

436
00:29:12.811 --> 00:29:17.811
being a living statue and in Boston is a clearly seasonal occupation.

437
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.720
So,
you know,
I would sort of,
um,
I would go back to,

438
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.930
to,
you know,
to cafe work in the winters or I would,

439
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:32.460
I would travel and perform the eight foot bride in,

440
00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:37.350
in warmer hospital will climbs.
Like I went down to key west and I went to La.

441
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:42.460
I tried my hand at Vegas,
I went to Australia when,
one winter.

442
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:48.300
But I would say I made about 95% of my living statue income right in the middle

443
00:29:48.821 --> 00:29:51.550
of Harvard Square over the course of,
you know,

444
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:53.920
four or five years.

445
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.440
And it really,
you know,

446
00:29:57.441 --> 00:30:02.140
it wasn't until I looked back,
um,
after,

447
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.471
you know,

448
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:07.120
after years of having transferred into the music and rocking and rolling tour in

449
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.500
performer career,

450
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:14.430
that I realized how much street-life and busking life has shaped my approach to

451
00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:18.130
everything.
You know,
my,

452
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:23.170
my life philosophy was not an academic approach.

453
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.890
It was not a music business approach.
It was a busking approach,

454
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:31.930
which is you have to,
you have to be good at what you do.

455
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.270
And,
um,
and then you rely on the goodwill of others.

456
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:42.160
And that's the way busking works.
You know,
nobody buys a ticket.
You,

457
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:47.190
you do your thing and you have to captivate a crowd and,

458
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:48.910
and then you pass your hat.

459
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.090
What separates a good living statue from a great living?

460
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.530
Oh,
you know,
I think,
I think there's two answers to that question.

461
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:04.670
I have seen some shitty fucking living statues and I have seen some,

462
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.770
have seen some people with the,

463
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:12.480
who have put the absolute minimal amount of care and effort into their costumes

464
00:31:14.441 --> 00:31:16.300
and makeup.
Um,

465
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.840
and it's always really depressing to me to see a bad living statue.
You know,

466
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:22.210
someone who's just like,
you know,

467
00:31:22.211 --> 00:31:27.211
wearing a rain coat and a bad mask and isn't even really standing still,

468
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:33.040
you know,
and has barely interacting with,
um,

469
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:37.660
with the people who are giving the money.
And,
you know,
regardless,

470
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:42.430
everyone has always curious about a living statue.
Even a bad living statue.
And,

471
00:31:42.431 --> 00:31:46.240
you know,
in children's curiosity is,
is unrelenting.

472
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:50.970
So they can't really tell the difference between an immaculate living statue who

473
00:31:50.971 --> 00:31:52.870
spent $2,000 on a,
you know,

474
00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:57.760
an a beautiful latex costume that looks completely realistic.
You know,
or,

475
00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.760
or someone who's just,
you know,
wearing a shitty raincoat and a mask.

476
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.780
All they know is that there's something happening and it might be magic and they

477
00:32:04.781 --> 00:32:09.190
put their dollar and something magical is going to happen.
Um,

478
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.570
but you know,
I've seen,

479
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.600
I have seen some really incredible living statues with just glorious costumes

480
00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:21.670
and they,
you know,
they're,
they're just killing it in the aesthetics department,

481
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.990
but they don't love you.
And my favorite,

482
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.400
my favorite living statues are the ones who have some Patheos and,

483
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.010
and who actually connect with you.
Um,

484
00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:41.030
and that was the approach I took to,
uh,
to the eight foot bride,
which is,

485
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:45.380
you know,
I as a,
as a performer,
hungry for love and connection.

486
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:50.150
I treated every single patron,
um,

487
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:54.830
as a,
as like a ten second love affair.
And I,
I just,

488
00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:00.160
I enjoyed so deeply the act of looking into a stranger's eyes and thanking them

489
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:07.010
for giving me a quarter that,
um,
you know,
that it was a real part of the job,

490
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:08.090
but also means that,
you know,

491
00:33:08.091 --> 00:33:11.060
I'm really disappointed if I go up to a living statue.
And they're like,
yeah,

492
00:33:11.061 --> 00:33:12.620
yeah,
yeah,
you gave me a dollar now fuck off.

493
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.840
<v 0>Sad,
cheap trick or something.</v>

494
00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:19.460
So what,

495
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.850
you mentioned eye contact and you have v you have very striking icontact and

496
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:29.250
certainly use that in your ted talk.
And I,

497
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:31.760
I've seen it in other photographs and videos.

498
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:35.450
What advice would you give?

499
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.560
I think that most people avoid excessive eye contact,

500
00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:44.561
but what advice would you give to average Joe or Jane out there about

501
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.730
using icontact,
connect with people?
What are your thoughts on that?

502
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.870
<v 3>Uh,
I have a lot of thoughts on that.
I mean,
I,
I think,</v>

503
00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.920
I think eye contact is very hard for a lot of us because it is,

504
00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:09.540
it's so threatening and the more disconnected we are and the more time we spend

505
00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.940
looking into our devices and barely looking at each other,
um,

506
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.190
the more threatening it is to,
to,
to keep and hold somebody's gaze.

507
00:34:24.910 --> 00:34:27.730
But God,
is it powerful?
I mean,

508
00:34:27.731 --> 00:34:32.190
looking somebody in the eye unthreatening Lee,

509
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.470
um,
on aggressively it is,
it is the,

510
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:43.310
I really feel like it is often the antidote for what is ailing us because we

511
00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:47.370
feel so connected superficially in so many ways.

512
00:34:47.371 --> 00:34:51.930
And perhaps we are through our Twitter feeds,
through our Facebook feeds,

513
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.710
through our many events,
through our doing this and that.
I'm running around.

514
00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:00.740
But if we're able to do all that and we're not able to look at and see each

515
00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:07.190
other,
it all,
it all can feel really superficial.

516
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:09.710
And I had some,

517
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:15.070
I had some really life changing experiences,

518
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.830
um,
in yoga retreats particularly.
And I read about one of them in the book,

519
00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:25.390
one of the,
one of the first teacher training,
yoga retreats I went on.
I was,

520
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:28.630
it was probably 26,

521
00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.310
27 and we did this exercise where,

522
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.730
um,
you know,
there's maybe 50 of us in the group total and,

523
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.490
and we did this exercise where we,

524
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.840
we got into groups of like 10 and we took turns just standing in a line facing

525
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:49.950
each other.
Um,
and it was basically an exercise in,

526
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:52.770
in presence and the,

527
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:57.830
and the goal was just to stand there and face another person,

528
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.910
maybe about a foot apart.
Ida,
I

529
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:08.220
just gazing into each other's eyes and not reacting,

530
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.970
not smiling,
not giggling,
not rolling our eyes,
not saying,
oh,

531
00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:16.380
it doesn't this feel kind of uncomfortable and silly that just really just

532
00:36:16.381 --> 00:36:17.550
holding the gaze.

533
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:24.510
And what was so incredible to me about that,

534
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.080
and this is after I had clocked my five years,
is,
uh,
you know,

535
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.330
living statue.
So I of course I'm just loving this,
I'm soaking this in.

536
00:36:33.331 --> 00:36:36.930
This is like,
you know,
crack cocaine to meet basically like,
yeah,

537
00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:40.830
I get to just look in someone's eyes for three minutes and then I get to look in

538
00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:43.570
someone else's eyes.
And I just,
to me,
the,
the,

539
00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.570
the juicy intimacy of that was,
uh,

540
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.310
you know,
felt like a warm bath,

541
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:56.360
but for six or seven people in that group of 50,

542
00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.340
they burst out sobbing.
They could not handle

543
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:09.470
actually what w and W and we did a lot of talking and kind of breaking down in a

544
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:14.940
postmortem of this experience afterwards.
And it wasn't even the,

545
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:18.720
they felt overwhelmed by having to look at someone else.

546
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:25.430
They felt overwhelmed by actually feeling seen by another person.

547
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.900
And the,
the emotion,
the emotional,
overwhelming,

548
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:39.480
uh,
experience of,
of feeling really just,

549
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:44.160
you know,
intimately seen by another,

550
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.700
having spent possible an entire lifetime,

551
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.820
not being seen by their parents,

552
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.340
not being seen by their peers,

553
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:58.410
not being seen by the people around them and maybe avoiding it,
you know,

554
00:37:58.411 --> 00:38:02.190
for reasons of fear,
fear of intimacy,

555
00:38:02.191 --> 00:38:05.730
fear of being found out,
fear of whatever it was.

556
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.860
And I remember looking at this and these weren't fucked up people,
these were,

557
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:13.800
you know,
these are your average,
you know,

558
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:19.370
a totally functional adults in their thirties with jobs and kids and the whole

559
00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:24.270
nine.
And I remember thinking like,

560
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:30.210
this isn't just them.
I mean this is really all of us.
We,

561
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:35.540
we do not connect with each other at nearly the level

562
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:37.630
<v 2>we could.</v>

563
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.610
And though we live in close proximity and though we sit on the subway with each

564
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:45.100
other and though we,
you know,

565
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:50.130
though we have a wide variety of things connecting us and making us sort of

566
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:51.400
pseudo intimate,

567
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.570
a lot of us are really alone.

568
00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.510
And that was a real,
that was a real eyeopener.

569
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:02.790
Uh,
excuse the Pun.

570
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.590
<v 0>I think this is a really profound point that you're making and the pseudo</v>

571
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.540
intimacy I think is a great way to put it.
I,

572
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:17.580
I I tend to unexpectedly at times brush just enter a zone of sort of profound

573
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.310
loneliness and it's the,

574
00:39:23.311 --> 00:39:27.160
the irony in some ways I think is that of course you have,

575
00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:32.080
you have an incredibly loyal fan base.
And uh,
I've,

576
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:37.100
I'm very fortunate to have a really fantastic group of readers and listeners and

577
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.350
I'm,
I'm,
I find it so easy to love them,
to love my friends,
to love my family.

578
00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:44.260
If I had a very difficult sometimes to love myself,

579
00:39:44.261 --> 00:39:47.260
it seems almost self indulgent and that's kind of weird.
You could,

580
00:39:47.261 --> 00:39:49.180
I'm sure there's plenty of analysis that can be done on that.

581
00:39:49.181 --> 00:39:52.930
But one of the most therapeutic,
we were talking about,

582
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.600
you mentioned yoga before we got started and also again here,

583
00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.530
one of the most therapeutic unexpectedly therapeutic experiences I've had in the

584
00:39:59.531 --> 00:40:04.420
last six months is starting to play with something called Acro Yoga where you

585
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.860
are

586
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.170
<v 2>yeah,</v>

587
00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.530
<v 0>Yoga and you,</v>

588
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:11.600
there's a trust element and a vulnerability element of balancing each other

589
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:17.090
upside down and staring.
You have to maintain at points I contact and it's,

590
00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.130
it's a very visceral,

591
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:24.500
primal need that is being satisfied.
Um,
anyway,
I,

592
00:40:24.501 --> 00:40:26.780
I don't want to ramble on,
but it's,

593
00:40:26.781 --> 00:40:30.830
it's been a really profound realization for me that I can't think myself out of,

594
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.440
I can't think myself out of this loneliness.
No.

595
00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.810
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean we,
I think we think that we can think a lot of things.</v>

596
00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:45.870
You know,
we can think our way out of a relationship problem.

597
00:40:45.871 --> 00:40:49.470
We can think our way out of a sexual problem and we can think our way out of a

598
00:40:49.471 --> 00:40:52.080
work problem.
And to me,

599
00:40:52.081 --> 00:40:57.050
Yoga and also like meditation and really trying to have,
um,

600
00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.060
you know,
a constant level of body awareness.

601
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:06.030
It's so important because you really can get lost in your head.

602
00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.080
And if you,
you know,
if you,
if,
if,

603
00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:14.110
if you demand that your head and your body are disconnected and you really can

604
00:41:14.821 --> 00:41:18.720
just like,
as long as you sort of like feed your body and drag it around as a,

605
00:41:18.721 --> 00:41:22.270
as a container for your mind,
everything's fine.
The,

606
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:26.280
the whole system starts to fall apart.
And I see that more and more,

607
00:41:26.281 --> 00:41:28.810
especially as I get older.
Um,

608
00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:34.130
if I neglect my body and I neglect like,

609
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.641
you know,

610
00:41:34.641 --> 00:41:39.641
actual physical contact with other people for too long because it's just a pain

611
00:41:41.781 --> 00:41:44.690
in the ass cause I just don't have time because I'm too busy this week to get to

612
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:49.220
yoga because it did,
it did.
It really like the,
the,
the,
you know,

613
00:41:49.221 --> 00:41:50.850
the whole building starts to feel like it's,

614
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:55.640
it's built on sound shit just falls down and,

615
00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.510
you know,
I,

616
00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:01.730
there's still something in us and in me because you know,

617
00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:06.731
we are taught to be so rational and so had oriented the kind of don't want to

618
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:11.150
believe that it's true and the he can get away with it.
Um,

619
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:14.720
but you count it all eventually comes back to roost.

620
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.010
<v 0>You mentioned meditation.
I'd love to dig into that for a second.
Uh,</v>

621
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.220
and uh,
as I,
as I understand it,

622
00:42:23.221 --> 00:42:27.620
you've also written about meditation before.
Um,

623
00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:30.420
there's one piece that when I was doing better research,

624
00:42:30.421 --> 00:42:32.570
melody versus meditation,
what,

625
00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:37.560
what is your meditation practice look like?
And,
uh,

626
00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.290
what,
what are the benefits that you've seen?

627
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:41.171
<v 2>Well,</v>

628
00:42:41.171 --> 00:42:45.130
I have this special room in my house that's covered with candles and lots of

629
00:42:45.131 --> 00:42:50.131
statues and I burned six sticks of incense and I drink a special stick tea and

630
00:42:50.861 --> 00:42:54.730
then I float into the air and it's really rad.

631
00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:59.770
Uh,
that's all,
that's all bullshit.

632
00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:06.660
What I usually do,
uh,
if I'm,
if I'm being good is,
um,

633
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.780
first thing in the morning,

634
00:43:07.781 --> 00:43:12.781
I will just use my phone as a timer and I will sit on whatever I can grab.

635
00:43:12.791 --> 00:43:16.030
If I don't have a meditation cushion around,
I'll grab it up,
you know,

636
00:43:16.031 --> 00:43:20.860
a bed pillow or a towel.
And I will sit cross legged somewhere.
If I'm,

637
00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.960
you know,
a five minute teeny hotel or a friend's house,

638
00:43:22.961 --> 00:43:27.610
sometimes it's in the bathroom or on the bed.
Um,
and I try to,

639
00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:29.950
I tried to meditate for,
you know,

640
00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:33.730
10 minutes if it's a crazy busy day and a half an hour,
if it's,

641
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.570
if I can carve out the time.
Um,

642
00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.490
and I definitely notice,

643
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:43.680
I notice a huge difference in my day if I'm,

644
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:48.570
if I actually make the time to do that.
And you know,
I was,
um,

645
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:53.680
I was brought into the world of meditation in my,
you know,
my late teens,

646
00:43:53.681 --> 00:43:57.730
early twenties,
and just basic vipassana meditation.

647
00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:01.480
Nothing fancy,
no crazy mantras,
no,

648
00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.970
no God's or deities just basically sitting,

649
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.320
sitting on the earth as a human being and paying attention to your breath.

650
00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.370
And your body and letting thoughts come and go,

651
00:44:12.371 --> 00:44:15.980
but really trying not to be attached to,
to the,

652
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:20.050
the drama that comes visiting.
And,
um,

653
00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.970
I wish I could tell you I was great at it.

654
00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:25.540
I've been meditating for 20 years and I still feel like a shitty meditator,

655
00:44:25.541 --> 00:44:27.880
which I think,
I think that's,

656
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.230
I think that's part of the journey is realizing that it's,
you know,

657
00:44:31.231 --> 00:44:34.110
it's not like you meditate for a year and all of a sudden you're,

658
00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:38.160
you're enlightened and you can sit and think about nothing for a half an hour.

659
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:42.220
But what,
what you do learn is that,
um,

660
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.510
just the act of watching where your brain is obsessing for a half an hour,

661
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:51.691
you know,

662
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:55.800
and if my timer goes off after a half an hour of meditating and I realized that

663
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:59.310
all I have been doing is,
you know,

664
00:44:59.311 --> 00:45:03.810
constructing an argument in my head with a person in my life or,
you know,

665
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.620
thinking about merge designs and I somehow lost the plot,
you know,

666
00:45:07.621 --> 00:45:11.980
two minutes into my meditation and flew off.
Um,

667
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:13.890
that just tells me,

668
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.490
that tells me where my head is that it tells me that I'm stressed out.

669
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:21.810
It tells me that that's,
you know,
that's what's preoccupying me.

670
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.750
And on a good day,
um,
you know,

671
00:45:24.751 --> 00:45:29.220
I think about constructing an argument,
I think about my list of things to do.

672
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.780
I think about what I'm about to eat when I get up and those thoughts come,

673
00:45:33.781 --> 00:45:37.740
but I'm able to let them go five or 10 seconds later and say like,
hi,
okay,

674
00:45:37.741 --> 00:45:42.480
I see you.
Yep,
you're here.
Okay,
now you're gone.
Let's,
you know,

675
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.370
let's go back to paying attention to our breath.

676
00:45:44.371 --> 00:45:48.240
And then five seconds later it's another thought and you say hello to it and you

677
00:45:48.241 --> 00:45:52.650
say goodbye to it.
And that's,
you know,
to me that's a much more,
you know,

678
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.290
quote unquote productive meditation practice.

679
00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:59.370
But the real productive meditation practice is just that you sit your ass down

680
00:45:59.371 --> 00:46:03.750
and you actually do it and you watch what happens.
That is the practice.
It's,

681
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.350
you know,
and it's never,
it's never easy,
but you do it.

682
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:13.000
You do get a perspective onto the inside of your head.

683
00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:18.080
And your thought process that I think is essential if you're going to progress

684
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.370
because you get to know yourself,
you get,

685
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.750
you get to watch the little tricks that your brain is playing and you know,

686
00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:32.190
and the places where you are obsessive and getting stuck.

687
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.810
And you know,

688
00:46:33.811 --> 00:46:38.811
it has been in moments of meditation and honestly actually more moments in yoga.

689
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:44.970
I'm often just like at the end of a yoga class,
lying on a mat on the floor,

690
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:46.470
watching,

691
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:51.830
watching my thoughts enough that I'm not just caught and them where I have had

692
00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:57.570
the most uh,
insightful,

693
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.310
um,
you know,
in,
in,
you know,

694
00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:05.070
I want to say the most insightful insights,
but you know,

695
00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:10.071
I've had the most insightful moments of my life looking at my thoughts and

696
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:13.770
going,
are you serious Amanda?

697
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:19.250
Like you actually really just spent five minutes coming up with a plan that

698
00:47:21.601 --> 00:47:23.430
actually you know,

699
00:47:23.431 --> 00:47:28.170
is really destructive and yet your brain was having a field day with it.

700
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:29.543
And just,

701
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:34.390
and just the act of being able to stand back and saying,

702
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.870
wow,
you,
you're thinking this,

703
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.970
you've actually been thinking this way all your life.
This is not,

704
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.550
not necessarily good.
Maybe we should,

705
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:50.230
maybe we should find another way out of this problem or whatever.

706
00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:52.360
And you know,
you,

707
00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:57.361
you don't get insights like that unless you give yourself some perspective

708
00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.310
because if you're just spending your life going and going and going and being

709
00:48:02.311 --> 00:48:06.600
trapped in the thoughts and not giving yourself,

710
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:10.320
you know,
a different point of view,
you just,

711
00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:12.090
you stay in the crazy.

712
00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:13.481
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

713
00:48:13.481 --> 00:48:18.481
I think the developing the skill is the observer is I found just so critical to

714
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:25.510
be able to step out of the rapids onto the shore and just observe it for a while

715
00:48:25.511 --> 00:48:29.940
as opposed to being sort of trapped like a,
like a monkey in the,

716
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.770
in the slip stream of thought,
getting washed over the rocks.
And I've,
I mean as,

717
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:35.613
as you put it,

718
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:39.220
I think a lot of people have this past fail mentality with meditation where if

719
00:48:39.221 --> 00:48:42.250
they can't think of a candle flame for 20 minutes straight,

720
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.630
they're a failure and they quit.
And then I tell people all the time,
I said,
look,

721
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.840
almost without fail,
every time I sit down to meditate,

722
00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:54.700
a portion of it will be spent fantasizing about some elaborate retribution

723
00:48:54.701 --> 00:48:58.780
against someone who like cut me in the salad line and college or something.

724
00:48:58.781 --> 00:49:03.040
So fucking ridiculous.
Uh,
but it's the,

725
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:07.600
just the act of meditating somewhat like stretching,

726
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:12.630
I suppose it just gives you a certain responsiveness as opposed to reflexive

727
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:20.020
kneejerk response to stuff that I find very,
very helpful.

728
00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.400
<v 2>Yeah.
Well it is,
it is not unrelated to the,
um,</v>

729
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.770
to the say last conversation we were having.

730
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:32.750
The ability to realize when you are not saying less,

731
00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:34.600
uh,
is,
you know,
is,

732
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:39.360
is directly related to the amount of perspective you can take in any given

733
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.480
moment argument,
you know,
conflict.

734
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:44.873
<v 0>Definitely.</v>

735
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:49.970
I would love to ask you a couple of questions that are a bit of a lateral step,

736
00:49:51.331 --> 00:49:54.360
but I'm curious nonetheless.
Uh,
the first is what,

737
00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:59.930
what book or books do you give most often or have you given most often as gifts

738
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.213
to other people?

739
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.250
<v 2>Uh,
well,
um,</v>

740
00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.200
<v 0>besides your own,
I suppose</v>

741
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:13.580
<v 2>that one doesn't count.
I go through phases,
but I have some,</v>

742
00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:18.810
I have some perennials.
Um,
and yeah,

743
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:23.590
to the,
to the,
that I can think of off the top of my head.

744
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.320
One is one is directly related to what we were just talking about.
Um,

745
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:29.890
mindfulness and,

746
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:33.650
and meditation and sort of the cutting through the bullshit.

747
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:38.170
One of my absolute favorite books of all time,
um,

748
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:40.750
because it changed my life is a,

749
00:50:40.751 --> 00:50:43.730
is a book called dropping ashes on the Buddha.

750
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.340
It's by a zen master songs on,

751
00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:51.341
and I read it who was a Korean zen monk and I read it when I was maybe 24 and

752
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:57.980
it's a short book and it's actually,
um,
it's just,

753
00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.630
it's just a series of letters that this,
um,

754
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:07.220
really funny,
uh,
very direct,

755
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:12.730
very no bullshit Korean monk wrote back and forth with his students in the 70s.

756
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.220
And most of the students are Americans.
They're,
you know,

757
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:23.870
there are sort of that first wave of we are getting into meditation,

758
00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:27.020
we are lost.
Please help guide us,
you know,

759
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.920
and the way this guy's ability to economically get to the point of what's

760
00:51:39.801 --> 00:51:44.801
important and how to explain to somebody else how to cut through the bullshit

761
00:51:45.591 --> 00:51:49.040
and just get to mindfulness was,
uh,

762
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:53.590
a game changer for me at 24 and all of the,
you know,

763
00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:58.600
Yoga and meditation I had kind of dabbled with up until then sort of coalesced

764
00:52:01.011 --> 00:52:05.480
and I,
and,
and that book really opened my mind.
Um,

765
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:09.380
it was sort of one of those,
Oh my God,
I think I get it.
Books.

766
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:11.240
And so I have,

767
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:15.770
I have given that book to probably 30 people or 40 people,

768
00:52:15.771 --> 00:52:20.320
especially people who have told me that they are feeling kind of lost,
um,

769
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:24.200
and or depressed or directionless or at a,
you know,

770
00:52:24.201 --> 00:52:27.620
younger people who are at crazy crossroads in their life and need something to

771
00:52:27.621 --> 00:52:32.350
hang onto.
I've given many copies of that book
to read it.

772
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:37.220
It's,
it's fantastic.
Um,
and there's actually,
if you like it,

773
00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:41.270
there is a companion book that was his second collection of letters called only

774
00:52:41.271 --> 00:52:46.070
don't know which was wanting to just cause he's spoken this thick Korean accent

775
00:52:46.071 --> 00:52:48.740
and had all these little hilarious ways of phrasing things,

776
00:52:48.741 --> 00:52:53.390
which is one of the most amusing things about the book.
Um,

777
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.550
and he's,
he keeps saying to his students all of the time,
only say,

778
00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:03.700
oh,
you don't know.
It was just,

779
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:05.870
you know,
just great create accent.

780
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:09.350
So my other one that I have given to a gazillion people,

781
00:53:09.351 --> 00:53:11.930
which is sort of on the flip side of the other,

782
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.680
like metaphysical side of the fence is a bill Bryson,

783
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.870
who's one of my favorite nonfiction writers,

784
00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:23.420
wrote a book called a short history of nearly everything,
which is,

785
00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.710
I don't know if you've read Bill Bryson,
but you know,
he's one of the,

786
00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:30.980
he's one of those guys.
Like he could write about anything and I would read it.

787
00:53:30.981 --> 00:53:31.090
Yeah.

788
00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:34.150
<v 0>What does it going to the wilderness or he has one about hiking the,</v>

789
00:53:34.151 --> 00:53:36.310
or attempting to hike the Appalachian trail

790
00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:41.040
<v 2>that,
that I,
I,
I love that.
I've read all of his stuff.
And He,</v>

791
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.130
so he decides to,
you know,

792
00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:48.920
as an every man with a basic understanding of,
uh,

793
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:54.060
the history of the earth and,
you know,
basically,

794
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:58.020
you know,
the,
the history of science and how things work,

795
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.100
decides to tackle this with his basic knowledge and,
you know,

796
00:54:02.101 --> 00:54:07.101
spends a few years researching a book and just the first 20 or 30 pages of this

797
00:54:10.951 --> 00:54:15.690
book are of Great Comfort to me.
It gives these,

798
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:21.560
he spends pages expounding on exactly how small the earth is

799
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.470
in relation to the rest of the universe.
And,

800
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:36.420
you know,
along with,
uh,
like reading about zen meditation or anything,

801
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:41.250
if anything is going to put you in a good mood or maybe send you into an

802
00:54:41.251 --> 00:54:43.380
existential angst,
full crisis,

803
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:48.920
knowing how totally insignificant your life as a human being on the planet earth

804
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:54.720
is in the grand scheme of things.
And we're talking space and time.

805
00:54:55.580 --> 00:55:00.360
This book is just like,
it just,
you know,
is incredibly humorous,

806
00:55:00.361 --> 00:55:05.361
but also is just one of those great perspectives where you read it and you,

807
00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:11.960
you,
you feel totally emotionally connected to bill Bryson.
And,
uh,

808
00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:16.290
and his desire and his hunger to learn these things.
And also,

809
00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:21.380
um,
you know,
it,
it,
you get to feel like an,

810
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:26.400
you know,
your,
your place in the,
your insignificance in the cosmos and it's,

811
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.460
that's a,
that's another favorite and the,

812
00:55:29.461 --> 00:55:31.470
and that's just in the nonfiction department.

813
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.570
Fiction I think is for another podcast.

814
00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:38.350
<v 0>We can do that in around two for sure.
Uh,
well I know,</v>

815
00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:41.170
I know what I'm getting on my kindle then.
Those,
uh,

816
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.270
particularly dropping ashes on the Buddha,

817
00:55:43.271 --> 00:55:47.840
I thought I had the collection of letters.
Format is really one of my favorites,

818
00:55:47.841 --> 00:55:52.500
so I'm excited to,
to grab that.
Uh,
so this,
uh,

819
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:57.620
a lot of what we've talked about ties into directly or indirectly how people

820
00:55:57.821 --> 00:56:01.600
define success.
And I'd be curious to know,
when you hear the word successful,

821
00:56:01.601 --> 00:56:03.700
who's the first person you think of and why?

822
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:09.180
<v 2>Oh,
God.
Um,</v>

823
00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:12.570
you know,
it's funny when you said it,

824
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.030
the first person who popped into my head was Neal,

825
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.450
but that's probably because I just spent all day with him and he is successful.

826
00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:23.380
Uh,
you know,
the only,
I,

827
00:56:23.381 --> 00:56:24.130
it may feel

828
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:28.550
<v 3>like a dodge to answer it this way,
but,
um,</v>

829
00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:35.270
success is something that has been so plastic,
uh,
and,

830
00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:38.740
and,
and fungible in my life,

831
00:56:38.741 --> 00:56:42.550
especially because I live in a,
you know,

832
00:56:42.551 --> 00:56:47.551
I live in a world in entertainment and in performance and you know,

833
00:56:47.621 --> 00:56:50.590
now and book writing,
it's,
it is a,

834
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:55.510
it is a competitive field.
It's not like,

835
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:59.140
you know,
my,
my sister or you know,

836
00:56:59.141 --> 00:57:02.260
someone else who just has a job in science and you know,

837
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:04.810
it gets their job at the university and maybe I'm,

838
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:09.010
maybe I'm full of shit and everybody out there with any job from shoemaking to

839
00:57:09.011 --> 00:57:12.850
plumbing feels highly competitive.
But you know,

840
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:15.880
especially being a female singer,

841
00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:21.900
the world sort of views you as being in competition with the woman next to you.

842
00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:24.093
You know,

843
00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:28.540
right down to the fact that you are on the charts here and she is on the charts

844
00:57:28.541 --> 00:57:33.541
there and the world measures you and measures your success by a number of

845
00:57:34.241 --> 00:57:38.650
downloads,
number of fans,
number of Twitter followers or whatever.

846
00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:44.850
And I have found that part of the struggle of actually finding happiness as an

847
00:57:49.391 --> 00:57:51.910
artist is the,

848
00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:56.890
is the daily fight to not define success.

849
00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:01.850
By the way the rest of the world defines success,
which is hard because you,

850
00:58:01.851 --> 00:58:06.851
you have to fight the same battles every day because you go out into the,

851
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:13.800
into the work environment and the entire industry and even,

852
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.291
you know,

853
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:17.830
to a certain extent your own fans because they're sort of all drinking the same.

854
00:58:17.831 --> 00:58:20.710
Kool aid are,
are our kind of all telling you,

855
00:58:20.711 --> 00:58:24.310
well success is defined by this success as defined by the success as defined by

856
00:58:24.311 --> 00:58:27.250
this and you're there in your own little bubble going,

857
00:58:27.251 --> 00:58:31.750
well I know that's not really true.
I know that,
you know,

858
00:58:31.751 --> 00:58:33.970
there is that superficial level of success.

859
00:58:33.971 --> 00:58:37.330
But then there's also my personal success,

860
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.580
which no one else can define for me.

861
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:44.820
And a really is only defined by how happy was I when I woke up this morning and

862
00:58:45.071 --> 00:58:47.320
how happy am I when I'm betting down at night.

863
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:53.160
And that's not reflected in any of the billboard charts or in any of the iTunes

864
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:57.430
download iTunes downloads.
So,
you know,

865
00:58:57.431 --> 00:59:01.930
success has this bizarro two faced.

866
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:07.330
Um,
w w you know,
uh,

867
00:59:07.331 --> 00:59:10.210
I'm losing my words today.
Um,

868
00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:12.910
what's the word for what a thing is

869
00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:21.100
perfect.
So yeah,
success has this very two faced essence where,

870
00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.393
um,

871
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:23.360
<v 2>you know,
you,</v>

872
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:27.860
you especially as a artist playing the game in the industry and putting out

873
00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:30.740
music and putting out books and so forth,

874
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:34.820
you kind of have to play that game a little bit and ride the balance of um,

875
00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:35.751
you know,

876
00:59:35.751 --> 00:59:39.050
trying to get your book on The New York Times best selling list and knowing what

877
00:59:39.051 --> 00:59:43.610
to do to do that.
Uh,
but also simultaneously not drinking the Koolaid,

878
00:59:43.611 --> 00:59:45.740
like swishing it around in your mouth and then spitting it out,

879
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:48.380
<v 0>going for a success tasting.</v>

880
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:52.580
<v 2>Exactly.
It's like being a wine Somalia who doesn't drink.
Um,</v>

881
00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:57.620
and you know,
I think I,
speaking of,
you know,

882
00:59:57.621 --> 01:00:01.380
of meditation at all kind of
this,

883
01:00:01.381 --> 01:00:03.900
this wines together and is it,

884
01:00:03.901 --> 01:00:08.901
is it actually a really good example of the sort of thing I would notice myself

885
01:00:10.831 --> 01:00:14.060
thinking and,
and,

886
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.240
and finally get to a point where I could really catch myself in the act of

887
01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:26.180
comparing myself to other artists and being jealous of people who had more

888
01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:33.521
charts success or being jealous of artists who seemed to me to be more

889
01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:38.831
successful and so in my crazy brain and they must somehow be happier or must

890
01:00:39.891 --> 01:00:44.060
somehow have beat me or must somehow have something that I don't have.

891
01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:45.500
And it's honestly,

892
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:49.430
it's in the moments of Yoga and meditation that I find myself,

893
01:00:49.431 --> 01:00:52.910
it's like you and your revenge plot against the person who cut you in the salad

894
01:00:52.911 --> 01:00:56.870
bar.
My moments like that are going,
oh my God,

895
01:00:56.871 --> 01:00:59.690
I really am doing that thing.

896
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:04.580
I really am thinking about,
you know,
Fiona Apple,

897
01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:07.610
Regina Spektor or you know,

898
01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.410
Lady Gaga as the person who has sold more records and therefore must be happier.

899
01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.490
Why didn't I make that decision?
Why am I not where they have?

900
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:19.130
Why did I not do this?
Why didn't I go into fashion?
Why didn't,
and,

901
01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.200
and watching an actually having the ability to watch my brain and stand back and

902
01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:31.030
go,
you know,
Amanda,
you realize that that's not actually success.

903
01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:36.430
You realize that even if you had that,
you know,
whatever thing,

904
01:01:36.431 --> 01:01:39.700
axes,
it's not going to buy you happiness.

905
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:44.260
Just sit with that for a second and notice what you're doing.

906
01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.730
And,
and to that,
I am grateful,

907
01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:53.820
really grateful for a mindfulness practice because I don't stop having those

908
01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:55.660
crazy thoughts.
They come,

909
01:01:55.810 --> 01:02:00.550
but I at least I can at least catch myself in the act and see that I'm doing it.

910
01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.360
<v 0>You're getting better at training them in the wild
in a way.</v>

911
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.180
Perhaps the,
so this,
this is,

912
01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:11.580
I think underscores a really important point.
I mean the,

913
01:02:11.581 --> 01:02:16.581
the definition of success and the misconceptions or self delusion of that we can

914
01:02:16.821 --> 01:02:20.430
get caught up in,
uh,
looking externally.

915
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:23.550
<v 3>What are common misconceptions about you?</v>

916
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.333
Ooh,

917
01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:30.840
those people do think I know who Amanda Palmer is.

918
01:02:30.841 --> 01:02:34.010
What are the common misconceptions?
I know who Amanda Palmer is.

919
01:02:34.011 --> 01:02:39.010
He's that narcissistic talentless Harry Connick married to my favorite Neil

920
01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:42.840
Gaiman.
Fuck her.
Um,
you know,

921
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.860
I would like to think in my darkest moments,
I,

922
01:02:45.861 --> 01:02:50.861
I would like to think that the most common misconception about me is that I is

923
01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:54.610
that I am not self reflective and that I,

924
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:59.220
and that I don't have self knowledge and that if I am a,

925
01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:04.350
you know,
narcissistic,
evil attention getting,
um,

926
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:09.240
you know,
fill in the blank,
um,
that I am,

927
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:14.300
that I'm not the kind of person who knows myself and,

928
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:20.560
um,
and,
and dissects myself.
And one of,
you know,

929
01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:24.500
one of the weird things about,
especially being a female performer is you,

930
01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:28.500
you get a lot of the same grief.
You know,

931
01:03:28.501 --> 01:03:33.450
you start to notice the patterns.
And you know,

932
01:03:33.451 --> 01:03:36.210
when I was,
when I was in my mid twenties,

933
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:42.560
and it was sort of the dawn of the Dresden dolls and I sort of faced my first

934
01:03:42.751 --> 01:03:44.700
wave of internet criticism,

935
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:49.560
and the main criticism was,
you know,
she's an attention whore.

936
01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.940
That was the big,
that was sort of the big Goto for people.

937
01:03:55.230 --> 01:04:00.230
And the amount of sort of like bravado,

938
01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:03.540
you know,

939
01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:08.540
and simultaneous shame that I felt when I would see people saying that about me.

940
01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:13.220
It was really interesting because on the one hand,
you know,

941
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:16.020
it was intellectually and emotionally smart enough to go,

942
01:04:16.021 --> 01:04:19.710
okay well people are calling me an attention whore,

943
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:25.370
but you know,
I'm a performing singer,
songwriter.
It,
my job is to get it running.

944
01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:28.170
So I can see,

945
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:33.380
I can see the double standard here and I can also see that nobody is calling the

946
01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:38.660
male artists who I opened up for or who opened up for me.

947
01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:40.530
No one's calling him an attention whore.

948
01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.680
I think this is a thing that's more or less aimed at me because I'm a woman.

949
01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:50.880
But I could be wrong.
I mean,
you know,
maybe,
maybe this,

950
01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:54.420
you know,
maybe there's something in this and maybe my,
you know,

951
01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:58.290
maybe my very insecure secret self is right.

952
01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.260
Maybe I am in this for all the wrong reasons.

953
01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:05.730
Maybe I am just too narcissistic.
Maybe I am too hungry for attention.

954
01:05:05.731 --> 01:05:09.720
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
Um,
but honestly,
you know,

955
01:05:09.721 --> 01:05:13.200
having no been in the business for,
you know,

956
01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:17.380
it's now whatever it is,
13 years later since,
you know,

957
01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:18.940
since I started the Dresden dolls,

958
01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:24.450
I feel like I've seen enough waves of criticism and also detected enough

959
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:32.610
patterns after an off time and done enough self inquiry that I can,

960
01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.820
I can sort of piece the puzzle together and get Yup.
I was kind of,
you know,

961
01:05:39.821 --> 01:05:44.590
it was kind of right and I was kind of wrong.
Um,
mostly,
you know,

962
01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:49.620
looking back at how I reacted in anger and fear at 25 I was mostly right.

963
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.200
Most of the people criticizing me,
you know,

964
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:58.201
as I was 25 and struggling to make it as a musician in Boston and you know,

965
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:02.740
aggressively pounding at the piano and aggressively,
you know,

966
01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:06.190
wearing few clothes and aggressively doing whatever the fuck I wanted and

967
01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:10.000
aggressively not caring about,
you know,

968
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:13.690
the etiquette and the fashions of the day.
Yeah.

969
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.980
Mostly people were threatened or angry,

970
01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:22.720
but it didn't have a whole lot to do with me.
It mostly had to do with them.

971
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:28.930
And it still feels true.
And it's,
you know,
I think one of the,

972
01:06:28.931 --> 01:06:32.050
I think one of the things you come to terms with as a performer and as a

973
01:06:32.051 --> 01:06:36.760
specialty as a female performer is,
you know,
you are so desperate,

974
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:39.450
especially at the beginning of your career,
you are,

975
01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:42.670
you are so desperate for universal approval,

976
01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.450
universal love,
you know,

977
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:50.140
and you figure that if you do your job right and you really work hard and you

978
01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:55.141
write fantastic songs and you are a consummate entertainer that everyone must

979
01:06:56.350 --> 01:07:00.700
love you.
And it's not a bad way to be.
You aim high,

980
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:05.910
you aim for the center of the target and the like and the,

981
01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:10.300
and the brass ring that's furthest away.
But also,

982
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.210
you know,
you realize whoever you are,

983
01:07:13.211 --> 01:07:15.760
there is no universally beloved performer.

984
01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:18.040
There are people out there who hate John Lennon there,
you know,

985
01:07:18.041 --> 01:07:19.750
there's people out there who,
you know,

986
01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:23.710
name an artist and there's people who hate them.
And one of the things that you,

987
01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:29.590
um,
that you discover as you journeyed down your,
you know,
your livelihood,

988
01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:32.650
um,
as a performer and you,

989
01:07:32.651 --> 01:07:36.350
you sort of negotiate your own career is,

990
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:41.950
is sort of developing an acceptance that your audience is going to be your

991
01:07:42.251 --> 01:07:46.690
audience and your audiences and everybody.
And there will be those out there,

992
01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:47.710
you know,

993
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:52.060
who decide that you're not their cup of tea and the ear style rubs them the

994
01:07:52.061 --> 01:07:55.870
wrong way and that they don't like your voice or they don't like your songs are,

995
01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:59.650
they don't like your appearance or they just don't like you.
Um,

996
01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.230
and it's just part,
part and parcel of the job.

997
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:07.630
And I remember people telling me it,
you know,
at 25 and at 27 and at 29,

998
01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:12.160
you know,
that if I was being criticized,
if I was being criticized,
it was a,

999
01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:14.200
it was a real sign of success.

1000
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:20.300
And even though I intellectually knew that that took me years to actually

1001
01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:24.590
emotionally take on and feel the truth of that,

1002
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:27.800
that if people are angered by you,

1003
01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:32.801
if people care enough to write about how they don't like hear music or write

1004
01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:38.420
about at this point,
you know,
write about how they don't like your book,
um,

1005
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.600
you're doing something right because you know,

1006
01:08:41.601 --> 01:08:46.100
if you're being discussed at all and your work is of enough merit to merit

1007
01:08:46.101 --> 01:08:47.060
criticism,

1008
01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:53.210
then you're just on the path and you know,

1009
01:08:53.211 --> 01:08:56.420
you're not so naive,
you know,
as,

1010
01:08:56.421 --> 01:09:00.680
as you were at 24 thinking that if you just pushed all the right buttons,

1011
01:09:00.681 --> 01:09:03.110
everyone would eventually see the light and love you.

1012
01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.440
<v 0>It doesn't work that way.</v>

1013
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.240
I think that you could mention any artist,

1014
01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:15.270
any person of note or who's had a decent amount of public exposure and they

1015
01:09:15.761 --> 01:09:18.150
probably have a hate page dedicated to them.
I mean,

1016
01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:23.080
it really doesn't matter who it is,
but you know,
you mentioned,

1017
01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:28.410
uh,
fans and wanting everyone to like what you do.

1018
01:09:28.411 --> 01:09:31.890
But certainly,
I mean,
I think that to business as an art,

1019
01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:35.460
if everyone is your customer,
the no one is your customer on some level,

1020
01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:37.020
you have your,

1021
01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:42.140
I think somewhat a famous for having a very die hard fan base.

1022
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.000
And maybe this is a tired question,

1023
01:09:45.001 --> 01:09:50.001
but I would love to still hear from you why you think that's the case.

1024
01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.160
Um,
and I'll just,
I'll just leave it at that.

1025
01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.620
We can certainly dig into it,
but you have such a dedicated fan base,

1026
01:09:58.621 --> 01:10:03.300
I mean above and beyond in a way that has sort of mesmerized,
uh,

1027
01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.490
a lot of people in the music industry and elsewhere.

1028
01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:10.670
The ranging from the huge success of your Kickstarter campaign to the,

1029
01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:13.050
I think challenging the status quo,

1030
01:10:13.051 --> 01:10:17.970
which may be part of the reason that you get a lot of the flack that you do.
Um,

1031
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:21.180
couch surfing with fans,
bringing fans up on stage.

1032
01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.050
There's so much we could dig into.
But why do you think your fans,

1033
01:10:25.051 --> 01:10:27.630
you have such a large contingent of die hard fans?

1034
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:33.970
<v 3>Well,
I,
I think that has to do with,</v>

1035
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.780
um,
you know,
how,

1036
01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:42.350
how specifically intimate my writing is.

1037
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.340
Um,
because it's certainly not for everybody.

1038
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.170
And you know,
I,
when I look back at my career,

1039
01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:55.250
you can hear me right?
Oh,
I can hear you.
Okay.

1040
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:57.110
I just thought I lost myself for a second.

1041
01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:02.500
So when I look back at the last right,

1042
01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.630
10,
15 years of my life,

1043
01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:09.960
I definitely see a lot of moments where I could have turned to the left or it

1044
01:11:13.281 --> 01:11:14.010
could have turned

1045
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.090
<v 2>to the right and I could have made things like,</v>

1046
01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:20.730
for lack of a better word,
more palatable,

1047
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:24.570
more radio friendly,

1048
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.830
more universal,
um,
more.

1049
01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:32.610
This is the kind of thing that I know more people can digest.

1050
01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:37.200
And when I look at those choices,

1051
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:42.250
I pretty much have on,

1052
01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:47.310
on the whole chosen not to take that turn.

1053
01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.360
And which isn't to say that,
um,

1054
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:55.200
I want to alienate people.
In fact,
the opposite is true,

1055
01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:57.750
but I,

1056
01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:03.410
I've kind of deliberately resisted commercial success mostly because as I grew

1057
01:12:08.251 --> 01:12:11.520
in my career,
which did grow slowly,
you know,

1058
01:12:11.521 --> 01:12:15.870
it's not like I started writing songs one day and then the Dresden dolls started

1059
01:12:15.871 --> 01:12:20.550
and then six months later we were famous.
I was on a really,
um,

1060
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:25.050
you know,
really slow climb from the time I started as a songwriter,

1061
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.360
as a teenager,
um,

1062
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:31.950
to solo performing to meeting Brian and starting the band to touring locally for

1063
01:12:31.951 --> 01:12:34.020
three years to ultimately getting signed,

1064
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:39.260
said a lot of time to sort of look around and gage,

1065
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.593
um,

1066
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:48.020
who I was and which bands I really admired and,

1067
01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.230
and kind of what forms of success were available to me.

1068
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:57.940
Because,
you know,
when I was 18,
there was only one thing.
It was like,
get on MTV,

1069
01:12:57.941 --> 01:13:02.250
be famous.
That was success.
Um,
but then as you know,

1070
01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:05.730
as I grew into my twenties,
I realized there were a lot of,

1071
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:11.390
a lot of artistic choices on a lot of lifestyle choices open to me,

1072
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:15.720
and I was master of my own fate.

1073
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:20.870
I was allowed to choose whether I was going to be the kind of artist who spent

1074
01:13:21.090 --> 01:13:25.560
two hours getting ready before shows,
doing massive hairdos,

1075
01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:28.380
putting on makeup,
getting into fashion,

1076
01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:31.920
trying to work with pop producers,
you know,

1077
01:13:31.921 --> 01:13:34.740
putting dancing in my videos,
you know,

1078
01:13:34.741 --> 01:13:39.741
really trying to sell myself as someone who could hopefully ultimately go

1079
01:13:39.931 --> 01:13:44.520
platinum and sell 4 million records.
And I,
you know,

1080
01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:48.240
part part of the curse is if you,
if you want to look at it that way,
um,

1081
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.140
which I don't,

1082
01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:54.290
but it was like I learned too much too soon and I knew that going the lady Gaga

1083
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:03.360
route or whatever and taking,
taking the,
you know,

1084
01:14:03.361 --> 01:14:08.340
the bear structure of my songs and handing them over to a pop producer to turn

1085
01:14:08.341 --> 01:14:13.341
them into dance hits wasn't necessarily going to make me a happier person.

1086
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.400
I just sensed it.
I'm an,

1087
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:20.920
I don't want this to come across sounding pretentious or anything because I

1088
01:14:20.921 --> 01:14:22.960
think there's really different ways of being happy.

1089
01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:25.450
And I think it's very possible that lady Gaga is happy.

1090
01:14:25.451 --> 01:14:29.570
And I don't know because I don't know her,
but I,

1091
01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:33.730
I looked at,
you know,
my life is a long expanse of time,

1092
01:14:33.731 --> 01:14:36.880
energy choices and who I was going to get to hang out with.

1093
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.430
And I was like,
you know,

1094
01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:45.370
I think it may mean less chart success,

1095
01:14:45.371 --> 01:14:49.480
radio success,
less chances of getting on an MTV.

1096
01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:54.040
But I know if I make this choice and this choice and not choice,

1097
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.850
it's more probable that I'm going to enjoy my day.

1098
01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:01.360
And so those are the choices I kept making.

1099
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:05.240
<v 0>Oh,
I'm sorry.
Is that what you mean by lifestyle choices?</v>

1100
01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:08.130
Is it a quality of life thing or is it something else?

1101
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:13.990
<v 2>Well,
I mean one,
it's both,
you know,
the choice too.</v>

1102
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.740
And you know,
there's just some certain things,

1103
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:21.570
especially if you're talking about pop life,
you know,

1104
01:15:21.571 --> 01:15:26.571
there's certain choices as a woman where like some shit just comes down to time

1105
01:15:26.971 --> 01:15:30.600
and energy.
I got into a conversation about this on Facebook.

1106
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:34.290
I have never spent any time doing my hair.

1107
01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:38.310
And it may seem,
it may seem stupid or you know,

1108
01:15:38.311 --> 01:15:42.660
like a kind of irrelevant thing,
but I actually know,

1109
01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:43.471
you know,

1110
01:15:43.471 --> 01:15:48.471
for the pop stars out there who kind of want to do the Fashionista thing and um,

1111
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.580
you know,
take that particular fork.
It's,

1112
01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:58.050
it just takes time out of your day if you want to,
you know,

1113
01:15:58.051 --> 01:16:02.970
if you want to go in that direction and do fashion and,

1114
01:16:03.570 --> 01:16:08.340
you know,
always look photo ready and vogue ready on stage.

1115
01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:10.980
I know what it takes.
I've done it for video shoots,

1116
01:16:10.981 --> 01:16:14.160
I've done it for photo shoots.
You need to sit in a chair for two hours.

1117
01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:17.780
And I sort of looked at that and was like,
ah,

1118
01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.730
I don't want to sit in a chair for two hours.

1119
01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.570
I want to spend that two hours going out to dinner with my friends in

1120
01:16:23.571 --> 01:16:27.980
Philadelphia and hearing about their art projects and I want to spend that two

1121
01:16:27.981 --> 01:16:31.760
hours,
you know,
needing ingredient with fans before the show.

1122
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:35.570
So I get that it's kind of a sacrifice and I get that.

1123
01:16:35.571 --> 01:16:40.280
I won't look like Katy Perry on stage,
but it's okay,

1124
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:43.820
I'll give that up.
I'll make this choice and not that choice.

1125
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:45.451
<v 0>So I've,</v>

1126
01:16:45.451 --> 01:16:50.451
I've been fascinated with your story on so many levels and one of them,

1127
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:52.560
if,
if you're able to discuss it

1128
01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:58.490
relates to crossroads that I find myself in,
which is being tired of the,

1129
01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:02.400
the charts,
the New York Times bestseller list,
I'm just fatigued by it.

1130
01:17:02.401 --> 01:17:06.030
I've been through that game several times.
It's exhausting.

1131
01:17:06.031 --> 01:17:10.220
It's not objective.
It's really a,
there is a,

1132
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:15.550
a very subjective kind of editor's choice element to it that I dislike because I

1133
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.540
don't feel it's,
I feel,
uh,
that it's,
it's not,

1134
01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:20.660
uh,

1135
01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:25.660
it's not a real reflection of the true success of any given book.

1136
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:30.020
And I was hoping maybe we could chat about the,
uh,

1137
01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.860
the rebellion and,
uh,

1138
01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:36.770
splitting with roadrunner records if you're able to talk about that,

1139
01:17:36.771 --> 01:17:37.604
because I was,

1140
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:42.830
if you could give people a little bit of context on that.
Um,

1141
01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:48.160
I,
you know,
I'm thinking of going completely indeed as a writer potentially,
uh,

1142
01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:52.070
moving forward and there's a certain appeal and the simplicity of that.

1143
01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.200
And we'll see if I have the fortitude to do it.

1144
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:59.120
But are you able to give people a little bit of context on what happened with

1145
01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.370
roadrunner and then what you learned from that?

1146
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:06.930
<v 3>Sure.
Um,
well the,
the rebellion specifically,</v>

1147
01:18:06.931 --> 01:18:10.420
or is this a,
this hilarious moment in my career,

1148
01:18:10.421 --> 01:18:15.210
this would have been 2008,
um,

1149
01:18:15.610 --> 01:18:18.640
I had put out my first solo record who killed Amanda Palmer.

1150
01:18:18.641 --> 01:18:22.360
I was really proud of it.
I still am,
I think it's a great record.

1151
01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:26.530
And there was a song on it called Leeds United,
um,

1152
01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.330
that was like a big band,
crazy drunk and brash,
you know,

1153
01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:33.630
uh,
you know,

1154
01:18:33.690 --> 01:18:37.290
it was one of sort of one of the populist songs on the record and I decided to

1155
01:18:37.291 --> 01:18:41.670
make a video for it.
I made the video in London.
It was really fun.

1156
01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:46.900
Um,
and the,
the record label at the time,

1157
01:18:46.901 --> 01:18:48.520
I was still on road runner records.

1158
01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:53.320
I had things with them adjust or to start falling apart because they,

1159
01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:56.650
they barely lifted a finger to promote the dress and all his second album.

1160
01:18:56.651 --> 01:19:00.340
And um,
that left us feeling really disillusioned.

1161
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:05.480
But I sort of gave them a chance to,
you know,
to make good,

1162
01:19:05.850 --> 01:19:09.740
um,
on,
on,
on my,
my first solo record,

1163
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:14.300
which came out right after that.
And uh,
they didn't,

1164
01:19:14.301 --> 01:19:17.090
by the way,
long story short,
but,
um,

1165
01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:22.420
somewhere in there there's video got shot and the rough cut was sent over to the

1166
01:19:24.191 --> 01:19:27.240
label and I in,
in the,

1167
01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:32.290
at the time in between had made my way back to New York and the NR guy called me

1168
01:19:32.291 --> 01:19:33.310
into his office

1169
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:35.510
<v 0>advertising and something else.</v>

1170
01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:40.560
<v 3>Uh,
technically it in old school terms that meant artists and repertoire.</v>

1171
01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.920
Uh,
but in,
in,
in Layman's terms,
your,

1172
01:19:43.921 --> 01:19:48.360
your ANR guy is basically your,
your representative,

1173
01:19:48.361 --> 01:19:51.090
your dude.
Cause it's usually a dude,
but you know,

1174
01:19:51.091 --> 01:19:55.440
your dude or Gal at the label who is,
you know,

1175
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:59.250
the artist liaison base point of contact.
Got It.
Yeah.
Your,
your person.

1176
01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:03.600
So my person,
Dave,
um,

1177
01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:08.570
Dave wrath,
bless heart,
because he had to do,
he had,

1178
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.410
he had to speak for the trees

1179
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:16.920
and he called me into his office and tried as delicately as he could to tell me

1180
01:20:16.921 --> 01:20:20.310
that the label had had a meeting and they thought that I loved too fat and the

1181
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:25.550
video and would I be willing to cut the shots that showed my bare midriff.

1182
01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:31.700
And I was astounded at this because I am vain and I had seen the rough cut and I

1183
01:20:33.901 --> 01:20:38.160
thought I looked fantastic.
I was really thrilled that,
you know,

1184
01:20:38.161 --> 01:20:42.690
I had been a little,
cause you know I'm not,
I'm not trim,
but I'm,
you know,

1185
01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:47.760
I have like I have my little pot belly,
but you know,
some pot belly that can be,

1186
01:20:47.761 --> 01:20:50.490
can be attractive as long as it's not hanging out over your pants.

1187
01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.610
And I was actually really thrilled when I saw the rough cut because I thought I

1188
01:20:53.611 --> 01:20:54.690
looked fantastic.

1189
01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.130
And so I sat there with my jaw dropped to the floor going like,

1190
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:02.130
you're getting me?
No.
Like what shots are you talking about?

1191
01:21:02.131 --> 01:21:04.220
Cause I think I look great and I'm a vain motherfuckers.

1192
01:21:04.230 --> 01:21:08.320
So like you just clearly disagree.
And,

1193
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:09.290
and I,

1194
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:14.290
at that point I had kind of had it with the label and I had sort of decided at

1195
01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:19.560
that point to just probably split off and go my own way.

1196
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:21.900
So I basically did,

1197
01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.770
I did an act of war and I posted to my blog,

1198
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:30.800
I posted the story to my blog knowing that my fans would all be aggrieved and

1199
01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:37.530
everyone would,
you know,
everyone would,
would be sad on my behalf.

1200
01:21:39.130 --> 01:21:42.960
Uh,
and at the end of the day,
the,
the,
the label back down,
they,
you know,

1201
01:21:42.961 --> 01:21:46.110
they put the video out.
They of course did nothing to promote it,

1202
01:21:46.111 --> 01:21:49.770
which know it was probably shooting myself in the foot.
But who knows.
Um,

1203
01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.340
and this was also at the point where this,
you know,

1204
01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:54.240
the video was basically Internet only.

1205
01:21:54.241 --> 01:21:57.660
So it was up to me to do any promoting that was going to happen.

1206
01:21:58.890 --> 01:21:59.723
And

1207
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:07.310
this beautiful organic internet moment happened where I shared this story and

1208
01:22:07.891 --> 01:22:12.330
that was it.
I gave no directive.
And then on their own,

1209
01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:17.720
the fans created this movement where they started a page on the band forum

1210
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:25.280
uploading selfies of their own stomachs with messages written on them to road

1211
01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.020
runner,

1212
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:33.020
her saying things like this is what a normal belly looks like and you know,

1213
01:22:33.810 --> 01:22:38.340
fuck the label and long live.
And they gave the movement a title,

1214
01:22:38.341 --> 01:22:42.250
which was the rebelly and get it cause their belly was in the middle.
Um,

1215
01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:45.480
but this wasn't just a couple of people or even a couple of dozen people.

1216
01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:48.450
This is like hundreds of fans did this.

1217
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.060
And it was hilarious because it was a lot of,
you know,

1218
01:22:51.190 --> 01:22:55.500
huge man bellies and teeny little baby bellies and people,
you know,

1219
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:59.640
wrote on their cats and stuff.
It was fucking hilarious.

1220
01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.811
And someone,

1221
01:23:00.811 --> 01:23:05.811
even a one of the fans even like collected all of these photos and po published

1222
01:23:06.251 --> 01:23:11.050
a little chat book and you know,
with my permission like,

1223
01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:13.000
which they didn't even need,
you know,

1224
01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:16.800
printed up a thousand of these books and just offered to send them to be

1225
01:23:16.801 --> 01:23:18.640
pleasant.
And it was just,

1226
01:23:18.641 --> 01:23:22.720
it was one of those moments where I stood back like a proud parent.

1227
01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:28.420
I looked at my fan base and I was like,
you guys are awesome.

1228
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:31.810
I just love that you fucking did this.

1229
01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:37.060
You're creative and you're weird and you're,
and you're all with me.

1230
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:41.560
And that was just,
it was also one of those moments where I looked at them

1231
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:47.860
and this was,
this is my demographic.
Like these were my fans,

1232
01:23:47.861 --> 01:23:52.861
these are the people for whom the video was made and they were all so,

1233
01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:54.351
you know,

1234
01:23:54.351 --> 01:23:59.351
they were all so proud of me and also so happy for me to be authentic.

1235
01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:06.920
And I,
I sort of looked over at the label who were like,
Whoa,
you know,
Amanda,

1236
01:24:06.921 --> 01:24:10.430
if you really want to be successful,
you have to Xyz.
And I was like,
you know,

1237
01:24:10.431 --> 01:24:14.920
I really don't think you guys get it.
This is my audience.

1238
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:20.720
This is who I'm making the video for.
This is who I'm thinking for the music for.

1239
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:24.230
They understand,
you guys don't seem to,

1240
01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:28.510
I think this relationship has come to that.
And,
um,

1241
01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:32.570
but it was also,
it was,
you know,
as you look back at Internet history,

1242
01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:36.610
it was one of those moments where,
you know,

1243
01:24:36.611 --> 01:24:40.300
in 1995 that wouldn't have happened.

1244
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:45.850
But these people all found each other groups together and could create their own

1245
01:24:45.851 --> 01:24:50.740
moment.
And it's one of the blessings of the Internet,
which is,

1246
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:55.400
you know,
the paradigm shifts the people in power.
Um,

1247
01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:56.410
you know,

1248
01:24:56.410 --> 01:25:01.410
really everything is called into question and it's very possible that a 1995 I

1249
01:25:01.661 --> 01:25:06.580
might have believed the label.
I might not have understood that,

1250
01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:12.040
you know,
that my audience really did just want me the authentic take me not the

1251
01:25:12.041 --> 01:25:16.390
airbrushed one.
And you know,
and this is why it's sort of been a,

1252
01:25:16.391 --> 01:25:20.620
it's been a lifelong conversation,
a dialogue with my fan base.

1253
01:25:20.621 --> 01:25:22.990
It's not just me,
the artist with the megaphone.

1254
01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:28.300
<v 0>If you had to choose one way online to communicate with your audience,</v>

1255
01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:29.830
what would you choose?

1256
01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:33.600
<v 3>As it stands right now,</v>

1257
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:39.070
if I only got to use one social media platform or do I have to choose between

1258
01:25:39.241 --> 01:25:40.230
Twitter and email?

1259
01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:45.970
<v 0>Yeah,
you have to choose.
So it'd be one online tool,</v>

1260
01:25:45.971 --> 01:25:49.270
whether it's social network or otherwise.
What would you choose and why?

1261
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:51.590
<v 3>Ah,</v>

1262
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:56.960
if I could only communicate one way on the Internet,

1263
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:59.211
you know,

1264
01:25:59.211 --> 01:26:04.211
probably Twitter because Twitter has direct messaging so I could email people.

1265
01:26:05.650 --> 01:26:06.830
<v 0>That's true.
You could,
you could</v>

1266
01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:11.340
<v 2>well,
email,
uh,</v>

1267
01:26:11.730 --> 01:26:15.600
email camps,
um,
you know,
for lack of a better word,

1268
01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:18.990
email can't,
uh,

1269
01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:23.850
it's only person to person so it can't collect,
you know,

1270
01:26:23.851 --> 01:26:27.310
you can't create a movement on email or,
you know,

1271
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:31.470
unless if that were the case,
I would probably find myself,

1272
01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:35.220
you know,
kind of on,

1273
01:26:35.221 --> 01:26:40.221
on massive chain group emails with 900 people all be cc'd into conversation.

1274
01:26:46.670 --> 01:26:47.503
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1275
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:52.990
let me ask a couple of fun questions,

1276
01:26:53.850 --> 01:26:56.930
couple of listeners who were very curious to know,

1277
01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:59.593
how do you,

1278
01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:05.030
what is the dynamic like having two creatives in,
in one household.

1279
01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:08.130
So your,
your husband is,
is of course,
a very

1280
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:14.690
prolific writer.
You have many different creative endeavors.
Uh,

1281
01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:18.260
what is the,
do you,
would you work together?
Do you work separately?

1282
01:27:18.261 --> 01:27:22.030
Do you ask each other advice?
Is there collaboration?
Do you,

1283
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:25.490
how do your creative tempos differ?
That's a lot at once,

1284
01:27:25.491 --> 01:27:26.780
so you can kind of answer it however you want.

1285
01:27:26.781 --> 01:27:30.290
But I'm just so fascinated to know how that,

1286
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.180
how you guys make that work.

1287
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:37.620
<v 2>Oh boy.
That's a huge question.
I mean,
it's a huge lot of questions.</v>

1288
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:44.890
I think the biggest blanket answer is we help each other a lot.

1289
01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:47.220
Um,

1290
01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:52.220
but we also have private areas and rooms where we really don't fuck with each

1291
01:27:54.001 --> 01:27:58.170
other.
Um,
and we've,
we've learned the hard way,
you know,

1292
01:27:58.171 --> 01:28:02.930
I have learned,
um,
and if,
you know,

1293
01:28:02.931 --> 01:28:05.060
if anything,
if any,
if nothing else,

1294
01:28:05.061 --> 01:28:09.350
Neil and I have have found that we are insanely similar.

1295
01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:10.850
Um,
and we,

1296
01:28:10.851 --> 01:28:15.590
and we both constantly make the mistake of thinking that the other one has a

1297
01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:20.591
thicker skin than they do when the truth is we are both at our core,

1298
01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:26.450
really fragile artists.
Um,
and,

1299
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:31.250
and I think most artists at their core are,
you know,

1300
01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:36.170
may seem the thick skinned,
but when it comes down to it,
you know,

1301
01:28:36.171 --> 01:28:40.130
we really want people to love and understand our work.

1302
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:43.050
And so I've learned,
you know,

1303
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:48.070
I've been with Neil for six years and I still am constantly fine tuning how

1304
01:28:50.031 --> 01:28:54.650
honest to be with him about something he shows me and vice versa.

1305
01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.390
You know,
Neal,
Neal resumes something.
He wrote a couple,
you know,

1306
01:28:59.450 --> 01:29:01.670
a couple of weeks ago and I gave,

1307
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.780
I gave him my honest opinion and I immediately wanted to take it back cause I

1308
01:29:06.781 --> 01:29:07.111
was like,

1309
01:29:07.111 --> 01:29:10.890
you should have just not use God amount of why to give say that now he's going

1310
01:29:10.891 --> 01:29:14.910
to be depressed for three days.
And he was um,
cause like,
you know,

1311
01:29:14.911 --> 01:29:19.911
I didn't particularly love this or that and was totally blunt and you know,

1312
01:29:20.551 --> 01:29:25.160
and I would have,
I would've wanted the same thing from him if I had,
you know,

1313
01:29:25.170 --> 01:29:30.170
if I had written a piece of music and played it for him and no one had heard it

1314
01:29:30.481 --> 01:29:35.130
yet.
And I was feeling my small,
fragile self crawling out of my little art cave,

1315
01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.180
waving my watercolor around as

1316
01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.470
even when you're 54 I totally think of,
you know,

1317
01:29:43.471 --> 01:29:48.471
that whether it's a novel or a song or a poem or an opera or whatever it is.

1318
01:29:48.841 --> 01:29:53.700
To me,
you're still five showing your mom a watercolor going.

1319
01:29:53.701 --> 01:29:58.230
Do you like it?
Do you like it?
I'm,
the only answer is yes,
you're a genius.

1320
01:29:58.231 --> 01:30:02.850
I am putting that on the fridge.
That's your water color.
I don't know what it is.

1321
01:30:02.970 --> 01:30:04.260
It's totally abstract.

1322
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.260
I know it's supposed to be a tree and it doesn't really look like a tree,

1323
01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:11.310
but every,
every artist in that way is kind of five.

1324
01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:16.350
And you and you really do have to choose your words carefully.

1325
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:19.710
And you know,
on the other hand,

1326
01:30:19.711 --> 01:30:24.711
the reason Neil and I love each other and respect each other so much,

1327
01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:29.550
it's we don't really bullshit each other,
you know?

1328
01:30:29.670 --> 01:30:32.220
And we know,
we speak the language,

1329
01:30:32.221 --> 01:30:35.610
we know that there's a difference between holy fuck.

1330
01:30:35.611 --> 01:30:38.670
I think that's the best thing you've ever written.
And yeah,
that's,

1331
01:30:38.671 --> 01:30:39.504
that's really good.

1332
01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.220
<v 4>Yeah.
You know,</v>

1333
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:47.410
<v 2>and those are basically two ends of the spectrum.
And you're,
you really,</v>

1334
01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:48.130
you know,

1335
01:30:48.130 --> 01:30:52.510
if you're trying to be kind and a good attentive arts vous,

1336
01:30:52.511 --> 01:30:57.400
you're really not supposed to go into,
you know,
just,
uh,
I think I get it.

1337
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:59.380
Not your best work.
I didn't really dig it.

1338
01:30:59.410 --> 01:31:00.670
Like you're just not allowed to say that.

1339
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:03.130
<v 4>So we're like a Japanese tea ceremony,</v>

1340
01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:10.950
<v 2>you know,
and that's what the work itself,
we also help each other with,
you know,</v>

1341
01:31:10.951 --> 01:31:13.950
more of the nerdy stuff.
We edit each other on social media.

1342
01:31:14.490 --> 01:31:17.850
There have been nights where one of us has,

1343
01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:19.680
and this has happened in both directions,

1344
01:31:19.681 --> 01:31:24.180
where one will text the other and be like,
for fuck's sake,
delete that.

1345
01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:30.330
Or you find yourself in the middle of an Internet shitstorm tomorrow because you

1346
01:31:30.331 --> 01:31:35.040
have pressed tomorrow and you're too busy to spend all day writing a blog

1347
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:38.250
defending your right to Xyz.
And,

1348
01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:43.320
and 90% of the time the person will be like,
you know,

1349
01:31:43.321 --> 01:31:48.060
I knew you.
I knew not to do it.
I just want to know,
fuck it.
You're right.

1350
01:31:48.061 --> 01:31:48.894
I'll delete it.

1351
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:49.913
<v 4>Um,</v>

1352
01:31:52.230 --> 01:31:56.410
distinctly non-Americans I'm guessing you get a fair number of those.

1353
01:31:57.510 --> 01:32:00.370
<v 2>We both,
we both do that for each other and we,
you know,</v>

1354
01:32:00.371 --> 01:32:04.660
we not only text each other and say,
hey,
delete that tweet.
You're an idiot.
Um,

1355
01:32:04.661 --> 01:32:08.590
but we'll also,
we'll run,
we'll run things by each other.
You know,

1356
01:32:08.591 --> 01:32:12.520
Neil and I have both stepped in the middle of controversies unwittingly.

1357
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:14.590
You know,
Neil more recently than me,

1358
01:32:14.591 --> 01:32:18.160
he had got himself in an Internet shit storm with the title of his most recent

1359
01:32:18.161 --> 01:32:20.060
book and we,
you know,

1360
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:25.080
we sat in bed and had long conversations about is this a really a good idea.

1361
01:32:25.211 --> 01:32:28.690
And you know,
when people come yelling at you,
how are you going to deal?

1362
01:32:28.691 --> 01:32:29.800
And you know,

1363
01:32:29.801 --> 01:32:32.650
why don't you actually write something in the introduction of the book to

1364
01:32:32.651 --> 01:32:35.290
explain it so that you can kind of proactively blah blah blah.

1365
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:38.130
Like we sit there like a couple of marketing managers

1366
01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:44.230
dealing with the kerfuffle before it actually blows in the window.
But we both,

1367
01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:49.620
we've both been there and we've both been there holding the hand of the other

1368
01:32:49.871 --> 01:32:52.360
while the other stands in the Internet.
Shit storm,
you know,

1369
01:32:52.361 --> 01:32:57.361
having to deal with the op eds and the angry tweets and the angry tumbler

1370
01:32:57.791 --> 01:32:58.624
people.

1371
01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:03.870
And there's something really wonderful about having a spouse who really

1372
01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:08.670
fundamentally understands you and has your back.
We,

1373
01:33:08.671 --> 01:33:12.310
we deeply understand each other and we,
we,

1374
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:17.230
and we deeply share a philosophy about,
you know,
life work,

1375
01:33:17.231 --> 01:33:20.200
freedom of speech and compassion that even,

1376
01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:24.430
even if we express it differently is one of the reasons we were so attracted to

1377
01:33:24.431 --> 01:33:29.130
each other to begin with.
It was like,
Oh,
you're,
you're one of me.
I see.

1378
01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:33.850
I see what you're doing over there at,
got it.
And um,
and there,

1379
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:38.520
there's something really,
there's something really comforting about that,
um,

1380
01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:38.931
because it's,

1381
01:33:38.931 --> 01:33:43.931
it can be a really lonely job when you're out there trying to explain,

1382
01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:47.830
you know,
how your work was misunderstood,
how your book title was misunderstood,

1383
01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:51.100
how your intention was misunderstood.
It's nice to,
you know,

1384
01:33:51.101 --> 01:33:53.830
deal with that kind of bullshit on the Internet all day and then sit down to

1385
01:33:53.831 --> 01:33:58.370
dinner with someone and have them deeply understand,
you know,

1386
01:33:58.390 --> 01:34:00.100
not just the intellectual bit of it,

1387
01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:03.160
but how it emotionally feels to go through a day like that.

1388
01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:08.220
<v 0>Yeah.
Someone else has been deployed to the Internet before,
I think to catch that</v>

1389
01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:15.630
last questions.
You walk into a bar,
what do you order from the bartender?

1390
01:34:16.410 --> 01:34:20.760
What temperature is it outside?
It is Boston in the winter.

1391
01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:22.493
Oh,

1392
01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.850
<v 2>I ordered or red wine or a hot toddy.
Okay.</v>

1393
01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:28.170
<v 0>Oh,
hot toddy.
Good choice.
Uh,</v>

1394
01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:32.670
if you could give one piece of advice to your 20 year old self,
what would it be?

1395
01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:39.580
<v 2>Uh,
leave college.
Okay.</v>

1396
01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:42.280
Leave transferable.

1397
01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:47.220
You're still a sophomore and go to art school in New York is what I've been

1398
01:34:47.221 --> 01:34:51.610
telling us.
Leave the liberal arts bubble for God's sake.
Ron,

1399
01:34:51.611 --> 01:34:55.180
will you still have time,
although you know,
in the,
uh,

1400
01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:58.010
back to the future timespace continuum problem.

1401
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:01.190
Would I be talking to you right now about my wonderful marriage to Neil Gaiman

1402
01:35:01.191 --> 01:35:05.320
and my best selling book?
I don't know.
So dicey time travel.

1403
01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:10.640
It's dicey time travel.
I think,
you know,
I've got no regrets,

1404
01:35:10.641 --> 01:35:13.880
but I'm sure if I had,
um,
if I had a,

1405
01:35:13.881 --> 01:35:16.820
if I had escaped my shitty situation at 20,

1406
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.700
I might have just jumped into another shitty situations.

1407
01:35:21.690 --> 01:35:24.980
<v 0>Well,
this,
this has been so much fun.
I want to be respectful of your time.
Um,</v>

1408
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:26.820
press we can do around two sometime.

1409
01:35:27.250 --> 01:35:29.840
<v 2>Oh,
I would love to,
I could talk for hours.</v>

1410
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.930
<v 0>This is really fun.</v>

1411
01:35:31.170 --> 01:35:36.170
Where can people find you on the internets and say hello and learn about what

1412
01:35:36.601 --> 01:35:37.434
you're up to.
And so,

1413
01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:42.080
<v 2>ah,
people can find me in the obvious places.
You know,</v>

1414
01:35:42.081 --> 01:35:43.430
you can Google up,
uh,

1415
01:35:43.431 --> 01:35:47.330
Amanda Palmer on pretty much any social media site.

1416
01:35:47.331 --> 01:35:50.870
Amanda Palmer on Twitter and I'm on Facebook and I actually,

1417
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:56.290
one cool thing that you might not find googling is I just created a special page

1418
01:35:57.950 --> 01:36:02.330
of my website for people who aren't familiar with my music because I've had so

1419
01:36:02.331 --> 01:36:03.830
many people,
um,

1420
01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:09.290
coming to me as blog readers and readers of the book and as followers of me on

1421
01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:09.920
Twitter who,

1422
01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:14.920
who actually didn't come through the music that came through some other avenue

1423
01:36:15.231 --> 01:36:18.920
and really want to get to know the music but are kind of overwhelmed by,

1424
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:20.870
you know,
the whole catalog.

1425
01:36:20.871 --> 01:36:25.871
And so I created a page on my automatic to palmer.net that's called a walk

1426
01:36:26.591 --> 01:36:27.890
through Amanda Landa

1427
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:32.930
starts with the beginning of the Dresden dolls and kind of walks you through the

1428
01:36:32.931 --> 01:36:37.160
basic albums and what the singles on the albums were and what the best videos

1429
01:36:37.161 --> 01:36:37.841
are.
And it's,

1430
01:36:37.841 --> 01:36:42.830
it's a really good primer if you want to just go in and sample,

1431
01:36:43.190 --> 01:36:47.210
you know,
the last 13 years of,
of albums and music and stuff.

1432
01:36:47.211 --> 01:36:49.130
And it's pretty funny I wrote it.
So

1433
01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:55.210
I think if you Google amount of landing and they find it or just go to Amanda

1434
01:36:55.210 --> 01:36:57.170
Palmer dotnet and kind of have a browse around

1435
01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:02.030
<v 0>and your name on Twitter is,
it's just at Amanda Palmer.</v>

1436
01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:06.950
You got and you got the name.
That's a good one to have a awesome,
well Amanda,

1437
01:37:06.951 --> 01:37:08.140
thank you so much.
Uh,

1438
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:12.110
everyone who's listening of course I'll put links to everything that I can track

1439
01:37:12.111 --> 01:37:16.130
down that we've talked about in the show notes,
the books,
Amanda,
Landa,

1440
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:17.870
everything that was mentioned.

1441
01:37:18.710 --> 01:37:23.300
And I will let you get on to another creative day,
I'm sure.

1442
01:37:23.301 --> 01:37:24.860
So thank you so much for the time.

1443
01:37:25.810 --> 01:37:29.670
<v 2>Yeah,
thank you Tim.
I think you are awesome.
And um,</v>

1444
01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:34.180
if you decide to,
uh,
fly solo,
um,

1445
01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:38.410
Godspeed.
Thank you.
It's,
it,
it's,
it's a,
it's a lot of work,

1446
01:37:38.411 --> 01:37:40.050
but boy is it satisfying.

1447
01:37:40.090 --> 01:37:43.160
<v 0>Got To jump off,
jump off and grow wings on the way down.
Yeah.</v>

1448
01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:45.640
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean one final thought on that,</v>

1449
01:37:45.641 --> 01:37:50.260
cause I wanted to say something when you said that.
I think,
you know,
I went,

1450
01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:53.050
I went solo and did solo music,

1451
01:37:53.051 --> 01:37:55.920
everything once I dragged off the label.

1452
01:37:55.921 --> 01:37:59.550
But then I decided to put my book out with like,
you know,

1453
01:37:59.551 --> 01:38:04.530
one of one of the biggest publishers.
And you know,

1454
01:38:04.531 --> 01:38:09.270
I think the freedom to pick and choose is more important than the freedom of

1455
01:38:09.271 --> 01:38:14.190
being independent.
I think.
I think what,
and it really is,
it's like,

1456
01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:15.271
you know,

1457
01:38:15.271 --> 01:38:19.230
work with the men when you're digging the man and the man can actually help you

1458
01:38:19.231 --> 01:38:23.820
make your art and then don't wing it when you don't want to.
But you know,

1459
01:38:23.821 --> 01:38:28.080
there is no such thing as true freedom because you're always trading,

1460
01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:31.560
you know,
you're always trading something for something else.

1461
01:38:31.561 --> 01:38:35.280
And having tried to run my own record label and all of that,

1462
01:38:35.281 --> 01:38:37.470
you really do appreciate,
you know,

1463
01:38:37.471 --> 01:38:41.280
the people sitting in offices doing shuffling the papers that they do shuffle.

1464
01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:44.550
So you know when in doubt,

1465
01:38:44.610 --> 01:38:49.200
and if you go through round one,
two,
three and four,

1466
01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:51.390
just remember that you,
at the end of the day,

1467
01:38:51.391 --> 01:38:52.860
you get to do whatever the fuck you want.

1468
01:38:52.861 --> 01:38:56.040
Whether it's work with a publisher or work with yourself and you get to change

1469
01:38:56.041 --> 01:38:57.750
your mind 10 times if you want to.

1470
01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:00.320
<v 4>Cause I have,</v>

1471
01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:06.670
<v 0>well I wish you and yours many more adventures and uh,</v>

1472
01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:09.400
I hope we get a chance to have a hot toddy in person soon.

1473
01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.830
<v 4>I would love that.
And we can invite Neil and he can talk in British at you.
Oh,</v>

1474
01:39:13.831 --> 01:39:17.920
I would love that.
I want him to narrate my entire life,
uh,

1475
01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:23.610
with all of his free time.
Just like so soothing.

1476
01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:27.200
<v 2>I want Neil Gaiman to narrow my entire</v>

1477
01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:32.760
<v 0>doesn't pay well.
Granted,
but uh,
but we could,</v>

1478
01:39:32.761 --> 01:39:33.980
we could talk about that over alcohol.

1479
01:39:34.330 --> 01:39:36.250
<v 4>No,
but you know,
you could create the APP</v>

1480
01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:42.520
you don't have to do is get him to read the entire Oxford English dictionary.

1481
01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:47.770
That's it.
You could make gazillions on the Neil Gaiman narrate your life.

1482
01:39:48.130 --> 01:39:48.963
It's true.

1483
01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:56.090
<v 0>All right.
Well Amanda,
uh,
you're very sweet and Virginia's for taking the time.</v>

1484
01:39:56.091 --> 01:39:59.930
I really appreciate it and you're an inspiration.
Thank you.

1485
01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.273
You work too.

1486
01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:03.490
<v 4>Take it easy.
Bye.
Bye.</v>
