27
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:48.140
graphic design related.

28
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.150
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers,

29
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:56.840
including sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

30
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:00.830
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

31
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.671
the brainstorming.

32
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:05.000
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

33
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.270
works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

34
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.780
a website and APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

35
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.530
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

36
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.140
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

37
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.830
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

38
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:23.540
money back.
It's that straight forward.

39
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.260
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

40
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:29.630
things that I'll be sharing in the future.

Hello my hetero genius homosapiens homicidal Tom Cats.

46
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.600
That doesn't make any sense.
I was going to say homicidal Homo Sapiens,

47
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.430
but heterogeneous.
Why don't we say heterogeneous like Raj Innocence?

48
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.960
I don't know.
This is Tim Ferriss.
Welcome to the Tim Ferriss.

49
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.030
My job every episode is to deconstruct a world class performer and to show you

50
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:07.690
how they do what they do.
What are the favorite books,
the routines,
the habits?

51
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.030
How did they achieve the success they've achieved?

52
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.830
Whether they are chess prodigies like Josh Waitzkin or actors like Arnold

53
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.480
Schwarzenegger,
director like Jon Favreau,
Comedians,
athletes,
hedge fund managers.

54
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.560
We've got everybody startup impresarios like Peter Teal.

55
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.850
And so on this time we have by request,
Scott Adams.

56
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.700
Scott Adams is a very famous cartoonist.

57
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:34.840
He's the creator of the Dilbert Comic Strip and the author of several different

58
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.550
books that are nonfiction.

59
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.850
And he and I have a very wide ranging conversation we've met before and we cover

60
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:45.610
things such as his use of affirmations,

61
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.640
written affirmations for the Stock Market for success with women for his career.

62
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.360
As a cartoonist,
we talk about hypnosis,
why he became interested in hypnosis,

63
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.150
common misconceptions about hypnosis and uh,

64
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.610
how he used different techniques or aspects of what he learned to make Delbert

65
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.160
popular.
Even the name itself,
he goes into,

66
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.470
we talk about a current fascination of his,
which I say,
which,
which,

67
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.350
or who is Donald Trump and,
uh,

68
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.670
the negotiator in chief that he is a campaigning to become.

69
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.030
And a why the political press misses a lot of the genius that perhaps the

70
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:28.750
business press should catch a,
we talk about goals versus systems.

71
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.550
So how he has approached his life with systems in many cases instead of goals.

72
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.720
And he and I,
oddly or perhaps not so coincidentally,
share a lot in common there.

73
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.860
We talk about his first ever Dilbert check the six dimensions of humor.

74
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.970
So how can you engineer humor in say,
a comic strip or elsewhere?

75
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.720
And we talk about the most underrated comic book strips and comics and his

76
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:54.370
opinion how he got into the best shape of his life at 58 and much,

77
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:58.390
much more.
It's a really fun conversation.
He is one hell of a character,

78
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.100
a very hilarious guy as you would hope.
And uh,
the banter is a,

79
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.820
I found a really good time.
So I hope that comes across via audio.

80
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.410
And without further ado,
please enjoy Scott Adams and say hi to him.

81
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.310
It is at Scott.
Adam says on Twitter.

82
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.310
So give a give a hello give a thank you.
Give him some feedback and uh,

83
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.720
there you have it there without further ado is a little premature.

84
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:27.640
But here we go.
Without further ado,
Scott Adams,
please enjoy
Scott,

85
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:30.220
my good man.
Welcome to the show.
Hey,
thanks for having me.

86
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.810
I am so excited to have you on because many of the guests who've been on this

87
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:39.400
podcast are fans of yours.
I'm a fan of your work and have you personally.

88
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.800
And there there are few things I'd like to thank you for.

89
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:44.980
The first is helping me to learn different languages because I bought the

90
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:49.840
Dilbert principle in many different languages,
Chinese,
Spanish,
German,

91
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.370
English as a way to learn conversational languages,
number one.

92
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:56.800
And then number two is for your tennis lesson,

93
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.720
which was the first proper tennis lesson I've ever had.

94
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:03.710
So right off the bat I wanted to thank you for being very good at helping me to

95
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:07.250
make progress in both of those areas.
Oh,
there's so much I can teach you,
Tim.

96
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.690
We're just,
we're just getting started.
Well,
you,
you know,
the,

97
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:14.930
the language is in tennis.
Go along the way.
I feel like,
you know,
have,

98
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.830
have tennis racket and a few words,
we'll travel the way I gotta tell you,

99
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:22.370
the first time I saw one of my books translated into Portuguese,

100
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:26.090
I think I had this strange sensation that I could speak the language because I

101
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:30.410
knew what the word said.
I was the coolest thing.
Well that is,

102
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.420
that is actually really related because I,
what I'll do is with these languages,

103
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.840
if I learned for instance,
uh,
Japanese first,

104
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.200
then I will use the Japanese and say a target language of Spanish to learn the

105
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:48.710
Spanish and other words.
I already know what's in the book on some level,

106
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.810
just like memorizing lines in a movie.

107
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.200
But I will use the Japanese to help me learn the Spanish so that they're linked

108
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.931
together.

109
00:06:56.931 --> 00:07:01.070
And that way I get to review previous languages while learning new languages.

110
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.520
And I was so impressed with how you were able to teach me tennis,

111
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.380
uh,

112
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.580
or at least get me up and running with the basics in such a very short period of

113
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:11.570
time.
And I feel like you,

114
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.340
you're very methodical in many different areas and you have methods that other

115
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:17.174
people can use.

116
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.180
And one of the specific behaviors that I'd love to hear you perhaps elaborate on

117
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.560
just right off the bat is the idea of verbal or written affirmations.

118
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.970
So neval one of our mutual friends was on this podcast and she was mentioning

119
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.270
that at some point,
at least based on in on his recollection,

120
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.100
you had gone into your office at the time and gone into the bathroom and said to

121
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:45.920
yourself in the mirror,
I will be a successful cartoonist or something like that.

122
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:49.580
Multiple Times.
I've also heard that you write things down,
say 10,
15 times.

123
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.940
Could you perhaps explain a bit of how you use affirmations?

124
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:59.200
If you do,
you have accidentally given me the greatest um,

125
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.580
beginning anecdote to a long explanation.
Anybody ever did so.

126
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.990
All right.
Oh man,
true story.

127
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.940
Just a few days ago I was having dinner with novel and I'm just making

128
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:15.140
conversation.
You know,
we haven't seen him in awhile and just randomly,

129
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.320
because I knew I was coming onto your podcast and said live all,

130
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:19.470
if you've ever done the,
you know,

131
00:08:19.471 --> 00:08:23.480
Tim Ferriss podcast and he gets us weird expression in his face and he says,

132
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.730
I just came from there was,

133
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.120
it was the most random thing and the two people who could have said to each

134
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:33.170
other after not seeing for a while,
but that,
that weird story.

135
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.610
It's a story about coincidence,
right?
Yeah.
There's no magic that happened there.

136
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:40.940
It was just a strange coincidence and it probably wasn't even a coincidence

137
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:44.540
because the fact that we both know you and you know there's something in the air

138
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:48.350
and maybe you bunch your bunch of interviews in a certain way or think about

139
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:51.170
them a certain way.
So I'm sure there's no real coincidence there.

140
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.780
There's just something we didn't see underlying it all.

141
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.060
So that's the backdrop for affirmations.

142
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.550
<v 2>Let me say first that what I'm saying is not my belief that if you say your</v>

143
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:03.210
affirmations,

144
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.240
something magical will happen and the universal will change and in some non

145
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.340
science way.
All right.
So I'd never had made that claim,

146
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:15.150
although often people have put that,
uh,
opinion in my mouth.

147
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.830
What I have said is that I've used the technique and I got a certain experience,

148
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:23.040
which I'll be happy to share.
And then I tell the story.
All right,

149
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:24.750
you can make of it what you will.

150
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.790
I have several explanations for why there seems to be what I would call the,

151
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.840
the appearance of an effect,
which by the way,
we'd be amazing in itself.

152
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:34.350
Of course,

153
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:39.150
you could give yourself a genuine feeling that you had a superpower even if it

154
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:42.600
wasn't real,
as long as it didn't interfere with your job,

155
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:45.180
nobody thought you were crazy.
It'd be a cool feeling.
So,

156
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.830
so even if it's not real,
in some sense of reality,
still worth having,

157
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.010
frankly.
So we'd have,
um,
I,

158
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.970
I'm going to take as long as I want it for this and you can just cut me off.

159
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.190
It's a fun story from beginning to end.
I live with a lot of people ask,

160
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.190
this is what,
uh,
this is what this format is for longform.
Please go for it.
Yeah.

161
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.930
So I'm in my twenties.

162
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:11.010
I was taking a course in hypnosis to learn how to become a professional,

163
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.040
hidden the test and get certified in my class was a woman who was also

164
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:20.730
interested in lots of things that I thought were pretty out there.

165
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:24.660
So new agey stuff.
But we became friends and one day she said,

166
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.330
you got to try this thing called affirmations.

167
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.330
I read about it in a book and I don't remember the name of the book.

168
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.560
And so I can't tell you here,
cause she couldn't tell me.
And she said,

169
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.130
it works like this.
All you do is you,
you pick a goal in your,

170
00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:43.131
write it down in 15 times a day and some specific sentence form like eyes got

171
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:48.930
Adam,
this will become an astronaut for example.
And you do that every day.

172
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.830
And uh,

173
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.480
then it will seem as if the universe just start spitting up opportunities and it

174
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:58.980
will look to you like these are coincidences and whether they're or not is less

175
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:01.020
relevant than the fact that they seem to pop up.

176
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.460
So I of course being my rational self,
you know,

177
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:09.130
at this point I haven't even decided if hypnosis is a real thing.
Right?
Right.

178
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:14.370
You know,
I'm taking the course to find out in part.
And so I'm saying,
you know,

179
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:17.370
that seems like a terrible waste of time.
There's no science behind that,
blah,

180
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:21.720
blah,
blah.
She convinced me partly because she was a member of Mensa,
uh,

181
00:11:21.721 --> 00:11:26.460
that she wasn't dumb.
Uh,
step.
That's good.
And then secondly,

182
00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:27.660
it didn't cost me anything.
Right.

183
00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:31.270
It was a low investment for something to make her shut up.
So I said,
hi,

184
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.860
I'm going to do this thing.
So I picked as my goal,
um,

185
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.890
that I would have an encounter with a woman who is well beyond my buying power,

186
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:43.960
shall we say.
This is pre Dilbert.
So,
you know,
post,

187
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.820
post Delbert you get to add a few points to your,
to your attractive,
the scale.

188
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.480
It's not fair,
but that's just the way it works.
So,
so let's say if,
you know,

189
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:56.110
if I could modestly say I was,
uh,
uh,
six,
uh,
hoping to be a six and a half,

190
00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.900
let's say she was at a nine,
just so you know,

191
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:03.040
you get a sense of the monumental task.
I,
I sat in front of myself.

192
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.900
Secondly,
I didn't know her.

193
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.510
She was just somebody who worked in the company in a different department.

194
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.260
So I'll shorten the story just to say lucky things happened and against all

195
00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:16.060
odds,
my affirmation came true.

196
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.170
So I thought to myself as everybody would in this situation.

197
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.040
Well it's not really the affirmation that it worked.
That would be crazy,
right?

198
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.810
Because even though it was a whole bunch of ridiculous coincidences that put us

199
00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:31.810
in the same place,
you know,
at the same time,
I mean,

200
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:34.600
you wouldn't believe the number of them and I,
I won't tell them here,

201
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:36.070
cause there there's just too many.

202
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.880
But in the end it was almost like we were fated to meet right now I don't

203
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:43.690
believe in that,
but it just felt like that that's the experience.

204
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.810
So I said to myself,
well,
I guess I've misinterpreted this.

205
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.870
And really what happened is I'm not in six and a half,
dammit,

206
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.380
I must be her level,
or maybe,

207
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:57.260
maybe I'm a seven and a half and maybe she's a nine,
but she's got,
you know,

208
00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.720
poor self image.
So she didn't know it.
So maybe that's all that happened,
right?

209
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.840
So I said,
well,
I'm going to have to try something else.
So I said,
all right,

210
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:08.730
I'll try it.
Affirmation of I'll get rich in the stock market.
Yeah,

211
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.540
that's kind of a crazy thing to ask for,

212
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.380
especially if you don't even have a stock brokerage account open.

213
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.310
And if you don't have any money to invest,
I think I was,
you know,
a poor banking,

214
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.020
uh,
person,
a banker.
That was.
And so I started doing that affirmation.

215
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:26.110
And after about a week,
I literally woke up in the middle of the night,

216
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:30.820
sat straight up in my bed with a thought firmly in my head that I should buy

217
00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:35.560
stock.
And Chrysler at the time,
I don't remember the year,
but if,
you know,

218
00:13:35.561 --> 00:13:37.660
if you went through the historical records,

219
00:13:37.661 --> 00:13:42.070
it was when Chrysler was flirting with the completely going out of business who

220
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:45.640
was,
I don't know if they were officially bankrupt,
but they were,
they were,
uh,

221
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.570
the government had pumped them up and most observers were saying,
you know,

222
00:13:49.571 --> 00:13:52.870
this is sort of the,
the company that's circling the drain.

223
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.540
So it didn't seem like a good idea and,

224
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:59.680
but I tried to open my Schwab account anyway and pursue it just to see,
you know,

225
00:13:59.681 --> 00:14:02.560
we're still in ab testing here to see us.
This is real.

226
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.550
But the paperwork got mixed up and it took weeks to sort it out.

227
00:14:07.551 --> 00:14:11.350
And I didn't get my account opened it.
In the meantime,
the stock starts rising.

228
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:11.680
Yeah.

229
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.160
I think it would up to hundred 20% in the time that I wasted trying to open my

230
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:19.660
account.
So I thought to myself,
damn,
I was kind of right.
You know,
I mean,

231
00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:22.900
I picked a pretty good stock,
but you know,
my timing's off.

232
00:14:22.901 --> 00:14:25.510
So I guess the affirmation thing wasn't really working.

233
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.240
So I didn't buy that stock.
If you,
if you go back,

234
00:14:28.241 --> 00:14:31.880
you'll find out it continued to go up because it turns out Chrysler did,

235
00:14:31.881 --> 00:14:35.560
it turned around.
It was one of the great business success stories of all time.

236
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.430
I knew nothing about that except,
you know,
the headline news.
Um,
before I,

237
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.110
I came up with this idea.
In other words,
there was no story.
I ran,

238
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:48.370
no analyst was ahead of it.
It just came from nowhere or so it's always seemed,

239
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.040
but I lost out because I didn't it,
I guess.
Right.

240
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.340
<v 3>I didn't buy and it became kind of the story stock of the year.
Right.</v>

241
00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:00.620
So I tried it one more time.
I said,
uh,
I think I'll try to,
uh,
you know,

242
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:04.460
buy one more stock and I do the affirmations and one day I pick up the newspaper

243
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:07.720
and I just had this feeling and I opened it up and there's a,
uh,

244
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.400
back in the day when a company was going public,
they would sometimes put a,
uh,

245
00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.460
a big notice in the newspaper and it was a company called ask computer ask or as

246
00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:19.670
software,
I forgot.

247
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.080
But there were a new tech company back before tech was anything.
And I said,
Hey,

248
00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:26.540
I'm gonna Invest in this company.
I just feel it put in some money.

249
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:31.070
I think it went up,
I don't know,
10% of the week,
whatever it was.
I thought,
Ooh,

250
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:33.030
I'm a genius.
I think I invested about it.

251
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.710
Thousand dollars might've made a hundred which was big money for a week of doing

252
00:15:36.711 --> 00:15:40.130
nothing.
You know when you're,
when you're not making enough money to save money,

253
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.060
but make it $100 for nothing,
seemed like a big deal.
So I'm thinking,
man,

254
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:44.923
I am so smart.

255
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.110
I sold my stock and that fricking stock went to the moon us.

256
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.480
And now I've got these three,
these three data points.
Right?

257
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.260
And the only thing that stopped me from the to doing very well for me is that I

258
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:59.570
didn't stay with them.
So I said,
well,

259
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.880
it would be dumb if this thing actually has something to it to set another goal

260
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:08.860
that's relatively modest,
right?
So,

261
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.950
so there was another thing I did first,
let me insert that before I went back.

262
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:17.270
I also made a bet with somebody that would take the,
uh,
the g mats,

263
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:21.570
the test you take to get it into a good school for your Mba.
Um,
bees,

264
00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:24.890
I taken them right after I'd finished by four year degree and I'd got,

265
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.260
I think the 77th percentile,

266
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.500
which is nowhere near enough to get into a school like Berkeley,
which,

267
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.330
which would make a difference in my career.

268
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.200
So I made a bet with somebody who's going to take a prep course.

269
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.970
They were going to try to,
uh,
raise their score from the 80s and something,

270
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.260
perhaps the,
the nineties,
uh,
in order to get into a good school again,

271
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:49.520
like Berkeley.
So I made a bet,
and I don't know why I made this bad.

272
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:51.200
It was just stupid in retrospect.

273
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:56.260
I bet that I would raise my score from 77th percentile to whatever was her new

274
00:16:57.441 --> 00:17:00.010
best score.
So I would beat not only your other score,

275
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.300
which already beat me by over 10 points,
I think.
Or maybe,
you know,

276
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.060
she was in the high eighties,
I think,

277
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.680
but I thought that would beat her new score.

278
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.260
And I wasn't going to take a test preparation course.

279
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.670
I was just going to take some practice tests on my own at home.
So I did that.

280
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:16.640
But I,
I paired it with the affirmation and then,
uh,

281
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.740
I also visualized,

282
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.280
which is part of the process and they tell you to do very specifically what my

283
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:26.580
score would look like on the exact document I knew I would get because I had

284
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.700
taken this test before,
years earlier.

285
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.370
And so I would imagine that in that little box where the,

286
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:33.910
the cumulative score was,
I would see the,

287
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:38.360
the number 94 and so I just kept focusing on do I need for it,

288
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.120
because I figured that would be close enough that if I got anywhere in that

289
00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:43.280
range,
um,
you know,

290
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.560
then I'm probably going to get into a good school if I want to.

291
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.620
So we take the test.
I,
my,
everyone in my practice tests,

292
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.210
I got about the same as the first time.

293
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:54.420
I took it somewhere in the high seventies.
Uh,
percentile.

294
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.440
I take the test felt exactly the same as all the practice tests.

295
00:17:58.441 --> 00:18:01.140
I didn't feel like I was having a good day or anything.
Weeks passed,

296
00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:03.030
the test shows up in the mail.
I go to the mailbox,

297
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:06.570
I opened the mail and they opened that letter and it's the same,

298
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.850
same kind of format that I'd visualized.

299
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.660
So I knew exactly what it looked like and I looked out into the little box where

300
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:17.370
for weeks I had been visualizing the number 94 and I looked at it and the

301
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:20.980
fucking things said 94
all right.

302
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:26.880
This was after the stock market experience.
Yeah,
I'm getting my timing mixed up.

303
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:29.160
It was sitting there were roughly in that period.
Right.

304
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:34.610
So I literally sat there in my little mold covered literally apartment in San

305
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.590
Francisco,
in the Haight district.

306
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:43.370
I sat in a chair and I stared forward for hours and all night long.

307
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.780
I would,
I would say to myself,
I don't think I just saw that.

308
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.100
And then I would reach over on my table and pick up the little a report and I

309
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:56.850
would look at it again and I would make sure I was scouring the document and not

310
00:18:56.851 --> 00:19:00.270
reading like a date or you know,
a serial number or something.
Right.

311
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.501
And it was right.

312
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:04.380
And I'd put her down and then I would just repeat that process for hours.

313
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.370
And at the other day I said,
I think I'm going to set my sights higher.

314
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.790
And it wasn't long after I decided to start the affirmation,

315
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.510
my Scott Adams would become a famous cartoonist.
So Abby was,

316
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.440
there were some years that passed in between and then some other affirmations.

317
00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:22.230
But that's,
that's essentially the,
the path I took.

318
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.700
So the odds of becoming a famous cartoonist,
uh,

319
00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:31.230
I think about 2000 people submit packages do this.
The big syndicates,

320
00:19:31.231 --> 00:19:35.330
the people who give you the big contract,
your big break,
um,
uh,

321
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.280
they might pick a half dozen of them.
Of those half dozen,

322
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.750
most of them will not make it after a year or two.
So it's a very rare,
in fact,

323
00:19:42.751 --> 00:19:46.800
Dilbert was probably one of the,
you know,
I think the biggest breakout,

324
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:51.830
we're one of the biggest in 20 years just to look at the affirmations.

325
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.650
I have a number of questions about this and then I want to ask you about God's

326
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:59.790
debris also because I think this is maybe there's an interesting tie in,
but Oh,

327
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.560
if I could,
because I think your,
your listeners want to hear this.
I know.
Sure.

328
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.970
Interrupt you here,
but no,
no.
And trucked all you want.

329
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.650
The two other affirmations that are notable was,
um,

330
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.100
I said that I would become a number one bestselling author before I'd ever

331
00:20:14.101 --> 00:20:18.870
written a book and I'd never taken a class in writing,
you know,
except a one,

332
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.480
I think a two day course in business writing.
And that was it.

333
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.500
And the Dilbert principle became the number one bestselling book the next time I

334
00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:29.040
used it.
Because after that,
pretty much everything I wanted,
I got,
you know,
right.

335
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:30.510
Because with success,

336
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.710
you don't need the affirmation so much because just everything starts being

337
00:20:34.711 --> 00:20:38.600
attracted to you automatically.
But there was a period,

338
00:20:38.601 --> 00:20:41.930
and I know you get asked about this later,
where I lost my voice,
right?

339
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.640
Couldn't speak for three and a half years.
Yeah,

340
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.190
we'll talk about that later I think.
But,

341
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:53.080
<v 2>uh,
that was the,
the next time I used affirmations and the affirmation was I,</v>

342
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:57.970
Scott Adams will speak perfectly.
Now I realize I don't speak perfectly,
but with,

343
00:20:57.971 --> 00:21:02.930
when we get to that story,
you'll see that,
uh,
there's more to it.
And if,

344
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.560
if we were to look at just the,

345
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:08.020
the mechanics of these affirmations,

346
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.030
are you sitting down in the morning and writing down 15 lines,

347
00:21:13.031 --> 00:21:16.120
kind of like Bart Simpson on the chalkboard on a piece of paper.

348
00:21:16.121 --> 00:21:19.890
How exactly were you doing it?
And then,
um,

349
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:24.250
how do you expect a lakes exactly.
Yeah.

350
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.430
I will start by saying,
well,
I'll tell you exactly how I did it,

351
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.180
but then I'll also tell you that I'm positive.
The exact method doesn't matter.

352
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.590
I think what matters is the degree of focus and the commitment you have to that

353
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:36.640
focus.
Right?

354
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:42.030
Because the last affirmation I mentioned was primarily done in my head while

355
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:47.410
driving.
But,
uh,
you know,
continuously for years.
Dot.
Three years.

356
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.043
Um,

357
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.660
so the way I did it back in those times was I used a pencil or a pen and a piece

358
00:21:55.091 --> 00:21:59.610
of paper and I wrote the same sentence 15 times a day,

359
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.150
once a day,
I think.
I mean,

360
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:02.830
there would be nothing wrong with doing it twice a day,

361
00:22:02.831 --> 00:22:04.150
except it's twice as hard.

362
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.530
So I don't think there's a reason that you should do it twice a day.

363
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:13.000
I don't know if 15 is magic,
I'm sure 10 would get you there.
20 might be better.

364
00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:15.520
But I doubt it.
I don't think it matters.
And by the way,

365
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:17.740
these are the questions that everybody asks me all the time.
You know,

366
00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:22.030
do you save the piece of paper?
No.
All right.
You don't save the paper.

367
00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:24.490
The paper is irrelevant.
If you type it,

368
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.260
I'm positive you'll get the same result.
I don't know if this works.
I mean,
again,

369
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.580
I'm not telling you that affirmation.

370
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:34.510
This is a thing that actually happens as opposed to a perception that you have.

371
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.900
But I'm sure the perception at least would be the same if you were typing it as

372
00:22:37.901 --> 00:22:40.750
opposed to writing it.
So I think all of the details don't matter.

373
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.280
Here's why I think it seems to work and there are several possibilities for
that.

374
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:50.830
One is something a I learned long ago and I forget who coined it,

375
00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:55.110
but uh,
if you ever heard the phrase reticular activation I have.
Yeah.
Yeah.

376
00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.770
So it's basically the idea that it's easy to hear your own name spoken in a

377
00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:04.170
crowd.
All right,
so you,
you'll hear background noise as well.
Ah,

378
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.520
Tim Ferriss,
Blah Blah Blah.
And he like,

379
00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:09.130
how did I hear that one thing and this whole bunch of crowd noise.

380
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.710
So basically your brain is incapable of,

381
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.480
of processing everything in its environment or even coming close.

382
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.330
So the best it can do is set up these little filters.

383
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.140
And the way it sets its filters is by what you pay attention to,
right?

384
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.770
It's what you spend the most energy on.
It's how you focus your memory.

385
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:28.120
That's how you set your filter.

386
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.170
So your filter is automatically assigned for your name because that's just,

387
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.010
you know,
the thing that matters most to you.
But you can use these affirmations.

388
00:23:36.011 --> 00:23:40.750
Presumably this is just a hypothesis to focus your mind and your memory on a

389
00:23:40.751 --> 00:23:41.860
very specific thing.

390
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.890
And that would allow you to notice things in your environment that might have

391
00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:46.724
already been there.

392
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.020
It's just that your filter was set to ignore and then you just tune it with,

393
00:23:50.021 --> 00:23:54.800
through this memory and repetition trick until it widens a little bit to allow,

394
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.990
allow some extra stuff in.
Now,
uh,

395
00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:01.190
there's some science to back that Dr. Richard Weisman,
uh,

396
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.090
did some studies.

397
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:05.990
I look and he was trying to find out if people actually have real luck,
you know,

398
00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:09.170
can they guess the future better than other people in the answer?

399
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:10.250
As you might guess,

400
00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:13.640
and I'm sure the people listening to this podcast are all rationalist and

401
00:24:13.641 --> 00:24:16.010
skeptics and you know that he found nothing,
right?

402
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.780
Nobody can guess random events better than other people.
But he did another test,

403
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.610
which I'll shorten here,
but the,

404
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.120
the idea was that people who expect it to be lucky,

405
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.570
that people who labeled themselves lucky and looked for luck everywhere,

406
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.360
we're a little bit better at finding it.
In other words,

407
00:24:32.361 --> 00:24:34.700
just actually noticing it in the environment.

408
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.630
So if your filter is tuned to this thought,
hey,

409
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:41.330
I think there's something out there.
Lucky,
let me look for it.
Where's Waldo?

410
00:24:41.331 --> 00:24:44.000
Where's Waldo?
Where's there's Waldo?
All right,

411
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:48.500
you're going to find a little bit more and more often than the guy who says it

412
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:51.470
was nothing to look for.
I already know everything's going to go wrong.

413
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.100
I'll tell you tomorrow,
tomorrow I was going to be meeting going wrong.
Bad Day.

414
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.760
He,
York Ray went right.
So that guy's just not looking for anything,
right?

415
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.930
So now let me give you an anecdote to tie that together.

416
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.670
During the time I was telling myself I want it to be,
you know,
a cartoonist,

417
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.910
how do you do that?
Like,
you know,
where this was pre internet,

418
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.980
I didn't know where to search for it and I didn't know anybody.
Um,

419
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.440
I came home and I noticed,
all right,
I noticed something I'd never seen before.

420
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.610
Maybe it had always been there,
I dunno,
but I noticed a card,
a show,

421
00:25:22.611 --> 00:25:24.680
a TV show about how to become a cartoonist.

422
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:28.880
And I wrote to the host of the show and ask for some advice.
He gave it to me,

423
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:32.640
short story,
uh,
even shorter,
um,

424
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.130
that sent me on the road to,

425
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.510
to know how to buy the book that I needed in and submit my materials and that

426
00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:40.730
sort of thing.
Now you could say,
well,

427
00:25:40.731 --> 00:25:44.850
that was just a coincidence because maybe that shall only aired once and,
uh,

428
00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.330
I think it was on public TV.
So it actually probably heard lots of times.
But,
um,

429
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.740
there might've been other things I would have noticed.

430
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.260
It wasn't just that one thing I could have noticed.

431
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:57.590
I might've noticed other things that would have sent me on a different path,

432
00:25:57.591 --> 00:26:01.100
but also toward this,
this thing I'd been focusing on right now.

433
00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:04.940
The other possibility,
um,
every rational person in the audience is screaming,

434
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:08.870
you know,
at their,
uh,
their speaker right now.
You idiot.

435
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.410
This is selective memory.
Um,
what,

436
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.810
what's really happening is there are lots of times that you were focusing on

437
00:26:14.811 --> 00:26:16.970
things and do a affirmations and you're just,

438
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.480
you just freaking forgot those tights.
A survivorship bias.
Right?
Right.
Um,

439
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.770
I say absolutely.
That's completely possible.
Right?

440
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:29.030
But I just told him my story and I can tell you that I don't have a memory in

441
00:26:29.031 --> 00:26:31.670
all of those years of trying it when it didn't work.

442
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:35.600
I do have plenty of memories of when it hadn't worked yet.

443
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.480
Like I said,
the voice problem took a year's.
Um,

444
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.960
and yeah,
I suppose if I were doing one in particular right now,
uh,

445
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:50.220
that I could say it hadn't happened yet.
So,
so there's that.

446
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.120
Um,
but there's also just the fact that,
um,

447
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.650
it may be a self identification thing.
And what I mean by that is,

448
00:26:59.220 --> 00:26:59.930
uh,

449
00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:04.350
I have a view that we're mostly moist robots in the sense of,

450
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.100
you know,
the,
the environment that is programming us.
And,
you know,

451
00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:11.580
we've got a little DNA that's like our operating system,
but basically,
you know,

452
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:16.170
you start with that and that can vary a lot.
Right?
Your DNA is a little bit,

453
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.460
a little bit of a,
a window of how much your,
you know,
your nature,
it can change,

454
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.500
but that's like a computer,
right?

455
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.920
And then the environment programs it within its parameters.

456
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.680
So you got that going on.
So you've got a person who's just getting,
you know,

457
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.540
programmed by the environment,
but they don't know that,
right?

458
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.030
They think they're making decisions and using their free will.

459
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:40.770
So it could be that all that's happening is that a person who is willing to

460
00:27:40.771 --> 00:27:45.771
write down their goal 15 times a day has in their dis at their disposal without

461
00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:49.800
necessarily knowing it.
A subconscious that is totally on their side.

462
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.281
In other words,

463
00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:54.120
there's something in the subconscious that is overriding the conscious and say,

464
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.070
you know,
Scott,
we're going to do this thing.
You haven't figured it out yet.

465
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.820
All right?
But I'm doing the affirmations,
doing the affirmations.
So what I'm,

466
00:28:02.821 --> 00:28:06.030
what I'm suggesting is it's not the affirmations that are making something

467
00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:06.570
happen.

468
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:10.410
This thing is going to happen because my subconscious already decided that I

469
00:28:10.411 --> 00:28:11.340
have these objectives,

470
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:14.820
I have these goals and I'm going to chew through a fricking wall to make these

471
00:28:14.821 --> 00:28:18.300
happen,
right?
And I have some capabilities so I can,
I can chew,
you know,

472
00:28:18.301 --> 00:28:19.134
I'm a good shoer.

473
00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.820
So maybe all of this happening is that a person like me who has the subconscious

474
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:28.740
that's guiding him towards this very specific outcome is also the same person

475
00:28:28.741 --> 00:28:31.800
who was willing to write it down 15 times,
right?
So in other words,

476
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:34.900
the causation is exactly backwards from how it looks,
right?

477
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.710
I'm already that person who's going to make this happen.

478
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.040
And I'm also by coincidence a person who is so intent on it,

479
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:42.390
then I'll try anything.

480
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.450
And one of those things just happens to be writing stuff down and 15 dogs,

481
00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:46.950
<v 0>right?
Well,
it's,
it's uh,</v>

482
00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:52.290
it's like looking at parents and who credit being good parents with buying books

483
00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.460
a,
B,
and c,
and you're like,
well,

484
00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.780
maybe it's just that the people who are predisposed to being good parents are

485
00:28:58.781 --> 00:29:03.450
the same people who are likely to buy a bunch of books.
And study how maybe,

486
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.170
and maybe just maybe I've got three

487
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:08.780
<v 2>links were raised in an identical situations that we all turned out completely</v>

488
00:29:08.781 --> 00:29:10.010
different.
Like,

489
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.560
do you just say that to anybody and watch them get the doe in the headlights,

490
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.000
headlights look like,
okay,
you're just change everything I know about life.

491
00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.590
I will now erase that.

492
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:21.190
<v 0>Yeah,
go on.
But I do think that,
you know,</v>

493
00:29:21.191 --> 00:29:24.710
you bring up a couple of really important topics and,

494
00:29:24.711 --> 00:29:28.870
and I think helpful lenses through which to view behaviors.
So the first is,

495
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:33.420
uh,
this,
this potential combination of,
uh,

496
00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:37.540
optimism and,
uh,
being an opportunist,

497
00:29:37.541 --> 00:29:42.250
which I think perhaps the,
uh,
affirmations,
right?

498
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:44.830
So for instance,
people might say,
well,

499
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:48.130
the people who go to silicon valley or more successful because they're driven,

500
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:51.880
they go to silicon valley,
they build tech companies and so on.
Uh,

501
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.070
I would argue there's probably more to that story.

502
00:29:54.071 --> 00:29:59.071
And one plausible explanation is people in Silicon Valley believe certain

503
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.570
impossibles are possible,

504
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.870
whereas they wouldn't be in a peer group elsewhere that would support that.

505
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.261
Right?

506
00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:10.090
So they're encouraged to try these things that would see doomed,

507
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.640
seem doomed to fail in many other parts of the world.

508
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.630
And if you're able to achieve that,
uh,

509
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.020
in isolation by using these affirmations,

510
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:25.050
then you have this sort of a naive optimism that then provides you with this.

511
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.800
Uh,
like you said,
selective attention and optimism where you'll,
you'll,

512
00:30:29.801 --> 00:30:32.470
you'll write to the host of the TV show,
right?

513
00:30:32.471 --> 00:30:36.910
It's kind of like the sixth sense and noticing the red door knob or you buy a

514
00:30:36.911 --> 00:30:39.130
new car and then you go out and you see the new car everywhere.

515
00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:41.890
It's not that everyone went out and bought the same car to be like you.

516
00:30:41.891 --> 00:30:43.000
It's that you're now noticing it.

517
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.740
How did you decide to write what rights,
uh,

518
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.760
God's debris?
What was,
what is the story behind that?
Because when I,

519
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:56.000
when I pinged my audience to ask what they would like to know from you,
um,

520
00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:57.730
many people are familiar with Dilbert.

521
00:30:57.731 --> 00:31:00.700
I would suspect a lot of people are probably not familiar with God's debris,

522
00:31:00.701 --> 00:31:04.510
but the,
the premise and everything about the book is really fascinating.

523
00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:07.210
Could you describe how that,
how that came about?

524
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.620
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
for the readers,</v>

525
00:31:09.621 --> 00:31:13.760
not or the listeners not familiar with the God's debris,

526
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:18.290
that's a non humor or non Dilbert book.
I wrote,
um,

527
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.370
2001 I think,
and it's a,

528
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.460
essentially a conversation between a delivery man and the smartest person in the

529
00:31:26.501 --> 00:31:29.620
world,
um,
that he beats by accident.
He thinks,

530
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.180
and the challenge of the book was to write in the,

531
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.080
in the voice of someone who is allegedly the smartest person in the world.

532
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.320
Someone who literally knows everything.
Now,
the problem is,

533
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.740
since I don't know everything,
you know,
how do you figure out that out?

534
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.420
So that my writers solution was my version of Ockham's razor,

535
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.710
sort of a bastardized version in which I simply had the alleged smartest person

536
00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:58.090
in the world say the things that seemed like the simplest explanations.

537
00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.000
And it turns out when you read the simplest explanation,

538
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:05.800
even if it's not what you were already set the believe or already did believe,

539
00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:10.360
it's very compelling.
Anyway,
it's just one of those ways.
Your brain is wired.

540
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:15.280
That simplicity looks compelling.
You know,
Ronald Reagan Iee,

541
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:19.690
Donald Trump.
Simplicity is always compelling.
But the larger part,

542
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.370
you know that the content of the book,

543
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:23.740
and this won't mean as much as the people who haven't read it,

544
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:25.900
but it will mean a whole bunch of the people who have.

545
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.940
You're probably wondering how the hell does anybody think of those different

546
00:32:30.941 --> 00:32:35.670
ideas and have them fit together in the same book?
Uh,

547
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.740
that's one of the questions I get asked the most and the answer is you don't do

548
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:44.060
it intentionally write that stuff does not happen because you had a plan.

549
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:49.160
That book is the result of literally a my lifetime.

550
00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:53.750
Up to that point.
It was 40 ish years.
I forget.
Um,

551
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.840
and all the strange thoughts I'd had and one specific moment in my shower at

552
00:33:00.141 --> 00:33:04.040
which I realized,
Holy Hell,
these are all the same idea.

553
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.990
And they have a theme,
which I can now weave them together into one grand idea,

554
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.740
which if I put it in the voice of someone,
not myself,
you know,

555
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:14.360
then put it in the form of fiction.

556
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:18.650
It will give the reader the same feeling that I had when the census came to me

557
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:22.070
in the shower where I got a full body tingle.

558
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:27.020
I felt like maybe everything I knew was wrong.
Um,
not really,
but you know,

559
00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:30.660
I'm talking about it sensation,
just you know,
a feeling.
And I thought,
I,

560
00:33:30.661 --> 00:33:32.920
is there any way that package that,
you know,

561
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.530
is there a way to write that down so somebody could get that feeling I had in

562
00:33:36.531 --> 00:33:39.200
the shower when I took things from left field,

563
00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:44.150
right field and married orange with a number 12 and explained to you why it's

564
00:33:44.151 --> 00:33:47.150
all really the same thing.
All right?
Could I make somebody have that experience?

565
00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:47.750
So that's what I,

566
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:52.700
what I tried to do with the book and I used throughout it a lot of techniques

567
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:57.710
that I learned in hypnosis classes,
uh,
to strengthen the,
you know,
the impact.

568
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.080
And in the forward,
I,
I give the reader a,
you know,

569
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.040
plenty of clues that this is a,
a thought experiment.

570
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.420
It's not a typical novel.
It's not a story like there they're used to.

571
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.250
And what,
what were some of the techniques from hypnosis that you implemented?

572
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:18.980
Oh,
would that if I told you,
would it be a spoiler?
Um,

573
00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.010
that's okay.
Well,
if he gives away the spotlight,
I'm just curious,

574
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.700
or maybe the broader question is how have you incorporated,
let me,
because I'm,

575
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.320
I'm a,
a,
uh,

576
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:33.530
an uninformed when it comes to hypnosis and I don't know anything about it.
It's,

577
00:34:33.531 --> 00:34:37.910
I'd be just very curious how you've implemented hypnosis into your life.

578
00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.270
I suppose.
Broader question.
Yeah.
So first of all,
um,

579
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.340
the way I use hypnosis is to broadly for the public,
you know,

580
00:34:44.341 --> 00:34:48.150
it says most people are thinking of a stage hypnotist and something's on a
movie.

581
00:34:48.151 --> 00:34:51.030
You were somebody who was programmed to kill the president.
There's something,
um,

582
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:55.040
I,
I'm not talking about any of that stuff or anything that involves a trance,

583
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.670
right?

584
00:34:55.670 --> 00:35:00.670
I'm talking about the science of persuasion stuff that's science tested and the

585
00:35:00.711 --> 00:35:04.930
things that are pretty well known and understood.
So I'll give you one example.

586
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.980
Just illustrate it.
My challenge,
what?

587
00:35:06.981 --> 00:35:11.870
I have a book that's most of it is two people talking is that you will get

588
00:35:11.871 --> 00:35:13.360
bored,
right,
right.

589
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:17.780
So I need to continually put you in the place of one of the characters.

590
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.260
You can't be in the place of the smartest person in the world,
you know,

591
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.800
because by definition,
you just can't get there.
Right.

592
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:29.990
But you can be in the place of the person who's listening to it and not buying

593
00:35:29.991 --> 00:35:34.130
it.
There's no way you can buy it in it's unfinished form,
right?

594
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.640
It's like somebody,
it's sort of like,
um,
uh,

595
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:41.800
what's the game that you doodle?
And people try to guess your doodle,

596
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.450
a Pictionary,
Pictionary,
Pictionary.

597
00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:49.170
So you need a certain amount of clues before anybody's going to get it right.

598
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.910
Nobody gets it on the first line.
So that's,

599
00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.810
that was the experience I was going for is that,
you know,
you get it.

600
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.990
I completely lost my train of thought.
Thinking about Pictionary,
cause

601
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.770
we were out,
we were talking about persuasion and hypnosis.
Oh,
okay.
So,
right.

602
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.690
The method I used was,
um,

603
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:11.460
whatever the world's smartest person said something that I knew everyone reading

604
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:14.520
it with,
like,
Oh God,
there's 10 obvious reasons why that's stupid.

605
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.380
I would just have the person say,

606
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.430
I think there's that obvious reasons why that's stupid.
Um,
paraphrasing myself.

607
00:36:20.431 --> 00:36:22.380
But,
uh,
another words I make,

608
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:26.690
I make my characters say the thing you just thought.
Right?
Right.

609
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.940
So that's a little different than traditional fiction where I'm making the

610
00:36:32.581 --> 00:36:35.730
character lead you all the way.
So,
um,

611
00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:40.620
so this is a technique and hypnosis you would call it pacing and leading in

612
00:36:40.621 --> 00:36:45.060
persuasion.
You'd have other names for it,
but the idea is,
um,
I'm you,

613
00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:49.710
so I would match you in some way.
If you were doing a standard induction,

614
00:36:49.711 --> 00:36:53.940
the way you would match match,
somebody would be matching their blue breathing,

615
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.600
matching their level of maybe anxiety or the way they talk.

616
00:36:57.601 --> 00:37:01.950
He might try to pick the same language type they use.
You know,
if somebody uses,

617
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:05.970
you know,
angry words and war words,
you'd start out using them.
That's pacing.

618
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.690
So you're matching them so they feel comfortable with you.
They bond with you.

619
00:37:09.691 --> 00:37:14.100
They link to you,
your,
your brain's kind of become like psychologically linked,

620
00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:17.430
you know,
if one person pulls the other one feels the tug,
right?

621
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.110
Just the way any relationship is right.

622
00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:23.640
It's just the normal way to any two people act when they're together.
So,

623
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:27.420
so all you're doing is setting up a thing where you're pacing and then that sets

624
00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:31.140
them up for the leading because the leading in this case in something so

625
00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:35.670
outrageously unexpected that um,
without the,
the leading,

626
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.950
you know,
I could never take them to the new place.
It's like a,
it's,

627
00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:43.110
it's a lot like judo actually in,
in so much as when you're connected to someone.

628
00:37:43.111 --> 00:37:46.290
First you have to tether with the hand grips and then once you've done that,

629
00:37:46.291 --> 00:37:51.291
you try to lead your opponent into a pattern that you are leading like a dance

630
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.620
so that you can control where they step with either foot.

631
00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.610
And at that point you can control it.
You can control in balancing,
right?

632
00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:02.220
So you can,
you can then do with them whatever you want.

633
00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:07.010
Once they've kind of been trained that they're stepping pattern,
uh,
t or as,

634
00:38:07.011 --> 00:38:08.070
which sounds pretty similar.

635
00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.650
Do you know how much that makes me want to go wrestle somebody?
Right?

636
00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:17.550
It's amazing.
Oh,
the foot sweeps in judo are just beautiful.
I mean,
so elegant.

637
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.740
You know,
I've never heard of that explanation of judo,

638
00:38:19.741 --> 00:38:23.910
which instantly makes me interested in it and I had no interest whatsoever

639
00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:28.200
before.
So nicely done on my pleasure.
My pleasure.
Judo is a,

640
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:30.840
especially if people search foots suites,

641
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.790
judo foots weaves on Youtube for instance.

642
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:36.460
It's just one of the most beautiful demonstrations

643
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.220
<v 0>of paired physics where,</v>

644
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:44.170
where one person is using an opponent's energy against them.

645
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.410
Uh,
but,
uh,
it can certainly have,
I think,

646
00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:52.090
have a lot of parallels in a conversation and just human interaction.

647
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.330
Uh,
the,
the how are you,

648
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:59.470
how are you introduced to hypnosis?
You took this class that you had mentioned,

649
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:02.860
but what's,
uh,
what sparked your interest?

650
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:05.110
And for those people who are not familiar with hypnosis,

651
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:08.860
and I've only seen the stage performers and so on,
um,

652
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.120
how do you sniff out someone who is truly a master at hypnosis?

653
00:39:13.121 --> 00:39:15.250
And maybe that's too broad.
Maybe they're a bunch of different types.

654
00:39:15.251 --> 00:39:19.060
And how do you sniff out kind of the charlatans that you shouldn't really pay

655
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.133
much attention to?

656
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:25.740
<v 2>Did you,
uh,
did you read my blog on Trump?
I'm not sure if you're asking.</v>

657
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.500
I don't know if I have it.

658
00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:28.630
<v 0>I'm not,
I'm not leaving.</v>

659
00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:33.520
<v 2>Okay.
So that was the most accidentally a perfect question anybody ever asks.</v>

660
00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.220
I say I love it.
It's,
let me start at the beginning of the,
uh,

661
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.930
my mother delivered,

662
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:45.960
gave birth to my little sister wall under hypnosis and did not use any

663
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:50.680
painkillers.
She did not feel pain and she was awake the whole time.

664
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.700
That's incredible.
Just like I left that dramatic pause after that,

665
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:58.390
but I forgot we're doing a podcast and everybody went to check their equipments.

666
00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:03.790
Sorry about that.
Uh,
but the,
uh,
but I had a huge impact on me.
Um,

667
00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:07.360
so it turns out our family doctor was a trained hypnotist and you know,
he,

668
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.540
he handled the birth and he just offered her that option.
Now,

669
00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:15.460
let me be quick to point out that there's sort of a rule of one in five and

670
00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:18.700
hypnosis and that is that one in five people are,

671
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.140
are able to go into a,
um,

672
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:25.630
a state that is that extreme.
In other words,

673
00:40:25.631 --> 00:40:29.290
somebody who could simply block pain or somebody who could see something that

674
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:32.380
wasn't really in the room.
Now keep in mind that all of these cases,

675
00:40:32.381 --> 00:40:36.220
these people are completely aware and awake and they can stop the sensation any

676
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:39.040
way they want,
anytime they want.
But you know,
if you're giving birth,

677
00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:41.950
you're not going to be going out of your way to stop the sensation of stopping

678
00:40:41.951 --> 00:40:45.730
pain.
Right?
So,
so it's not,
nobody's controlling you.

679
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.270
It's more like a coach working with a,
you know,

680
00:40:48.271 --> 00:40:52.120
an elite player to coach is not doing it.
The coach is saying,
you know,
hey,

681
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:55.840
you know,
crossover gibble,
you know,
go into your lake,
left jog,
right?

682
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.850
So that a huge impact on me.

683
00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.270
And so it got me interested in that and other things.

684
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.930
And so when it was in my twenties and I realized that a guy who works at us bank

685
00:41:04.931 --> 00:41:09.250
teller and has drives a car,
which a one girlfriend,
uh,

686
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:13.910
affectionately,
oh,
she had a terrible name for it,
but I can't say it on the air.

687
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.453
Of course you can say it.

688
00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.670
I realize there's a reason not because it's a profanity,
I just can't say.
Okay,

689
00:41:18.671 --> 00:41:19.504
no problem.

690
00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.530
<v 0>Just to trade my,</v>

691
00:41:21.531 --> 00:41:25.790
I had a hand me down van from my mom and the backseats were stolen so all my

692
00:41:25.791 --> 00:41:29.140
coworkers started calling it the molester mobile.
That was the next day from

693
00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:33.950
<v 2>my car.
Okay.
Went on the car.</v>

694
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:38.540
Uh,
so anyway,
I thought I needed edge,
you know,

695
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:41.540
career wise,
you know,
dating wise.

696
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.690
And if there's anything to this,
at the very least,

697
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:48.320
I'm terribly curious about what it is and what it isn't.
And you know,

698
00:41:48.321 --> 00:41:51.320
you figure your mother's not going to lie to you about childbirth.
I mean,

699
00:41:51.321 --> 00:41:54.850
now it's something that became like a central story of your youth,
you know,

700
00:41:54.851 --> 00:41:56.480
so it was kind of a big deal.

701
00:41:56.481 --> 00:41:59.720
It doesn't seem like the thing she would've made up sort of credibility was
high.

702
00:41:59.721 --> 00:42:02.630
And I thought,
well,
let me check this thing out.
But I again,

703
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.020
20% of the people can have that kind of experience.

704
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:11.440
And the family doctor obviously you become trained and quickly identifying who

705
00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:14.700
those people are so he knew,
um,

706
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:18.350
but all the rest of the people can get a substantial benefits.

707
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:21.020
So unfortunately I'm,
I'm in the,
you know,

708
00:42:21.021 --> 00:42:24.640
the 80% that can't get those extreme benefits,
but the,

709
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:29.630
the stuff I could get is immense.
Um,
and it includes the ability to,

710
00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.800
uh,
craft the book the way I did that.

711
00:42:31.801 --> 00:42:36.740
It includes a lot of technique I use for making Dilbert popular.
For example.

712
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.620
Um,
the reason Dilbert has no last name,

713
00:42:39.621 --> 00:42:42.050
the reason you don't know what town he lives in,

714
00:42:42.051 --> 00:42:45.350
you don't know the name of his company.
And here's a first for a comic strip.

715
00:42:45.351 --> 00:42:50.190
I think that the second main character is the boss in terms of,
you know,
time on,

716
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:53.090
on screen,
uh,
and he doesn't have any name at all.

717
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:58.760
And that all that all comes out of a hypnosis training.

718
00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:03.910
And what I do is I allow the reader to imbue the characters with as much of what

719
00:43:05.901 --> 00:43:10.430
they love as they possibly can without giving them a hard stop.

720
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:15.410
So in other words,
if I said,
uh,
this is a Dilbert Goldberg,
all right?

721
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.630
All of the,
you know,
the antisemites would say,
well,
you know,

722
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:22.190
I don't really relate to that Goldberg guy.
Now you know,
any name,

723
00:43:22.191 --> 00:43:24.910
you give them somebody,
somebody's going to be a hater,
right?
So you're,

724
00:43:24.911 --> 00:43:27.170
you're taking people out of the equation.
As soon as you name him,

725
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:28.730
maybe it's the name they've heard of,

726
00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.710
or there's a reason why it's Dilbert and not Bob,
you know,

727
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:38.120
existing association.
So all of that is just classic.

728
00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:41.630
A well understood hypnosis training.
But again,
I'm not,

729
00:43:41.631 --> 00:43:45.320
I'm not hypnotizing the audience.
I'm simply giving them a better product.

730
00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:48.110
So keep in mind that when I talk about hypnosis,

731
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:52.100
I include things like,
um,
you know,
negotiating,

732
00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:56.210
obviously selling marketing,
but also design product design.

733
00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:59.510
Sorry to pause you,
but I just love to ask because I think like most people,

734
00:43:59.511 --> 00:44:00.590
when I think hypnosis,

735
00:44:00.591 --> 00:44:04.910
I think trance for the purpose of overcoming pain,

736
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.300
being as stiff as a board between she chairs,
et Cetera.
What,

737
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.390
how would you define hypnosis then in this case?
Cause I'm,

738
00:44:11.391 --> 00:44:13.520
I'm listening to what you're describing and I'm like,
wow,
okay.

739
00:44:13.521 --> 00:44:18.440
You've elements if like the,
uh,
narrative structure,
storytelling,

740
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.340
persuasion,
negotiation,
it covers a lot of basis.

741
00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:26.240
How do you define hypnosis?
So the simplest,

742
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:29.990
um,
but I think everybody has ends up with their own definition of it if they,

743
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:33.750
if they have any with it because I don't think there's any one definition

744
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:37.020
everybody's going to agree with.
For me it is a,

745
00:44:37.021 --> 00:44:41.100
for me a connection with either one person or if you're doing it,
you know,

746
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.390
to a group,
if you're trying to persuade a group,
you're,

747
00:44:43.391 --> 00:44:46.600
you're connecting to the group,
you're getting this sort of,
you know,

748
00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:51.270
pacing and leading thing going on,
you're building trust and then you're using,

749
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:56.250
uh,
usually words are sort of the programming language,
you know,
if you will.

750
00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:57.950
Linguistics are the,

751
00:44:57.951 --> 00:45:02.951
the user interface for this moist a robot that we are.

752
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:06.760
Um,
so if you want to program you had you pick words,
um,

753
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.510
if any of you saw a recent went viral recently,

754
00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:13.350
there was an article in the onion in which it was just as funny article about a

755
00:45:13.351 --> 00:45:15.300
couple who allegedly,
uh,

756
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:19.470
use their complete despair and hopelessness as the thing that bound bound them

757
00:45:19.471 --> 00:45:23.700
together,
uh,
at,
but it was,
it was masterfully written thing.
I wish I could,

758
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:26.640
you know,
uh,
uh,
tell you the writer's name,

759
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.390
but the choice of words puts you in a completely different mental state.

760
00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:34.520
It's just the most brilliant word choice in a piece of writing.
You'll see.

761
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.290
And I tried to do that too.
So what I'm writing,

762
00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:40.710
and I don't know if you use the same method,
there's,
there's,
I write in layers.

763
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:44.220
So you know,
there's this first draft,
second draft,
but somewhere toward the end,

764
00:45:44.221 --> 00:45:45.240
the final layer,

765
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.520
I look at every word I use and I say is there is a word that will work on an

766
00:45:50.521 --> 00:45:54.510
emotional level or a different level or just a more perfect level.

767
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.960
Something that will make you remember it.
Something that'll keep you awake.

768
00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.930
That means exactly the same thing.
So here's an example.

769
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:05.130
If I said to the audience,
and I,
I do this in front of crowds,
so you know,

770
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.800
you a home can play along and shout out the answer,

771
00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:08.820
but I already know the answer.

772
00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.780
I'm going to give you two words that mean about the same.
You tell me out loud.

773
00:46:12.781 --> 00:46:14.370
And Tim,
you can play along.
Just say that.

774
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:17.100
Say the one of the two words they both made about the same.

775
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:21.300
That's the funniest one.
Which one is funnier,
Paul or Yank.

776
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:26.250
Yank.
Yeah.
And everybody,
everybody at home just said the same thing,
right?

777
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:31.670
So language does have that much specific control over the way you think.

778
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.730
And so,
uh,
you know,
science and a hypnosis,
uh,
uh,

779
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.670
it was kind of a precursor to a lot of the studies that have borne out a lot of

780
00:46:41.671 --> 00:46:46.671
way hypnotist found by trial and error that you can manipulate the brain by what

781
00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:51.780
people concentrate on,
what words you put in there,
what you make them focus on.

782
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.010
Um,
you know,
what you tied to their habits.
Uh,

783
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:59.310
there's just lots of ways that you can,
you can program the,
the,
the box.

784
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.040
<v 0>Well,
I mean language is,
is mind control,
right?
I mean you can,</v>

785
00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:07.460
you can very easily make people think any number of things are fueling the

786
00:47:07.461 --> 00:47:12.070
number of things by using this of symbology that we've,

787
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.130
that we've created known as language and I've,

788
00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:17.740
I've just been so fascinated by that for so long.

789
00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:22.830
Do you find then is writing an indirect way of developing the skill sets that

790
00:47:23.921 --> 00:47:28.921
would make you a fast learner in hypnosis or or do they not,

791
00:47:28.931 --> 00:47:29.980
does not really pore

792
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.120
<v 2>over that cleanly?
I would say that learning to be a writer,</v>

793
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:38.500
you're only going to maybe brush accidentally on the level that I'm even talking

794
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:42.600
about.
Got It.
Like everybody knows,
hey that's a good word,
but you,

795
00:47:42.601 --> 00:47:45.670
you need to go to the next level.
You know,
if you're saying to yourself,

796
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:50.110
I am putting together a logical argument and this word is the perfect word for

797
00:47:50.111 --> 00:47:54.760
my argument because it means the best thing.
Cause remembering my,
my example,

798
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:59.220
Yank and pull are really the same thing,
are they?
No,
they're not.
Right.

799
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.930
Because you've got a different sense and that's why one was funnier,
you know,

800
00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:04.270
but it also had a y in it and had a k in it.

801
00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.150
So there had two levels of funding this built into the word.

802
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.010
So I will consciously make a choice to get rid of,

803
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:14.830
have a more accurate word to instill,

804
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.820
to put in a word that has more of a programming control,
right?

805
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:23.470
Because you want people to have an experience because that's what they're going

806
00:48:23.471 --> 00:48:26.200
to remember.
They're not going to remember what word choice you use.

807
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:31.890
This dovetails exactly into my loud defense of Donald Trump's methods,

808
00:48:33.011 --> 00:48:35.650
which I've been writing about all we've got the Internet,
I've seen,

809
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.500
I've seen some of that.
Some of the fireworks.
So please,
uh,

810
00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:45.930
let me draw a line for you that um,
I'll say an advanced,

811
00:48:45.931 --> 00:48:49.840
this is conspiracy,
uh,
talk,
you know,
conspiracy theory talk.
So you,

812
00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:53.230
so you don't have to say it.
None of the listeners have to tell me that.

813
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.760
So it's just for fun.

814
00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:59.290
But there is a connection between Donald Trump and me.

815
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.020
There is an individual between us.

816
00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:06.190
That individual happens to be the father of hypnosis.
Milton Erickson,

817
00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.500
Nokia Ericsson,
Bill Erickson.

818
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.970
I'm a name known only to people who studied hypnosis usually or psychology.

819
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.410
So he was a linguist who put a lot of this.
Uh,
I'm not sure if he was a linguist,

820
00:49:17.411 --> 00:49:20.080
but he put a lot of this stuff together,
mostly by instinct.

821
00:49:20.081 --> 00:49:23.290
I think in the beginning,
one of his,
um,

822
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.880
and his school is the school of hypnosis that I ended up going to.

823
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.250
It was a different school with a few differences,

824
00:49:30.251 --> 00:49:34.690
but basically I grew out of that also and have the Ericksons school is,

825
00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:38.320
um,
a couple of people with John Grinder,
I think,

826
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.640
hope I didn't get the name wrong,

827
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.870
who developed a NLP neuro linguistic programming,

828
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.890
which is the way to use a largely words as a programming language,

829
00:49:47.891 --> 00:49:51.940
although they don't market it that way though NLP is marketed with a lot of

830
00:49:51.941 --> 00:49:56.260
stuff that I don't buy into,
but there's a core of it that comes from hypnosis,

831
00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:00.040
which matches pretty exactly with what,
uh,

832
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:04.090
scientific studies and,
you know,
current psychology would expect.
Right?

833
00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.970
So there's,
there's a part of it that's real strong and powerful,

834
00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.490
but it's probably the minority of it.
I mean,
most of it is,
you know,

835
00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:14.080
people being stiff as boards between two chairs and,
you know,
that sort of stuff.

836
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:19.370
Uh,
now the best practice,
or most famous practitioner of NLP,

837
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:24.460
NLP,
the person who got his inspiration from it is Tony Robbins,
Tony Robbins.

838
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.250
It has been,
um,
a business associate with Donald Trump.

839
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.940
They worked together on some kind of program about success.

840
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:35.840
You can see their videos of them talking one after another.
If you Google them,

841
00:50:35.841 --> 00:50:39.740
you see them standing together on Google images,
et cetera.
Now,

842
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.360
I have no reason to believe that they ever had a conversation on the methods of

843
00:50:44.361 --> 00:50:48.260
persuasion.
I think Trump is first of all,
a natural cause he's,

844
00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:49.610
he's been doing it for a long time.

845
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:54.830
But if you look at his recent work that has Erickson's fingerprints,

846
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.930
all the,
all over it.
Let me give you an example,
and I wrote about this.

847
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:04.520
So if you want to see the details is that,
you know,
dilbert.com and my blog,
but,

848
00:51:04.521 --> 00:51:05.354
uh,

849
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:10.360
take the debate where he came in as the under prepared buffoon who is going to

850
00:51:10.911 --> 00:51:15.680
blow himself up.
And Megan Kelly of Fox News decided that yes,

851
00:51:15.681 --> 00:51:19.390
that's exactly what was going to happen.
And she started right out with the,
uh,

852
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.470
did you say all these bad things about women?

853
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:27.080
Now every other politician would have been smeared off the stage by that because

854
00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.330
it wouldn't matter what he said back,
right.

855
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:32.330
It wouldn't matter what the response was because the question itself,

856
00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:37.370
like it helped me.
Yeah,
the question is the content.
All right.

857
00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:40.910
The logic of the answer,
the,
you know,
maybe somebody said,

858
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:43.130
oh that was taken out of context or whatever,

859
00:51:43.131 --> 00:51:45.440
which is what people usually say and it usually is.

860
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.830
I mean that's actually usually true,
but the,
the public isn't going to hear that.

861
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:53.570
They're just going to hear the feeling that they felt when Megan Kelly said that

862
00:51:53.571 --> 00:51:58.070
person's name bad to women and let us really liked the beginning and the end of

863
00:51:58.071 --> 00:52:02.090
the thinking for,
you know,
let's say at least 20% of the public,

864
00:52:02.091 --> 00:52:07.070
right about the same 20% that can easily be hypnotized coincidentally.
So,

865
00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:10.370
but what did Trump do?
As soon as that question came up,
he sent my,

866
00:52:10.371 --> 00:52:15.371
interrupted her and he said only Rosie O'donnell that my friends is hypnosis.

867
00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:21.470
He took an anchor that everybody can visualize and his core audience already had

868
00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:23.720
a negative impression.
They're negative.

869
00:52:23.721 --> 00:52:27.980
Impression of Rosie O'donnell almost certainly was bigger,
stronger,

870
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:32.180
and visual and more important than whatever Megan Kelly just said,

871
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:36.860
which should have been a full house.
I mean,
she,
she,

872
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.420
she showed him for kings and he beat her hand and he did it without even trying.

873
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:44.450
And he did it with a method which is well understood,
right?

874
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.300
This is a negotiating technique.
You know,
you throw it out an anchor,

875
00:52:47.301 --> 00:52:51.860
you divert everybody.
And so instead of becoming this,
you know,
sexist,

876
00:52:51.861 --> 00:52:55.340
which he could have been on day one,
he became the straight talker.
He's the guy,

877
00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:55.910
he and,

878
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:59.360
and he admitted in the very next sentence that he'd also said bad things about

879
00:52:59.361 --> 00:53:03.860
other women.
See,
he has some really interesting,
oh,

880
00:53:03.861 --> 00:53:07.790
but wait,
go ahead.
Go ahead.
Wait.
There.
There's a better part.
It gets better.

881
00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:10.820
I'm ready now.
I know you follow the headlines.
So you know what happened next?

882
00:53:10.821 --> 00:53:14.840
Roger Ailes and Fox News.
Um,
you know,
Wade in say like,

883
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:19.070
we're going to need to make peace,
right,
with Donald Trump because,
um,
you know,

884
00:53:19.071 --> 00:53:22.460
this is getting out of hand and Donald Trump made peace with them.

885
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:25.010
How do you interpret that?
I'll tell you how I interpreted it.

886
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:30.080
I interpret it as Donald Trump just bought fox news without paying a frikken

887
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:34.230
penny because if he wants that,
if they want him to appear on his show,

888
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.080
that's up to him.
And he just proved he doesn't need him.

889
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.810
So he's going to get all the press he was without Fox News.

890
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.200
If they want to get out of the program and support the guy who is probably going

891
00:53:43.201 --> 00:53:45.440
to be the nominee,
that's,
that's what I've predicted.
Um,

892
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.410
because of his knee hypnosis skills in particular having nothing to do with his

893
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:52.080
policies.
By the way,
I'll get to that.
I,
you know,
I'm not a,

894
00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:56.190
not a fan of the policies,
but I don't think he is either.
You just,
you know,

895
00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:59.550
they're opening,
negotiating gambits as,
as he does.

896
00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:05.040
So he effectively,
um,
change the debate,
became the straight talker,

897
00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:09.720
took control of Fox News all in one day.
And all of that is straight out of,

898
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.990
you know,
the hypnotist playbook,
although it's,
you know,

899
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.540
he would call it persuasion.
He might call it negotiating.

900
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:19.600
He literally wrote the book,
the art of the deal.
Let me show you this to again.

901
00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:22.410
So you see the pattern.
So if you saw his immigration plan,

902
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.360
that's like the most ridiculous thing in the world.

903
00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:28.500
It's like they'll all the giant fence make Mexico pay for it as if they want to

904
00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:29.334
do that.

905
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:33.810
Round up 11 million Mexicans who have been in the country for a loyal and

906
00:54:33.811 --> 00:54:36.950
sending it back,
change the constitution to get rid of the birthright.
All right,

907
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.560
I'm saying it with my mock invoice,
but um,
you know,

908
00:54:40.561 --> 00:54:45.000
then I'm going to reverse it around and tell you that if you,
if,

909
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:47.160
if you evaluate him as a politician,

910
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:50.400
which is what the political writers are all doing incorrectly right now,

911
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:54.510
that's the most ridiculous bag of shit anybody ever proposed to the country

912
00:54:54.511 --> 00:54:57.480
because as no chance of happening in that form,
right?

913
00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:00.810
It's just not going to happen.
But is not a politician.

914
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:05.130
He's a businessman and he say have the test and he just gave you an anchor.

915
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:09.690
And his anchor is,
look at what I'm going to do.
Everybody get excited.

916
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.730
Let's talk about changing the constitution.

917
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:14.880
Let's talk about the cost and the and the heartbreak and the,

918
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:18.480
and the misery that would cause to these 11 million people.
I'm planning to.

919
00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:20.400
I'm proposing we kick out of the country.

920
00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.740
Let's talk about how expensive that fence is.

921
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.580
And then when he gets to negotiate with Congress,
guess what?
It gives off.

922
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:30.570
He gives away,
cause the only thing he wanted was the fence,
right?

923
00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:36.150
The only thing he wanted was the fence.
But can you say in your plan,

924
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:40.050
I'm going to give everybody a free pass after we build the fence.
No,

925
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:43.080
because that makes it immigration explode for the 10 years that takes you to

926
00:55:43.081 --> 00:55:46.830
build a fence.
So you have to get there.
The way he got there,

927
00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.690
and it's a way a businessman would do it.

928
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:51.120
You come in with this ridiculous first offer.

929
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.060
You'd make all the idiots in the media who think is a politician,

930
00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:57.750
even though he screams of these dot.
I mean he wrote a book on this stuff.

931
00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:00.840
You know,
it was a number,
I think it was a number one bestseller,
right?

932
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:05.990
He could not be more clear or more honest about what he's doing as he does it,

933
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:11.130
but it's still visible because you're looking at him as a politician and saying,

934
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.760
if his goal is to do this thing as a stupid goal,

935
00:56:14.761 --> 00:56:17.070
he's not going to kick out an 11 million people.
Nobody's going to,

936
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:20.700
nobody's going to go for that.
That's not the game and will never be in the game.

937
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.370
I almost guarantee you that if he gets approval to build the fence,

938
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:28.510
you'll probably get some Mexican funding now.
Completely that an enough,

939
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:32.260
it'll be enough to say,
look,
nobody else was even good.
Ask for half.
Right.

940
00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:35.080
All right,
I got you.
Half of is paid for.
If he does that,

941
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:39.130
people that are going to wet their pants,
right,
and then he's going to say,

942
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.580
I guarantee it.
I guarantee you.

943
00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:44.050
He's going to say then now this imagines he gets nominated and becomes president

944
00:56:44.051 --> 00:56:47.950
and so I guess I can't guarantee anything,
but,
but if it got to the situation,

945
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.600
the likely outcome would be that you'd say,
look,
yeah,
that 11 million people.

946
00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:54.490
Yeah,
I guess it would be hard to round them up.

947
00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:58.300
Why don't we say that if you stay in a jail for x number of years,

948
00:56:58.301 --> 00:57:03.160
you pay your taxes,
you register,
you do some useful things that,
uh,

949
00:57:03.161 --> 00:57:04.090
you know,
uh,

950
00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:07.510
we'll make an exception in your case just for practicality because that's what a

951
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:11.590
business person does.
And by the way,
I've got my fence built now.

952
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.790
My brand brand America is exclusive for the first time.

953
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:20.050
And that's why you hired me.
You hired me to be a brand manager in a hire me to,

954
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:25.000
you know,
to tell the truth on my first offer.
You offered me to negotiate.

955
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:25.501
He's,

956
00:57:25.501 --> 00:57:29.620
he's literally running for the office of negotiator in chief and practicing his

957
00:57:29.621 --> 00:57:33.790
craft.
And he's doing it with such brilliance that I've,
I've literally,

958
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:36.850
I don't think I've ever seen anybody do it this well except,
oh,

959
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:40.660
I can think of one other person.
Um,
let's see.
Um,

960
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:45.400
there was Bill Clinton who also is a good friends of Tony Robbins.

961
00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:50.540
<v 0>I love the web.
It's like six,
six degrees of Kevin Bacon.
Yeah.</v>

962
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:54.350
<v 2>Yeah.
And by the way,
and so I'll say this at the end cause I went on for awhile.</v>

963
00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:58.700
Uh,
I'm not suggesting that there's a grand conspiracy there.
Um,

964
00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:02.600
it's a fact that all those things are connected.
That doesn't mean that you know,

965
00:58:02.601 --> 00:58:05.720
the,
the influences running through them in some one way direction.

966
00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:08.150
Like I described,
if you use as a,

967
00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:13.070
as a possible one of your filters to explain what's going on with the Trump

968
00:58:13.071 --> 00:58:15.590
campaign,
I just read it in the news,

969
00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:20.360
a writer saying essentially nobody understands why he's rising in the polls.

970
00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.400
And I'm saying exactly.
And you won't understand either.

971
00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:29.010
<v 0>Yeah.
I think it's also hard sometimes for people,</v>

972
00:58:29.011 --> 00:58:31.650
particularly in the day to day news cycle,

973
00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:36.680
just the churn of constant noise with the hours that need to be sold on TV and

974
00:58:37.051 --> 00:58:40.800
pages that need to be filled in newspapers that you need attention.
Right?

975
00:58:40.801 --> 00:58:45.450
It's kind of like the,
the um,
Glen Gary,
Glen Ross,
Alec Baldwin,
you know,

976
00:58:45.451 --> 00:58:50.100
always be closing speech with the like,
attention,
interest,
desire,
action.

977
00:58:50.101 --> 00:58:51.790
Like you have to have the attention first and,

978
00:58:51.791 --> 00:58:53.570
and Donald Trump is very good at doing that.
The,

979
00:58:53.571 --> 00:58:58.200
the other technique that I'd never seen,
and he uses it all the time,

980
00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:00.150
but it doesn't seem to lose its efficacy.

981
00:59:00.151 --> 00:59:05.151
It's one of these sort of guilty until proven innocent approaches or it's a

982
00:59:05.161 --> 00:59:09.630
retort,
uh,
which is he'll say,
check your facts.

983
00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:10.430
Next question.

984
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:15.430
And so with any journalists and it throws them off balance just enough cause

985
00:59:15.751 --> 00:59:18.930
they're like,
oh shit.
Like did my researchers miss,
you know,

986
00:59:18.931 --> 00:59:22.160
the one citation that refuted everything that I'm actually

987
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.570
<v 3>laying on this particular person.
And so whether it's,
uh,
you know,</v>

988
00:59:26.571 --> 00:59:30.170
Matt Lauer or anyone else would be like,
Matt,
check your facts.
Next question.

989
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:35.270
And it's just,
they're as good as dead.
It's one of those,
it's,
it's,

990
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:39.620
it's brilliant and it's in,
in a way,
and that's not to say that I would want,

991
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:44.480
you know,
Donald Trump running the country,
but it's,
I do admire the,
the,

992
00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:48.560
so the Ringman ship,
let me,
let me wait on that for a moment.

993
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:53.630
Look how many ways that could have been done incorrectly.
Suppose he simply said,

994
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:57.760
Matt,
your facts are wrong.
That's right.
Totally.
Totally.
Doesn't work.

995
00:59:57.761 --> 01:00:02.070
Totally different.
Yeah,
totally different.
Check your facts is what I call the,
uh,

996
01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:06.050
the high ground maneuver,
which I also write about.
Um,
it's the same thing.

997
01:00:06.051 --> 01:00:10.760
Jobs did what he explained to way antennagate just by saying all smartphones

998
01:00:10.761 --> 01:00:13.850
have problems.
Um,
we're trying to make our customers happy.

999
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:17.030
He made a national story go away.
And uh,

1000
01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:20.050
less than 30 seconds with those two sentences,
uh,

1001
01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.250
be took the high ground and everybody said,
oh,
wait a minute,

1002
01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.190
we've been talking about you.
Well,
yeah,
I guess,
I guess that's just got a normal,

1003
01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:28.190
when you think about smart phones and I'm sure glad I have a smart phone.

1004
01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:30.860
So I guess that's just normal.
So what Trump dud,

1005
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:33.110
if you said your facts are wrong,

1006
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.610
then he set the world Matt Lauer Against Donald Trump and anybody who like Matt

1007
01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:39.860
Lauer better than Donald Trump,
the other go to side with them.

1008
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.190
But instead he said,
check your facts.
He said,

1009
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:45.440
I'm a person with more information,

1010
01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.650
which actually seems pretty consistent because like it says world,
right?

1011
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.460
Like we were talking about his facts.
It's not Matt Lauer's facts.

1012
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:55.460
Matt Lauer's guy who studied up 10 minutes before the interview.

1013
01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.450
So you say you say that to me and I just laugh and say,
okay,

1014
01:00:59.451 --> 01:01:03.080
I don't know what the truth is here,
Donald,
but probably you're right,
right.

1015
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:06.200
It's just brilliant.
It's really,
really clever.

1016
01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.850
I want to shift gears just for a second because I love this type of

1017
01:01:10.851 --> 01:01:15.851
deconstruction and I'd love to chat a little bit about goals versus systems and

1018
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:24.370
just to hear you perhaps talk about some of how you think about your life in

1019
01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:27.650
those terms or not.
Yes.
Um,

1020
01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.220
you want me to just jump right in and define those two things?
That'd be,

1021
01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.540
that'd be very helpful.
So the,
um,
was ribbon my book,

1022
01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:38.240
how to fail at almost everything and still win big.

1023
01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.750
And the idea is that if you have a goal,

1024
01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:45.170
I'm goal oriented approach to the world.

1025
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.490
That that's an approach that made perfect sense 200 years ago.

1026
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:54.020
If you were a farmer and you had a simple operation than you thought,

1027
01:01:54.021 --> 01:01:58.160
if you cleared another 10 acres before winter or you could grow more corn,

1028
01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.050
you are almost certainly right.

1029
01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.320
So clearing those 10 acres before winter was a perfectly good goal and it made

1030
01:02:05.571 --> 01:02:10.430
perfect sense to pursue it.
But now,
fast forward.
All right?
It's a,
it's a,

1031
01:02:10.431 --> 01:02:13.940
it's a modern times.
There's probably more technology,

1032
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:18.941
more complexity in your pocket right now and your smartphone than the farmer hat

1033
01:02:19.711 --> 01:02:22.380
and his entire operation.
All right?
Today,

1034
01:02:22.381 --> 01:02:25.590
if you're focused on one thing for more than a minute and a half,

1035
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:29.460
there's a good chance that that thing is no longer worth having.
All right?

1036
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.600
There are people going to school for degrees that won't mean anything even four

1037
01:02:33.601 --> 01:02:36.640
years from now when they retire or when they get to school.
Um,

1038
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.970
so you've got people who were making plans with a clear focus in a world that no

1039
01:02:41.971 --> 01:02:46.050
longer supports a clear path to anything.
So what's the alternative?

1040
01:02:46.051 --> 01:02:48.420
And in a world where you can't,
if you can't predict the future.

1041
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:50.460
And on top of that,

1042
01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:55.710
even if you could predict it and you pick the goal and you marched straight at

1043
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:59.700
it when you got there,
there's a really good chance that you had said,
you know,

1044
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:02.760
I didn't notice there were five other goals that were way better than this one

1045
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:05.610
because they emerged while you were focusing on your goal.
Right?

1046
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:08.790
So if you're not keeping your eye on the and the whole of it,

1047
01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:11.600
and if you're not playing the odds and you're picking a,
you know,

1048
01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:15.150
a moon shot as your way to go through life,
you know,

1049
01:03:15.151 --> 01:03:18.090
you're going to feel like you're failing.
Not only if you miss the mood,

1050
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.870
but you're going to feel like a failure all the way to the moon because you

1051
01:03:21.871 --> 01:03:24.330
haven't gotten the moon yet and you're not quite sure if you're going to get

1052
01:03:24.331 --> 01:03:27.630
there.
So what's better than that?
Um,
and by the way,

1053
01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:31.500
I still recommend goals hardly for simple situations.

1054
01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:33.840
So if you enter a bowling tournament,

1055
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:38.250
your goal list of when the bowling tournament,
right?
It's a simple situation.

1056
01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:42.210
And usually when it's a like a human made a construct,

1057
01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:45.660
they are simplified and therefore a goal.
It makes sense.

1058
01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.160
Here's what may not make sense.
Let's say you said,

1059
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:53.850
my goal is to get my boss's job.
It's a pretty common goal,
right?

1060
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:58.050
That's stupid because your boss's job is just one of the many things that could

1061
01:03:58.051 --> 01:03:59.520
be better than what you're doing now.

1062
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.020
And the chances are there's other way better than that.
Yeah.

1063
01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:05.310
Your boss's boss's job,
for example.
You know,
what are you doing about that?

1064
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.173
You know?
Um,

1065
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.870
how about some job at another company about a lateral move that gets you in a

1066
01:04:09.871 --> 01:04:13.620
better place to go higher later.
You know?
So as soon as you focus,

1067
01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:17.340
you've given yourself something to fail at and you close yourself out from the

1068
01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:19.860
other opportunities.
All right?
So,
um,

1069
01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:24.890
what I write about instead is what I call a systems way of looking at the world

1070
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:30.320
in which you are continually looking at ways to improve your odds in some

1071
01:04:30.451 --> 01:04:34.710
favorable area,
some favorable,
a focus,
you know,

1072
01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:38.430
without being too specific.
Um,
so your area might be,
you know,

1073
01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:43.320
business or art or whatever it is.
Um,
so,

1074
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.640
uh,
the,
the hallmark of a good system is that even as things are failing,

1075
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:52.020
you're still improving your odds and your personal worth.
All right?

1076
01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.310
So if for example,
uh,

1077
01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:58.950
I start up a company and it doesn't work,
I would say,
oh,

1078
01:04:58.951 --> 01:05:02.010
I had a goal and I started that little startup and avail that none of the

1079
01:05:02.011 --> 01:05:02.700
failure.

1080
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:07.700
But if I started a company that was in a field that I already work and um,

1081
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:12.420
let's say making all the contacts that I made through the startup,
uh,

1082
01:05:12.421 --> 01:05:16.440
that networking,
the things I learned made me more valuable in the things,

1083
01:05:16.441 --> 01:05:18.100
you know,
maybe day job or

1084
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:22.710
<v 2>the next job I do.
Then I came out of hat.
So that's the system limit.</v>

1085
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.590
Let me give you a kind of a non business example of that.
Um,

1086
01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:31.330
I had a friend in high school who ordered to have a girlfriend and I wanted to

1087
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:34.870
have a girlfriend,
but he had a,
he had kind of a systems approach.
It.

1088
01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:38.490
I had a goal approach,
my goal approaches,
I'd pick out the,
uh,

1089
01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:41.470
the prettiest looking girl in my class.
And I'd say,
this,

1090
01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:45.250
this girl must be by girlfriend.
I will do everything I can to make this happen,

1091
01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.320
not do my research.
I'm figuring out who her friends were,

1092
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.770
where I can hang out and,
and,
you know,

1093
01:05:50.771 --> 01:05:54.700
it might take me months and at the end of it,
it usually ended this way,
right.

1094
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:58.690
She'd say,
you know,
one of two things.
Either she had a boyfriend,

1095
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:03.340
so I've wasted three months.
Or she'd say,
I don't like you,

1096
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:09.490
then I've wasted three months.
But every once in a while she'd say,
Hey,
you know,

1097
01:06:09.491 --> 01:06:12.130
this didn't happen often.
But once in a while she'd say,

1098
01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:17.680
I have a boyfriend and I don't like you.
So that was my experience with Lego.

1099
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:22.450
So by my friend,
even if I didn't have a boyfriend.
Right?

1100
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:26.560
Um,
so

1101
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:31.990
my best story of rejection in seventh grade was asking the prettiest girl,
uh,

1102
01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:36.870
the dance the first time ever asked somebody to slow dance.
And she said,
uh,

1103
01:06:36.871 --> 01:06:39.730
you know,
it's too hot.
I'd rather not.
And I said,

1104
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:43.630
perhaps if you took off your down winter jacket.
And she said,

1105
01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:48.250
um,
and I'm also too tired.
All right.
So,
so that,
that was,

1106
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.400
that was by dating experience in high school.
That was a goal oriented approach.

1107
01:06:51.401 --> 01:06:54.130
Right.
So my friend Mandwell,
he had a different approach.

1108
01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.420
He had a systems approach.

1109
01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:59.560
He would simply go wherever there were plenty of girls and he would ask them in

1110
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:04.360
order of descending,
descending order of looks,
will you be my girlfriend?

1111
01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:07.840
And or some version of that.
Of course,
almost everybody said no.

1112
01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.520
Now you're probably thinking,
oh,

1113
01:07:09.521 --> 01:07:11.710
you're telling me the old story about keep trying,
you know,

1114
01:07:11.711 --> 01:07:15.070
get back on the horse.
I'm not telling you that story at all.
I'm telling you,

1115
01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:17.920
he was learning a skill while I was wasting my time.

1116
01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.430
That guy knows how to approach strangers.
He knows what works,
what doesn't.

1117
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.300
He's got a thicker skin.
Um,
and he also had a lot of girlfriends,

1118
01:07:25.301 --> 01:07:28.270
so he was learning a lot that way as well.
But so,
so he,

1119
01:07:28.271 --> 01:07:31.090
he was failing in a way that puts them ahead no matter what happened.

1120
01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:33.010
I was failing in a way that didn't put me ahead.

1121
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:36.550
It just made me feel like a loser and probably put me behind for the next time.

1122
01:07:36.551 --> 01:07:41.500
I want her to feel confident in front of someone else.
Um,

1123
01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:42.580
so,

1124
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:47.530
and I can give you more examples from say fitness and diet because I know some

1125
01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:50.320
people have asked about that,
but they leave.
They would love to hear this.

1126
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:52.520
Definitely.
So A,

1127
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:56.770
a goal oriented approach and let's say a diet would be,

1128
01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:02.590
I want to lose 10 pounds and I'm going to do it with my willpower.

1129
01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.600
I'm going to keep those cookies out of my mouth.

1130
01:08:04.601 --> 01:08:07.840
I'm going to put the fork down and I'm going to push away from the table or I'm

1131
01:08:07.841 --> 01:08:11.170
just going to try harder because whiteness quiet right now.

1132
01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:14.740
Everybody who's been alive for more than 10 minutes knows that that can work in

1133
01:08:14.741 --> 01:08:16.160
the short run,
but it just

1134
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.500
<v 3>doesn't work in the long run.
You need something else assessed them.</v>

1135
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:25.640
So here's a system that I've been using that has me in the best shape of my life

1136
01:08:25.641 --> 01:08:30.200
at 58 and uses no willpower or whatsoever.
I eat whatever I want,

1137
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:35.030
whenever I want to.
It's just that,
ah,
my system is education.

1138
01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.810
I go out of my way.
If I see an article that says new thing,
uh,

1139
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.250
discovered about the link between this food that most of that I can ignore.

1140
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:47.330
But every once in a while you see something that says,
um,
you know,
he just,
uh,

1141
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:51.290
eat more protein and less of those simple carbs.
Uh,
good things will happen.

1142
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:53.060
And you say,
okay,
I already knew that one.

1143
01:08:53.190 --> 01:08:57.170
How deep does this knowledge thing go and how much difference does it make?
Well,

1144
01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:59.450
uh,
let me,
let me give you an example.

1145
01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:04.040
Say you and I go to the salad bar and um,
it's a terrible salad bar.

1146
01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:09.170
All there is is a white potato,
plain russet potato and some plain pasta.

1147
01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:12.680
And we're both trying to watch our weight.
All right.
What do you get?

1148
01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:16.910
Do you get the potato or the pasta?
Now I asked this question in life,
uh,

1149
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:20.330
crowds and it's about evenly split it to half the people,

1150
01:09:20.331 --> 01:09:23.690
but mostly people don't know.
There's only a few people in the whole room.

1151
01:09:23.730 --> 01:09:26.360
We even know the answer and the answer is actually really clear.

1152
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:30.590
It turns out that the put the white potato as opposed to the sweet potatoes that

1153
01:09:30.591 --> 01:09:33.920
are not bad,
the white potato has a terrible glycaemic index.

1154
01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:36.290
The pasta probably should,

1155
01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:40.100
but there's something about the way it processes that isn't fully understood

1156
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:41.870
that it just does.
So,
you know,

1157
01:09:41.871 --> 01:09:45.140
pasta isn't the best food in the world if you're trying to look into watch your

1158
01:09:45.141 --> 01:09:48.830
weight.
But if you had no choice of only those two,
I pick the pasta.

1159
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:52.280
You picked a potato,
you're struggling with your willpower,

1160
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:55.490
eating like crazy and then having a good time.
Because I've only,

1161
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.820
I've learned which foods I can eat like crazy and uh,

1162
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:03.710
not stimulate cravings.
So if I eat the simple carbs for lunch,

1163
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:07.080
I know I'm just going to be hungrier later.
I've learned that,
um,

1164
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:11.090
sometimes sleep pretends to be the same feeling as hunger.

1165
01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.900
So if I haven't slept,
I say,
oh,
I'm not really hungry and stop eating.
You know,

1166
01:10:14.901 --> 01:10:19.901
I need to either take a nap or I can eat some peanuts because I've read and I've

1167
01:10:20.871 --> 01:10:23.720
experienced this.
I know it's true that if he had fat things,

1168
01:10:23.721 --> 01:10:25.880
they have a lot of calories and that parts great.

1169
01:10:25.881 --> 01:10:27.230
Maybe if you tried to watch your weight,

1170
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:31.310
but they have such a good impact on reducing your,
uh,

1171
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:33.770
your cravings because fat's good at doing that.

1172
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:36.170
They will make up for it in long run.
And by the way,

1173
01:10:36.171 --> 01:10:39.560
it's full of protein and goodness and you know,
it's not bad to you peanuts.

1174
01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:44.960
So the other thing I do is a process to avoid using willpower is that it would

1175
01:10:44.961 --> 01:10:48.390
be impossible for me I think to stop eating.
Um,

1176
01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:51.650
both the quantity that I want to eat.
You know,
the food,

1177
01:10:51.651 --> 01:10:54.560
cause sometimes you just gotta shovel a lot in your face.
You just,
you know,

1178
01:10:54.561 --> 01:10:57.920
you just got to eat a lot and sometimes you want to eat the thing you want to

1179
01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:00.770
eat.
So sometimes it's about the flavor and the taste and sometimes it's,
yeah,

1180
01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:01.613
just need a lot of food.

1181
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:05.750
So I allow myself to have a lot of food anytime I want that.

1182
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:07.160
I don't put any control on that.

1183
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:11.750
I just make sure that it's the kind of food you can eat forever and you know,

1184
01:11:11.751 --> 01:11:14.100
you're not regretted.
Uh,
you know,
it's could

1185
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:18.600
<v 2>be salads and yogurts and fruits and vegetables,
mostly raw stuff.</v>

1186
01:11:18.601 --> 01:11:20.850
And if I think I'm overdoing it a little bit.
Dot.

1187
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:25.670
I'll throw in some peanuts or some,
uh,
you know,
roasted,
uh,

1188
01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:29.940
you know,
creamed almonds or something.
And you are a vegetarian.
Is that,

1189
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:30.510
is that right?

1190
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:35.510
Or have you have been mostly I tried to introduce fish that my diet,

1191
01:11:36.121 --> 01:11:38.910
but I'm having a hard time with it cause I can't,
I can't get past the,

1192
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:43.740
the icky factor.
Um,
that's just personal.
I liked it.
I just can't get past it.

1193
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.830
So in my case,
I use zero willpower,
right?

1194
01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:52.110
And one by one I have picked off things at which were problem cravings such as

1195
01:11:52.111 --> 01:11:56.430
diet coke.
I was drinking,
I somewhere between 10 and 20 a day.

1196
01:11:56.431 --> 01:12:00.520
I think of Diet for years,
30 years probably.
Uh,

1197
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:01.890
now if I said to myself,

1198
01:12:01.891 --> 01:12:05.250
today's the day I'm going to go on a healthy eating diet and diet coke was just

1199
01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:09.150
one of the 45 things I was depriving myself off,

1200
01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:12.210
it would be pretty tough.
But instead I say to myself,

1201
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:15.300
I could eat everything I want all day long.
I get a drink,
whatever I want,

1202
01:12:15.301 --> 01:12:19.200
as long as that's on the good list,
there's just one thing I can't do today.

1203
01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:22.110
Just one thing,
right?
And still thinks a little willpower.

1204
01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:26.610
But I noticed that after about a month or so,
two months really to be cleaned,

1205
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.990
the craving goes away.
And today,
you know,
a couple of years later,

1206
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.280
I look at a diet coke and it's actually hard to wrap my head around the thought

1207
01:12:35.281 --> 01:12:36.930
that I would want to put that in my body.

1208
01:12:36.931 --> 01:12:39.240
It's just looks like a total bunch of chemicals.

1209
01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.800
So cravings can be completely managed if you,

1210
01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.340
if you isolate them and pick them out of the herd and you know,

1211
01:12:47.341 --> 01:12:51.170
don't put too much of a willpower burden on yourself at the same time.
Now,

1212
01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:54.570
the downside of course is this,
the stakes,
you know,
several years instead of,

1213
01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:54.720
you know,

1214
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.080
everybody wants to lose 10 pounds in a month and I don't have any solution for

1215
01:12:58.081 --> 01:13:02.410
you if you,
if you know,
if that's what you want to do.
Now having said all this,

1216
01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.960
I'll also say that everybody's different.

1217
01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:09.270
And my good friend and startup partner,
uh,
uh,
Quinn Harker,

1218
01:13:09.271 --> 01:13:11.910
he will run a marathon and you know,

1219
01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:16.050
go ride his bike and go for a swim after that iron man.
And for him,

1220
01:13:16.051 --> 01:13:19.560
the challenge and the pain and the willpower is actually part of the attraction.

1221
01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:23.800
Right?
So that's,
that's part of what it brings it to them.
So it's no,
no surprise.

1222
01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:28.090
His weight is perfect.
Yes.
Keep in mind that whatever you hear from me,

1223
01:13:28.091 --> 01:13:31.680
it doesn't apply to everybody.
Um,
so the,
the other part of the system is finding,

1224
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:35.160
experimenting continually.
And I know you're into this,
um,

1225
01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:38.070
experimenting and trying to isolate one thing and saying,
okay,

1226
01:13:38.071 --> 01:13:41.040
I do this for a week.
Did that make any difference than anything?

1227
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:46.880
<v 0>Absolutely.
I mean the tracking and it's when it's,
you underscore a few things.</v>

1228
01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:49.200
The first is that,
uh,

1229
01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:54.220
you have become better identifying alternate causes for say hunger,

1230
01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:59.150
right?
You didn't sleep enough,
et cetera.
And for instance,

1231
01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:04.370
many people who cuts refined carbohydrates and starchy carbohydrates from your

1232
01:14:04.371 --> 01:14:06.950
diet will feel like they want carbs,

1233
01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:10.490
whereas in fact they're just dehydrated because when you cut carbohydrates,

1234
01:14:10.491 --> 01:14:11.500
you retain water.

1235
01:14:11.501 --> 01:14:16.501
So very simple fix for a lot of people is to put some sea salt or sprinkle a

1236
01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:21.220
little salt into their drinking water,
uh,
just into a few cups a day,

1237
01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:25.690
which then eradicates these types of carb cravings about branch chain amino

1238
01:14:25.691 --> 01:14:29.860
acids could do the same thing sometimes,
but the,
uh,
the,
just to touch on the,

1239
01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:34.240
the goals versus systems.
So I find for myself that I approach it in a,

1240
01:14:34.241 --> 01:14:36.370
in a very similar way.

1241
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:40.090
And I'd love to ask you about your MBA program in a second,
but when I,

1242
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:43.780
I decided I would not go to an MBA program,

1243
01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:48.160
but I had fantasized about going to Stanford GSB,
uh,

1244
01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:50.980
graduate school of business for many,
many,
many years.

1245
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.490
And I always thought that was kind of where I was,
I should have gone Undergrad,

1246
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:57.310
et cetera.
And uh,
at the,

1247
01:14:57.311 --> 01:15:00.910
at the end of it decided that I would take what that would have cost over two

1248
01:15:00.911 --> 01:15:04.390
years and invest in startup investments.
This was in 2007,

1249
01:15:04.391 --> 01:15:09.391
right after the four hour workweek had come out and decided that I,

1250
01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:14.350
I would,
I would invest based on the assumption that I would lose it all,

1251
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.950
but that I would try to optimize for skill acquisition.

1252
01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.940
<v 3>Yeah.
There you go.
There you go.</v>

1253
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:23.080
<v 0>And so when I make decisions these days,</v>

1254
01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.370
whether it's a TV show or the four hour chef and trying new distribution with

1255
01:15:27.371 --> 01:15:31.780
Amazon,
even if everything goes sideways,
I try to stack the deck.

1256
01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:35.800
And usually that's kind of the WHO,
what,
where,
why.

1257
01:15:35.801 --> 01:15:39.940
And when rundown,
like a journalist,
I'll be like,
who am I doing this right?

1258
01:15:39.941 --> 01:15:43.150
Let me optimize the people I'm interacting with so that I can acquire as many

1259
01:15:43.151 --> 01:15:46.360
skills or abilities as possible.
Uh,
you know,
when and where,

1260
01:15:46.361 --> 01:15:49.480
if I can be a novel environment.
So let me try to optimize for that,
et cetera.

1261
01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:51.790
So that I'll have this goal.

1262
01:15:51.791 --> 01:15:54.760
And it's usually a big audition audacious goal of sometime,

1263
01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.870
even if that feels like the four hour chef was boycotted by almost every

1264
01:15:58.871 --> 01:16:03.550
retailer on the planet because it came out of Amazon publishing and I was

1265
01:16:03.551 --> 01:16:05.890
prepared for that,
uh,

1266
01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:09.700
and that then allowed me to do experiments with bit torrent and so on.

1267
01:16:09.701 --> 01:16:13.570
So I came out of it not entirely happy with missing the goal.

1268
01:16:13.571 --> 01:16:15.820
Of course I'm very competitive,
but the,

1269
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:20.340
there were skills that then carried over to future projects.
So I,
I,

1270
01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:24.520
I also view sort of my decisions in a very,

1271
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.680
very similar way.
Not to say it's the only way,

1272
01:16:26.681 --> 01:16:29.230
but I find having both to be very helpful for me.

1273
01:16:29.610 --> 01:16:30.670
<v 3>Yeah.
I would,
I would,
uh,</v>

1274
01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:34.990
kind of summarize that by saying that the product is always yourself.
Right,

1275
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:38.730
right,
right.
As soon as you lose sight of that,
that you're,
um,

1276
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:42.780
you're working a 14 hour day,
you're sacrificing your health.
I mean,

1277
01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:44.190
you probably did all those things too,

1278
01:16:44.191 --> 01:16:49.050
but the path is to do less of that and take care of your health and maximize

1279
01:16:49.051 --> 01:16:50.010
your,
your instrument.

1280
01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:55.350
<v 0>What,
uh,
what was the first time you were paid for Dilbert?</v>

1281
01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:57.750
Like received payment for Dilbert?

1282
01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:03.800
<v 3>Um,
it was after being syndicated and then waiting several months for the,</v>

1283
01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:05.030
um,

1284
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:10.030
the accounting to work through the system and that probably 1989,

1285
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:14.330
1989 I got,
I'm just having trouble doing the math here.

1286
01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.300
Roughly how old were you at the time?
Let's see.
Oh,

1287
01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.970
are we going to do math in public?
But that is a social,

1288
01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:27.230
so you were like 30,
late thirties,
I think the,
is that right?
Early,
early,

1289
01:17:27.231 --> 01:17:30.670
early thirties,
early thirties.
And were you at,
uh,

1290
01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:33.140
PAC bell at the time or had you already left?

1291
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:38.410
I was at pack bell and stayed there after Dilbert was in newspapers for about

1292
01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:43.670
eight years.
Well,
I stayed there for several years after Dilbert,

1293
01:17:43.671 --> 01:17:44.720
but eight years in total.

1294
01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.320
And was was that surely to get the income from cartooning to a point where you

1295
01:17:53.361 --> 01:17:55.770
could,
you could,
uh,

1296
01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:00.050
you could survive on that or were there other reasons that you stayed at that

1297
01:18:00.051 --> 01:18:04.400
job for,
for eight years?
I hate to say skill acquisition,

1298
01:18:04.401 --> 01:18:09.260
but that's really a big part of the answer.
I was working in the technology lab,

1299
01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:12.830
um,
you know,
in those years when the Internet was new,

1300
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:17.270
literally the first person I knew who heard the word Internet,
you know,

1301
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:20.210
outside of my work friends.
Um,

1302
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:23.550
so we were learning things that I knew had,
you know,

1303
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.740
huge impact on my future and I didn't want to kind of lose that,
that foot in it.

1304
01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:28.490
Uh,

1305
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:32.510
and that actually became critical for the success of Dilbert later cause Dilbert

1306
01:18:32.511 --> 01:18:36.560
became the first syndicated comic on the Internet back when that seemed like a

1307
01:18:36.561 --> 01:18:39.680
silly idea.
So someone was at,
but,
uh,

1308
01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:42.500
what I say skills acquisition that I'm counting on the fact that I was getting

1309
01:18:42.501 --> 01:18:47.501
most of my fodder for the cartoon from my actual experiences and what coworkers

1310
01:18:47.781 --> 01:18:51.380
were suggesting.
So I had that going.
But,
um,
yes,
I mean,
I,

1311
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:55.400
I waited until I knew I could do it financially,

1312
01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:59.750
but it continued weighted waiting long after that because of the skill

1313
01:18:59.751 --> 01:19:04.751
acquisition and also because the pain of working completely goes away when you

1314
01:19:05.211 --> 01:19:09.110
don't need to do it.
Right.
It's like a,

1315
01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:10.790
it's like dealing with a small children,
right?
It's,

1316
01:19:10.791 --> 01:19:13.630
it's as long as you're not forcing them to do something,
uh,

1317
01:19:13.770 --> 01:19:17.980
the likelihood of it happening goes,
goes way up.
But,
but think of,
you know,

1318
01:19:17.981 --> 01:19:22.580
just the simple example where in the real world will real work world.

1319
01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:27.560
I'll say,
I'm going to try doing x.
Oh my God,
if x doesn't work,
my career,

1320
01:19:27.561 --> 01:19:32.390
my promotions by everything.
But now,
but after I didn't need to be there.

1321
01:19:32.391 --> 01:19:35.270
I could just say that.
What's better?
X or y x,

1322
01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.690
your mind is free.
Yeah,
no,
it's,
uh,
it's,
it's,

1323
01:19:41.691 --> 01:19:45.470
I think something that is commonly misinterpreted with say,

1324
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:47.420
some of the writing that I've done is people are like,
oh,

1325
01:19:47.421 --> 01:19:51.530
I should just quit everything and throw hail Mary and sort of jump off the cliff

1326
01:19:51.531 --> 01:19:54.730
and learn to fly on the way down.
And I'm like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
They keep,

1327
01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:59.270
you can keep your,
keep your current Gig,
do this on the weekends,

1328
01:19:59.271 --> 01:20:03.440
do this early in the morning,
uh,
moonlight.

1329
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:05.840
And then you can decide where on the spectrum you want to be,

1330
01:20:05.841 --> 01:20:08.100
whether you want to have both jobs.
You were wanting to do one

1331
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.060
<v 0>20% of the time,</v>

1332
01:20:09.061 --> 01:20:13.530
but there's no need to sort of put all of your eggs in one basket right at the

1333
01:20:13.531 --> 01:20:16.950
outset.
What was dog barks?
Original name.

1334
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.180
<v 3>So before dog Burt was published,
uh,</v>

1335
01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.790
he was a doodle that I would draw on my whiteboard in my cubicle at Pacific Bell

1336
01:20:26.791 --> 01:20:31.791
and before that at the Crocker National Bank and I had a no contest.

1337
01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:36.870
The name,
the characters.
And uh,
the name Gilbert was named by a friend of mine,

1338
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.970
Mike Goodwin,
who didn't know,

1339
01:20:38.971 --> 01:20:43.971
he had seen it in a world war two cartoon that was at the same name,

1340
01:20:44.851 --> 01:20:48.180
Dilbert.
And I found out about that after it got published.

1341
01:20:48.181 --> 01:20:50.220
I wouldn't to use the name,
but it's lucky I did.

1342
01:20:50.221 --> 01:20:52.590
And I guess the original Creator,
uh,

1343
01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:55.140
didn't have a problem with it cause he never contacted me.

1344
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:59.640
But because I had this character Dilbert and he was the type of guy who would be

1345
01:20:59.641 --> 01:21:03.300
a loader and I wanted to give him a dog just so there was somebody to interact

1346
01:21:03.301 --> 01:21:03.680
with.

1347
01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:07.950
And then one of the name of the dog to have some correspondence with Dilbert.

1348
01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:11.420
And so dog Burt's original name was delta.
Okay.

1349
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:16.440
<v 0>Now did he ever made,
did he,</v>

1350
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:21.070
did he ever make it into a strip with the name Dell dog or no,
no.

1351
01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:24.210
<v 3>I wisely decided that was not a good commercial decision.</v>

1352
01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.740
At least offered newspapers cause they're all,
you know,
aggressively rated g.

1353
01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:35.930
<v 0>What's,
uh,
what aspects of Dilbert changed,</v>

1354
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.350
uh,

1355
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:41.060
besides that in the sort of gestational period or when you were testing out new

1356
01:21:41.061 --> 01:21:42.680
characters on the white board and so on?

1357
01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:49.200
<v 3>Well,
in the beginning their characters or I'm not really formed.</v>

1358
01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:50.521
So you know,

1359
01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:53.610
you've got an idea who they are and maybe you're thinking of somebody else,

1360
01:21:53.611 --> 01:21:57.840
what do you write it?
But over time they become,
um,
some part of me,
you know,

1361
01:21:57.841 --> 01:22:01.390
there,
they each represent a different voice of my head.
You know,

1362
01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:06.240
Dilbert's got to the voice of reason.
And,
you know,
the one that you know is uh,

1363
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:09.870
oh,
say he's challenged by,
you know,
he loves a challenge.

1364
01:22:09.871 --> 01:22:12.100
He likes fixing things more than the likes.
You know,

1365
01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:16.350
talking to people and social interactions and stuff.
The dog,
Bert is the,

1366
01:22:16.351 --> 01:22:17.760
the evil part of my brain.

1367
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:22.710
The little voice in my head that is saint just the worst things when I made it

1368
01:22:22.711 --> 01:22:26.220
otherwise polite conversation.
And,
you know,
it's the,

1369
01:22:26.221 --> 01:22:28.930
it's the voice that's trying to keep me from not laughing or,

1370
01:22:28.931 --> 01:22:33.240
or forcing me to tell a bad joke suddenly.
So I have a reason to laugh at myself,

1371
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:38.070
really covering up that I'm thinking something horrible.
Uh,
so yeah,

1372
01:22:38.071 --> 01:22:42.840
he's,
he's the worst part of me.
You know,
my Megalomania and my,
you know,

1373
01:22:42.841 --> 01:22:46.500
my,
uh,
lack of regard for other humans,
which,
you know,

1374
01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:49.950
obviously it's an exaggeration.
I've,
I have plenty of regard for other humans,

1375
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:55.380
but not always their intelligence.
So dog,
dog,
it takes that role.

1376
01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:59.340
<v 0>And you've done,
uh,
I mean,
you,</v>

1377
01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:02.890
you've had a massively successful career,
obviously.
Dope.

1378
01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.380
It is done spectacularly well.

1379
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:08.740
I've heard that one of the,

1380
01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:13.690
one of the innovative things you did have many was including your email address

1381
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:16.840
in your panels.
Is that,
uh,

1382
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:21.340
do you think that had a huge impact and what other types of decisions do you

1383
01:23:21.341 --> 01:23:26.341
think helped a Dilbert to become the success that it became?

1384
01:23:26.730 --> 01:23:31.680
<v 2>So there were several key things that happened and this will dovetail back to a</v>

1385
01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:34.440
conversation about luck.
But,
um,

1386
01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:39.210
when we first contemplating putting deliver on the Internet,

1387
01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:44.160
that that in itself looked like a huge risky thing because my god,

1388
01:23:44.161 --> 01:23:47.460
you can't give away your content that we're selling to other people right in

1389
01:23:47.461 --> 01:23:50.400
front of their noses as we're selling it to them.
I mean,
it sounded,

1390
01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:54.980
it sounded crazy that right today it's just as normal business.
Right?
Um,

1391
01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:57.630
but that it seemed like a big risky thing.
Likewise,

1392
01:23:57.810 --> 01:24:02.220
what I decided to see if I could get better user input,
um,

1393
01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:06.990
using the things I'd learned in my Berkeley Mba classes.
Um,

1394
01:24:06.991 --> 01:24:11.160
I did what no cartoonist had ever done before and the sounds know stupid and

1395
01:24:11.161 --> 01:24:13.500
trivial when you say it from today's perspective.

1396
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:16.320
But I opened a channel directly to my customers.

1397
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.680
So normally what happens is the cartoon is write something.

1398
01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.580
It goes to an editor who sends it to an editor at a newspaper who sends it to

1399
01:24:23.581 --> 01:24:25.110
production.
You know,

1400
01:24:25.111 --> 01:24:28.800
newspaper delivery boy gives it to the user who reads it.

1401
01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:32.640
I have no idea what happened after that.
Right.
I don't know if they laughed.

1402
01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.900
Cursed hated me.
So I thought,
well,
I'll do business one oh one.
I mean,

1403
01:24:36.901 --> 01:24:40.650
this is what I should be doing.
It's a business.
It's not art per se.

1404
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:46.550
And so I ran my email address in the margins of the Strip.

1405
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:49.380
A thousands of people started writing to me.

1406
01:24:49.381 --> 01:24:54.120
I was getting thousands of emails a day.
A lot of them said the following.
Uh,

1407
01:24:54.121 --> 01:24:57.300
I don't know any Belize.
Anyone else who has emails?
So I'm writing to you.

1408
01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:03.450
It was literally the dawn of the Internet to give you an idea how early it was

1409
01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.220
in the dawn of the Internet.
My address was my full name,

1410
01:25:07.221 --> 01:25:11.700
scottAdams@aol.com.
Nobody had that Nice.
I mean,

1411
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:15.070
there are six people named Scott Adams in my towns.

1412
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:19.830
Is that the primordial soup of the Internet days?
Right.
So,

1413
01:25:19.831 --> 01:25:23.730
um,
thousands of people wrote in,
but what they said was interesting.

1414
01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:25.410
So,
uh,

1415
01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:29.400
consistently they said when Dilbert is doing his office type things,

1416
01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:31.590
which he actually wasn't doing much in the beginning.

1417
01:25:31.650 --> 01:25:35.700
Mostly he was staying at home and interacting with dog bird going on dates,

1418
01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:37.920
but only once in a while you'd go to the office.

1419
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:43.020
But it turns out people like that the most by far.
And so I pivoted.

1420
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:45.330
So I changed,
delivered into a workplace strip.

1421
01:25:45.331 --> 01:25:49.170
And that was certainly the biggest change.
You know,

1422
01:25:49.171 --> 01:25:50.490
the biggest thing that made a difference.

1423
01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:54.300
The other was putting it on the Internet early when being early to anything made

1424
01:25:54.301 --> 01:25:57.330
a big difference.
And it was the right product to be on the Internet.

1425
01:25:57.810 --> 01:26:02.810
But it also solved our biggest marketing problem with newspapers because our

1426
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:04.130
salesperson

1427
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.820
<v 3>would go into a newspaper and say,
hey,
here's a new thing.
And they'd say,
ah,</v>

1428
01:26:07.821 --> 01:26:10.280
you know,
we don't get it.
We don't care in the old days.

1429
01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:15.520
But once I had literally thousands of email messages saying,

1430
01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:18.710
this is the greatest thing,
why don't you put it in my newspaper,
the,

1431
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:22.340
and then they name the actual newspaper,
I printed them all out.

1432
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:26.990
I collected them by what newspaper they mentioned,
sent them off,
you know,

1433
01:26:26.991 --> 01:26:30.290
physically like printouts to the salespeople.

1434
01:26:30.291 --> 01:26:34.370
And then they walked into the office of the editor and put the printout on their

1435
01:26:34.371 --> 01:26:38.510
desk and the editor said,
okay,
you know,

1436
01:26:38.511 --> 01:26:42.800
for a newspaper if five people ask for something that they've never heard of,

1437
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:45.080
you know,
and it's something that they can easily,
you know,

1438
01:26:45.081 --> 01:26:49.490
for $20 a month they can put it in the newspaper or whatever it is,
you know,

1439
01:26:49.491 --> 01:26:50.270
they're going to do that.

1440
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:54.230
<v 0>It's true with politicians also,
just as a side note for people,
like honestly,</v>

1441
01:26:54.231 --> 01:26:57.230
you get 10 people to call,
uh,
lawmakers office,

1442
01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:59.420
especially if they're not somebody in the news every day.

1443
01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:01.850
It gets a lot of attention.
That's really smart.
Yeah,

1444
01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:05.890
<v 3>yeah,
yeah.
And let me say that about me as well.
I mean I'm,</v>

1445
01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:11.030
I'm a voracious reader of all my feedback on social media as well as email and

1446
01:27:11.031 --> 01:27:15.800
everything else and I've changed a substantial things and the way I approach,

1447
01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:19.700
you know,
Dilbert or other jobs based on,
you know,
one or two emails.

1448
01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.030
<v 0>What,
uh,
what other types of,</v>

1449
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:27.170
<v 3>don't ask me.
Well,
uh,
I'll tell you the,</v>

1450
01:27:27.171 --> 01:27:31.160
the biggest change that,
uh,
uh,
there were actually more emails than that,
a few,

1451
01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:35.900
but it's one that jumps to mind.
When Kapur was originally introduced,

1452
01:27:35.901 --> 01:27:39.050
he was just a cat.
He wasn't meant to be a regular character,

1453
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:42.470
but thousands of people not going to say thousands,

1454
01:27:42.471 --> 01:27:46.740
I'll say probably hundreds of people emailed and said,
we love Cat Bert.

1455
01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:49.010
And what's interesting is he didn't have that name.

1456
01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.450
<v 0>So it's a more,
I mean,
many people said capper,</v>

1457
01:27:55.451 --> 01:27:57.130
but you had not given him that name.

1458
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:58.930
<v 3>Right.
So,</v>

1459
01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.030
so capper now they'll comes out of nothing.
I mean,

1460
01:28:04.031 --> 01:28:07.660
it certainly had no plans to have a,
you know,
a Garfield competitor in that.

1461
01:28:07.661 --> 01:28:10.900
Now I'm stuck.
I'm like,
oh,
they all wanted it,
but what am I going to do with it?

1462
01:28:10.901 --> 01:28:15.430
So I have to now,
I'd moved Dilbert into the office by that time and I'm like,
ah,

1463
01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:17.050
how do I get a cat in the office?

1464
01:28:17.051 --> 01:28:18.760
It's already too much that I've got a dog there.

1465
01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:23.440
And then I realized that a cat's personality fits perfectly with human
resources.

1466
01:28:23.441 --> 01:28:26.980
So I made him the director of resources because you know,
like,

1467
01:28:27.850 --> 01:28:32.260
like a human resources person.
A cat doesn't really care if you live or die.

1468
01:28:32.261 --> 01:28:34.720
He just likes playing with you before it happens.
So,

1469
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:39.540
and uh,
and recently I started working with a,
uh,

1470
01:28:39.730 --> 01:28:44.730
a company called does think HR who does a subscriptions of HR advice,

1471
01:28:45.761 --> 01:28:49.500
I guess my simple accident description.
And,
uh,

1472
01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:52.840
I'm working with them with cat bird as a potential way to get their message out

1473
01:28:52.841 --> 01:28:57.450
there.
So,
uh,
this is a good example of the systems versus the goal.
I mean,

1474
01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:59.830
I certainly didn't start out to have a cat cartoon.

1475
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:03.600
I started out to do a bunch of things.
I introduced a lot of characters.

1476
01:29:03.601 --> 01:29:06.570
I washed to figure out which ones work and I just,
you know,

1477
01:29:06.571 --> 01:29:08.040
put water on the stuff that work.

1478
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:12.660
What are some of the tools that most help you,

1479
01:29:12.810 --> 01:29:17.640
tools or routines that most help you cartoon these days or right for that matter

1480
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:19.320
either.
Oh,
well,

1481
01:29:19.321 --> 01:29:24.320
I use by a Wacom Cintiq for the drawing.
So what that is,
is a,

1482
01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:28.140
a special,
uh,
monitor.
In my case,
it's a really big one.

1483
01:29:28.141 --> 01:29:31.240
I think it's a 27 inches across.
Um,

1484
01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:33.650
and I can draw on it directly with the stylists.
Um,

1485
01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:35.070
much like you had drawn paper,

1486
01:29:35.130 --> 01:29:38.550
although you have to learn new techniques and use Photoshop and you know,

1487
01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:43.540
a lot of different stuff.
So it's just Photoshop at a Syn,
synthetic a walk.

1488
01:29:43.541 --> 01:29:47.310
Um,
and uh,
after that it's a,

1489
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:50.220
I just usually peruse the news,
drink coffee,

1490
01:29:50.221 --> 01:29:55.221
eat my protein bar in the morning and something jumps in my head.

1491
01:29:56.071 --> 01:29:56.820
And if it doesn't,

1492
01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:01.080
maybe I'll read a few email messages that I think we'll have messages or

1493
01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:05.970
suggestions.
Sometimes I'll check the suggestions coming in from various places.

1494
01:30:05.971 --> 01:30:10.410
Usually,
you know,
my,
uh,
I've got,
uh,
an email address just for that,

1495
01:30:10.411 --> 01:30:11.770
that runs in the strip every day.

1496
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:17.390
So some combination of that gives me some kind of an idea or I where I jump off

1497
01:30:17.581 --> 01:30:19.680
of what was the last thing I wrote the day before.

1498
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:23.450
Cause sometimes they lend themselves to a serial treatment.
But I,

1499
01:30:23.451 --> 01:30:28.451
I don't have much of a process beyond being in the right frame of boon frame of

1500
01:30:28.471 --> 01:30:33.030
mind physically and mentally.
Like getting rid of all the other distractions,

1501
01:30:33.031 --> 01:30:34.980
which is in part why I do it in the morning,

1502
01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.710
not just because my energy and my mind are better,

1503
01:30:37.711 --> 01:30:42.520
but because of distractions are far less.
So,
you know,

1504
01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:46.470
for me creativity is a process of removing barriers.

1505
01:30:46.471 --> 01:30:50.850
It's not so much a process of pulling something in that was outside me.

1506
01:30:51.210 --> 01:30:55.010
Right,
right.
It's a sort of decreasing the,

1507
01:30:55.030 --> 01:31:00.030
the noise to signal ratio so that what was already there is easier to put down.

1508
01:31:03.810 --> 01:31:05.600
Is that how you,
well actually the,
uh,

1509
01:31:05.670 --> 01:31:10.460
the analogy I use is it has more to do with flow rate.
That is to say,
um,

1510
01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:13.380
if I'm busy,
I'm thinking about lots of things.

1511
01:31:13.381 --> 01:31:16.770
I might have one good idea in an hour,
but if I clear my mind,

1512
01:31:16.771 --> 01:31:19.790
I can't stop them coming.
They're like,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump.

1513
01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:21.450
Now that's the part.

1514
01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.450
Unfortunately everybody wants to know what's the secret to being,
you know,

1515
01:31:24.451 --> 01:31:26.550
a creative person and having a new idea every day.

1516
01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:30.750
And unfortunately there's just some of this that either is a bad childhood

1517
01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:33.420
experience or DNA.
You know,
you,

1518
01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:36.420
you can do a lot to make yourself better at whatever you have,

1519
01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:41.550
but the flow rate of ideas that I have I think probably is unnatural.

1520
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:43.020
I think that's true.
I,

1521
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:47.310
but I also think it's a skill that can be cultivated.
Uh,

1522
01:31:47.370 --> 01:31:49.650
James Aalto chair,
who's a friend of mine,

1523
01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:53.160
has recommended to his readers for some time to develop the habit of just

1524
01:31:53.161 --> 01:31:57.690
writing down 10 ideas.
I think usually in the morning,
each day.

1525
01:31:58.110 --> 01:32:00.070
And I've spoken to a number of people who have adopted this

1526
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.600
<v 0>habit and it's,
it's become,
um,</v>

1527
01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:06.570
sort of exponentially easier over time,
uh,

1528
01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:10.270
to the extent that now they can't contain it to 10.
Uh,
so it's,
uh,

1529
01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:14.420
it's,
it's,
it is,
it is a curious question.
I mean the,
the,
the,

1530
01:32:14.430 --> 01:32:18.310
the question of creativity comes up a lot,
but like you,

1531
01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:23.400
I have to prevent too many extraneous inputs if I want to have any type of

1532
01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:28.850
unique output.
And so I'd love to ask you about your question or,
or your,

1533
01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:32.770
your morning rather if you have full control of your day,

1534
01:32:32.771 --> 01:32:37.540
what is your ideal first 60 to 90 minutes look like in your day?

1535
01:32:37.541 --> 01:32:40.690
Like what time do you wake up?
What type of protein bar due to et cetera.

1536
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:45.460
<v 3>So it depends on when I went to sleep,
either five or six,
but let's say five.</v>

1537
01:32:45.461 --> 01:32:47.670
I get up and uh,

1538
01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:52.210
I walked directly downstairs and get my coffee.

1539
01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:57.340
So push one button and way forward.
Have my one protein bar,

1540
01:32:57.341 --> 01:33:00.430
which is always the same because the coffee is always the same.

1541
01:33:00.431 --> 01:33:03.460
The proteins or is the same at the time's always the same.

1542
01:33:03.461 --> 01:33:06.760
Give or take that hour because I'm removing decisions.

1543
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:08.230
What type of protein bar do you eat?

1544
01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:13.750
I eat a builders 20 gram protein bar,
chocolate peanut butter.

1545
01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:17.320
And I'm so smart that I actually picked it up and they had the label in front of

1546
01:33:17.321 --> 01:33:18.670
me because I expected that question.

1547
01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:21.060
<v 0>Well,
you know,
he will.
Well</v>

1548
01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:26.580
<v 3>at that point I usually get on and start looking.
I guess I,</v>

1549
01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:30.170
I check Twitter first,
um,

1550
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:34.170
check my web page to see if the plane blew up.
That I don't know about,
you know,

1551
01:33:34.171 --> 01:33:38.010
did I,
did I say anything yesterday that caused the world to melt down?
Because,

1552
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:40.980
you know,
I'll need to know about that.
Um,

1553
01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:45.180
failing that,
I usually open,
um,

1554
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:48.290
business insider because I just like reading.

1555
01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:50.190
Usually while I'm waiting for my coffee,

1556
01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:54.060
I've looked at my Facebook feed and you know,
just tweeted,
you know,

1557
01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:57.420
played around.
Basically,
I'm just trying to wake up,
get my mind working.

1558
01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:01.980
And there's a process where once you clear your mind,

1559
01:34:02.190 --> 01:34:05.490
you have to flood it.
And you may use different words for this,

1560
01:34:05.491 --> 01:34:10.050
but I know you do it.
Um,
so you empty it and then you flood it with new input.

1561
01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.280
That's not the old input.

1562
01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:14.100
So I'm looking at the news and when he has stuff I haven't seen,

1563
01:34:14.101 --> 01:34:17.310
I'm not looking at yesterday's problem for the fifth time.

1564
01:34:17.311 --> 01:34:20.700
I'm looking at a new problem.
I'm thinking of a new idea.
So flooding in all the,

1565
01:34:20.701 --> 01:34:23.040
all the,
uh,
the new stuff,
but then he,

1566
01:34:23.041 --> 01:34:27.810
then you got to find out where in that flood is the little,

1567
01:34:27.811 --> 01:34:31.650
uh,
piece that's worth working with.
And that's where I,

1568
01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.270
that's where I use the body model.
I kind of cycled through all this,

1569
01:34:35.271 --> 01:34:37.230
this study model you said?
Yeah.

1570
01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.150
So the model is your brain can't find good content.
All right.

1571
01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:45.570
Not directly in an intellectual sense,
obviously the brain's involved,

1572
01:34:46.050 --> 01:34:49.260
but what I mean is that as I'm thinking of these ideas and they're floating

1573
01:34:49.261 --> 01:34:52.050
through my head,
um,
I'm monitoring my body.

1574
01:34:52.110 --> 01:34:55.980
I'm not monitoring my mind and when my body changes,

1575
01:34:56.010 --> 01:34:59.720
I have something that other are gonna care about too.
Oh,
that's cool.
I like that.

1576
01:34:59.721 --> 01:35:04.460
So that means posture or what or what type of indicators are there?
Um,

1577
01:35:04.461 --> 01:35:09.290
I'll tell you when,
if I'm thinking of let's say a particular setup for a joke,

1578
01:35:09.710 --> 01:35:14.430
I'll,
I'll think of the joke.
And then,
uh,
quite often I'll audibly go right.

1579
01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:16.170
And it wasn't planned,
right?
It just,

1580
01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:20.150
it just went and it was sort of a half laugh that you do when you're by yourself

1581
01:35:20.151 --> 01:35:22.610
and you say,
think of something funny,
but you don't want to do a full laugh,

1582
01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:27.890
you know?
So there's sort of thing,
there are other times when,
um,
so for example,

1583
01:35:27.891 --> 01:35:31.370
I told you the story about being in the shower and thinking as the entire plot

1584
01:35:31.371 --> 01:35:36.110
for God's debris in one moment.
You know,
my entire body lit up.
Um,

1585
01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:41.030
when I had the idea for the blog that I wrote recently,

1586
01:35:41.031 --> 01:35:43.400
they're just sort of lit up the Internet.
Um,

1587
01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:47.780
I felt it as a full body experience long before I wrote it.
Right?

1588
01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.530
And so that's,
that's largely true.
Now with Dilbert,

1589
01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.360
if you do this long enough,

1590
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:56.450
a lot of the things that used to be technique just get baked into your

1591
01:35:56.451 --> 01:35:57.740
personality after awhile.

1592
01:35:58.070 --> 01:36:02.570
And so there's stuff you do as second nature that you've got to moving art into

1593
01:36:02.571 --> 01:36:06.770
the domain of craft.
Right?
So for example,
I know,

1594
01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:12.180
cause I've learned over time that there are six elements of dimension of humor,

1595
01:36:12.351 --> 01:36:15.530
six dimensions of humor.
And if I use at least two of them,
I've got a joke.

1596
01:36:15.531 --> 01:36:18.080
If I use three of them,
school probably going to be a really good joke.

1597
01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:21.160
But that's not enough.
There's still that,
um,

1598
01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:25.150
there's something about it that x factor,
that thing you can't put your foot,

1599
01:36:25.190 --> 01:36:29.450
your finger on,
that just makes your body move.
You know,
it just moves your body.

1600
01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:34.220
And if he can't get that,
um,
no craft in the world can survive,
you know,

1601
01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:36.820
he can't resuscitate it.
And have you,
have you,

1602
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:41.540
have you written about the six elements of humor before?
I did.
I,

1603
01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:44.540
I've written about it a number of times.
I think if anybody googles,

1604
01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:48.800
my name's Scott Adams and six dimensions of humor,
you'll see.

1605
01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:53.500
Yeah,
you'll see a few references to it.
Got It.
And,
um,
what,

1606
01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:57.980
what would be two examples of the six?
Just just for fun.
Oh,

1607
01:36:57.981 --> 01:37:01.460
I know you're good at this because you know what you just did that was just so

1608
01:37:01.461 --> 01:37:04.490
smart.
If you had,
if you had asked me for the six,

1609
01:37:04.491 --> 01:37:06.070
I would have changed the subject because I know,

1610
01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:13.070
but you asked me for two cause you know,
I could come up with to,
uh,
all right,

1611
01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:16.040
so I would go for sex because you've now made it,

1612
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:20.720
you've made it safe for me to do that.
I'm wonderful.
Um,
so there's cute,

1613
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:25.370
there's bizarre,
there's recognizable,
there's naughty.

1614
01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:30.410
Uh,
how many was that?
Yeah,
you're already way ahead of the game.
You've got four,

1615
01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.730
you got cute,
bizarre,

1616
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.440
recognizable and naughty that you don't have to Google the rest a little bit.

1617
01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:38.220
Let me give you an example.
Um,

1618
01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:43.220
so cute is usually a kids and dogs,
right?
So,

1619
01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:46.400
and bizarre is just anything that's not in a place.

1620
01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:50.390
So if you know you're a cartoon history,
you will know that a,

1621
01:37:50.391 --> 01:37:54.890
the far side use primarily the dimension of putting something out of place.

1622
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.860
So you'd have an animal talking.
So as soon as the animals talking,

1623
01:37:59.010 --> 01:38:00.690
he's got one dimension.
All right.

1624
01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:03.570
So he is basically starting a race and he's already ahead of you.

1625
01:38:03.571 --> 01:38:05.340
If you're the cartoonists do sitting there saying,

1626
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:09.660
I think I'll do a comic about anything.
I the world is my canvas.
Right?

1627
01:38:09.661 --> 01:38:11.370
But he started,
he started ahead of you already.

1628
01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:16.880
So he's got the bizarre and then he'll have the animal say something often in

1629
01:38:16.951 --> 01:38:20.670
the framing or the type of mood that a human would say.
Right?

1630
01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:24.210
So that's recognizable part.
So if you could put yourself in the picture and say,

1631
01:38:24.211 --> 01:38:28.290
Aha,
Oh God,
I recognize that situation.
Uh,
but it's an animal talking.

1632
01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:32.280
Um,
clearly there's more to it than that.
Again,
that's just the,

1633
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:35.850
you have to have at least that two dimensions.
Um,

1634
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:41.030
take a look at the best comic strip of all time that I think nearly everyone in

1635
01:38:41.881 --> 01:38:45.810
the world would say.
Um,
Calvin and Hobbes,
there's a,

1636
01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:50.460
there's a talking tiger that is both bizarre and cute.

1637
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:53.220
All right?
So he took,
um,

1638
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.990
the far side one dimension further as a starting point.

1639
01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:01.830
All right.
The,
the moment you start reading Calvin and Hobbs,

1640
01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:06.330
you already have cute cause his drawing is amazing.
Both of the child and the,

1641
01:39:06.370 --> 01:39:06.691
you know,

1642
01:39:06.691 --> 01:39:11.220
he's got a double cute is going a child and an animal and it's a cool animal.

1643
01:39:11.221 --> 01:39:12.054
Right?

1644
01:39:12.150 --> 01:39:16.410
So he starts that before even writes a joke so that if he has the kid doing

1645
01:39:16.411 --> 01:39:19.650
something,
you know,
nobody or um,
um,

1646
01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:23.760
also anything bad happening to anybody is of course,
uh,
one of the dimensions.

1647
01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:27.150
So cruelty did,
I mentioned cruelty,
they might have to five yet

1648
01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:28.660
<v 0>you're up to five.
That's number five.</v>

1649
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.870
<v 2>By the end of this interview,</v>

1650
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:32.940
I will have come up with that six one and I'm going to,

1651
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:36.330
I'm going to scream it in the middle of whatever other unrelated question.

1652
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:42.500
<v 0>Or You could just leave people with bated breath to,</v>

1653
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:45.210
to tap Google into their keyboards.
That's,
that's another,

1654
01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.960
another way to get them to go to your site,
I'm sure.
Uh,
but uh,
we've,

1655
01:39:48.961 --> 01:39:52.710
we've got cruelty.
What it,
what are some of the most,
um,

1656
01:39:53.010 --> 01:39:58.010
or could you be just one underrated or underappreciated cartoonists in your

1657
01:39:58.951 --> 01:39:59.311
mind?

1658
01:39:59.311 --> 01:40:02.730
People that perhaps listeners haven't checked out that they should check out?

1659
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:08.740
<v 2>I would say a comic calledF minus f being,
you know,</v>

1660
01:40:08.770 --> 01:40:12.280
like you're a failure f I,
you can Google that.
It's,

1661
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:16.120
it's syndicated and uh,
that's the one that makes me laugh.

1662
01:40:16.150 --> 01:40:18.540
The most of the ones you haven't heard of,
cool.

1663
01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:22.620
Of the ones you may have heard of that also makes me laugh the most,
um,

1664
01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:25.110
pearls before swine.
Um,

1665
01:40:25.210 --> 01:40:30.210
and that would be no accident because he literally studied the,

1666
01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:34.260
you know,
the two of six rule.
And um,
you know,
I,

1667
01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:38.890
I had conversations with him when he was coming up and you can see that he's one

1668
01:40:38.891 --> 01:40:41.890
of the few cartoonists whose approach to it the way I have,

1669
01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:44.860
which is as a business,
not just an art.
Right.

1670
01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:50.080
And so he's used the most methodical operator out there now in terms of doing

1671
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:53.830
what is the smartest thing to do for your art.
Cool.

1672
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.640
<v 0>F minus and pearls before swine.
I will check out both of those,</v>

1673
01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:59.520
actually have not checked out either.
Uh,

1674
01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:03.190
I want to be respectful of your time,

1675
01:41:03.191 --> 01:41:07.120
but I would love to ask a couple of rapid fire questions.

1676
01:41:07.121 --> 01:41:08.440
The answers don't have to be rapid,

1677
01:41:08.441 --> 01:41:12.910
but I'd love to just ask a couple of short questions,
uh,

1678
01:41:12.911 --> 01:41:15.070
before we come up on time,
if that's okay with you.

1679
01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:18.050
<v 2>Sure.
And I know you want to ask me about the voice thing.</v>

1680
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:21.780
<v 0>Ah,
yeah,
yeah.
Well we could do that first.
I mean,</v>

1681
01:41:21.810 --> 01:41:26.790
could you describe what happened to you and what you learned from that

1682
01:41:26.791 --> 01:41:28.290
experience?
I mean,
and there's,

1683
01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:31.590
there's a fair amount out there for people to want to dig into the specifics of

1684
01:41:31.591 --> 01:41:32.520
the condition and so on.

1685
01:41:32.521 --> 01:41:35.620
But maybe you could just give people an overview of what happened because it's

1686
01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.280
terrifying,

1687
01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.490
<v 2>right?
So I'm not going to give like a big scary medical thing.
I new show.</v>

1688
01:41:39.491 --> 01:41:42.550
It'd be terrible and people can Google it.
If you googled,
uh,

1689
01:41:42.670 --> 01:41:46.570
spasmodic Dysphonia,
you would learn that I,

1690
01:41:46.571 --> 01:41:49.930
and tens of thousands of other people at this problem where you lose your voice.

1691
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:52.830
Um,
meaning that a clips,
uh,
your,

1692
01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:57.100
your vocal cords spazz at times when you don't want them to.
So he can't get out,

1693
01:41:57.190 --> 01:42:00.850
um,
words that makes sense.
Uh,

1694
01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.440
it was so unknown that it took me a long time to figure out what it was.

1695
01:42:05.441 --> 01:42:10.441
And I had to figure out using Google and hunting down a doctor and doctor to

1696
01:42:11.561 --> 01:42:14.860
doctor and you know,
my path went through,
you know,

1697
01:42:14.861 --> 01:42:18.510
Japan down to USC.
And finally Dr. Gerald Burke,

1698
01:42:18.511 --> 01:42:23.511
who had invented a surgery that was not well publicized that a worked for me.

1699
01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:25.630
So I've been,

1700
01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:29.830
since I've been active trying to tell people who have spasmodic Dysphonia,

1701
01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:30.820
which by the way,

1702
01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:34.750
I'm going to do an audio impression of it because there are people listening to

1703
01:42:34.751 --> 01:42:38.140
this guaranteed who have it and don't know they have it because they had never

1704
01:42:38.141 --> 01:42:40.900
heard anyone else who spoke that way.

1705
01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.340
And they're trying to figure out what it is.

1706
01:42:42.341 --> 01:42:44.970
So I'm going to do an impression and I'm going to send a,

1707
01:42:45.190 --> 01:42:49.210
like three dozen people to their doctor with a solution.
All right,

1708
01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.870
here's my impression.
If I were to order a diet coke,
um,

1709
01:42:52.871 --> 01:42:57.780
since my vocal chords would clench,
especially on some problems,
syllables,
um,

1710
01:42:57.790 --> 01:43:00.850
it would come out like a clipped,
um,
cell phone.

1711
01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:04.630
So instead of a diet coke and we're,
we're,
can I have a diet coke?

1712
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:08.680
It would come out as an I guy coat like that.

1713
01:43:08.770 --> 01:43:13.270
So it sounds like you're just dropping syllables.
So everybody at home who said,

1714
01:43:13.271 --> 01:43:16.380
Holy Shit,
I know somebody like that.
Um,
the,

1715
01:43:16.570 --> 01:43:20.980
the name for it is spasmodic Dysphonia,
but I got something much cooler.

1716
01:43:20.981 --> 01:43:22.660
You want to hear it?
I do.
That's on this.

1717
01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:26.080
We might be able to solve this problem today.
This is literally,

1718
01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:29.830
this is literally true.
I might actually be able to,
with your help,

1719
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:34.030
solve the entire problem for 50,000 people in this country.

1720
01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:36.340
Maybe it's a long shot,
right?
Let's give it a go,

1721
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:38.020
but I'm going to take it all right.

1722
01:43:38.021 --> 01:43:41.560
The surgery fixed me and what that involved was cutting some nerves in my neck

1723
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:45.310
that disconnected my brain from my vocal cords for three and a half months.

1724
01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:49.270
They spliced in a new network that takes three and a half months to regrow.

1725
01:43:49.271 --> 01:43:51.800
And once it regrows that I could talk,

1726
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:55.610
<v 3>but very weakly.
And it took her years to get my voice back to where it is.</v>

1727
01:43:57.170 --> 01:44:00.230
What's interesting about that is nobody knows why that works.

1728
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:04.580
Because the problem has been well identified to be a little left brain hiccup.

1729
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:09.080
So you don't,
you don't fix your brain by rewiring the nerves in your neck.

1730
01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:12.590
Now hold that thought.
Nobody knows why the surgery works.

1731
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:17.840
Now the only other thing that works for this that I've personally verified,

1732
01:44:17.841 --> 01:44:20.930
cause I've talked to the individuals who've done this and I actually went

1733
01:44:20.931 --> 01:44:25.570
through this training myself,
was a doctor who some thought was a,

1734
01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:28.610
was a not because science was not quite supporting his method,

1735
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:34.330
but you would go in and he would say everybody hum at the key of f for weeks and

1736
01:44:34.371 --> 01:44:38.720
tried to never talk at your natural deeper tone instead of just Tom.

1737
01:44:39.110 --> 01:44:41.810
Now I think it might've worked for 10 or 20% of the people.

1738
01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:45.580
But keep in mind this is an incurable problem,
right?

1739
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:49.900
At 10 to 20% of the people walked out with perfect voices.
I spoke to,
uh,

1740
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.850
one of them,
actually several of them I spoke to live,

1741
01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:57.860
so I verified and one of them crossed over my week.
So I know it's a real person,

1742
01:44:57.861 --> 01:45:02.030
not a shell or something.
Now what do these two things,
the surgery,

1743
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:05.990
which nobody knows why it works and the humming in the key of F,

1744
01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:07.910
which nobody knows why it works.

1745
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:10.850
What did they have in common in both of those cases?

1746
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.000
It's the only time the subject takes an extended period without reinjuring the

1747
01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:20.930
muscles and the vocal courts.
Hmm.
Uh,

1748
01:45:21.130 --> 01:45:26.120
so there is a non zero chance and I actually act,
um,
saw my surgeon,

1749
01:45:26.150 --> 01:45:29.720
um,
like a couple of months ago just had a,
an event and I said,

1750
01:45:29.721 --> 01:45:33.500
is it possible that the only reason that your surgery works is that you

1751
01:45:33.501 --> 01:45:38.270
prevented me from reinjuring the muscles of my vocal cords for long enough for

1752
01:45:38.271 --> 01:45:41.690
them to heal for the first time ever.
Because when you have this problem,

1753
01:45:41.691 --> 01:45:45.230
you ended up straining it every single day cause you're trying really hard to

1754
01:45:45.231 --> 01:45:46.370
talk.
It's just not working.

1755
01:45:46.670 --> 01:45:49.970
So imagine if you had a sprained ankle and you ran a marathon every day.

1756
01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:52.190
I would never heal.
Right.

1757
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:56.540
So the humming in the key of f uses different equipment like it uses just a,

1758
01:45:56.660 --> 01:46:00.650
you know,
or,
or maybe it just has less of a pressure on the same equipment.

1759
01:46:00.651 --> 01:46:01.840
I don't know.
And by the way,

1760
01:46:01.970 --> 01:46:06.320
I'm talking at what I can best approximate as the key of f I have.

1761
01:46:06.321 --> 01:46:08.600
I'm tone deaf so I'm not sure I'm getting there.
Um,

1762
01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:12.740
my normal speaking voice is actually much lower and I do that to preserve my,

1763
01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:15.860
my speaking mechanism.
That's one of the things you learn.

1764
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:19.070
So put those two things together.
The only two things,

1765
01:46:19.071 --> 01:46:21.830
these two things that are the only things that work to,

1766
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:26.780
to solve the spasmodic Dysphonia is people didn't talk not even a little bit

1767
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:30.130
using their normal voice for an extended period.
Um,

1768
01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:31.910
three and a half months in one case,

1769
01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:35.630
maybe as few as a week or two weeks in the other case.

1770
01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:39.350
But if you have this or you know somebody who does and you're listening to this,

1771
01:46:39.710 --> 01:46:40.850
somebody out there,

1772
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:44.000
I want you to see if you're in a special situation where this makes sense for

1773
01:46:44.001 --> 01:46:46.160
you.
Just don't talk for two weeks.

1774
01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:50.190
If you've got maybe a spouse who can answer the phone or type of job where you

1775
01:46:50.191 --> 01:46:55.110
can do an email just as an experiment.
And then the email,
he as at a,

1776
01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:59.410
you'll see my email address or you can find me on Twitter or anything.
Ah,

1777
01:46:59.530 --> 01:47:03.150
you see bay addresses in the Strip every day.
And tell me if it worked.

1778
01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:07.140
Cause if I could get three people in the world that this works for Tim,

1779
01:47:07.141 --> 01:47:09.390
we just fixed the problem.
It can be a really big break.
So,
you know,

1780
01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:14.220
I love this idea and for those people who might be considering this,

1781
01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:19.020
uh,
who think they might be a candidate or you could also look at,
uh,

1782
01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:22.080
for instance,
uh,
silent meditation retreats.

1783
01:47:22.081 --> 01:47:25.080
There are 10 to 14 days,

1784
01:47:25.081 --> 01:47:28.740
silent meditation retreats through groups like Spirit Rock and others.

1785
01:47:28.741 --> 01:47:31.720
So you could actually create a context,
uh,

1786
01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:36.540
wherein that is reinforced,
right?
Not only it's,
it's not just willpower,

1787
01:47:36.541 --> 01:47:38.470
but you're in an environment where it's not permitted.
So that,

1788
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:41.640
that could be also something to look into.
But no,
this is very exciting.
I liked,

1789
01:47:42.090 --> 01:47:42.630
uh,

1790
01:47:42.630 --> 01:47:47.520
I should say that whispering is still a perfectly allowed because that doesn't

1791
01:47:47.521 --> 01:47:51.510
use your vocal chords so you can communicate with anybody you want to in a quiet

1792
01:47:51.511 --> 01:47:55.020
room during this quiet period.
This is very interesting.
Well,

1793
01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:58.350
I'm glad we touched on that.
And again,
I have to emphasize,

1794
01:47:58.440 --> 01:47:59.760
it's totally a long shot,

1795
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.120
but there's somebody who listened to this was going to try it and we'll find
out.

1796
01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:04.320
But the long shots are worth it.

1797
01:48:04.330 --> 01:48:07.770
I mean you mentioned 10 to 20% with the humming in the key of f.

1798
01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.260
If that were a drug for a,

1799
01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:15.420
for a major condition and the people for whom it didn't work had an a side

1800
01:48:15.421 --> 01:48:19.560
effects that would,
that would stand a good chance of getting commercialized.

1801
01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:21.630
So I mean that's,
that's a viable,

1802
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:25.040
so a viable tool if you have a one in five chance of being awesome.

1803
01:48:25.170 --> 01:48:26.800
Well listen to this,
the um,

1804
01:48:27.150 --> 01:48:30.810
it gets more interesting because this is more validation for why this might
work.

1805
01:48:31.650 --> 01:48:36.360
This doctor could get no credibility because when he would report is cures,

1806
01:48:36.361 --> 01:48:39.590
which he was shouting at the top is his voice.
He was making videos,

1807
01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:42.600
showing the people,
showing them the actual people talking before it,

1808
01:48:42.601 --> 01:48:45.360
after it was as convincing as it possibly could be.

1809
01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:49.590
And when he would take it to the medical community,
they would say,
oh,

1810
01:48:49.710 --> 01:48:52.390
it looks like all that happened here is that you,

1811
01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.410
these people were misdiagnosed in the first place,

1812
01:48:55.710 --> 01:48:58.530
so you didn't cure spasmodic dysphonia.

1813
01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:02.670
These are people who just had strained voice boxes or strain,

1814
01:49:02.671 --> 01:49:07.050
whatever vocal chords and you let them rest and for a while and now they're

1815
01:49:07.051 --> 01:49:11.430
better.
I say,
maybe that's everybody.
Right,
right.
For sure.

1816
01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:16.200
Definitely.
I mean that's a,
it's kind of not entirely a perfect parallel,

1817
01:49:16.201 --> 01:49:20.170
but a lot of people who consider themselves hard gainers,
meaning they,

1818
01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:23.550
they have difficulty gaining muscle mass is particularly true with men are

1819
01:49:23.551 --> 01:49:25.550
simply training.
Too often they,
they,

1820
01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:29.310
they are not physiologically capable of recovering from the,

1821
01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:34.380
the stress that they're imposing on themselves.
They never,
uh,

1822
01:49:34.410 --> 01:49:38.880
they never,
uh,
sort of super compensate and experience this,

1823
01:49:38.890 --> 01:49:39.810
this hypertrophy.

1824
01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:44.840
So it's just a matter of removing stimuli as opposed to adding something,

1825
01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:48.040
you know,
the subtraction versus versus addition with just very

1826
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:52.810
<v 0>anti Western medicine.
And a lot of respects,
but,
um,
in,
in,</v>

1827
01:49:52.811 --> 01:49:56.380
in,
in the conventional sense,
let me,
let me ask you,

1828
01:49:57.190 --> 01:49:59.770
let me ask you this.
What,
what,
besides your own books,

1829
01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.400
what book or books have you given most as a gift?

1830
01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:08.040
<v 3>I've never given a book as a gift.</v>

1831
01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.900
<v 0>You haven't?
Wow.
Okay.
No,
this is interesting.
So what do you give gifts?</v>

1832
01:50:13.050 --> 01:50:15.240
Maybe that sounds like a weird question,
but I mean,
if you do,

1833
01:50:15.241 --> 01:50:18.150
I'd be curious to know what you,
you often give as gifts.

1834
01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:22.910
<v 3>Um,
I retired from the gift giving business a while ago.
Um,</v>

1835
01:50:23.110 --> 01:50:28.010
which takes a long time to train everybody,
but
no,
I,

1836
01:50:28.011 --> 01:50:32.830
I replaced that in favor of being a,
you know,
a nice person on the general basis.

1837
01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:36.620
Right.
You know,
like maybe I want to buy you something today.
You know,

1838
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.110
it doesn't need to be reasonable.
So no,
I don't,
I don't do gifts in particular,

1839
01:50:41.111 --> 01:50:45.040
but I'd say if you're looking for a book that I think everybody should read,

1840
01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:49.480
perfect.
It would be a book called influence,
um,
by,

1841
01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:54.430
uh,
I don't know how to pronounce it.
She Aldine or Cialdini.
Yeah,
that's,

1842
01:50:54.431 --> 01:50:55.900
that's the part I was choking on it.

1843
01:50:55.901 --> 01:51:00.100
I didn't know how to pronounce the first part,
but it's C,
I a l,
D,

1844
01:51:00.101 --> 01:51:04.870
I n I 100% of effect of people seem to have read.

1845
01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:08.200
Read that book.
Yeah,
exactly.

1846
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:11.020
That's one of those things that would I beat somebody in,

1847
01:51:11.021 --> 01:51:13.300
they're operating at a pretty high level.
If you mentioned that book,

1848
01:51:13.301 --> 01:51:16.180
they've all read it.
Yeah,
that's true.
It's very consistent.

1849
01:51:16.630 --> 01:51:19.040
But if you talk to the general public,
it's still that well known.

1850
01:51:20.010 --> 01:51:22.720
Then I would add to that,
uh,
I haven't read these books,

1851
01:51:22.721 --> 01:51:27.721
but I took the Dale Carnegie course and if the books say anything that is as

1852
01:51:28.451 --> 01:51:31.840
useful as the course,
that's probably a good thing.
I hear good things about him.

1853
01:51:32.410 --> 01:51:36.220
<v 0>I'm a big fan of a lot of his work in particular,</v>

1854
01:51:36.221 --> 01:51:38.320
not the how to win friends and influence people,

1855
01:51:38.321 --> 01:51:41.260
but how to stop worrying and start living,

1856
01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:44.800
which I think is it fantastically well written book on anxiety and there's a
law,

1857
01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:48.760
there's a bit of material on the physiology and so on.
That's this outdated,

1858
01:51:48.761 --> 01:51:51.820
but the vast majority is,
is fantastically well done.

1859
01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:57.010
<v 3>Well that that needs it update because I have a theory that there's a real,</v>

1860
01:51:57.011 --> 01:52:00.160
um,
there's something like called the digital disease,

1861
01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:04.900
meaning that if you take the average person and put them in the average simple

1862
01:52:04.901 --> 01:52:08.800
environment of the past,
they were not overwhelmed by its complexity.

1863
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:13.330
But I believe that today the average person is overwhelmed by the complexity of

1864
01:52:13.331 --> 01:52:16.780
life because it got more complicated and that,
um,

1865
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:21.990
I barely know an adult who is not some kind of drug either prescribed or

1866
01:52:22.811 --> 01:52:24.610
otherwise to deal with anxiety.

1867
01:52:24.850 --> 01:52:27.160
And I'm pretty sure that wasn't the case when I was a kid.

1868
01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:28.870
Maybe we have more options now I guess.

1869
01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:34.120
I think there's like a real legitimate mental illness.
Plague.

1870
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:36.540
<v 0>I agree.
I totally agree.
And I think,</v>

1871
01:52:36.541 --> 01:52:39.200
and I think I saw you mentioned something along these lines on Twitter,
but it's,

1872
01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:43.490
we're in an a distraction economy,
right?
I mean,
we,

1873
01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:46.130
it's not only limited to a box in our living room,

1874
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:50.210
<v 3>but we have,
we have obviously the,
the phones,
the tablets,</v>

1875
01:52:50.211 --> 01:52:54.050
the laptops.
Now we have wearables.
Uh,
let me,

1876
01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:57.260
let me emphasize that point because I realized I sounded like a old lady.

1877
01:52:57.290 --> 01:53:01.430
Get off my lawn.
Um,
uh,
stop this,
stop this new technology stuff.

1878
01:53:01.431 --> 01:53:06.140
But I think most people who move here to me now that I'm very pro future and

1879
01:53:06.141 --> 01:53:08.390
technology,
so yeah,
not saying we should,

1880
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.010
we should back up but keep in mind the names of these biggest companies in your,

1881
01:53:13.011 --> 01:53:15.710
your world like Google,
apple,

1882
01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:20.060
they're their business model is distraction.
You know,
your smartphone,

1883
01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:25.310
all of that depends on them taking you off your task and making you look at an

1884
01:53:25.311 --> 01:53:30.140
advertisement or by their new songs or by their new thing going to look at a new

1885
01:53:30.141 --> 01:53:30.974
app or something.

1886
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:36.430
So they're literally in the business of making you distracted and doing the job

1887
01:53:38.061 --> 01:53:42.620
that the smartest people in the world using the best science and ab testing can

1888
01:53:42.621 --> 01:53:47.620
provide while in the normal world you had,
it was a fair fight,
right?

1889
01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:51.740
You're like,
Hey,
I'm going to ignore your billboard on the highway cause I can,

1890
01:53:51.741 --> 01:53:55.130
it wasn't that hard.
Haha.
Those guys with the billboards,

1891
01:53:55.131 --> 01:53:58.130
they were using a ton of science.
But now,

1892
01:53:58.131 --> 01:54:02.450
now it's me against all the sciences and Google.
All right.
It's,

1893
01:54:02.451 --> 01:54:07.120
it's total.
It's a total stack deck.
Not In your favor.
Yeah.

1894
01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:11.960
Uh,
before you call this true story.
So as part of your process,
I'm,

1895
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:16.990
your assistant sent me a form that needed to be filled out in order to do the

1896
01:54:17.061 --> 01:54:21.950
process of finding it in my email,
printing it out.
Or in this case,

1897
01:54:22.130 --> 01:54:25.250
realizing that I had to print out something to look at to realize I didn't need

1898
01:54:25.251 --> 01:54:29.990
to print something out.
It's,
you know,
it's only two minutes.
Right,
right.

1899
01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:32.780
Totally worth the time.
Not Complaining about the process.

1900
01:54:32.781 --> 01:54:34.250
A a completely necessary,

1901
01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:39.390
but in that two minutes I only had one hope to be able to complete that to me,

1902
01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:43.580
a task within the hour so that I'd have it in on time for the,
for this.

1903
01:54:44.090 --> 01:54:48.800
And the only hope was chanting it continually to keep the other thoughts out of

1904
01:54:48.801 --> 01:54:53.330
my head.
So,
so for five minutes,
I simply chanted,

1905
01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:56.900
print the form,
print the form,
print the form.
I would pick,

1906
01:54:56.930 --> 01:55:01.010
I would pick up my phone just by reflex and start to hit Twitter while I'm

1907
01:55:01.011 --> 01:55:05.870
chanting.
And I was like,
no,
I actually have to yell at myself.
I yell at my head,

1908
01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:07.040
no,
no,
no.

1909
01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:11.150
I yell at us all the way back at the tape and then I go print the form,

1910
01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:12.860
print the form.
And after I printed it,

1911
01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:16.460
I still had to w that I learned I really needed to do something online instead.

1912
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.490
And so I had to find that again.

1913
01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:23.660
So now like find the email,
find the email.

1914
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:28.750
So without that I don't have a hope and I need to do that more often I think.

1915
01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:31.430
Yeah.

1916
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:36.020
Psych holding up a shield to deflect all of the incoming distraction.

1917
01:55:36.330 --> 01:55:37.280
And you mentioned billboards.

1918
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:41.270
If you could have one billboard anywhere with anything on it,

1919
01:55:41.630 --> 01:55:42.980
what would it say and where do you put it?

1920
01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:50.910
Ah,
it would say be useful.

1921
01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:53.070
It would be everywhere.

1922
01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:00.960
So I realized one day that I could boil down my entire philosophy of how to live

1923
01:56:02.670 --> 01:56:06.660
into those two words.
Just be useful.
That's useful.
Yeah.
That,

1924
01:56:06.661 --> 01:56:09.090
that comes from my farming,
upgrading.

1925
01:56:09.150 --> 01:56:12.960
My white mother grew up in a farm and I grew up next to the farm she grew up on.

1926
01:56:12.961 --> 01:56:17.850
So I worked on it with like grandparents and stuff.
Um,
and they're,
you know,

1927
01:56:17.851 --> 01:56:22.470
there's no wasted energy,
right.
Cause can afford it.
Yeah.
Wait,
waste is death.

1928
01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:27.150
So you,
you know,
you didn't leave,
you always pitched in,
you didn't,

1929
01:56:27.170 --> 01:56:31.800
you didn't wait for somebody to ask.
You just be useful.
And so I,
you know,

1930
01:56:31.801 --> 01:56:34.260
having now made the money that I need to bake,

1931
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:38.910
I'm far more focused on the being useful to the rest of the world,

1932
01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:42.690
part of the equation for the second half of my life and far more enjoyable.

1933
01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:47.970
So if,
you know,
if somebody says,
how do I be happy,
how do I be happy?
You know,

1934
01:56:47.971 --> 01:56:52.890
the biggest question in the world,
I'd say be useful.
It works every time.

1935
01:56:53.130 --> 01:56:58.080
It doesn't sometimes work.
It works every time.
Be useful because what,
guess what?

1936
01:56:58.081 --> 01:57:00.950
People like it,
they want to be with you.
You're useful.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1937
01:57:01.170 --> 01:57:03.810
People want to hire you.
You're useful.
Everything comes together.

1938
01:57:03.811 --> 01:57:07.500
If you just do that one thing and that dovetails back to,
you know,

1939
01:57:07.501 --> 01:57:12.390
the product is you,
you know,
that the project is,
is semi relevant.

1940
01:57:12.391 --> 01:57:13.410
Whether it succeeds,

1941
01:57:13.710 --> 01:57:18.120
what really matters is did you become a more valuable and therefore more useful

1942
01:57:18.121 --> 01:57:22.260
person at the end of it?
Definitely.
And you mentioned,
you mentioned happy.

1943
01:57:22.261 --> 01:57:24.000
I think a lot of people strive to be happy.

1944
01:57:24.001 --> 01:57:27.270
A lot of people also strive to be successful and that means different things to

1945
01:57:27.271 --> 01:57:29.670
different people.
When you think of the word successful,

1946
01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:34.260
who's the first person who comes to mind for you?
Well,
Donald Trump,

1947
01:57:34.261 --> 01:57:36.810
but only because he's in the news.
It was,
you know,
so,

1948
01:57:37.110 --> 01:57:41.640
so I think the test was completely polluted when I think is successful.

1949
01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:46.470
I would say,
um,
if I think of it for two seconds,
Bill Gates and,
uh,

1950
01:57:46.471 --> 01:57:49.830
there's nobody in second place.
Why is that?
First of all,

1951
01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:53.310
he amassed a huge amount of money,
but it do,

1952
01:57:53.311 --> 01:57:57.790
it did so in a way that made the world forever better.
Right.
And,

1953
01:57:57.800 --> 01:57:59.560
and I'm sure that,
you know,

1954
01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:01.890
now that you see how the second half of his life is going,

1955
01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:06.390
I think that he always needed something that didn't just make money.
You know,

1956
01:58:06.391 --> 01:58:10.500
I think the putting the computer on every,
not every desk or whatever,
uh,

1957
01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:12.690
was a real thing.
Um,

1958
01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:17.400
I believe he invests that money largely so he could do the second part of his

1959
01:58:17.401 --> 01:58:22.260
life.
And now you take the smartest,
most rational human,

1960
01:58:22.830 --> 01:58:26.940
um,
the world has ever produced a and find out,

1961
01:58:26.941 --> 01:58:30.870
we'll surprise everything you thought about him wasn't exactly what you thought.

1962
01:58:31.230 --> 01:58:35.970
And years ago when he said his plan was to give it away and nobody really took

1963
01:58:35.971 --> 01:58:40.690
that seriously.
Guess what?
He's doing that too.
And the way he's doing it is,

1964
01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:45.400
is picking the thing that governments can't do and poor people can't do.

1965
01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:49.180
He's pay east taking not only the place that has the greatest leverage cause you

1966
01:58:49.181 --> 01:58:49.271
know,

1967
01:58:49.271 --> 01:58:53.680
you can go in with his brains and money and in scientific ways and you know,
the,

1968
01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:58.220
the energy that he attracted himself and pick off these things.
You know,

1969
01:58:58.750 --> 01:59:02.590
his contribution to Africa by the time he,
you know,

1970
01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:06.370
takes the dirt nap or transfers is a life force.

1971
01:59:06.371 --> 01:59:08.800
It's a software which I think is far more likely in this case.

1972
01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:12.160
They may rename the nation after him home.
You know,
it might,

1973
01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.250
it might be the continent of Bill Gates when he's done.

1974
01:59:15.490 --> 01:59:17.230
And I'm not sure if everybody sees this company.

1975
01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:21.940
I mean he's working on stuff like fixing water,
you know,

1976
01:59:22.090 --> 01:59:25.840
like how,
how would everybody liked to have water?
Would that be good?

1977
01:59:25.930 --> 01:59:30.930
I mean he's going after the biggest targets with some guns that have all the

1978
01:59:30.941 --> 01:59:34.270
ammunition that you need to go after those targets and nobody else can do it.

1979
01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:37.160
<v 0>He's a very impressive guy.
I heard a,</v>

1980
01:59:37.220 --> 01:59:40.820
a first person anecdote from a friend of mine who,
uh,

1981
01:59:41.690 --> 01:59:46.460
somehow ended up going on a bird watching tour with Bill Gates.

1982
01:59:47.310 --> 01:59:51.950
It's a small group of people end up and Bill Gates spent maybe an hour of the

1983
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:55.160
night before reading a birdwatching guide.

1984
01:59:55.190 --> 01:59:57.590
And according to my friend,

1985
01:59:57.591 --> 02:00:02.591
I mean literally had perfect factual recall of that book on the tour the next

1986
02:00:03.710 --> 02:00:07.520
day to the point where he could talk to this professional bird guide in a

1987
02:00:07.521 --> 02:00:12.500
tropical environment on a peer level.
A just mind boggling.

1988
02:00:12.501 --> 02:00:16.180
I mean talk about CPU power.
Um,
uh,

1989
02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:20.000
what advice and I'll just ask you one or two more questions.

1990
02:00:20.090 --> 02:00:22.550
What advice would you give to your 30 year old self,

1991
02:00:25.580 --> 02:00:28.790
<v 3>30 year old self?
Um,
that was a,</v>

1992
02:00:28.791 --> 02:00:31.220
that was a time of great transition.

1993
02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:35.930
I would say probably patients because you know,

1994
02:00:35.931 --> 02:00:40.130
I've been playing the system game and not the goal game since,
um,

1995
02:00:40.370 --> 02:00:44.030
since I got into college and literally have a diary in which I,

1996
02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:48.080
I wrote my master plan.
If you take,
you know,

1997
02:00:48.170 --> 02:00:53.170
10 years following up a process and it's not giving you a results that's hard to

1998
02:00:53.691 --> 02:00:58.580
remain patient.
So in retrospect,
that was the only thing I needed to,
uh,

1999
02:00:59.030 --> 02:01:02.420
to maybe alleviate some of my pain.
But on the other hand,

2000
02:01:02.421 --> 02:01:06.140
inpatients probably drove me harder.
So maybe I wouldn't tell myself that either.

2001
02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:08.920
<v 0>And if,
if you're a 30 year old self said,
how,</v>

2002
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:12.220
how exactly do you propose IB patient,
what would you,

2003
02:01:12.250 --> 02:01:13.300
how would you respond to that?

2004
02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:19.250
<v 3>Um,
well my 30 year old self wouldn't have access to medical marijuana,</v>

2005
02:01:19.251 --> 02:01:21.080
so I would have to have a limited

2006
02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:26.240
limited canvass with which to paint.
Um,
I,

2007
02:01:26.241 --> 02:01:28.180
I've always made it a,
a,

2008
02:01:28.290 --> 02:01:33.290
a top priority since I was a teenager and had tons of stress related medical

2009
02:01:35.871 --> 02:01:39.830
problems to make that job.
One,
to learn how to have stress.

2010
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:45.370
I would consider myself a world champion at avoiding stress at this point in

2011
02:01:45.711 --> 02:01:48.770
dozens of different ways.
And a lot of it is just how you look at the world,

2012
02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:54.080
but most of it is,
um,
is really the process of a diversification.

2013
02:01:54.890 --> 02:01:58.730
So I'm not going to worry about losing one friend if I have a hundred,

2014
02:01:58.850 --> 02:02:01.980
but if I have two friends,
I'm really going to be worried,
not,

2015
02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:06.410
not going to worry about losing my job because my one boss is going to fire me.

2016
02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:07.340
Um,

2017
02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:12.200
because I have thousands of Boston said newspapers everywhere and lots of them

2018
02:02:12.201 --> 02:02:14.510
could like me one day.
And it doesn't make any difference to my life.

2019
02:02:15.110 --> 02:02:18.410
So what are the ways to not worry about stresses,
to eliminate it?

2020
02:02:18.650 --> 02:02:20.150
I don't worry about my,

2021
02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:25.640
my stock picks because I have a diversified portfolio.
So diversification,

2022
02:02:25.641 --> 02:02:30.050
it works in almost every area of your life to reduce your stress.
I love this.

2023
02:02:30.051 --> 02:02:34.040
Well Scott,
we need to hang out more.
We need to play more tennis.

2024
02:02:34.041 --> 02:02:37.400
We should get in Deval in the room to just up the intensity quotient to also,

2025
02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:42.260
not that we need it,
but uh,
it always fun to,
uh,
to,

2026
02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:47.090
to chat with you and uh,
where can people learn more about you,

2027
02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:51.680
find you online,
say hello,
where would you like people to,
to check you out?

2028
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:52.970
Um,

2029
02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:57.770
I would like people to go to [inaudible] dot com and check out my blog if they

2030
02:02:57.771 --> 02:03:02.630
like my non humor thoughts.
Um,
pretty soon,

2031
02:03:02.631 --> 02:03:03.860
uh,
my startup,

2032
02:03:03.890 --> 02:03:08.890
which is now called a calendar tree.com we'll have little pivot and have a new

2033
02:03:09.531 --> 02:03:14.050
name,
um,
and we'll make lots of noise about that,
but you will,

2034
02:03:14.090 --> 02:03:18.920
will you want to watch for that?
And,
uh,
what is your,
what is your Twitter handle?

2035
02:03:18.921 --> 02:03:22.550
If people want to pin you on Twitter,
uh,
Scott Adams says,

2036
02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:28.120
and if you could make just in closing one ask or a recommendation to the people

2037
02:03:30.291 --> 02:03:34.250
listening to this,
what would,
what would that be?
Besides checking your stuff out,

2038
02:03:34.370 --> 02:03:36.950
think of your life as a system.

2039
02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:40.790
Think of yourself as the most important part of the system.

2040
02:03:41.090 --> 02:03:45.980
Be Useful and make yourself more valuable as you go.
I love it.

2041
02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:48.620
It's everybody listening for,
for links.

2042
02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:53.750
I'll also include specific links to a couple of popular posts on Scott's
blogged.

2043
02:03:53.751 --> 02:03:56.330
Just visit the show notes.
Everything we mentioned will be in there.

2044
02:03:56.450 --> 02:04:00.980
Four hour workweek.com forward slash podcast all spelled out and uh,

2045
02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:05.360
Scott,
keep creating man.
I love your stuff and uh,
hope to see you again soon.

2046
02:04:05.450 --> 02:04:07.700
Thank you Tim.
I love this.
Let's do it again.

2047
02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:15.420
<v 0>This episode is brought to you by 99 designs.</v>

2048
02:04:15.421 --> 02:04:18.720
Your one stop shop for all things graphic design related.

2049
02:04:18.721 --> 02:04:23.700
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers,

2050
02:04:23.701 --> 02:04:27.420
including sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

2051
02:04:27.421 --> 02:04:31.410
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

2052
02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:32.270
the brainstorming.

2053
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:35.580
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

2054
02:04:35.581 --> 02:04:39.750
works.
Whether you need a t,
a business card,
a website,

2055
02:04:40.090 --> 02:04:42.330
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

2056
02:04:42.570 --> 02:04:46.080
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

2057
02:04:46.290 --> 02:04:48.720
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

2058
02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:52.410
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

2059
02:04:52.411 --> 02:04:53.070
money back.

2060
02:04:53.070 --> 02:04:56.850
It's that straightforward and many of you who are listening have already used it

2061
02:04:56.851 --> 02:04:59.310
and created some amazing things that I'll be sharing in the future.

2062
02:04:59.610 --> 02:05:01.950
But in the meantime,
if you want to see some of my competitions,

2063
02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:06.090
some of the book covers as well as get a free $99 upgrade,

2064
02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:09.000
goto 99 designs.com forward slash Tim,

Tim,

2066
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:18.930
this episode is brought to you by Vimeo pro,

2067
02:05:18.931 --> 02:05:23.220
which is the ideal video hosting platform for entrepreneurs and in fact a bunch

2068
02:05:23.221 --> 02:05:27.060
of my startups already use Vimeo pro including wealth front who uses it to

2069
02:05:27.061 --> 02:05:29.280
explain how wealth front works task grab,
it,

2070
02:05:29.310 --> 02:05:32.090
uses it to tell their company story and there are many other names that you'd

2071
02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:36.810
recognize among their customers,
airbnb,
Etsy,
et cetera.
Why do they use it?

2072
02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:40.350
Well then you approached provides enterprise level video hosting for a fraction

2073
