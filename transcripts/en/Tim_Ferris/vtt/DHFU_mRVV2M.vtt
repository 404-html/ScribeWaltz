00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.790
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:06.150
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.290
No,

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.560
it does seem like I'm a cybernetic organism.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.633
Living tissue

00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:29.080
Your one stop shop for all things graphic design related.

8
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.140
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

9
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.810
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

10
00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:41.800
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

11
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.040
the brainstorming and a lot of it took place with designers from around the

12
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:49.240
world and here's how it works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

13
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.720
a website,
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

14
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.470
you submit that project and designers from around the world,

15
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.110
we'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

16
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.800
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

17
00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:04.510
money back.
It's that straight forward.

18
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.230
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

19
00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:10.600
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,

20
00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:12.340
if you want to see some of my competitions,

<v 2>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.300
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,</v>

26
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:31.490
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

27
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.400
And my answer is inevitably Athletic Greens,

28
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:36.890
it is your all in one nutritional insurance.

29
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:38.630
I recommended it in the four hour body,

30
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.650
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

31
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.680
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

32
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.150
It just covers all my basis.

33
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.170
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

34
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.000
day,
and you can get 50 oh my God,
50% off.
Yes,
50% off.

35
00:01:56.001 --> 00:02:00.740
If you go to athleticgreens.com forward slash Tim,
that's athletic,

36
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:05.360
greens.com forward slash Tim,
check it out.
It's tasty,

37
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.230
but more important,

38
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.980
it will help you not screw up when you're doing your nutritional plannings.

39
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:13.580
So for me it just covers the basis,
takes a load off my mind,

40
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.350
puts a lot in my body and check it out.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.013
<v 2>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.080
<v 1>Hello Ladies and germs.
This is Tim Ferriss.</v>

43
00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:26.650
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where I interview and

44
00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:31.651
deconstruct world class performers to tease out all of the tactical actionable

45
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:36.670
bits that you can use,
the morning rituals,
the favorite books,
the meals,

46
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:38.680
the workouts,
the influences,

47
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.460
all of those things that you can replicate and pull into your own life.

48
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.750
This episode is chock full of all sorts of good information.

49
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.560
It was a lot of fun to do and there are two guests,

50
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.720
Stanley McChrystal and Chris Fussell.

51
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.440
Stanley McChrystal retired from the U s army as a four star general.

52
00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:58.810
After more than 34 years of service.

53
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.470
Former defense secretary Robert Gates described him as quote,

54
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:06.280
perhaps the finest warrior and leader of men in combat I've ever met.

55
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.220
And quote from 2003 to 2008,

56
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:13.000
he served as commander of the Joint Special Operations Command,

57
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.470
otherwise known as Jay sock,

58
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.480
where he was credited with the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi leader of al Qaeda

59
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:20.314
in Iraq.

60
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.400
His last assignment was as commander of all American and coalition forces in

61
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:25.234
Afghanistan.

62
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.750
He's a senior fellow at Yale University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs

63
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.900
and the cofounder of Cross lead a leadership consulting firm.

64
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.700
Chris Fussell is a former us navy seal officer,
also former aide,

65
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:38.260
the camp for general McChrystal.

66
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.340
And we'll get into what that means and a current senior executive at crosslead

67
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.990
and in this conversation,

68
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:48.991
which is very wide ranging and I think particularly important for people who are

69
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:51.690
anti military or uh,

70
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.050
have very strong feelings pro or con related to war to listen to.

71
00:03:56.051 --> 00:04:00.580
We dig into,
of course,
some very personal habits and backgrounds.

72
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:04.930
So Stanley's,
we're very well known for eating one meal per day.
Why is that?

73
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.560
What does he eat?
We dig into it and workouts,

74
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.130
all of the very personal bits we dig into for both of these gentlemen.

75
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.840
And then we also talk about combat.
We talk about the realities of fear of death,

76
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.030
of combat,
of high stakes,

77
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.570
how to come back from a death in the field.

78
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.810
All of these things that I think have implications across many,

79
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:28.840
many disciplines including for the private sector quite frankly,

80
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:32.290
although the stakes are often lower.
So I hope you enjoy this interview.

81
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.670
There's a lot here.

82
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.820
There are a couple of areas where we get into a little bit of inside baseball,

83
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.430
uh,
related to special operations and things like that.

84
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.260
Please bear with me and go through it because there are gems hidden throughout,

85
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.820
I think from both of these gentlemen.

86
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.460
So hope you enjoy and thank you for listening.

87
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.480
<v 3>Chris,
welcome to the show.
Thanks for having us.
Appreciate it.
Yeah,</v>

88
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.720
I've been looking forward to this and have way more questions than we'll ever

89
00:04:58.721 --> 00:04:59.554
get through today.

90
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.980
But I have been fascinated by not only the military and the training of the

91
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:08.380
military,
of the pros and cons of different aspects of the military,

92
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:11.350
but also how those translate to the civilian world.

93
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.550
And after the four hour body and the four hour chef has spent time with the

94
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:19.660
defense language institute and really become fascinated with the habits and

95
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:23.800
rituals of the top performers in that world.
So I have a slew of questions,

96
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:28.801
but the one that I have been asked to ask you stand more than perhaps any other

97
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.060
is why one meal a day?
Do you actually eat one meal a day?
I do.

98
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.860
Um,
and people ask me,
why is it some Zin connection with something?

99
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.860
And know what happened was when I was a lieutenant in special forces many,

100
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:45.634
many years ago,

101
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.850
I thought it was getting fat and I started running and started running distance,

102
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:51.701
which I enjoyed.

103
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:56.701
But I also found that my personality was such that I'm not real good at eating

104
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.900
three or four small discipline meals.

105
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.790
I'm better to defer gratification,
uh,
and then eat one meal.

106
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:09.080
And for me that's dinner.
And so what I do is I sort of pushed myself hard,

107
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.770
all dre try to get everything done and then and sort of reward myself with

108
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.590
dinner at night.
What time do you usually eat dinner?
Well,

109
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:20.060
whenever I'm finished work and uh,
it would be like eight or eight 30.

110
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:23.420
There's a challenge when you work really long hours because suddenly you start

111
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:25.820
to eat very late and then you go directly to bed and that,

112
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.840
that you feel like you're sleeping with a football and your stomach and do you

113
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.850
drink a coffee earlier in the day?

114
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.950
I'm just thinking with the workout and that many hours a lot of people would

115
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.170
would fade.
How do you prevent yourself from fading?
Yeah,
I have a tendency,

116
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:43.190
I'll drink coffee,
I'll drink other beverages to water and different things.

117
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.150
And I do find that there are certain days your body just says eat and eat right

118
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:47.900
now.

119
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.830
And I used to keep a bin of those hard pretzels in high office and Afghanistan

120
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:53.210
and I'd grab a handful of those.

121
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.060
And other times I might be out doing something physical in the military,

122
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:58.970
like road marching and suddenly your body communicates,

123
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.540
eat pretty quickly or you won't keep road marching and I'll,
and I'll do that.

124
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.550
But otherwise,
uh,
I like to stick to the idea of,
of one and I got it.
You know,

125
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:08.150
this is a,

126
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.980
this is a constant topic of conversation in the intermittent fasting worlds and

127
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:16.580
everyone has,
Ori Hofmekler has his thing.
The Paleo guys have,

128
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.980
have their thoughts obviously.
Are you a,

129
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.450
<v 4>so you have one meal a day kind of guy?
Well,</v>

130
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:27.451
when I was working for the general crystal as his aide to camp his last year

131
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.210
running the joint special operations command,
it was sort of a bite directive.

132
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:32.550
There was no other choice.
That was just the,

133
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.230
what we call the battle rhythm of the organization.
And when,
you know,

134
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.550
the old man got up to eat,
that's,
you did it then or you didn't do it at all.
Um,

135
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.650
so yeah,
I've,
I've lived on that terrain.
Um,

136
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.940
but I would be the first to tell others because,
um,
as,
as Dan alluded to,

137
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.790
it sort of became the driver in the organization.
But this is what we do.
And,

138
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.750
and I would tell people as his aide,
he won't judge you if you eat breakfast.

139
00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:55.360
This is the way his metabolism works.
He doesn't do this as a,

140
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.050
as a demonstration of personal strength.
This is just what works.
So don't,

141
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.830
don't think you were impressing them by not eating lunch or whatever.
Um,

142
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.520
but there was a classic story around this.

143
00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:11.170
When I first joined the inner circle staff,
um,
we had this,

144
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.240
uh,
command sergeant major,
who I'll call got,
uh,
uh,

145
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.850
a legend in the community.
He had been,
uh,

146
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.830
with Stan for about three and a half years at that point.

147
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.710
And so I was asking him about the one meal a day thing,
and he,
he said,
uh,

148
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.210
when he showed up for the first year,
he's,
you know,
two feet from stamp,

149
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.370
the entire five years they worked together.
And he said,
well,
this is what,

150
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:35.230
this is what the boss does.
This what I'll do.
So he did,

151
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.980
he did a meal a day and he does not have a metabolism that drives toward it.

152
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.420
And we lived in these little crummy Sorta quonset huts next to the,
uh,

153
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:46.270
where the headquarters was a quonset huts.
No,
just sort of wooden wooden huts.

154
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.560
Pretty Spartan living about 50 yards from where the headquarters was in Iraq.

155
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.050
And uh,
Jodi said about,
uh,

156
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.780
about a year into the tour that McChrystal cosmesis Jodie get in here.

157
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.170
So he runs over here.
What's up sir?
He goes,
and he,
he said,

158
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:04.680
I hadn't really looked through his hooch before and he said,

159
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.730
general McChrystal is pointing at these,
this little tin of pretzels he has.

160
00:09:07.731 --> 00:09:11.550
And he goes,
I think there's my seat,
my pretzels.
And Jody said,

161
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.710
I almost whooped on my gun and shot him.
And I said,
you,

162
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.500
you've been eating pretzels.

163
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.490
I've been hitting my dark secret or a year.

164
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:24.570
And you had a friend souls in your room because it was the most unprofessional

165
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:28.140
I've ever been.
I just storm out of the room,
you know,

166
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:29.190
low blood sugar will do that.

167
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.670
Makes cowards of men long distance running and low blood sugar.

168
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.960
So you mentioned a hooch.
Now I,
so one of the challenges.
