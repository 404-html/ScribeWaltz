00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.130
Hey guys,
Tim Ferriss here we have a guest,
Jason Philipa,
crossfit games champion,

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:09.030
and we're going to talk about a few things that perhaps need clarification and

3
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm personally interested to know about warm ups.

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.030
So how do you typically take your athletes through warmups and maybe even what

5
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:20.970
are some common mistakes that people make in their warm ups?
Yeah,
I mean I would,

6
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:24.030
I would kind of put it two fold.
I think number one,
one of the concerns,

7
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:27.510
we see what the warmup is where people don't have any guidance and direction or

8
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.710
focus on what they want to do.

9
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.410
And so the purpose behind the warmup is pretty simple.

10
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:33.660
It's get your core body temperature up,

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.090
take your body through a full range of motion,
right?
Get you prepare.

12
00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:39.570
Let's just say you just got out of the car where you just got a bed.

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.490
Can I take your bike through the full range of motion?

14
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.970
But most importantly also start preparing different movement patterns there'll

15
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:46.770
be incorporating for your workout,
right?

16
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:51.771
An example would be today we had a class doing pull ups or or box jumps for

17
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:52.860
example.

18
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.530
So one of the things I want to make sure that we're doing box jumps in the work

19
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:57.640
of the day is to make sure we're opening up the hamstring,

20
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.040
making sure open up the Achilles,

21
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.490
opening up areas that are going to be specifically tax during that workout.

22
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.550
And so an example of a warmup that's just a good general warmup.

23
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.250
What I like to do is like to go into the garage,
you're going to the gym,

24
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.190
started a timer and as soon as you start the timer when it does is it gives you

25
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:12.360
the sense of urgency.

26
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.600
I think sometimes what happens is the warmup ends up taking an hour.

27
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.510
The warm just needs to take a little bit of time,
10 15 minutes,

28
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.670
kind of prep the body and obviously it depends on what you're doing.

29
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.790
But my recommendation is set a clock right after you set the clock.
Sorry folks,

30
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.220
yon kind of big movers,
meaning like a rower,
getting that cardio,

31
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:33.360
big big movers running,
uh,
squatting,
right?
Full range of motion,

32
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.270
things that really take you through a full range of motion in joints like

33
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:40.470
thrusters,
right?
All the way down.
All the way up,
shoulder presses,

34
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.370
those types of things.

35
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.830
And what CEI does a good squat warmup look like?

36
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.380
Yeah,
I mean as far as I'm considered,

37
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:51.750
one of the things I like to do is I like to grab onto a pull,
right?

38
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:55.470
Or something to get like uh,
uh,
components and feedback.

39
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.660
And we're not going to do is I have to get down in the squat right?

40
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.850
And at the bottom of like to kind of work through the positions,

41
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:01.620
kind of opened up my hips,
getting this position,

42
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.650
we're really focusing on the crease of my hip below my knee joint at this point.

43
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.870
So I'm holding the pole and kind of open myself up.

44
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.290
Once I feel like my ankles are opening up,
my hips are opening up,

45
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.380
then I start working through kind of a slow squat.

46
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.600
And what I focused on is you can go up against the wall,

47
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.950
you can go up against the pole,
whatever.

48
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.150
But I think about key my arms up therefore engages my lower back.
Right?

49
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:23.910
So I'm thinking about three things.
My low back is flat,

50
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.300
my weight is in my heels and I'm trying to get the crease of my hip below my

51
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:31.110
knee joint to really work that full range sweater.
They squat down,
right?

52
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:33.470
I'm really focused on tight back,
wait my heels that can,

53
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:36.780
I get that power and the crease that will need joint to work that full range.

54
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.920
Then as I'm Kinda grooving and feeling it out,
I started dragging my knees out.

55
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.330
I go slow,
slow,
slow,
really perfected.
Then I start adding the speed.
Right.

56
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.920
Then I started getting in reps and what I'll do is I'll,
you know,

57
00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:51.660
I'll look at the clock and I'll do maybe five squats,
five sit ups,

58
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.210
five pushups for about two minutes.

59
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:56.950
Kind of getting the body moving and going through those patterns.
And uh,

60
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.990
when you then move to using say a barbell in the squat because I,
the,

61
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.100
the squat being I suppose one of the higher yield activities so that you can

62
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:07.520
focus on,
uh,

63
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.250
how do you typically do back squats or instruct people to do back squats with a

64
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:15.580
bar?
With a barbell?
Yeah,
I mean with the Barbell,

65
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.950
I mean essentially it's the same points of performance,
right?

66
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:20.200
So when we talk about the back squat,
we talk about the squat,

67
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.140
one thing about points performance and what are those really going to be?
Right?

68
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.410
We want our weight plants in our heel to make sure we're engaging kind of our

69
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:29.230
glutes,
our hamstrings,
et cetera.
We want our torso and our,

70
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.650
our our lower back nice and tight and we never want to see this thing kind of

71
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:36.400
break here or overextend want the crease for a hip or knee joint.

72
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:38.650
When our knees out,
now we grab onto the bar.

73
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.200
Some of the things that I'm thinking about right?

74
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.700
His hand placement and foot placement.

75
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.060
So I'll walk up to the bar and I'll think right hand left hand whether I have

76
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:49.480
just the Barbell,
a hundred pounds,
200 pounds,
400 pounds.

77
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.800
I want to set up the same way.

78
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.620
I want to have some type of a mantra in my head where I have some type of
rhythm.

79
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.610
So this way when I get into a competition setting or or a heavier load,

80
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.340
my brain is already been trained to do so.
Right?

81
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.460
So his right hand left hand and you do typically space.
Yeah.

82
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.780
It's sort of an inch in or out on the knurling for myself.
Yeah.
And this is all,

83
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.330
you know,
there's some that's that's personal preference,
right?

84
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.810
But some of the non negotiables are,
you know,
flat back in the hills,
et cetera.

85
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.030
But as far as in this,
uh,

86
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.270
sometimes people with poor shoulder mobility need to go a little bit wider.

87
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.730
So let's just say I'm in this position,
right?
Right foot,
left foot.

88
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.730
I come underneath the bar.
I address it now as like Getty here.

89
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.080
Right now it's level of my traps.
Some people do a low bar back squat.

90
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.370
You do a low bar,
then I why not my grip.
But for me,
I like to go high bar.

91
00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.480
So I placed,
it happened my traps now before I even pick it up,
right?

92
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.390
I'm thinking,
Hey,
if I just pick it up kind of with my low back,

93
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.220
rounded and had crappy position,

94
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.040
I can mess myself up and it feels heavier than needs to be.

95
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.160
So at four I haven't lifted up.
It's a big breath.
Boom.

96
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.950
I pick it up with kind of like a a purpose,
right?

97
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.050
Purpose before I even lift off the bar.

98
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.360
Now from this position is the exact same thing,
right?

99
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:56.080
I'm focusing on key components.
My chest is up,
I'm gazing straight ahead.

100
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:59.750
I sit back into my heels,
right crease of my hip goes below my knee,
joints,

101
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.580
elbows are in this good position,
chest is up,
boom.
I drive back out of it,
right?

102
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.700
And then as a re re rack it,
I walk into the wreck.

103
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.740
Sometimes people,
they use the rack the wrong way.
For me,

104
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.830
the best part I like to do is I like to back out of the rack and then come back

105
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:16.580
into the rack.
This one,
when you're fatigued,
you're easily,

106
00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:19.050
he will just put it right back in.
So meaning I,

107
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.590
I noticed you put your feet in a good deal further than a lot of people do when

108
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:27.280
you were loading yourself up with the weight.
And then when you're coming in,

109
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.680
meaning you're basically using forward momentum to place it back on the,
yeah,

110
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.560
I mean a little bit,
right?
I mean,
you know,

111
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.170
obviously it also depends on how much load you're doing.
Right?
And but yes,

112
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.450
for the most part the big is on the backs.
What is,
is kind of,
uh,

113
00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:44.850
addressing the bar with purpose.
I think a lot of times people,
the backs,

114
00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:45.240
why is a,

115
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.690
is a foundational movement that should beautiful because it's stressed your

116
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:53.700
entire system,
right?
So you're just getting strong from head to toe.
I mean,
tax,

117
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.500
if you had to ask me one movement that you could do twice a week to increase

118
00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:00.230
pure strength,
I would say it more than likely be the back squat.

119
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.410
Right now I'm on a program,
I started off on a five by five.

120
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.120
I go up 10 pounds once a week.
Right.
But I do it or twice a week,

121
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.220
depending on if you want to go five pound jumps each one.

122
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.650
But these use on a linear progression.

123
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.050
That's one example of a strength component you get incorporated.

124
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.940
Why are you doing five by five crew?

125
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.730
So I'm going to find my five currently just because I've tried different things.

126
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:23.720
So I've done 20 right back squat,
I've done,
I've done when there's five,
three,

127
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.430
one,
I've done all different types of stuff.
For me,

128
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:29.300
the five by five is nice because I could warm up to a weight final load.

129
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.840
Let's just say it's a hundred pounds and then I know that I'm gonna be able to

130
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:37.700
get in and out quickly.
You know,
I'm done with my sets in 30 minutes.
It's,
it's a,

131
00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:40.310
it's a weight that's challenging but not so crazy.

132
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:41.720
I'm going to feel like I'm gonna injure myself.

133
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.940
But most importantly is time under tension.
So five reps just down,
up,
down,

134
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:47.481
up,
right?

135
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:51.080
And it's just that time and attention gets you stronger and it over time you

136
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:53.990
increase the load.
So this way you make sure your technique is on point.

137
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.260
And how long will that five by five period last for you?
Is it,

138
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.950
is it a set period?
Is it three months?
Is it four months is it's,

139
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.760
so right now I'm going up in 10 pound increments,
right?
I'm actually personally,

140
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:04.861
I'm,

141
00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:08.180
I'm starting off right now once week 10 Penn in Cummins because have a lot other

142
00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:11.810
stuff going on.
I recommend for most people to maybe do twice a week,
right?

143
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.750
But maybe do it five pound jumps,
et cetera.
Now,

144
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:16.790
what will happen for me as I'm gonna go 10 pounds up,

145
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.820
now I'm gonna get to a point where I could no longer complete those five reps.

146
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.880
Then what I'll do is I'll go ahead and revert back to about two,

147
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.450
two sessions before and then I'll start going up in five pound increments.

148
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.130
And then once I can no longer do that,

149
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.430
then I'll go ahead and reevaluate and drop back down and then keep going up.
And,

150
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.170
but the,
the,
the key for me is where I'm at in my life.
I want you to stay strong.

151
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.930
I don't need to be super strong.
I don't need a back squat 500 pounds.

152
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.030
I just went back squat 400 pounds and I'm okay with that.
Yeah.
And uh,

153
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.130
how much in terms of rescue you taking between the fiber upsets you want

154
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:50.780
recovery and so that's can be a little bit different.

155
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:53.000
I think sometimes we need time.
The stats,
you know,

156
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:56.720
for me it's probably a one-to-one.
Like I'll,
I'll play,
I'll hit us set.

157
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.360
Let's just say it takes on a 30 seconds,

158
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.940
then would all wait on is probably maybe not one to one.

159
00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.730
It probably maybe two minutes.
Right?

160
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.680
I want to feel recovered and they hit it again.

161
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.260
Obviously it depends on how much load there is,
right?
I mean,

162
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:11.150
if I'm starting off at 300 pounds,

163
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:13.280
it's a lot different than when I get up to 400 pounds.
Right.

164
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.060
You need more time to let your system reset and that's just feeling it out.

165
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.020
And is your preference when say you were making this 10 pound jumps and then

166
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:23.810
you're unable to complete the five reps?
Uh,

167
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:29.510
the preference is to decrease the,
the size of the jumps in the increments.

168
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.753
Uh,

169
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.470
do you play with the interval between workouts as well or do you keep that

170
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:40.280
standard?
You mean the rest period or you mean and how the number holes?
Oh yeah.

171
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:42.180
I play with it.
All right.
I mean,
the thing about it is,

172
00:08:42.181 --> 00:08:45.230
is that I think people sometimes get too caught up in their program.

173
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.260
The program is only as good as how well you execute on it,
right?

174
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.100
As long as you have an idea that hey,
once or twice a week I need to squat heavy,

175
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.560
I need to go down and up with a heavy load on my back,

176
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.330
you're going to get stronger.
Right.
We don't need get to too wrapped up.

177
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:00.590
Now if you find a program,
stick with it and I think that's really important.

178
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.110
Meaning to re evaluate often.
Right.
Maybe some days you're not feeling it,

179
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.750
maybe do it in the next day.
Right.
But you the last thing you want to do.

180
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:09.900
I think sometimes people get into these rhythms when they find a program that

181
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:13.320
had just become super diligent on it,
which I totally respect.

182
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.230
The problem is sometimes they go in and let's just say the coaches programmed

183
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.980
some crazy workout,
but they were up all night with their kid,
they were sick,

184
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:21.420
whatever.
Now they go in,

185
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:24.240
they have a halfass workout cause they feel like crap and they look at their

186
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:26.190
results and it makes them feel worse.

187
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.150
Instead they should have gone in than an active recovery day and came in

188
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:32.460
tomorrow and done it.
So you need to listen to your body.

189
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.780
And what are some of the biggest mistakes that you see with novice or

190
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:39.450
intermediate?
Uh,

191
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.800
athletes or recreational say crossfitters or otherwise when they're trying to

192
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.840
pick a program?
Yeah,
I think picking up,

193
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.140
I think the biggest problem we see is that they're trying to jump from program

194
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:49.621
to program,

195
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:52.950
think he's going to get them results when in reality we'll get your results is

196
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:53.784
hard work.

197
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.150
And that's the biggest problem that I see fundamentally with a lot of the guys

198
00:09:57.151 --> 00:09:58.470
that are coming in the crossfit space.

199
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.580
It'll jump from this program in this program,
this program,

200
00:10:00.581 --> 00:10:03.570
they'll do it alone in the garage instead of trying to get into the gym.

201
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.450
Do with buddies,
you know,
push each other hard,
right?

202
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.810
And get in this atmosphere that breeds results.

203
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.170
And so the most critical pieces put yourself in a position of success.

204
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.140
And the best way I think you do that is by surrounding yourself.

205
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:19.830
Other people that are going to elevate you.
Um,
program aside.
Now,

206
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.000
do you need an okay program?
Sure.
But the difference between doing 80%,

207
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:27.870
82% is almost irrelevant as long as you're going in there and you're attacking

208
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:28.704
it with purpose.

209
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.040
And I'm sure there are a lot of people out here and there are a lot of people

210
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:35.610
out there who think they're working really hard.
Right?
So to you,

211
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:38.910
what does that mean?
That's a really good question.

212
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.810
I think that there's a lot of people who think they're working hard and the are

213
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:43.330
working hard.

214
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.990
They're probably working harder than most people in the United States,
right?

215
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.520
But I think having a coach and a community around you will always take you to

216
00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:52.960
another level.
And it's very hard to argue otherwise.
Like,

217
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.470
I've worked out in my garage for years.

218
00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.360
But what I find is you really need to have the clock to motivate you or your

219
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:03.750
friends.
Meaning I like to do email moms,
so every minute on the minute,

220
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:05.970
so each minute I give myself a goal and I need to hit it.

221
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.940
So now it's almost like my friend is the clock and I'm competing against the

222
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:12.300
clock,
right?
Like,
Hey,
I want to get 10 back squats in a minute,
whatever.

223
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.360
But you always need to have something to kind of shoot for when you're in the

224
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:17.190
gym.
You have this,
this atmosphere,

225
00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:19.320
this sense of camaraderie that I think pushes you.

226
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:22.950
So I think what it is is it's when you're done with the workout,
you evaluate,

227
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.140
you sit there and you ask yourself this very simple question,

228
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.840
did I do the best I could not work out that I really go hard?

229
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.230
And if the answer is yes,
great,
the answer is no.
Then fixed it the next day.

230
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:34.720
But I think sometimes people wait too long to ask themselves that question,

231
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:39.390
right?
For,
for people who were say semi athletic,

232
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.100
uh,
in their twenties or thirties,

233
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:45.090
getting into say crossfit style workouts for the first time.
Okay.

234
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.630
Haven't played any competitive sports in a long time.
Right.

235
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.260
And uh,
you're looking at their first year of training.

236
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:58.261
Are there any particular movements you would remove or warnings that you would

237
00:11:58.391 --> 00:11:59.740
make so that they avoid injury?

238
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.390
I think the most important thing is we've done a lot of people from,
you know,

239
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:08.210
formal,
former NFL players to this,
to that,
whatever the,

240
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.760
the yet to be coachable and you have to be prepared to be okay with going a

241
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:14.680
little bit lighter.
And I think one of the problems,

242
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:16.120
and I've had the same thing happened to me,

243
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.730
is that sometimes you need to take a step back,
take a step forward.

244
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.340
And if you build the house on a,
on a,
you know,

245
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.250
on some strong foundation you could do a really good job.

246
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.530
But I think sometimes in the first year of crossfit,

247
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.160
people have this tendency to want to go up and go up and go up when they,

248
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.530
their movement isn't efficient,

249
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.340
but they're getting away with because they're muscling.
It's like Jujitsu,
right?

250
00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:39.100
Yeah.
In Jujitsu is the exact same thing.
Yes,
I can try and muscle it,

251
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.140
but I can maybe do that with a white belt.

252
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.650
But as soon as I get to a certain level where someone else's whatever,

253
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.210
I'm not gonna be able to muscle it anymore.

254
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.740
And so if I build the foundation today about technique first,
right?

255
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.160
Make sure I can do it well once,
make sure my mechanics are on point,
right?

256
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.680
Then they share.
I can consistently do it right.
Can I,

257
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.760
can I perform the basketball consistently?
Well with no low,

258
00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:04.570
just kind of warming up then.
All right,
let's dose it.
But let's hit it hard.
And,

259
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.620
uh,
in say that first year,
let's,
I'll give you a hypothetical.

260
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:13.330
So let's say you have 150 pounds to make the math.

261
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.280
It's kind of easy.
150 pound former athlete.
So high school athlete,
not college.

262
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.630
Right.
Okay.
Still in reasonably good shape isn't like eating hohos and right and

263
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.680
cheeseburgers every meal every day and wants to set some goals.

264
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.270
And so I think a lot of people,
certainly speaking for myself,

265
00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:34.000
are motivated by having a clear objective.
Absolutely.

266
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.850
And so this guy comes to you and says,
what should Mike,
what do you,

267
00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:41.140
what do you suggest is goals sort of at the end of year one?

268
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.580
Is it like back squat,

269
00:13:42.581 --> 00:13:45.430
x times body weight and then this and then that and the other thing.

270
00:13:45.431 --> 00:13:47.770
What were some goals?
How it potential goals?

271
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.280
I would probably look at power lifts and conditioning or gymnastics pieces

272
00:13:51.281 --> 00:13:54.000
before I looked at Olympic lifts,
done it.
That's what I would do.

273
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.990
The Olympic lifts are highly complex,
right?

274
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.560
They develop many different general physical skills from neurological components

275
00:13:59.561 --> 00:14:02.860
to physical adaptations.
I mean,
it's a phenomenal lips,

276
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.050
but they're like a golf swing,
you know,

277
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.130
anybody could swing a golf club or expand your entire life trying to perfect it.

278
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.610
The Olympic lifts to the same.
So my recommendation would be not to rush that.

279
00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:16.570
Right.
That process takes time.
But with things like the power lifts,
you know,

280
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.720
you can get on a program and increase your back squat tremendously over the

281
00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:23.110
stage.
Squat,
deadlift,
bench,
squat,
deadlift.
I mean those are the Kings,
right?

282
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.880
I mean push,
pull,
squat,
right,
right.

283
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.480
And in addition to obviously have cardiovascular type things your mile time,
uh,

284
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.080
you know,
can you do a muscle up,
right?
There's a good example.
Um,
you know,

285
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:38.410
can do pull ups,
those are easy targets that you can shoot for.

286
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.890
We can get on programs to do it and I like doing every minute on the minute work

287
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.400
to accomplish that.
So for example,
if I wanted to get better at pullups,

288
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.090
one of the things that I've done the past is,
you know,
five strict pull ups,

289
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.130
right?
Every minute on the minute for 10.

290
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.880
So you just allocate 10 minutes to come in your garage and do five every minute

291
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:58.690
for 10 minutes.
Then as you start progressing,
he's not,
it gets easier,

292
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.310
maybe start doing chest to bar.
Then as that starts getting easier,

293
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:05.400
maybe you increase the numbers and then over time we end up finding is your pool

294
00:15:05.401 --> 00:15:09.940
of strength will get significantly better and it's not at the,
um,
it's not the,

295
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.910
uh,
the technique is still on point,
right?
Whereas the Olympic lifts,

296
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:16.250
you're so focused on increasing,
increasing,
increasing.

297
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.870
If your position is incorrect,

298
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.990
you'll eventually hit a dead end and with say that 150 pounds cmis athletic,

299
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:26.360
former competitive guy,
uh,

300
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.060
any particular goals in the power lifts that you had said?
If he's like,

301
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:34.061
I just need a number or something in mind that I can hold in place as an

302
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:38.900
objective by the end of the year,
if,
uh,
I mean,
double,
double,

303
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.820
double body weight back squat is,
uh,
you know,

304
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.100
it's a very achievable goal,
but it's a challenging goal,
right?

305
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.140
Um,
triple bodyweight deadlift is,
is,
is pretty extreme,
right?

306
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.270
Two and a half times is,
is,
is pretty good.

307
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.260
Obviously there's exceptions is if you're a specialist,
right?
But you know,

308
00:15:57.261 --> 00:16:01.320
and then you talk about like a bench press,
I dunno,
two,

309
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.130
one and a half times body weight,
right?
You start talking about these numbers,

310
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:04.730
right?
Sure.

311
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:09.050
But in theory we want to think about is how is my overall fitness looking like,

312
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:11.120
you know,
I'm the guy where,
you know,

313
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:15.350
I've ran a five 40 mile and I've backed school,
had the same day,
you know,

314
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:18.810
for 50 that's,
that was my goal.
But there's some guys like,

315
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.730
like our buddy Mark Bell who wants to swag squat 1000 pounds but can't run 400

316
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.010
meters.
He probably can,
but it'll take them awhile.

317
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.810
You may not a good time or just period good time.
But you know,

318
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.870
that's why you know,
the people,
you don't evaluate their goals.
Right.
And,
and,

319
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.070
and see what they're trying to do.

320
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.010
For me it's a blend of all these different things cause then they carry over

321
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:38.720
into so many different things.
You know,
I can go mountain biking,

322
00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:42.740
I can go snowboarding,
I can go Jujitsu,
I don't need to worry about it.
Right.

323
00:16:42.741 --> 00:16:47.120
But if I was only lifting or only doing cardio,
I wouldn't have those carryovers.

324
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.130
And you mentioned gymnastic.

325
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.880
So the powerlifting components and gymnastic components before say Olympic
lifts.

326
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.460
Yeah,
you can do them all simultaneously.
No,
totally.

327
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:58.400
But I'm wondering within the gymnastic components,

328
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.640
which do you think have the,

329
00:17:01.641 --> 00:17:05.240
our foundational or have the most carryover to many other things?
Yeah,
I mean,

330
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:07.400
that's a great question.
I think in the gymnastics realm,

331
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.390
and so I think a good program combines,
you know,
powerlifting,
gymnastics,
um,

332
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:11.661
you know,

333
00:17:11.661 --> 00:17:15.020
obviously your traditional cardiovascular types and then the Olympic lifts are

334
00:17:15.021 --> 00:17:18.710
beautiful because they've just put it all together.
Now,
gymnastics in particular,

335
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.780
I think the pushup is a staple,
right?

336
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.840
You should be able to do a pushup in a good position,
right?

337
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:27.500
Where you're in a good elbow position where it's very practical,
right.

338
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:32.300
On pressing this way.
I'm pressing this way,
I'm pressing this way in a dip.
Right?

339
00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:35.570
Can we see what a good pushup looks like versus,
I mean,
in theory,
right?

340
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:36.870
A lot of people in,
they do their up,

341
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:41.280
they love to kind of push it up through all those.
Right?
Now that position,
right,

342
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.840
puts some strain on the shoulder.
And what it also does is it's not functional,

343
00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:47.540
right?
Imagine if your car had gas.
You wouldn't push like this.
Right?

344
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:48.531
And so in theory,

345
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:52.410
what we're really thinking about is here my head goes forward a little bit,

346
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.100
my elbows stay more or less in.
Now this transfer here,

347
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.170
right transfers into things like,
right.
He hands the hand,

348
00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.090
right?
A transfers into a dip transfer is all these different things.

349
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:08.250
So that's the position we're looking for.
And how do you develop that?

350
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.630
Obvious you can do on your knees,
your head comes forward.
My body stays rigid,

351
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.750
my elbows,
Stan.
That's a great way to develop it.
Got It.

352
00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:19.340
So you're doing it like a very mild,
not a plan Shlain exactly.
But you're,

353
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.590
you're rocking your entire body weight forward slightly so that your forums or

354
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:23.580
more.
That's right.

355
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.910
Which gets me not tripod position and use for handstand pushups.

356
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:31.860
The tripod head forward,
hands back.
What's a,
you mentioned Mark Bell.

357
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:32.970
What are,

358
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:38.090
what are some of the things that you've learned by hanging out with Mark Bell in

359
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:40.620
other top tier power lifters?

360
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.260
What are some of the things that you've served incorporated for yourself or

361
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:47.820
learned?
I mean those guys,
you know,
Mark Bell,
the Louie Simmons of the world,

362
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:51.710
I mean these guys just,
you know,
I remember not eight years ago,
you don't,

363
00:18:51.711 --> 00:18:52.800
I'm a young guy.

364
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.080
I Walk in Louie Simmons Gym and there's five guys back squatting,
you know,

365
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.530
800 pounds.
One is bleeding out their nose.

366
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.600
And what I learned from that experience,

367
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:03.570
right is that what you said is that I was at Westside barbell is just the

368
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:06.090
dedication to the craft.
Right?
And that's inspiring.
Well,

369
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.100
no matter what you do is the dedication to the craft,
right?

370
00:19:08.101 --> 00:19:09.480
If you're a Barista would be really good at it.

371
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.890
So in Mark's really good at is he's really good at his craft and then obviously

372
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:16.980
in his craft,
his passion for coaching is really inspiring for me.

373
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.660
And then obviously his ability to then transfer that into helping people improve

374
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:25.530
their lifts is,
is,
is really great.
Cause that's what inspires me.
What,
uh,

375
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.130
what have you observed?
What makes them a good coach?
Because I mean,

376
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:31.500
you're a very good coach.
So what,
what makes,
when you've watched mark,

377
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.100
you're like,
hmm.
Kind of taking mental notes or observing what he's doing.
Right.

378
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.710
What makes them a good coach?
And then the second part,

379
00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:41.070
which you can answer first if you want,
is as it relates to the power lifts,

380
00:19:41.071 --> 00:19:45.870
are there any particular technical modifications or programming thoughts,

381
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:50.640
anything that you've,
uh,
borrowed or tested from some of those guys?
I mean,

382
00:19:50.641 --> 00:19:54.270
I would see what,
what makes him a good coach is that he comes off as authentic,

383
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.480
right?
He practices what he preaches,
which I think is very important.
Um,

384
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.460
and he comes off like he really cares legitimately about getting that person's

385
00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:03.660
movement better.

386
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.820
But most importantly is that he's also open minded enough to recognize that

387
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.380
there's different systems,
different body types,
different whatever.

388
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.500
And he's not judging people.
He's just saying,
hey,
give us a shot.

389
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.750
It might not be for everybody,
but give us a shot.
Right.

390
00:20:15.751 --> 00:20:18.450
And I think that's what's really inspiring because you have some of these people

391
00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:20.940
who are at the top of their game and they said,
no,
we have to do it this way.

392
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.660
It's like,
well,
what if my femur is too long or whatever.
You know,

393
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.330
and I think that's what's really cool about mark as a kind of,
you know,

394
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.510
takes whatever you can from each person and incorporates it.

395
00:20:29.511 --> 00:20:31.890
And I think in regards to technique,
you know,

396
00:20:31.891 --> 00:20:34.800
you see people set up from the delta,
from the top,
set up from the bottom,

397
00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:37.510
do different types of things,
and then you say,
set up,
what do you mean by that?

398
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:41.520
Really just brace a position,
right?
Shoulder,
back,
position,
brace,
belly.

399
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:46.320
Everything's engager at peak tension,
right?
Some people,
uh,
you know,
connect here,

400
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.380
reach down,
grab and just go right?
Some people for me,
right?

401
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.300
I like to step in and dealt a little bit different.
I to go down to the delivery,

402
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.110
Kenneth,
have a rounded back,
have a rounded position.

403
00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:00.400
Then right before I'm ready to go right in this position,
I set everything.
Boom.

404
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:02.960
I set the back,
I set the shoulders,
I pulled a bar in,

405
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.490
I'm tightening lats and I lift.
That's what I like to do.
Um,

406
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.870
and so really looking at mark and in different types of people as you pick up on

407
00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:13.540
these techniques.
But most importantly is just the foundation of movement.

408
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:18.070
It's underload never move your spine.
That's,
I mean,
that's a critical piece.

409
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:20.290
Whether you're pressing overhead,
you're,
you're,

410
00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:23.710
you're doing a deadlift or you're squatting.
Once you connect head to hip,

411
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.700
just stay there.
Got It.
So that orientation should not change.
That's right.

412
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.050
Whatever orientation that is.
Right.

413
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:31.720
So let's just say you're here and maybe your back has a slight,

414
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.750
maybe your thoracics little rounded from st the computer too long or whatever,

415
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:37.530
right.
Hold that position obviously is not favorable.

416
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.000
Try and work for a better position,
but whatever you do,

417
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:43.690
just hold it there because as soon as you start moving that spinal or load,

418
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.320
all of a sudden the load finds that,
that,
that tension position and you start,

419
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:47.860
you know,

420
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.740
putting yourself more at risk of injury started bending the paper clip in ways

421
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:55.060
you shouldn't been.
The paper clip.
That's right.
What are some keys to,

422
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:57.020
let's say you have a,
a dead lifter.
Yeah.
It,

423
00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:02.070
who is pulling three 15 in a sort of a,

424
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.270
not a super wide sumo stance but sort of uh,
uh,

425
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.630
it's like Ed coan moderate,
yeah.
Moderate stance and he's,

426
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.970
he pulled three 15 buddies.
He's hit that point where it's like,

427
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:16.450
I can't make more than five reps with three 15.
Uh,

428
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.600
what points would you look to tweak or experiment with,
uh,

429
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.330
to help that person if you believe that they could get to say 400 or beyond?

430
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.630
I mean it,
when they were trying to guess,
it might not be a great question.

431
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.630
I would say also just generally speaking,
like what are the,

432
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.230
the keys to the deadlift and when you have somebody starting with the deadlift,

433
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.420
do you start them conventional sumo,

434
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.960
a Hex Bar?
If it depends what,
how does it,
how do you determine that?

435
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.350
I just love to hear.
I,
I'm fascinated by the deadlift.
So for us,

436
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.520
any thoughts on the deadline for us at our gym,
right.
Nc Fit,
we always start,

437
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.170
we always start conventional.

438
00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:56.290
And the reason why I like conventionalist cause the carryover into the clean and

439
00:22:56.291 --> 00:23:00.640
the snatch.
So is there anything wrong as to Modelo?
Absolutely not.
Right?

440
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:03.520
Plenty of lifters lift that way,
but for us,

441
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.030
we like the conventional stance because it carries over into the clean.

442
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.420
It carries over into the snatch,
right?
That's what we like it.
Now,

443
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.420
what I would say to this gentleman that stuck at three 15 is yes,

444
00:23:13.421 --> 00:23:14.231
I look at his position.

445
00:23:14.231 --> 00:23:16.960
So one of the things I look at right is when he's in this position,

446
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.040
is he in this position or is he creating that peak tension on the hamstring by

447
00:23:21.041 --> 00:23:24.040
really engaging it by pointing his knees back and as he stands,

448
00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.710
he really pointing his knees back,
or is it kind of going up and around?
Right?

449
00:23:26.711 --> 00:23:27.970
I look for those type of things,
right?

450
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.960
He is he getting the most out of his hamstrings that he can.

451
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.460
And then the next thing I would do is start looking at,
you know,

452
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.930
different types of components to start building up those strengths,

453
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.510
whether it be deficit,
dead lifts,
right?
At lighter loads,

454
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.430
whether it'd be banded deadlifts,
whether it be changed.
Let's explain.

455
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.510
So depths that dead lift would be when you elevate your feet so that you're

456
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:44.740
going lower than usual.

457
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.710
And that's a really valuable tool specifically for the Olympic lifts as well.

458
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.290
So one of the things that's very challenging about the Olympic lifts,

459
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.500
the most important thing about the Olympic lifts is holding positions,
right?

460
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.680
So when you're off the floor and your Olympic lifting,
right when you're here,

461
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:58.790
as I drive up,

462
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:03.791
my only goal until I get to here is to maintain the ratio for my head to hit.

463
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.520
And this whole contact point.
Now the problem is as the weight gets heavier,

464
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.820
right?
This wants to pull you forward.
This wants around your back.

465
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.970
This wants to kind of make you do one of these and see you have to resist that

466
00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:17.450
change.
One of the ways you can incorporate that,
assuming you get hold,

467
00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:19.190
good spine position with your hamstrings,

468
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:22.790
flexibility is to stand on top of the plate and now you go from a little bit

469
00:24:22.791 --> 00:24:23.660
lower,
right?

470
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:27.800
But that's a good training drill for the deadlift is from a deficit position.

471
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.780
If you have the flexibility that position to do so.

472
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.730
So you mentioned a few things that I want to touch on because I think they're

473
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:38.450
super important.
So we were talking about the push up a little earlier and you,

474
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.550
you observed rather than flaring your elbows out,

475
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.030
which has very little transferred to other movements you wanted to have,

476
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.860
you want to mimic a position that you will then be able to use in other types of

477
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:52.490
movements and sports.
So for the deadlift,
uh,

478
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.520
it seems like you're assessing a very similarly where you're asking what is the

479
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:59.870
depth of position that will give us the greatest degree of transfer for other

480
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.540
movements?
Yeah.
That we find valuable.
Uh,

481
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.720
what are some other mistakes that people make with exercises such as flaring the

482
00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:10.400
elbows out in the pushup?

483
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.420
Are there other common mistakes where you look at it and you're like a not a

484
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:15.890
very stable position that B,

485
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.650
it's not going to help you in the other 12th things we want to get good at?

486
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:19.580
I'd say mostly,

487
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.040
I would say the biggest one answer your question has range of motion.

488
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.000
That's the biggest one.
When we talk about range of motion,
whether it be uh,

489
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:30.070
you know,
and here's an important thing to kind of kick kick to,
you know,

490
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:35.150
people who are listening to this is that I would look at movements that move a

491
00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:35.781
large load,

492
00:25:35.781 --> 00:25:39.980
a long distance quickly that carry a barbell and object a long distance.

493
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.220
I would look at these high moving movers for example,

494
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.390
like risk curls or calf raises or shoulder shrugs.

495
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:51.470
They don't produce much power because you're not moving that much weight,

496
00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.340
that long a distance.
So if you think about like for example,
key produce,

497
00:25:55.341 --> 00:25:59.660
more power in a squat,
right?
All the way down,
all the way up the load on you,

498
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.370
right?
You're moving your body so far,

499
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.720
or can you produce more power the calf raise,
right?
So at first recommend,
hey,

500
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.140
let's look at doing these type of movements like a thruster,
right?

501
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:13.910
Or a burpee verse,
a Bicep Curl,
right?
And the application that's associated.

502
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.460
Secondly,
let's look at your range of motion.

503
00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.910
So if you're going to say you're gonna do a squat,
right?
Let's not go to here.

504
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.830
Let's try and take the crease of the hip or the knee joint.

505
00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.220
We are knee was designed as a hinge.
So when I sit on a low toilet,

506
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.190
I can get back up again without having to use my hands.
Right.

507
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.810
Hard to do.
I'm sure if you've been,
Zeus had some time in Asia,

508
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.580
there's like everybody's really comfortable down in this kind of position,

509
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.690
which is right in Japan.
They go uncle Swati,
which is the shit spot.
But uh,
yeah,

510
00:26:41.691 --> 00:26:45.060
you don't have dip bars to help you get out of that position.
So I was,

511
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.051
I saw a woman,

512
00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:48.750
I was on an airplane yesterday and she had a really tough time getting the chair

513
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.770
and like I helped her out of the chair,
ray,
of course.
But my thing is,
you know,

514
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.390
a program that we do should help us outside the gym,
right?

515
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.920
Whatever I do in here,

516
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.190
shit most benefit me for outside the gym said this recommends the quality of

517
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:03.450
life that I'm looking for forever.

518
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.300
And there's certain movements that has don't carry over very well.
Right.

519
00:27:06.301 --> 00:27:08.790
And there's certain ones that carry over really well,
like the dead lift,

520
00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:11.460
the squat in the press.
Uh,
would you mind,

521
00:27:11.461 --> 00:27:13.500
we talked a little bit about the back squat.

522
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:17.640
Would you mind showing us what a proper front squat it looks like?

523
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.400
Maybe if you wouldn't mind facing out this way and it's a little unnatural,

524
00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:24.590
but yeah,
I'm very curious to see what a proper front it looks like they're,

525
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.390
there's,
so how to think about when you introduce that?
Yes,

526
00:27:27.391 --> 00:27:30.000
there's several different types of squats,
right?
You have the overhead squat,

527
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.580
the front squat,
the back squat,
and then just basically the,

528
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.940
there's other types too,
right?
High Bar,
low bar,
this,
that.

529
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.250
But the point is is that each,

530
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.300
each one loads the system a little bit differently.
So take an overhead squat,

531
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:46.590
you're putting that load way over your head.
So now what happens is this,

532
00:27:46.591 --> 00:27:51.591
this object is now so far away from your center of mass that it puts more

533
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.940
momentum,
more,
more force onto your midline to control it like a wrench.

534
00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:59.880
If you had a small wrench,
right?
It doesn't create that much torque people,

535
00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:01.950
long wrench creates a lot of torque.
So the overhead squat,

536
00:28:01.951 --> 00:28:05.040
it's Kinda like the king for that.
But in regards to the front squat,
one of the,

537
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.920
one of the benefits of the front squat and one of the reasons why I love it is

538
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:11.190
for again the carryover.
Why?
Because we receive a clean here,

539
00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:14.100
we do thrusters here.
There's a lot more carryover in this position.

540
00:28:14.101 --> 00:28:16.110
So one of the things that I do if I'm front squatting,
right,

541
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:20.490
cause I focused on just be aware of that.
But like my,

542
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.060
my go down for the count,
we'll see.
We got three small fingers,
right?

543
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.390
What I'm looking for right is barely to keep my fingers on this bar because

544
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:29.520
eventually if I'm death gripping it,
which is fine,

545
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.670
I can't get the bar as high up in my throat.
So what I'm looking for,
right,

546
00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:36.030
just putting the pads of your finger on it.
Yeah.
So I'll,
I'll warm it up,
right?

547
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.960
I'll make sure my lats are warmed up in here and this is really what's tight.

548
00:28:39.961 --> 00:28:42.300
So a lot of people complain about risk payment needed front squats.

549
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.750
The reason why they complain about that so they can't get their elbow up.

550
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:46.830
So we think about it,

551
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.580
the risk flection is not any further than if you just did a push up on the
floor.

552
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.890
But in reality,
what it really actually is,

553
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.850
is your lats being so tight that you can't get your elbow in a position to then

554
00:28:56.851 --> 00:28:59.460
open you up.
Do you warm up your lats or,

555
00:28:59.461 --> 00:29:02.730
or ensure the of the proper range of motion in your lats with anything other

556
00:29:02.731 --> 00:29:05.310
than this particular type of world where,
where'd you find this to be enough?

557
00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.710
I find this to be enough salt.
I'll go back and forth.

558
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.450
I'll put the bar on my shoulder,
right?
And I'll start working it out.

559
00:29:10.451 --> 00:29:15.120
So let's just say I'm in here right now.
I'm kind of working,
it can open up.

560
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.380
I would take a little bit time here,
right?
Yep.
And then,
you know what I mean?

561
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:22.410
A minute,
two minutes,
a minute.
And you know,
you can also go up to the bar,

562
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:25.140
you can open up your lats by just holding onto the bar and kind of dragging your

563
00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:28.380
head through the window.
Right?
Well,
let's just see.
You're in here now.

564
00:29:28.381 --> 00:29:31.650
A lot of people,
we want to death grip it and do this,
right?

565
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.310
The problem with this is right now I'm supporting it and it's like carrying

566
00:29:35.311 --> 00:29:38.580
groceries in,
in,
in the store.
If I carry groceries out here,

567
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:41.830
it's can be really hard for carry groceries rep against my really easy.

568
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.370
Same thing applies here.
So the bar is right up against my throat,
right?

569
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.810
What I'm focused on is I want to think like there's basically laser beams coming

570
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.910
at the ends of my elbows.
As I squat,

571
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.730
I want those laser beams to plant the wall in front of me.

572
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.010
And the reason for that is the hierarchy of my elbows.

573
00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.370
The more the bars that against my throat,
the closer is my center of mass,

574
00:30:00.371 --> 00:30:01.630
the lighter it's going to make the object.

575
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:03.583
<v 1>Hm.</v>

576
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.910
<v 0>So as to send down the exact same thing,
right?
I would sit back into it,</v>

577
00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.220
right?
Elbows up in this position.
Boom,
exact same thing.

578
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:16.940
But really the key here,
right?
Loose grip,

579
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.320
elbows up over the lat to get there.
And uh,

580
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.600
if you had to pick or wanted to pick,

581
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.590
say front squat or overhead squat,

582
00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:32.330
would you choose the front squat or do you find for overall benefit and transfer

583
00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:37.040
the,
the overhead squat to be in some way?
I would say for night,

584
00:30:37.041 --> 00:30:39.590
for most people I'd recommend back squat,

585
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:43.370
right then front squat because it's a little bit harder to get into a good

586
00:30:43.371 --> 00:30:46.490
position on a friend's car and he's going to back squat.
It requires some time.

587
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:50.030
Yeah,
right.
Another drill and it was kind of open for last,
right here.
Right.

588
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.820
So what I would say is back spots king then Francois,

589
00:30:53.821 --> 00:30:56.520
cause I think it has a huge carryover prom mistakes,
limited time,

590
00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.210
get to open up the lats now at the overhead squat,
right.

591
00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:02.000
One of the problems we see with the overhead squat,
oops,

592
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:05.540
that was my big shoulder mobility,
right?
So if your shoulders are tight,
skinny,

593
00:31:05.541 --> 00:31:10.470
very challenging for you to sit up here
and squat down,

594
00:31:10.471 --> 00:31:13.590
right?
Because there's so many things.
I mean,
if you look at my position,
right?

595
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:17.730
The bars over my head as I descend down,
right?
Naturally this bar,

596
00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:19.470
and he's a sales my center of mass.
So what I do,

597
00:31:19.471 --> 00:31:22.560
I pull the bar back a little bit.
Not My shoulders are tight.

598
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.250
One of the problems I have there is I can't get the bar back,

599
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.910
so then I end up doing this.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
Very challenging.

600
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.710
Smarick munitions,
back squat,
front squat,
overhead squat.
Some you should do,

601
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.820
you should start with a PVC pipe over your shoulders,
uh,
down,
whatever,

602
00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:44.010
and then get there.
Cool.
Thank you sir.
Hope you enjoyed the video.
