1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.870
Optimal,
minimal.
At this altitude,

2
00:00:02.871 --> 00:00:06.080
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.810
You posted a question.

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.450
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

5
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.590
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by zip recruiter.</v>

6
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.070
You may have heard them everywhere.
They're growing like crazy.

7
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.760
They're an innovative platform for doing several things,

8
00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:37.710
but especially improving the hiring process,

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.290
making it slick and elegant and easy.

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.140
One of the hardest parts of running any business,

11
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:47.400
growing any business is finding and hiring the right team.

12
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:52.080
I've seen this firsthand in close to a hundred startups now,
God,

13
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:56.440
I'm getting old from all over the world at different stages of growth and

14
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.470
nothing can quite drain your resources and cost you time and money like making

15
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:03.310
mistakes in hiring.

16
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.870
Ziprecruiter developed their own system and their own platform for helping you

17
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.310
to solve two of the biggest problems and bottlenecks for employers,

18
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.910
posting jobs easily and then making it even easier to find the best candidates.

19
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.480
Unlike other job sites,

20
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.260
ZipRecruiter does in effect the opposite of what you'd expect.

21
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.310
So they do not depend on candidates finding you there.

22
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:31.760
Technology finds the right candidate for you,
and in fact,

23
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:35.570
more than 80% of the jobs posted on ZipRecruiter return a qualified candidate

24
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.830
based on your criteria that you select in just 24 hours.

25
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.090
So no more juggling email,
reviewing hundreds of unqualified candidates.

26
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.260
I've been there,
done that.

27
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:49.070
Don't recommend it or dealing with calls to the office,
et Cetera.
None of that.

28
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.990
Simply screen rate and manage your candidates all in one place on Ziprecruiter's

29
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:58.700
dashboard and as a listener of the Tim Ferriss show,
thanks for that.

30
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.930
Ziprecruiter wants to allow you to start posting jobs and trying their services

31
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:04.700
for free.
So if you're thinking of hiring somebody,

32
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:07.840
you need to find any and executive assistant you need to find a developer,

33
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.560
whatever it might be tried out.

34
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.710
Just visit zip recruiter.com forward slash Tim and you can experience just how

35
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.620

36
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:22.290
qualified job candidates.

37
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.280
that's ziprecruiter.com forward slash.
Tim,
check it out.
Give it a spin.

38
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.920
This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for many,
many years.

39
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.850
It comes with me everywhere on my telephone and my pocket.

40
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.150
I love audio books and they are one of my favorite ways to pass the time.

41
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:47.490
More than that,
to indulge myself,

42
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.790
to educate myself with time that would otherwise go to waste in some respects

43
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:55.460
when I'm taking walks,
when I'm cooking,

44
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:57.980
cleaning up the house on the road for travel,
whatever,

45
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:01.720
and those in between or as a secondary activity.

46
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.750
I love using audible to help me transform my downtime in a way.

47
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.300
And it's allowed me to consume more books,

48
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.860
many more books than I would otherwise.

49
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.940
You can access an unbeatable selection of bestsellers,
mysteries,
thrillers,

50
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.590
and anything you could possibly imagine really I've two to recommend right off

51
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:23.140
the bat one.
Uh,

52
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.440
and they recommended this even for nonfiction purists.

53
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.240
This is a fiction book ready player,
one by Ernest Cline,
alright,

54
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.320
that's read by Wil Wheaton Ready Player,
one buyer in his client,
check it out.

55
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:40.060
The reviews are bonkers and this has a cult following.
Check it out.

56
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.340
And then very selfishly,

57
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.140
I'll mention one that I put together with one of you guys with actually a

58
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:51.820
listener of the podcast who is also a huge fan of Seneca.

59
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.910
So the book is Tao of Seneca Tao,

60
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.390
Tao of Seneca,
s,
e n,
e,
c,
a subtitle,
practical letters from a stoic master.

61
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:06.391
And this is effectively an introduction to what I view as the ultimate operating

62
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:10.780
system for thriving in high stress environments.
That is stoicism.

63
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:14.470
It's become very popular among top athletic coaches,
CEOs,

64
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:18.340
a faster growing companies.
So checking out that is for nonfiction,

65
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.700
folks who must read or listen to nonfiction Tao of Seneca,

66
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.160
practical letters from a stoic master.

67
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.400
And as a listener of the Tim Ferriss show,

68
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.960
you have access to a 30 day trial and your first audio book is freak.

69
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.290
So why not go grab one of those ready player one or town of Seneca,

And unlike streaming,
you own your books once they have been downloaded.

74
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.210
And I like to listen oftentimes when I'm offline.

75
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.040
So you have that benefit as well.

76
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.720
You can't make more time folks just not manufacturing anymore.

77
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.510
It's out of print.
Uh,

78
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:08.950
but you can make the most of it a turn your travel,

Hello boys and girls.
Sasquatch is and squirrels if that's a thing.

82
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:23.944
This is Tim Ferriss.

83
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.510
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show and I am sitting listening to

84
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:31.930
people whack myths and banana bags.

85
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.480
I'm imagining doing Moy Tai while I have positioned myself in what's known as

86
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:42.481
the cat room with red padding over all the walls at on its headquarters here in

87
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:46.120
Austin,
Texas.
Check out on it.

88
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.270
Oh and then [inaudible] dot com not a paid mentioned.

89
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:51.460
Just a thank you and hat tip to Mister Aubrey.

90
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.100
Thank you sir for lending me your space for recording.

91
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.610
This episode is a much requested follow up with Esther Perel at [inaudible] pro

92
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.590
e s t h e r p e r e l on tweak [inaudible] who has been called the most

93
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:14.381
important game changer in sexuality and relational health since Doctor Ruth and

94
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.430
since I first met as there I've spent more and more time with her and the more

95
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:24.290
time I spend with her the more impressed I am.
She is the real deal and very,

96
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:25.100
very insightful.

97
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.570
Her Ted talks on maintaining desire and rethinking infidelity have at this point

98
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:34.400
probably more than 20 million views and she's both seen and tested everything

99
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:39.401
imaginable firsthand with couples in 34 years of running her private therapy

100
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:44.030
practice in New York City as is the author of the international bestseller

101
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:46.520
mating in captivity.
You've probably heard of it,

102
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.860
which has been translated into 26 languages.

103
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.090
She is fluent in nine of those languages.

104
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:57.860
I've heard her in person use them and as Belgian native she now brings her

105
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.360
multicultural pulse to a new book which I highly recommend checking out the

106
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:06.360
state of affairs,
subtitle,
rethinking infidelity.

107
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.690
Her creative energy is currently also focused on,
uh,

108
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.070
the creation and hosting of an audible original audio series.

109
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.810
We or should we begin?

110
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.700
But the state of affairs is worth checking out in this episode as their answers

111
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.220
your most upvoted questions,

112
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.170
including how to foster relationship or marriage longevity,

113
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.290
the most effective ways to improve communication in relationships,

114
00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:32.460
how to deal with criticism,

115
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.520
letting go of emotional baggage from past relationships,

116
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.690
how to know when to move on from a relationship that just doesn't seem to be

117
00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:41.400
working and much,

118
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:46.430
much more if you like s three or you're going to love this and her episode is

119
00:07:46.651 --> 00:07:49.980
one of the most downloaded of all time previously.

120
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.380
So here is more of the good stuff.

121
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.530
Please enjoy this wildly interesting in my opinion,

122
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.100
Q and a from your questions with Esther Perel.

123
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:02.603
<v 2>Hi,</v>

124
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.400
thanks for sending in your questions and let's dive in.

125
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.720
So this is a question from Gregoire briefly via Facebook.

126
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.060
The guts to ask her how to foster marriage longevity and he exercises with teens

127
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.350
or habit would be great,

128
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.220
especially around fostering deeper emotional relationships.

129
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.520
There is the first basics,

130
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.230
appreciation to simply seeing a lot of nice things,

131
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.090
not taking things for granted and not forgetting to say thank you and please

132
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:38.450
just because it's the person that you live with.
Making complements,

133
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.370
holding hands,
kissing,
stroking,
sending sweet notes,

134
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.360
buying flowers,
preparing breakfast,
bringing the coffee to bed,

135
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.450
all those sweet things that people do that basically let you know that you're,

136
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:54.320
that they live inside of you,

137
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.730
that you're thinking of them even when they're not there.

138
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.630
These daily appreciations do they go a long way and it's sometimes it's a real

139
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:08.001
diligent effort to keep doing them and then I am a strong fan of letter writing.

140
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.990
I think that when you fly away,
when you're away,
when you're sitting in a cafe,

141
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:17.580
when you just have a moment to drop a note that is not just on the birthdays and

142
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:22.370
on the anniversaries,
just kind of your,
your own musings about do about you'd,

143
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.320
you'd likes together your dreams,
where you're going,
how you met,

144
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:26.970
what you remember,
what you fancy.

145
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:32.310
That is actually very much the kind of the telling of the story.
You know,

146
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:37.340
the story of the couple there is a lot of intimacy in their touch is a major

147
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:38.760
experience of intimacy.

148
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.480
I think when you do that Uma and things that kind of really encouraged the other

149
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:49.590
person in which you recognize the material at their most authentic good,

150
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:53.400
do this thing.
This is really something you really like.
Take a few more days.

151
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.860
You know,
you want it to always take this class,

152
00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.850
take this class kind of ways in which you encourage the other person to,

153
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.300
to be the best version of themselves and vice versa.

154
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:10.300
Be the best version of yourself with them.
It's really basic.
Uh,

155
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.790
what makes a relationship sustain itself and be um,

156
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.190
be more nurturing.
Next,

157
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:22.610
Alicia Behnia Eichelberger via Facebook asks how to lessen arguments in your

158
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:25.200
marriage.
Look,

159
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.880
I think it's all about the art of speaking and listening.
You know,

160
00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:30.714
there was a,

161
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.830
a sculpture a few years back by Bruce Noman and it was a world peace project and

162
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:40.860
he had 23 inch monitors with faces of the most diverse group of people,

163
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.660
diverse races,
ethnicities,
gender,
ages,
all of it.
And every single person,

164
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.460
every face was saying,
I'll talk and you listen,
you talk and I'll listen.

165
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.640
They'll talk and we listen.
You talk and we listen.

166
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.850
And it just showed you this,
the,
the,

167
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.660
the robustness of this most difficult arts,

168
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.870
which often I would say listening is harder than speaking.

169
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.580
But then for some people,

170
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:09.420
maybe speaking actually becomes the hardest thing in a relationship.

171
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.420
You can often get the daily hassles in which you are grinding at each other.

172
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.230
And um,
in which there's a friction going on.

173
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.560
Don't sweat the small things is probably really important in terms of,
uh,
um,

174
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.710
how people deal with the arguments in a relationship.

175
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.590
I would say,
don't complain,

176
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.510
ask behind every criticism.
There's often a wish.
And if,

177
00:11:36.511 --> 00:11:39.660
because if you believe that your partner has done something wrong,

178
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:42.390
that they didn't pay a bill on time or anything,
um,

179
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.970
and you wish that they had done it right,

180
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.610
but instead of asking them to correct it,

181
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.100
you basically tell him that he can never do it.
Well that you,

182
00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:52.140
they're doing this on purpose,
that,
you know,

183
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:56.140
just ask them to do it better next time,
you know,
rather than would it kill you,

184
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.100
you know,
something simply do you think that next time,
you know,

185
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:02.290
you could set a monthly alerts so that you don't forget,

186
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.160
it's a very different tone.
It's a very different way of relating to the person.

187
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.810
There is no contempt in that one,

188
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.700
which we know from the research of John Gutman is one of the four horses of

189
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:14.140
apocalypse.
Actually,

190
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.100
I'm going to give you the four horses get hit really important.
One is criticism,

191
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.760
contempt,
stonewalling and defensiveness.

192
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.380
Dose for a pretty much the,
the,
the killers in the,

193
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:30.370
in the land of arguments and relationship.
The client,
you know,

194
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.340
try not to talk with categorical of all,

195
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.850
always and never all or nothing.
Um,

196
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.880
that probably is one of the most important changes in vocabulary.

197
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.950
Um,
banish them.
You know,
I always have to ask you,
you never do this.
No.

198
00:12:46.951 --> 00:12:48.370
But the moment you say you never deal,

199
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.400
the person's going to come up with the one time that they know and that they've

200
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:54.760
done it so that they can defeat your argument rather than really understand that

201
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:59.170
you're asking them to do it more often,
which is exactly why I see ask,

202
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:00.040
don't complain,

203
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.900
add some humor at some humor is nothing that's going to diffuse your arguments

204
00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:08.080
more than just putting some perspective into it and not take yourself so

205
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:12.100
seriously.
So empathy at the end of the day,
you know,

206
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.120
as soon that you burn,

207
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:17.200
it has the same interest as you to solve the stresses in your relationship and

208
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:18.040
for that to happen.

209
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:21.640
It's one that both of you understand and appreciate the other person's point of

210
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:22.474
view.

211
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.040
Do you really think that the other person wants you to purposefully be annoyed

212
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.620
or hurt you or let you down?
Probably not.
Um,

213
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.660
it's all of that shift that takes you out of relationships that are mired in

214
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:38.704
bickering,

215
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.800
chronic low intensity warfare or high conflict because there's a range there.

216
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.610
Okay.
Imagine I asked you as you arguing,

217
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.760
turns toxic as in does burner keep telling you that you can never do it right or

218
00:13:54.611 --> 00:13:56.290
that they can never do it right by you?

219
00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.220
That every little convo about who should set the table will end up in a blowout

220
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.360
about how dysfunctional the relationship is or that two minutes,

221
00:14:04.361 --> 00:14:05.440
eight minutes into a fight,

222
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.200
one of you is saying we should get a divorce or we should break up.

223
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.870
That's what I'm calling a high conflict couple.

224
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.060
The opposite of the arguments is you come in and you see,

225
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.990
I want to listen to what you have to say.
I want to apologize.

226
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.200
What can I do to make this better and not?

227
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:28.201
What can you do to make this better shifted around and you'll have magic

228
00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:29.770
happening.
Okay.

229
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.470
Next question from Ben.
Ultimate about jealousy,

230
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:41.190
how the majority of nonexclusive relationships I've seen seem to get done in by

231
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:44.080
one of two parties feeling possessive.

232
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:49.530
How do we read ourselves from these negative emotions when I think that jealousy

233
00:14:49.631 --> 00:14:53.600
is intrinsic to love,
I don't think of it as a negative emotion.

234
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.990
It is part and parcel of the experience.

235
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.190
I think that sometimes it's an interesting experience in particularly in the US

236
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:07.190
where people often will say,
I'm not jealous cause I'm angry as if jealousy is,

237
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.560
is a feeling that is politically incorrect.

238
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.420
It doesn't have much popularity these days.
Jealousy is an erotic rage.

239
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.230
Jealousy is the feeling you have when your partner takes their love,

240
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:18.891
their desire,

241
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:23.120
their excitement to someone else and you wanted more directed toward you,

242
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.540
it is toward away from you.
Um,

243
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.600
so I don't suggest that you read yourself from that emotion.

244
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:33.800
I suggest that you integrate the emotion.
It tells you something,
it,

245
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.240
it generates action.

246
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.610
It generates conversations and it is not the same as possessiveness.

247
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.000
They're related,
but they're not the same.
On the other end,

248
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.360
he was a simple formula for possessiveness.

249
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.850
If you love someone,
set them free.
If they love you,
they'll come back.

250
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:57.730
Joseph Dibella dope posted this question on Twitter is the,

251
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:02.000
what is the best way to move on after divorce and deal with post-marriage

252
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.560
depression,
sadness,

253
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.000
especially for men who find it difficult to speak about their inner pain of the

254
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:12.650
divorce.
And the lack of connection.
Joseph,
I'm going to tell you something.

255
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:18.070
Men have a much harder time post divorce emotionally and physically than women.

256
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.160
Maybe not financially,
but in every other respect they do.

257
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.830
Uh,
they suffer much more.
They're more at risk for accidents,
for drinking.

258
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:28.431
Uh,

259
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:33.431
they take a hit because they need women even though they want to pretend that

260
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.150
they don't.
Uh,
it goes against the cultural narrative.

261
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.610
I think that what you have in this moment is two things.
One,

262
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.650
you absolutely want to reach out,

263
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.490
and I think if you have friends that you can talk to,
that would be great.

264
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:54.410
Male or female friends.
If you want to go to a men's retreat to a men's group,

265
00:16:54.411 --> 00:16:57.260
there is nothing comparable to it at this point.

266
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.640
Then groups where guys come together to talk about their inner life,

267
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.310
what's going on with them.
It's empowering.

268
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.800
It builds solidarity.

269
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:11.030
It takes you out of the loneliness of the shame out of the isolation,

270
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:13.820
out of the feeling of failure,
all of it,
all of it.

271
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:19.390
There's nothing more powerful than a group of people that come together and hold

272
00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:24.260
one person,
well that person can't hold themselves.
It's a spiritual challenge.

273
00:17:24.261 --> 00:17:28.490
It's not just a relationship challenge.
So you need to go get energy,

274
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:33.650
you're depleted and one of the ways that you get energy is by going to do

275
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.520
something for others.
Go help others.
The research is very clear.

276
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.090
The most powerful antidepressant is doing for other people.

277
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.520
It puts things in perspective.

278
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.740
It makes you feel like you have something to offer.

279
00:17:45.741 --> 00:17:48.710
It makes you feel appreciated by the people whom you're helping.

280
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.760
It changes the entire equation of what's going on inside of you.
Um,

281
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.390
right.
I think journaling is an important part of morning.

282
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.850
On occasion,
if it works out,

283
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.880
it may be a good thing to have a final conversation with your eggs and bit of

284
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:08.970
time later where you kind of clear things and you try to have a different

285
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:12.420
conversation than the ones that you had when things really tanked.

286
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.010
I think that it's also useful on occasion to go to your family and to ask a bit,

287
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:21.150
little bit about what has been the history of relationships in the family so

288
00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:23.430
that you get to get to learn a little bit as well.

289
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.460
Whereas some of the unknown legacies that you carry inside of you,

290
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.540
the main thing is don't isolate yourself.
That's,
that's it.

291
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:38.360
And you will see that when you start to,
people generally appreciate it,

292
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.550
the don't know to do it themselves,

293
00:18:40.551 --> 00:18:44.690
but they like it when they feel that they have something to offer when they made

294
00:18:44.691 --> 00:18:47.900
to feel significant because someone else opens up to them.

295
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.670
It's the opposite sometimes of what we anticipate.
Okay,
good luck to you.

296
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.190
The Real Josh Gil asks on Twitter,

297
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.100
I'd love to hear her talk about letting go,

298
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.960
moving past the anger from being cheated on the anger towards the partner that

299
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:08.961
cheated the friends that seemingly abandoned the one that was cheated on and the

300
00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:14.460
anger towards the self for not seeing the relationship falling apart sooner and

301
00:19:14.461 --> 00:19:17.920
trying to fix it.
A lot of self blame here,
right?

302
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.910
A lot of self blame and a lot of anger at the other people for not being there

303
00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:26.440
for you.
You know,
often when people are cheated on Diff,

304
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.440
the first thing is to say,
what's,
what am I,
what's wrong with me?

305
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:33.980
What am I missing?
Why am I not enough?
Or why didn't I see it?

306
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.200
Um,

307
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.200
but sometimes there is a reason that people engage in trauma denial that people

308
00:19:40.511 --> 00:19:44.770
don't want to see because when we don't see it protects us.

309
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.990
It preserves a certain coherence to our life.
Uh,

310
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:52.720
it's not just because we are fools and idiots and easily duped.
Um,

311
00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.250
so be careful about not pouring all kinds of self loading onto you.

312
00:19:57.251 --> 00:20:00.340
What kind of an idiot are you?
How could you not know it?
Uh,

313
00:20:00.341 --> 00:20:04.050
what kind of a guy lets himself be walked on like this?
Uh,
we,

314
00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.550
you should have known,
you should have seen,
you should have done more.

315
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.590
Ask yourself this questions,
but from a place of responsibility,

316
00:20:10.591 --> 00:20:15.180
not from a place of beating yourself down and blaming yourself because then you

317
00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:19.290
can't think if you put yourselves that much done and you feel so terrible about

318
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:19.650
yourself,

319
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.640
you cannot really think or you can do is just protect yourself from getting the

320
00:20:23.641 --> 00:20:28.350
blows.
Now there are phases in the recovery as well.

321
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:33.330
The first thing is just simply,
you know,
the hurt,
the anger,
the confusion,

322
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.200
the disbelief,
the disorientation,
the,

323
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.300
the loss of the predictable future,

324
00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:42.150
the idea that whatever you thought your life was going to be,

325
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.160
it isn't going to happen.
All of that,

326
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.730
and you need to really respect that all the screenings are going to hit you all

327
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:53.230
at once and it's going to be an avalanche of all this Maelstrom.

328
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.180
And that's normal.
It's in the nature of the beast.
It's really,
really normal.

329
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.040
And gradually at the occasion you will mourn this and you will think,
you know,

330
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:05.440
it wasn't good anyway.
And at other times you will say,

331
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:08.320
I could have continued this way.
How could she destroy all of that?

332
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.970
And then you can ask your friends,
talk to them,
did you see things?

333
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:14.140
Did you try to warn me?

334
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:18.190
Did I not listen where you equally as surprised as me?

335
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.610
But you need to know that there are phases of recovery.

336
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.950
I've written about it extensively in my new book.

337
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:29.850
You go from the crisis and you go and you move into the insight phase where you

338
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:32.770
start to make sense of all of this.
Why did this happen?

339
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.940
What can I learn from this?
What does it say about our relationship?

340
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:41.050
What does it say about me?
What does it say about her?
And then there is the,

341
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:44.140
where does this take me now?
What am I lessons?
Um,

342
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:46.490
where am I going to go with that?
And,
uh,
and,

343
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:51.070
and try not to have this just become a script for anger and bitterness.

344
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.160
I think that when you're very angry all the time,

345
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.900
you basically also protect yourself from not being too sad,
from not being hurt.

346
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.300
From that feeling vulnerable,
um,

347
00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:05.710
it kind of props you up to being angry and it gives you a sense of
righteousness.

348
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.300
But be behind the anger is often a real sense of collapse and let yourself go

349
00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:12.400
there.
It's okay.

350
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.510
It really hurts to just be angry isn't going to make it for you.

351
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.320
And how to allow yourself that by being with people who you trust to with next

352
00:22:22.901 --> 00:22:27.520
to whom you can fall apart,
who won't judge you for it,
who understand heartbreak.

353
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.440
It is a new human emotion.

354
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.820
It's one of the oldest experiences we've had and it's part of our humanity.

355
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.460
You want afforded,
you want,
avoided.

356
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:41.890
Let yourself feel the pain and the hurt and the sadness and cry and then you'll

357
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:43.300
come through it.
You know,

358
00:22:43.301 --> 00:22:47.420
I'm thinking about the guy that I wrote about in my book who,
who's who was at,

359
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.980
actually,
it was his brother who cheated on him with,

360
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.210
with the girl that he used to date.
And uh,
for years,
for years,

361
00:22:55.211 --> 00:22:58.000
every time a girl liked him,
he taught,
you know,
who's who,

362
00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.920
who's health is hiding here behind that.

363
00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:03.520
I'm not saying he really carried it with him for a long time.

364
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.470
It takes a while til you begin to trust again till you begin to feel good about

365
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:12.550
yourself again to the field that you are able to be loved and lovable.

366
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.540
It really goes very deep.
This experience.
Um,

367
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:19.880
it taps into our sense of self worth,
all of that.
Uh,

368
00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:23.230
and I hope that the stories that I wrote about in the book will help you with

369
00:23:23.231 --> 00:23:27.670
that.
Uh,
they were meant for that.
They were meant to help you.

370
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.690
Okay.
Thank you.
Ron.
Jannie 86 writes on Twitter.

371
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.070
Is it harder to find true love as you get older and progressively more

372
00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:36.904
intelligent?

373
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:41.920
Do you have to be young and stupid to find love the most people in search of a

374
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:46.380
partner's settle at some point?
I'm glad you back,
but uh,

375
00:23:46.381 --> 00:23:50.090
I'm going to challenge the premise of your question a little bit.
You know,

376
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.090
what does it mean that you're going to settle that you,

377
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.410
I think the main thing is this.
When you are younger,

378
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.320
you allow yourself the experience of meeting someone,

379
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:05.290
seeing where it takes you unfolding with the story and uh,

380
00:24:05.291 --> 00:24:06.630
and embracing the,
the,

381
00:24:06.631 --> 00:24:09.590
the surprise of where this thing is going that you didn't expect.

382
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.970
But when you're looking for in the relationship as an adult and you come with

383
00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:15.260
your expectations,

384
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:20.410
you often toward the possibility for a story to unfold and to surprise you

385
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.800
because you're sitting there with an inventory and you're not really allowing

386
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:26.300
for the unknown to,

387
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.050
to open itself up to you and to take you on a ride that you didn't see coming.

388
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:31.220
Um,

389
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:36.220
I think most of the dating that involves a checklist is don't,

390
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.610
that's,
that's the best way I can say.
It's,
it's anti romance.

391
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.530
It's anti story and stories are the way we live our lives.
Um,

392
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:45.980
it's,

393
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.980
it's a list of items and often you will find that people match all the items on

394
00:24:50.991 --> 00:24:54.380
your list and the feeling isn't there because the feeling is something that

395
00:24:54.381 --> 00:24:56.630
emerges that develops through interaction,

396
00:24:56.631 --> 00:25:01.310
through shared experience to the creation of a shared story together.
And,

397
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:06.080
um,
I don't believe that that is any less possible as an adult.
In fact,

398
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.760
when you are older,
you are clear about what you like,
what you resonate with,

399
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.380
you know yourself better.

400
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:17.450
And from that place you are more able to appreciate the person that is in front

401
00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:22.100
of you.
But it's not like you have to be young and foolish to fall in love.
No,

402
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:23.840
absolutely not.
There is no wage for it.

403
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.150
People Fall in love at any age at this point.

404
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.620
People have the opportunity for the first time in history to actually start an

405
00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:35.240
entire new lives,
um,
in their 50,
60,
seventies.
Um,

406
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.190
love doesn't have an age to it.

407
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:42.170
We love differently because we are more mature because we accept certain things

408
00:25:42.171 --> 00:25:44.300
more.
And because we accept other things less,

409
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.660
and we don't necessarily call that settling.
Settling means what?

410
00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:52.280
I only found six items on my list out of the 10.
That's not the way we do it.

411
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:56.870
We make a choice and the choice always involves a loss.

412
00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:01.760
And at some points we make certain choices that are maybe more rational or more

413
00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:02.690
forward looking.

414
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.620
We understand that there's certain things we need in order to live with someone

415
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.840
and that there are some people with whom we could have a fantastic lover,

416
00:26:09.841 --> 00:26:11.420
fair and a fantastic adventure,

417
00:26:11.421 --> 00:26:13.970
but maybe not necessarily build a whole life together.

418
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.640
And in that sense we become,

419
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:21.850
we are able to hold more elements at the same time and make a decision that

420
00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:26.210
embraces ambivalence.
It's something that that I called maturity,

421
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.930
not settling.
Debbie,
Lina asks to Twitter,

422
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:35.090
when do you know a relationship is done?
That is such a powerful question.

423
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.130
It's really,
but uh,

424
00:26:37.131 --> 00:26:41.180
but what do we mean by done that you don't like who you have become,

425
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.520
that you don't like what you're doing that you don't like,
how you,

426
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.610
how you're being reflected back that the relationship has lasted cell service.

427
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:54.210
It's sense of a lightness and vitality or that it has become toxic and is dying

428
00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:57.300
on the vine.
What do we call done?
Yeah,

429
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:02.790
I think that the main element that is really for me the kiss of death,

430
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.880
the end of a relationship is contempt cause it's really involves a profound

431
00:27:08.431 --> 00:27:13.230
sense of dehumanization.
When that tone that just says look at you,

432
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.620
come on.
What is this is that you call this a relationship,

433
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.480
that sense of this of self loading and contempt.

434
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.920
It's very hard to come back from that.
You can fight,
you can be critical,

435
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.590
you can complain,
you can be volatile,

436
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.130
you can have a lot of things in a relationship.
Um,

437
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.980
because from there you can always come back into suite repair,

438
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:40.530
tender connecting,
et cetera.
And you just go to the cycles of connection,

439
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:44.070
disconnection and repair,
which is the triad of relationships.

440
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.100
But contempt is a real tough one.
Um,

441
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:51.240
the belittling the infantilizing,
the,
the meaning,
the degrading,

442
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:55.440
all these categories of relationships,
which basically amount of abusiveness.

443
00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.150
To me that is a moment where in a relationship really is done.

444
00:28:00.151 --> 00:28:04.140
Because what it means is that one,
in order to protect oneself,

445
00:28:04.141 --> 00:28:07.380
when needs to leave,
unless you're the one doing it,

446
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.000
and then in order to protect yourself in the other,
you need to change.

447
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.620
Thank you.
Kelsey.
Homan asks on Facebook,

448
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.750
how does she handle her critics?
Oh,
good.
That is a wonderful question.

449
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:26.100
Does she read and comment on the Internet trolls for her book reviews,

450
00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:27.330
but cast et cetera.

451
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.590
How does she deal with the people who think they know more about relationship

452
00:28:31.591 --> 00:28:32.424
than her?

453
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:38.300
So I love this question because it allows me to say something,

454
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.360
you know,
I am often considered a thought leader or an expert.

455
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.960
I actually see myself much more as a student and as a person who is avidly

456
00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:53.010
curious and continues to learn on a daily basis rather than as someone who

457
00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:56.370
positions herself as knowing.
I think about these things a lot.

458
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.690
I often can sound very confident,
but I'm sure of nothing.

459
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.930
And one thing I can say is that nothing I say is made up.

460
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.850
But that doesn't mean it's true.

461
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:11.220
I also don't think there is one truth and I think that I am a person who

462
00:29:11.221 --> 00:29:15.810
continuously seeks to be challenged.
I go and then check with other people.

463
00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:18.300
Am I missing something?
Is there something I didn't think about?

464
00:29:18.301 --> 00:29:20.750
Is there validity in the criticism?
Um,

465
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.120
I invite conversation,
dialogue,

466
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.020
confrontation and disagreement where it hurts.

467
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.920
Where I find myself at a loss is when people are taking one thing.

468
00:29:34.531 --> 00:29:37.380
I say completely distorting it,
character,

469
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.920
character cheering me or what I say when I try so hard to embrace complexity and

470
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:49.021
nuance and kind of feel completely flattened by a complete misunderstanding of

471
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:54.640
what I say often to the extent where I wonder if the people actually really read

472
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.980
my work,
engaged with me.

473
00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:02.310
And I wish that the predicts actually came to me and asked me and engaged with

474
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.260
me and challenged me rather than just,
you know,

475
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:10.770
trashman I generally try not to read too much of it because it hurts and because

476
00:30:12.551 --> 00:30:16.100
I don't feel that there is an invitation for the dialogue.
Uh,

477
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:20.500
whoever comes to me directly,
respectfully and says,
I disagree,

478
00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.260
I think you're wrong,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

479
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:28.290
I will speak with whoever is avoiding me and just going behind my back and using

480
00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:33.070
the Internet to anonymously or not anonymously.
Uh,
trash.

481
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:33.910
Um,

482
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:38.440
I think is participating in the same culture and in the trash and culture of the

483
00:30:38.441 --> 00:30:43.441
moment and with all the consequences that we all know are involved in this.

484
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.320
So that's my relationship to criticism.

485
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:52.360
I welcome it when it's done.
You mainly when it's done respectfully,

486
00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.630
Seth frank one asks on Twitter,

487
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:59.350
we often hear communication is key in the relationship,

488
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:03.790
but as I believe she has mentioned in her book too much can hinder desire.

489
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.420
What then is the juice to Amelia?
Okay,
listen,

490
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:10.630
we make me think of a song by Carly Simon,

491
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.990
no secrets in which she has aligned sometimes.

492
00:31:13.991 --> 00:31:17.660
I wish I didn't know those secrets of yours.
No,

493
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:23.010
I think that the free love of the 60s came with a view of honesty and

494
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:26.950
transparency and letting it all hang out there.

495
00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:32.460
And while it kind of came with the rise of individualism has everything that a

496
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:36.400
person experiences is at the center,
it matters.

497
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.290
It needs to be met.

498
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:43.830
I also think that the other side of this kind of wholesale sharing is um,

499
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.500
and it does have candor like that is that there needs to be consideration,

500
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:50.890
politeness.

501
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.680
And I find that those two qualities are often in short supplies,

502
00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.220
in contemporary relationships.

503
00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.540
There's this notion that we expect the partner to just hold on to all of our

504
00:32:01.541 --> 00:32:05.740
feelings and make us feel better rather than engage a little more in our own

505
00:32:05.741 --> 00:32:10.741
self suiting and in our own self regulation and in going in venting to others.

506
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.790
It actually has always been the case that people vented to people outside of the

507
00:32:15.791 --> 00:32:19.630
relationship in order to be able to sustain what happened on the inside.

508
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.190
But it's about kind of don't let your emotional hemorrhoids bleed like that

509
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:28.510
inside your house all the time.
I don't know that this is always the best.

510
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:32.350
We of course want communication,
we want exchange,

511
00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:35.650
we want deepening and real meeting with the other,

512
00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.980
but I'm not sure that the kind of all out there is the only model and what

513
00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:45.800
you're going to hear from me always is that there isn't one way only there isn't

514
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:49.430
one size fits all.
And so while I answer you in one way,

515
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:54.290
I may answer someone else differently and I think it's that richness that I want

516
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:57.830
us all to hold here on occasion.
Let it be,

517
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.290
you don't have to react to everything.
Not everything is a tense.

518
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.580
Certain things are just too,
they're not really that important.

519
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.080
And that's another song that I think we really need to be able to hum on

520
00:33:09.081 --> 00:33:12.190
occasion.
And in terms of the,
the,

521
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.910
the not telling everything on the desire,
it's really this,
the questions,

522
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:21.440
the interest that you want to keep for your partner or vice versa are a way in

523
00:33:21.441 --> 00:33:24.290
which you remain curious,
interested,

524
00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.560
engaged with the other person as a person.

525
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:32.900
The way that we often are in the beginning where we are just interested in who

526
00:33:32.901 --> 00:33:37.430
is this person and what happens over time is that people often feel that they

527
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:41.600
know their partner as if they belonged to them as if they're just an extension

528
00:33:41.601 --> 00:33:46.070
of them.
And that's an actually a contrived illusion of safety.

529
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:51.100
It's not true in the face of the unknown which exists right in our midst.

530
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:56.330
There is that mystery of the other and the mixture of the other is simply

531
00:33:56.331 --> 00:34:01.280
available once you continue to be curious about them rather than assume this

532
00:34:01.281 --> 00:34:02.450
kind of familiarity.

533
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:07.160
That's what I'm trying to say about the connection to desire because if desire

534
00:34:07.161 --> 00:34:11.720
exists in that space of exploration,
of discovery,
of curiosity,

535
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.150
once you remain curious to your partner,

536
00:34:14.151 --> 00:34:17.810
once you continue to think of them as a person,
not just as your partner,

537
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.660
the desire can continue to try it as well.

538
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:26.270
The next question you're asking is what according to her observations and

539
00:34:26.271 --> 00:34:30.980
experience at the essential blocks to build a strong foundation between partners

540
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.570
and what is ascension in a relationship to maintaining longevity?

541
00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:40.220
The many,
many pieces that I think a part of driving relationships,

542
00:34:40.221 --> 00:34:41.420
but I'll give you a few,

543
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:44.450
just the ones that come up now and then if we meet again,

544
00:34:44.451 --> 00:34:48.830
you'll ask me again and I'll give you a few others.
Yes,
I'll go on.
Number one,

545
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:52.810
not everything must be said.
I think that,
uh,
that in,

546
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.370
in light of the culture that we live in today,

547
00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.340
I will probably say not everything must be said.

548
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:00.980
If we were talking and meeting in other parts of the word,

549
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.450
I would say the exact opposite.
More things need to be spoken sometimes.
Okay.

550
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.040
Just so you understand these things.

551
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:11.120
His answers are always taking place in a context and specifically in the

552
00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:13.610
cultural context.
The second thing,

553
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:18.500
I think one of the most important it combinations in a relationship is the

554
00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:22.070
combination between empathy and responsibility.

555
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:27.130
It's your ability to continue to see your partner and from their own point of

556
00:35:28.101 --> 00:35:32.510
view is to enter the shoes of the other and on the other side your ability to

557
00:35:32.511 --> 00:35:37.100
take responsibility for that which is yours,
your own contribution,
you mistakes.

558
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:41.240
If flaws just,
I'm sorry I did this,
actually I would,

559
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:44.640
next time I'll do differently.
I own it,
I own it.

560
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.770
The minute you can own something,

561
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.850
it gives you freedom rather than thinking that all problems in all changes

562
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.340
actually belonged to the other person.

563
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:59.130
And the next piece that is really essential to the balance to do in a

564
00:35:59.131 --> 00:36:03.720
relationship is the ability to navigate separateness and togetherness.

565
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:09.150
You know,
to have space,
to have individuality,
to have self expression,

566
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.640
to have your own friends,

567
00:36:11.641 --> 00:36:15.720
to have your own experiences that are not all related to the couple.

568
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.680
And then also to have some very strong things that belonged to the couple,

569
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.750
but some couples have a tiny overlap of the concentric circles and some couples

570
00:36:24.751 --> 00:36:27.600
have a complete overlap.
So there's a range.

571
00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:30.210
Some people love to just have a big,
big,

572
00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:34.290
big togetherness and a small separateness and others the other way around.

573
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.610
But it is that negotiation and it changes over life.

574
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.210
It's not one in the same when you meet and then 15 years later,

575
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.980
the next thing for a long relationship is flexibility.
Adaptability.

576
00:36:46.981 --> 00:36:49.320
It's your ability to say,
you know,
we used to do it like this,

577
00:36:49.321 --> 00:36:51.990
this worked for 10 years.
It doesn't work anymore.
Change.

578
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.730
And that thinks that people are much more able to do in their companies and in

579
00:36:56.731 --> 00:36:59.160
their workplaces than they are willing to do at home.

580
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:03.990
This is often a real static,
uh,
attitude towards the relationship.

581
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:07.670
We met a certain way,
we set it up a certain way,
my role,
your role,

582
00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.180
my responsibilities.
You were supposed to be.

583
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.660
And it goes on like that for 35 years,
you know,
and then we collapse.

584
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.950
So the ability to just come together and say,
I need something different.

585
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.090
Let's change this.

586
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:22.860
I love couples who have an annual summit and kind of reviewed their
relationship.

587
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.860
Where's it going?
How are we doing?
You know,
or even monthly.
It just because it,

588
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.660
it shows intentionality.
It shows attention.

589
00:37:30.661 --> 00:37:35.520
It shows care the same way that you water your plants,
you know,
uh,

590
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:40.080
rather than a kind of,
uh,
letting it go in this affair for,
for a long time on.

591
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:43.620
And um,
that kind of diligence makes a big difference.

592
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:47.400
And then the last one I will say for longevity and for trading relationships,

593
00:37:47.401 --> 00:37:51.570
because so many of you had the question about what makes a relationship last is

594
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.550
engaging with new experiences,

595
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.300
not just comfortable and pleasant experiences.
Those,

596
00:37:57.301 --> 00:38:01.340
those make for real familiarity and security and stability in the couple.

597
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.190
But what really makes a tribe,

598
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.770
what brings it a lightness and vitality is the engagement with new experiences

599
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:13.040
outside of the comfort zone because they breed new cells and all the research is

600
00:38:13.171 --> 00:38:17.280
confirming that at this point I'm novelty breeds testosterone.
It's,

601
00:38:17.281 --> 00:38:19.740
and it's not another to of sex,
sex positions.

602
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:24.770
It's really different ways of being with oneself in the relationship and with

603
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:28.020
each other.
So all of that combined.

604
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.760
You have a good chance to go for quite awhile.
Alex and daddy's phone,

605
00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:34.200
Twitter and Aspen.

606
00:38:34.201 --> 00:38:37.780
Jeannine will on Facebook are asking,

607
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:41.590
how do millennials bring back romance and emotional intimacy?

608
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:45.640
What do you see as the biggest flaws of young men in their twenties and how they

609
00:38:45.641 --> 00:38:48.730
communicate with women?
What advice do you have for them?

610
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.460
I'm going to divide this into,
look,

611
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:57.070
there isn't much romance when people make date some texts all the time.

612
00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:02.020
On occasion today,
Romance will be a phone call in the past romance.

613
00:39:02.021 --> 00:39:06.580
Well,
the card,
it's like,
you know who still gets picked up at the door,

614
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.800
who still gets brought back at the door,
who gets them?

615
00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:13.460
Of course the next morning.
I mean it's all these things that um,

616
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:18.610
are often seen as kind of pissy and an a,
an old century.
But in fact,

617
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.080
I don't think the repertoire has particularly changed it.

618
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.330
What the text doesn't go very far in terms of flattery,

619
00:39:25.331 --> 00:39:30.331
does it anything that goes beyond the bare minimum is romance because romance is

620
00:39:31.931 --> 00:39:35.770
pining romances,
seduction,
romances,
flirtation.

621
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:41.040
And that is a cultivated art by which you are gradually making the other person

622
00:39:41.741 --> 00:39:46.090
melt in your arms.
But for that you have to be able to say,

623
00:39:46.091 --> 00:39:46.930
I want you.

624
00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:51.040
And that means you have to experience the vulnerability of putting yourself out

625
00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:51.580
there.

626
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:56.200
And it seems that these days too many young people are quite reluctant to

627
00:39:56.201 --> 00:39:59.950
experience the vulnerability and the uncertainty of not knowing,

628
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:04.540
of making that phone call and hoping that somebody is going to answer and it

629
00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:08.620
won't be her dad,
you know,
like just to be an,

630
00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.310
and that butterfly thing,
um,

631
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:15.970
has kind of been done away with the stuff is way too much immediate

632
00:40:15.971 --> 00:40:20.290
gratification.
So there is no,
no space in between to seal experience.

633
00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:25.210
The excitement and the anticipation and the uncertainty.

634
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:30.550
But all of that was part of romance.
That was the romantic plot,
romantic plot.

635
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:34.090
It plays itself out in the will it happen,
won't it happen?

636
00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.970
The new Moisey relevant.
That's the,
you know,

637
00:40:36.971 --> 00:40:40.780
a romance novel is 300 pages for the last piece.
And the last piece is the,

638
00:40:40.781 --> 00:40:44.800
is only one page.
It's 300 pages of will though,
will it not?

639
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.600
And that's romance.
Now in terms of the question,

640
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.970
what to do,
take the risks,

641
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.160
the risks don't just go in a bar just to,
it's not just a booty call.
You know,

642
00:40:57.161 --> 00:41:00.670
put yourself out there and say,
I want you to now take the time.

643
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:05.230
I coach this guy recently.
Um,
and it was very sweet.
You know,

644
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:08.980
woman basically calls it off seven o'clock,
Friday night,
you know,

645
00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:13.050
not a very nice thing to do.
She's busy,
she has a meeting,
whatever.
And I'm,

646
00:41:13.051 --> 00:41:15.280
and he goes into a whole,
you know,
should I wait,

647
00:41:15.281 --> 00:41:18.670
does that mean she's not interested?
She's interested.
I just said,
look,

648
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.740
text her back and say,
I understand.
Makes you know,
you're uh,

649
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.240
but twice as much time for tomorrow.

650
00:41:25.241 --> 00:41:28.720
Please come back with something that is funny.

651
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.500
But that breeds confidence and that is assertive and that says,

652
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:37.270
I'm very interested and,
uh,
you owe me a double dose.
Um,

653
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:41.930
she liked it.
She liked it.
No.
If she doesn't,
if she has no interest in him,

654
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.290
then she will tell him at that moment,
please don't bother.

655
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.960
But if she has a slight interest in him,

656
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.240
he will gain a lot of points with one of those things.
Um,

657
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.650
I've done more and more,
you know,
coaching people lately,

658
00:41:54.651 --> 00:41:59.650
just looking at their Tinder feeds.
Just the kind of exchanges.
Uh,

659
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.360
not only do they like Romans,
they liked,
they like

660
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.170
anything that says to people,
you know,

661
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:10.400
you're interesting to me and I would like to meet you.
Just,

662
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.320
it's really thin.
It's really thick.
So,
um,

663
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:17.210
there is the issue of romance,

664
00:42:17.211 --> 00:42:21.710
but there is the broader question simply of how do people these,
this literally,

665
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.090
um,
turn each other on with their minds,

666
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:30.380
not just the other ways.
Okay.
Um,
men,

667
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.650
there's a beautiful book by Rob Garfield called questioning the male code,

668
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:40.250
which I recommend for many of you.
Um,

669
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:44.930
but the mayor could often comes with a fix it attitude,

670
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:49.700
um,
and fix it is I have an answer.

671
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:51.480
I have a solution.
Uh,

672
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.700
and it is part of the making of masculinity competence,
performance,

673
00:42:55.701 --> 00:42:58.070
problem solving.
So,
um,

674
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:03.430
unfortunately in the relationship with women fix it doesn't often work because

675
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:08.180
many times she wants to only talk and she wants to share the experience.

676
00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:11.120
She doesn't really want to be told what to do.
She's quite competent.

677
00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:15.240
She quite knows what to do.
And if you give her unsolicited advice,

678
00:43:15.241 --> 00:43:17.090
she experienced it as patronizing.

679
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:22.580
So the flip side of fix it is empathy is two things.

680
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:27.770
Tell me more.
Tell me more.
Men set the tone you need to do.

681
00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:29.000
You don't have to solve it.

682
00:43:29.001 --> 00:43:32.900
You just have to ask her if she wants to continue to talk about it and he wants

683
00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:37.190
to engage in,
in patting murmurings Oh really?
Oh,

684
00:43:37.191 --> 00:43:41.480
that's tough.
Oh Wow.
You know,
that can't,
um,

685
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:45.950
that says I'm listening.
It is most of the time what she needs,

686
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:50.300
if she want to give advice,
ask her if she wants to hear it and otherwise,

687
00:43:50.301 --> 00:43:54.620
which in she asks for it.
The fear that people have sometimes that guys have,

688
00:43:54.621 --> 00:43:56.720
when they said to me more is that she's going to study in it.

689
00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.110
We never stopped saying,
if she says we have to talk,
he says how long?

690
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.020
And in fact when you say,
tell me more,

691
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:06.200
the answer will be much shorter than if you don't.

692
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:11.510
And she still isn't sure that you really get it.
So that's really the main,

693
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:13.400
the main piece in terms of uh,

694
00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:18.740
men in communication and I'm not so sure that it is different for young guys or

695
00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:21.980
for me,
even men,
my generation boomers,

696
00:44:21.981 --> 00:44:26.981
it's really you don't have to have an answer and you don't have to feel like you

697
00:44:27.591 --> 00:44:30.890
make need to solve the problem or make the feelings go away.

698
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.150
You actually need to do less.

699
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:37.800
And your challenge is to still feel competent even if you do less,

700
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:42.330
but you will be much more appreciate action.
Um,

701
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.170
I had one of the little thoughts that when we talked about the things for

702
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:50.220
longevity and the things for,
for deepening the intimacy and all of these things,

703
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:51.810
which I didn't talk about,

704
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.290
which is people sitting in the morning and having breakfast,

705
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:58.770
watching outside the window,
listening to music together,

706
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.260
dancing together for a moment.
You know,

707
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:06.480
the average pop song is 2.3 minutes.
If you just do that,

708
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.830
it doesn't take a long time because sometimes things are so much work to

709
00:45:10.831 --> 00:45:13.140
maintain this intimacy.
It actually is not.

710
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:18.090
It's 2.3 minutes to listen to some of the most beautiful love songs ever written

711
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:21.810
and reconnect with that feeling between the two of you.
Okay.

712
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:27.000
So I hope that I've given you some ideas,
inspirations,

713
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:32.420
food for thought in the pursuit of your own loving and trading relationships.

714
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:36.450
I want to add a piece to Kevin Nina's question.

715
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.790
When do you know that the relationship is done?

716
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.360
Kevin and I was talking about the four horsemen of apocalypse that a famous

717
00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:49.730
researcher on the relationships John Gutmann talks about.
And I wanted to,

718
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:54.720
to expand a little bit on that.
You know,
one is criticism and uh,

719
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.960
okay,
we,
it,
it's quite easy,
right?
It's complaining,

720
00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:01.260
it's picking a,
at the other person.

721
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:06.590
It's seeing what you do as circumstantial and seeing the other person as

722
00:46:07.321 --> 00:46:10.680
characterological,
right?
Uh,
if,
if you're in a bad mood,

723
00:46:10.681 --> 00:46:13.980
it's because we had a tough day.
But if the other person doesn't act very nice,

724
00:46:13.981 --> 00:46:17.260
these,
because they're actually generally a mean person,
you know,

725
00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:21.540
or a bad tempered person rather than the two may have had a bad day.
Right?

726
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.990
So all the elements that have to do with criticism,

727
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:30.500
the way that people just know at the other person and just go and circle around

728
00:46:30.691 --> 00:46:33.060
the same grievances over and over again.

729
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:38.010
That's the piece that he's talking about.
Stonewalling is silent treatment.

730
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.670
It's basically,
you know,
withdrawing,
uh,

731
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.450
removing oneself and letting the other person stand out there and talk to the

732
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:48.950
walls.
That's another major,
uh,

733
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:53.850
horsemen of apocalypse.
Defensiveness,
the fact that,

734
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:54.391
you know,

735
00:46:54.391 --> 00:46:59.391
you can't bring anything up without the other person instantly rejecting

736
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:03.750
defensive going nature instead of just saying,
yes,
thank you for telling me.

737
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:08.310
Let me think about this.
Or simply,
uh,
I,
that doesn't feel good,
but,
uh,

738
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:13.110
you know,
probably I do.
Yes,
I do do that.
You know,
uh,

739
00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.240
I don't mean to,
but I do.
Or a or,
or it's an old habit,

740
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:21.150
bad habit of mine or something that acknowledges that stands accountable,

741
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:23.820
that doesn't enter the,
yeah,
but you,
you know,

742
00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:27.980
and then says you did worse and then starts to pile up,
you know,
and,

743
00:47:27.981 --> 00:47:29.380
and for everything you said,

744
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:33.730
the other person counters right away with something worse so that they never

745
00:47:33.731 --> 00:47:35.620
have to look at the thing that you said you said.
Yeah.

746
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:40.180
But yesterday you all of that,
okay.
That defensiveness,
it's a,

747
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:41.830
it's very rich defensiveness,

748
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:45.850
but it basically leaves you without the feeling that you ever can bring

749
00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:50.620
something up and that it will be responded to for its own sake.
Um,

750
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:55.640
and then contempt,
that's the one that I think is the final killer,
um,

751
00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:00.340
for a relationship.
And that went already detailed for you.

752
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:03.070
They wanted you to have a sense about,

753
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.460
this is for your question actually about the relationship being done,

754
00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:11.461
but also the question that was asked by Alicia asked about how to lessen the

755
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:14.530
arguments in your,
in your relationship.

756
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:19.770
So the opposite of these four killers of relationship have to do with how do

757
00:48:23.381 --> 00:48:26.470
people stay connected in the midst of disagreement.

758
00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.510
And I think the most,
and this is something I wanted to expand more for,

759
00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:32.860
an easiest question,

760
00:48:32.861 --> 00:48:36.820
is that you really need to know something about arguing in a relationship.

761
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:42.090
It often has very little to do with the content of the argument itself.

762
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:47.400
When couplers enter into a vicious cycle and they are reactive and they escalate

763
00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.410
and the bigger and the fight,

764
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.340
it doesn't really matter the subject anymore.
At a certain point,

765
00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:59.410
if it's the kids or the car or the money or what they were going to do for

766
00:48:59.411 --> 00:49:02.230
Christmas,
it all is going to sound the same.

767
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.580
And what you're going to hear is that people end up being in an interaction

768
00:49:06.581 --> 00:49:09.970
where they don't feel acknowledged,
they don't feel validated,

769
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.680
they feel dismissed,
they feel that the other person competes with them,

770
00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:19.510
that they are outmaneuvered and it doesn't matter what they talk about.

771
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:24.540
So there's the real truth about conflict in relationships is that the form

772
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:26.410
precedes the content.

773
00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:30.220
The way these arguments and fall is one in the same.

774
00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:33.610
If it is this or if it is about Greenpeace in South Korea,

775
00:49:33.611 --> 00:49:37.630
it makes no difference.
It's no longer about the issue itself.

776
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:41.080
And once you know that,
then you have to go out the form.

777
00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:45.850
And the form is what the people are doing to each other while they say the

778
00:49:45.851 --> 00:49:48.770
things they say.
And what they're doing is this long list.

779
00:49:48.771 --> 00:49:53.771
I've just gone through the opposite of dismissing and disqualifying and

780
00:49:54.251 --> 00:49:59.251
invalidating is acknowledging and recognizing and validating and empathizing.

781
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:04.630
And that doesn't mean you don't agree.
So there's a very,

782
00:50:04.631 --> 00:50:08.770
very good method developed by Mark Howard Markman,

783
00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:13.540
sorry I,
it's called prep.
Um,
and it's a book fighting for your marriage.

784
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:16.300
It's actually quite good.
And in prep,

785
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.260
basically they tell you in negative communication,

786
00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:24.880
you pretty much have 10 seconds before you get ready for the rebuttal.

787
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.940
That's about as much as you can listen to something that you Bergner says and

788
00:50:28.941 --> 00:50:32.270
that you disagree with in 10 seconds is three sentences.

789
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:37.630
So to where you minimize the arguments is by beginning to practice reflective

790
00:50:38.331 --> 00:50:43.250
listening.
It's tedious.
It's annoying,
but it's highly effective.

791
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.640
What I'm hearing you say and you repeat is there more and you repeat and vice

792
00:50:49.581 --> 00:50:54.380
versa,
and then when you talk you do x,
Y,
z statements.

793
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.440
When you do x in situation,

794
00:50:57.441 --> 00:51:02.441
why I feel z when you don't even look up when I walk into the house,

795
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:06.500
because you're busier to computer the whole time

796
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:10.460
and I am trying to make a connection with you.

797
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:13.670
I feel like I don't matter and you don't love me.

798
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:18.940
Something like that that is very different from you couldn't give a fuck about

799
00:51:19.401 --> 00:51:24.380
me and anytime I come home you on purpose,
pretend that you didn't hear it.

800
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:29.510
That's an attack from that attack or you're going to get is a defense and the

801
00:51:29.511 --> 00:51:34.511
defense can be a counter attack or stonewalling a or a defensiveness or a

802
00:51:34.641 --> 00:51:39.080
criticism or a or a content that here you have your four horses.

803
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:44.620
The sentence is broken down in such a way that if I have an experience of what

804
00:51:44.991 --> 00:51:49.640
you do that is not the same as my defining that this is what you do.

805
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:51.740
It says that when you do this,

806
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:56.090
I experience it in a certain way and that's my feeling and you can't argue with

807
00:51:56.091 --> 00:51:57.380
the other person's feeling.

808
00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:01.700
You can argue in another person trying to define you and to define your

809
00:52:01.701 --> 00:52:06.701
negatively that Xyz is intensely transformative when people really begin to

810
00:52:08.721 --> 00:52:09.554
practice it.

811
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:13.970
So that's one way out of the little helper of chronic arguments.

812
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:15.463
Okay.

813
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:19.880
Take a few of the questions that I haven't that I haven't spoken about.

814
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.510
How can men effectively handle their sex drive?

815
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:27.650
Asks The v Weinstock look,

816
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:31.700
I don't know exactly what you mean by effectively handled their sex drive.

817
00:52:31.701 --> 00:52:35.140
If you're asking,
you know what two men do when they are horny and and,

818
00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:39.200
and they want to have sex but they don't have partners available or they have a

819
00:52:39.201 --> 00:52:43.220
point of a steady partner who is not there at that moment or not interested.

820
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.430
I think one of the things that I would say is this,

821
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:51.860
sex for men is very much connected to what goes on inside of them.

822
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:55.520
If they're angry,
if they're happy,
if they're anxious,
if they're depressed,

823
00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.130
if they feel good about themselves.
And if they don't,

824
00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:04.040
some men turn to sex to suit themselves when they're anxious,

825
00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:06.800
besides when they feel good.
That's a given.

826
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.570
Some men experienced sex as the one and only language to which they can

827
00:53:11.571 --> 00:53:13.430
experience emotional intimacy.

828
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:18.050
So men experienced sex as the only language to whom to which they can feel

829
00:53:18.051 --> 00:53:21.840
tender w to soft connected.
Uh,

830
00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:26.400
they won't be the first time that you will hear women describe guys who open up,

831
00:53:26.401 --> 00:53:27.870
who they feel are truly there,

832
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:32.871
who are really intimate with them on insects because it is the sanction language

833
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.980
for guys to experience but otherwise are often forbidden emotions for men.

834
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.590
So that's for me,
when you ask about effectively handling sex drives,

835
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.570
it has to do with that.
It has to do with being not just monolingual,

836
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:52.390
having many languages available,
having many ways to act,

837
00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:56.640
to take care of our needs of our feelings and not just one.

838
00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:01.320
That's the effectiveness of sex is to not have it be x.
The only thing available,

839
00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:03.960
uh,
for the rest.
Uh,

840
00:54:03.961 --> 00:54:08.760
I'm not sure that there is a unique way to effectively deal with drives.

841
00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.700
But one thing you need to know,
sex is not a drive.

842
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.870
You don't die from not having sex.
You die from not being touched,

843
00:54:15.871 --> 00:54:19.560
but you don't die from not having sex.
It's a motivational system.

844
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:21.600
It's not a drive that's not the same.

845
00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:27.270
Ebbing is asking what are some of the suggestions and resources that she has for

846
00:54:27.271 --> 00:54:32.100
couples who want to explore having a more monogamish relationships,
not poly,

847
00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.800
but more flexible than traditional monogamy,

848
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:39.510
especially when it comes to navigating boundaries,
emotions and sexual health.

849
00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.560
It's a beautiful question.
So first of all,

850
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.650
there's the movie that comes out right now.

851
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:48.780
How has police movie called monogamish?
Uh,

852
00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:52.460
it's premiering in New York actually this week.
So,
um,

853
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.040
that would be a very nice movie to see together because it really opens up the

854
00:54:58.591 --> 00:55:00.660
conversation.
Um,

855
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.720
and for me the open relationship is less about what people actually do than the

856
00:55:06.511 --> 00:55:08.700
openness of the conversation itself.

857
00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:12.540
Many people don't really want to do as much as they want to do that.

858
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:13.880
They could if they wanted.

859
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:17.910
They don't want to feel that they live with the restrictions of the boundaries

860
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.690
and then it's a conversation.
What is it that you miss?

861
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.660
What is it that you feel drawn to?
What would you like to experience?

862
00:55:24.661 --> 00:55:27.270
Do you want to experience it to,
do you want to experience it together?

863
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.890
Do you want me to know about it?

864
00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:32.670
Is it a turnoff for you if I tell you or do you actually not want to know about

865
00:55:32.671 --> 00:55:35.070
it?
And often you'll find you have one of each in a couple.

866
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.240
Is it do you want to be,
is it something that you want that is fleeting,

867
00:55:39.241 --> 00:55:42.780
that is just that if you meet someone you want the possibility of letting

868
00:55:42.781 --> 00:55:44.730
something unfold and see where it takes you.

869
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.830
Is it when you travel because you're often away or is it that you have been with

870
00:55:49.831 --> 00:55:53.190
me since you were 17 and you want to know other partners cause you've never

871
00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:54.480
known others beside me.

872
00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:00.060
It's this whole conversation and not to take it immediately as something is

873
00:56:00.061 --> 00:56:03.480
missing.
I can't give you everything.
I should be everything for you.

874
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:06.480
If you have any other interest,
it must mean that I'm not enough.

875
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:08.790
It's really that conversation.

876
00:56:08.791 --> 00:56:13.791
And what you will find is that the couples for whom this is a joint interest,

877
00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:18.240
um,
the conversation itself is often very enlightening,

878
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:23.010
very vibrant,
and very,
very intimate because the possibility of,

879
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:28.410
to your partner about your longings for that which takes place outside and need

880
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:33.540
to have it be recognized and accepted is a deeply intimate conversation.

881
00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:37.630
The,
the,
the recognition of your freedom of your,

882
00:56:37.631 --> 00:56:42.340
of your erotic freedom on which you may not act,

883
00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:47.140
but that it exists even in fantasy,
even in curiosity,
in longing,
in interest,

884
00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:51.640
is profoundly intimate for couples.
And then you talk about,

885
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:54.820
do we want to do,
I want to know what do we tell each other?

886
00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:59.740
Do we notify in advanced?
We tell after it has happened.

887
00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:00.460
Uh,

888
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:05.140
what is it that you want to know and understand that you don't have necessarily

889
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:09.760
a symmetric need.
One of you may want to know more,
one of you doesn't,

890
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:12.370
one of you likes to share,
one of you doesn't.

891
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:14.470
You don't have to be one in the same.

892
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.430
And then you come back in you and you examine it works for us.

893
00:57:18.431 --> 00:57:22.090
It doesn't work for us.
It makes brings us closer.
It makes us too nervous.

894
00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.040
It now in the end it doesn't,

895
00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:27.280
it's not a good thing for us or not right now because we have young kids and

896
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:31.570
we're not equal because one of us is not working and we're not equal because one

897
00:57:31.571 --> 00:57:34.240
of us has been sick and we're not,
you know,

898
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:38.160
by definition they need to be a certain level of,

899
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:43.150
of equality in the relationship for the conversation to not be a power maneuver,

900
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:47.920
a boat,
people need to have the same possibilities.
Um,

901
00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:49.960
they may not both want to act on them,

902
00:57:49.961 --> 00:57:54.430
but they need to vote no that they could if they wanted any,

903
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:58.410
if that's part of the agreement and then you come back and you examine this is,

904
00:57:58.411 --> 00:58:01.270
is this good for us?
This is work.
When I say work,

905
00:58:01.271 --> 00:58:05.820
meaning do we feel enriched by it or do we feel like it's depleting us,

906
00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:09.700
that it's taking away from us that it ultimately now we thought it would be a

907
00:58:09.701 --> 00:58:11.110
good idea but it's not really,

908
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:14.930
or this has actually opened up things between us that we,

909
00:58:14.931 --> 00:58:18.540
we've had a whole different level of honesty between us,
a whole different level,

910
00:58:18.541 --> 00:58:21.730
depth of communication that never existed before.

911
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:27.400
We bring back different parts of ourselves.
Um,
the reunions are beautiful.

912
00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:30.370
We make love before we go off to meet someone else.

913
00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:33.310
We only accepted when one of us is traveling.

914
00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:36.910
It's a very rich conversation and it's often many,

915
00:58:36.911 --> 00:58:40.150
many conversations before anybody even act on any of this.

916
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:43.120
That's how this process goes.
Then you can read some books,

917
00:58:43.121 --> 00:58:47.920
you can retell minnows book open,
you can um,
read sex at dawn.

918
00:58:47.921 --> 00:58:52.921
I mean this and you can talk to other people who actually practice consensual

919
00:58:53.921 --> 00:58:57.940
non monogamy varieties thereof and how it works for them.
You get ideas,

920
00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:01.660
but often people don't tell you that that's what they do because it's so

921
00:59:01.661 --> 00:59:04.960
negatively judged.
So it's not like you can go and ask them how to do,

922
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:08.110
how do you raise your children?
Because I'm looking for some ideas,

923
00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:13.480
but you will find people who are willing to talk and I have experienced it for

924
00:59:13.481 --> 00:59:17.860
years.
So the,
the practice that it,
that doesn't mean it's what works for you,

925
00:59:17.861 --> 00:59:21.350
but it inspires you.
It gives you what you should be thinking about.

926
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:25.100
And that's how I would start this thing.
The last question that we'll do.

927
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:30.380
How do I help people come to terms and come to accept themselves?

928
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.850
You know,
um,

929
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:36.790
for me self acceptance is really a process of maturation.
It,

930
00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:40.970
Eh,
uh,
I don't expect people in their twenties to easily accept themselves.

931
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:44.840
So I do put this on a spectrum of time.

932
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:50.030
But I think the fundamental experience of accepting yourself is that you accept

933
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:53.550
that you are flow.
You accept,
uh,

934
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:58.130
the things that are beautiful about you and use begin to feel with I'm good

935
00:59:58.131 --> 01:00:01.670
enough.
I mean,
that's the essence.
It's not unperfect it's,

936
01:00:01.671 --> 01:00:06.050
I'm good enough or I'm flawed and I make mistakes,

937
01:00:06.051 --> 01:00:10.400
but they don't thank me.
I don't feel instantly,
massively embarrassed.

938
01:00:10.401 --> 01:00:13.850
And ashamed about them,
I'm able to look at them and just say,
okay,

939
01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:18.890
I'll do better next time.
I do it differently next time I learned from this.

940
01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.920
Um,
it's that process that is self acceptance.

941
01:00:21.921 --> 01:00:25.850
I mean I remember making mistakes and then not sleeping for three weeks at a

942
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:29.870
time,
you know,
and churning and obsessing about it and replaying it in my head.

943
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:33.920
Today I do some of these mistakes and I just think,
okay,

944
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.730
I know that mistake and uh,
I don't like it.
It doesn't feel good,

945
01:00:37.731 --> 01:00:40.700
but it doesn't cripple me anymore in the same way.

946
01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.170
I think that's the level of self acceptance of said was,

947
01:00:44.171 --> 01:00:48.730
is also knowing what you want and,
and feeling okay about it.

948
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:53.270
Not uh,
not feeling like you have to continuously justify,
explain,
apologize.

949
01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:56.690
It's a,
it's what I call the healthy sense of entitlement,

950
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:59.360
not grandiose sense of entitlement.

951
01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:02.120
Self acceptance is self confidence.

952
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.530
Self acceptance is also the ability to live with your lack of confidence in your

953
01:01:06.531 --> 01:01:08.780
insecurities and your uncertainties.

954
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:13.340
And to say this is an area where I feel deeply insecure and it's part of who I

955
01:01:13.341 --> 01:01:17.600
am.
Um,
I have it all the time.
Um,

956
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:20.160
all of this is self acceptance.
It's a,

957
01:01:20.161 --> 01:01:22.730
your ability to live with your sense of ambivalence,

958
01:01:22.731 --> 01:01:26.730
the things about yourself that you like in that you don't like.
Um,

959
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:30.590
the things that you feel really good about and the things that you are very

960
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:34.370
troubled by their ability to integrate those two,

961
01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:39.840
that's the ability to live with ambivalence about oneself is an essential

962
01:01:40.671 --> 01:01:44.420
ingredient of self acceptance.
It's all of that.
And for me,

963
01:01:44.421 --> 01:01:48.900
it's a process of maturation over life.
Um,
this is not something you,

964
01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:53.900
you just one day have.
It grows on you slowly,
physically,

965
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:58.910
emotionally in terms of lifestyle.
You know,
what you like,
you accepted,

966
01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:04.030
you don't drink,
you don't force yourself anymore to be who you're not.
Uh,

967
01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:08.660
you're okay in Nu skin.
Um,
I often say,
you know,

968
01:02:08.661 --> 01:02:12.380
if I had the,
the confidence of today with the looks of them,

969
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:17.310
um,
but when,
when I was young,
I didn't have the confidence.
It's a,
it,

970
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:22.990
it's an interesting thing that has a lot more to do with life experience.

971
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:27.840
Um,
then with any actual trainings that you're going to have.

972
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.400
But that's my suggestions for self acceptance.
Goodbye.

973
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.700
Thank you very much and I hope we talk again soon and I hope that um,

974
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:43.400
you can draw from some of these answers and a feed on them for a while until uh,

975
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:47.960
until the next meal as we say when a pity like,

976
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:52.010
<v 0>hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

977
01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.980
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

978
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.280
Do you want to get a short email from me?

979
01:02:58.281 --> 01:03:02.420
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

980
01:03:02.421 --> 01:03:05.960
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

981
01:03:05.961 --> 01:03:10.310
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

982
01:03:10.311 --> 01:03:11.600
pondering over the week.

983
01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:14.600
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

984
01:03:14.601 --> 01:03:18.050
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

985
01:03:18.051 --> 01:03:22.370
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

986
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:27.670
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

987
01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:31.040
close friends,
for instance.
And it's very short.

988
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:36.110
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend,

989
01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.330
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

990
01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.550
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour workweek.com all spelled out

991
01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:47.390
and just drop in your email and you will get the very next one and if you sign

992
01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:51.620

This episode is brought to you by audible,

993
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:53.930
which I've used for many,
many years.

994
01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:57.860
It comes with me everywhere on the telephone in my pocket.

995
01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.160
I love audio books and they are one of my favorite ways to pass the time.

996
01:04:03.651 --> 01:04:06.470
More than that,
to indulge myself,

997
01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.800
to educate myself with time that would otherwise go to waste in some respects.

998
01:04:12.801 --> 01:04:14.450
What I'm taking walks when I'm cooking,

999
01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:16.970
cleaning up the house on the road for travel,
whatever,

1000
01:04:16.971 --> 01:04:20.720
and those in between spaces or as a secondary activity.

1001
01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:25.810
I love using audible to help me transform my downtime in a way and it's allowed

1002
01:04:27.591 --> 01:04:30.830
me to consume more books,
many more books than I would otherwise.

1003
01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.910
You can access an unbeatable selection of bestsellers,
mysteries,
thrillers,

1004
01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:37.730
and anything you could possibly imagine.

1005
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:42.120
I have two to recommend right off the bat.
One.
Uh,

1006
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:45.440
and they recommended this even for nonfiction purists.

1007
01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:50.240
This is a fiction book ready player one by Ernest Cline.
Alright,

1008
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:54.320
that's read by Wil Wheaton ready player one layer in his client.
Check it out.

1009
01:04:54.321 --> 01:04:59.030
The reviews are bonkers and this has a cult following.
Check it out.

1010
01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:04.480
And then very selfishly on mentioned one that I put together with one of you

1011
01:05:04.971 --> 01:05:07.550
guys with actually of listener of the podcast,

1012
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:10.760
who is also a huge fan of Seneca.

1013
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:15.910
So the book is Tao of Seneca Tao Tao of Seneca,

1014
01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:20.380
s n,
e,
c,
a subtitle,
practical letters from a stoic master.

1015
01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:25.381
And this is effectively an introduction to what I view as the ultimate operating

1016
01:05:26.321 --> 01:05:29.800
system for thriving in high stress environments.
That is stoicism.

1017
01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:32.470

I'm getting old from all over the world at different stages of growth and

1044
01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:13.740
nothing can quite drain your resources and cost you time and money like making

1045
01:07:14.321 --> 01:07:15.520
mistakes in hiring.

1046
01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:21.090

to solve two of the biggest problems and bottlenecks for employers posting jobs

1048
01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:30.370
easily and then making it even easier to find the best candidates.

done that.

1056
01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:01.300
Don't recommend it or dealing with calls to the office,
etc. None of that.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:06.220
Simply screen rate and manage your candidates all in one place on Ziprecruiter's
