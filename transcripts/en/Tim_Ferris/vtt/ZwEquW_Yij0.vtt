00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.830
Greeting spokes,
Tim Ferriss here,
author of four hour work week,
tools of titans,

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:05.520
et cetera.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.140
I think a lot about ingesting information and it sounds so sexy,

4
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:10.920
doesn't it?

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.920
Learning how do you speed up the consumption of say text if you want to read

6
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:18.061
faster?

7
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:23.061
How do you do that without succumbing to some pseudoscience nonsense about speed

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:26.430
reading?
There's a lot of garbage out there,

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.260
but how can you improve your ability to absorb written information without

10
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.650
sacrificing comprehension?
There are some very straightforward ways to do it.

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.370
I'm going to show you that right now and I will use these two books to

12
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:43.260
demonstrate.
So these are fiction and nonfiction respectively,

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.080
how to get filthy rich in rising Asia.
One of my favorites,
uh,

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.240
recent fiction books,
which I generally don't try to read super quickly,

15
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:54.810
but these books are the same size.
So I'll show you then vagabonding,

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.180
which is one of my faves has been since 2004.
All right,

17
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.190
so let's take just for the sake of simplicity and I would recommend you do the

18
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:06.630
same.
A book that has fairly standardized formatting.
In other words,

19
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:10.260
there aren't a lot of bullet lists,
there aren't a lot of graphs.

20
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.730
It's mostly text.

21
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.410
And since we can only manage what we can measure,

22
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.680
step number one is figuring out roughly how many words per page are on,

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.720
uh,
this particular say spread,
right?
And then throughout the book,

24
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:29.550
so you're going to go through and you're going to count,

25
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.250
say on a page like this,
the number of words in 10 lines.
Okay?

26
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.350
So you come up with a total divided by 10.

27
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.560
That's your average number of words per line.

28
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.810
And then you can see here,

29
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.370
most books have a consistent number of lines per page.

30
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.110
You multiply that,
let's just say it's 30.
Okay?

31
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:54.510
If an average of 10 words per line,
that's 300 words per page.
Great.

32
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.470
Easy enough.
All right,
well,
we want to do next is establish your baseline.

33
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.390
So you're going to read for one minute,

34
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.160
you're going to be focusing on reading at your normal speed.
Of course,

35
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:10.050
now you have,
uh,
an experimental or observer effect.
So it might be slightly off,

36
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:14.150
but that's all right.
You're going to read for one minute.
And,
uh,

37
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.490
then you're going to do the math and multiply it out and figure out how many

38
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:21.240
words roughly have I read that is your words per minute rate.

39
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.860
WPM and uh,

40
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.910
what we do should help double or triple that without too much trouble right now.

41
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.080
Uh,
I'll do demo before we go into how to mess with your book.

42
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.210
If you look at say my nose.
All right,
and this video,

43
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.650
can you still see my finger?
Of course you can.

44
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.810
Can you still see my finger over here?
Yes.

45
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:48.750
You get that is your peripheral vision.
Even if your fixation point,

46
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.970
if your primary point of focus is right here,

47
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.120
when we read most of us,

48
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.020
when we were taught to read,
we read word by word,

49
00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:02.180
so we go from the furthermost left word to the furthermost,

50
00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.930
a right word and so on.
Seems logical.

51
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.700
The problem with that is is you're not using any of this space or the margins

52
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.060
and the way that you then remedy that is by drawing lines on some pages.

53
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.200
And I would suggest you indent one word from either side.
Okay.

54
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.310
And so what that might look like is

55
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.840
something like this.

56
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.350
So now you have lines going down either side of the page and instead of starting

57
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.330
all the way to the left,

58
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.630
you're going to start at this line and then you're going to end at that line.

59
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.580
So much like a say typewriter with a return carriage going down,

60
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.090
you're now going to be zigzagging just as you would normally,

61
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.180
but the parameters or the boundaries have been moved in by word.

62
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.090
You will,
you will not have any trouble reading and you,

63
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.800
you should still have full comprehension.

64
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.730
And if you do this for say five to 10 pages,

65
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.110
then if you're not having any trouble whatsoever,
you can indent by another word.

66
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.920
And you can either use lines or you can spitball it,
you can estimate it.

67
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.460
And by doing this alone,

68
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.530
just that you can train yourself to get to the point where effectively you are

69
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:28.531
very much focusing on the middle third of the page and you're just dotting down

70
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.330
the page left to right.

71
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.990
And that in and of itself could easily double your reading speed without

72
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:40.360
sacrificing comprehension.
Uh,

73
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.420
the next observation just mechanically that can be very helpful is that the eye

74
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.180
doesn't track in a clean,
smooth line when you are say,

75
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:56.590
glancing from left to right,
right.
So if you want to do a test close one eye,

76
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.920
you put a finger on that eye and then slowly track across the wall on the

77
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:06.760
opposite side.
And what you'll notice is that the eye jumps,
right?
And these are,

78
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:09.850
I believe,
I've never actually heard this,
said I've only read it a million times.

79
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.370
CICADAS movements.
Uh,
the,

80
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.200
I will jump from fixation point to fixation point and you can see this with

81
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:19.920
retina scanning and eye tracking,
which uh,

82
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.080
I've seen a fair amount of just in psychological studies.

83
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:24.070
I've been an experiment or,

84
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:29.071
and the subject both at Princeton where I did stuff actually in the lab of Danny

85
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.410
Kahneman who won,
who wrote thinking fast and slow,
incredible,

86
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:35.020
incredible scientists.
But I was just clicking space bars,

87
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:38.410
looking at stuff on the screen.
Uh,
and then at UCF and other places,

88
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.970
how do we utilize that?
What that means is when you're looking at a given page,

89
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.710
your eye isn't moving smoothly across each line.

90
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.870
It's fixation,
fixation,
fixation.

91
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.160
So the less that we can regress,

92
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.930
meaning bounce back or bounce up,

93
00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.990
you want to stay on that reliable forward path and the fewer fixation points we

94
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.110
have,
it's just a math problem.

95
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.950
The less time we're going to spend reading each page,
what does this mean?

96
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.330
This means that thus far we've just been looking at the page and reading.

97
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.970
What we're going to do now is use a pacer so you could use your finger and now

98
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:21.971
you are actually going to track with your finger trace underneath the line like

99
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:28.250
so and try to think of two fixation points per line for your eye.

100
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.940
But this will keep you from bouncing up to previously read material.

101
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:33.890
We've all had the experience of being really sleepy,

102
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.580
say and feeling like you've read the same two lines five or six times.

103
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.930
This is partially because your eyes are tired and you end up back skipping and

104
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:45.380
jumping all over the place,
right?
So then you use your,
your marker,

105
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.630
your Pacer to move down the page.

106
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.020
And the last test I would have you run or experiment prior to re measurement.

107
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.860
So let's say you do that for 10 minutes.
And so you've,

108
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.450
you've moved in the,
in the boundaries,
uh,
the,

109
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.070
the edges of the page so to speak,

110
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:07.520
where you stop and go to the next line and then you're minimizing the number of

111
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:10.130
fixations and you're preventing back skipping by using Pacer.

112
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:14.300
And the next thing you're going to do is say for five minutes is to read

113
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:17.240
slightly faster than your comprehension allows.

114
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.160
So you want to get to the point where you're losing maybe 10% and the effect

115
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:27.161
that we're looking for is resetting your comfort set point in reading at full

116
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:28.850
comprehension.
In other words,

117
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.470
if you're used to always driving at 30 miles an hour and then you get to the

118
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:34.730
point where you're on a highway,

119
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:38.900
say I was just in Texas and it was speed limit 80 miles an hour,

120
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.730
oh my God,
does that feel fast?

121
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:43.940
And suddenly you feel like you're operating at very high speed.

122
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.650
You then dial back.
When you go into say a 55 zone,
it feels like 30,

123
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.390
right?
You've adapted to the faster speed.
So for five minutes,

124
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.950
just practice reading with slight comprehension loss a little bit faster than is

125
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:58.784
comfortable.

126
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.150
And then what I want you to do is retest your words per minute rates.

127
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:05.660
And now you're going to use the bumping in from either side.

128
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.050
You're going to use the pacer and I want you to make sure that you have full

129
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:11.960
comprehension.
And in doing that,

130
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.400
I would wager that the vast majority of you,
uh,

131
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.860
probably close to a hundred percent if he followed all these instructions will

132
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:23.210
have at least improved your reading speed by 50%.
Some of you will double,
triple,

133
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.560
quadruple your reading speed without sacrificing comprehension,
no Voodoo,

134
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.590
no magic involved.
It's just understanding the mechanics of the eye.

135
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.180
A little bit about the,
uh,

136
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.540
about optical perception and then recognizing how you can optimize that for the

137
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:40.670
printed page.
And that's it.
So congratulations.

138
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:44.900
You've probably doubled or tripled your reading speed.
And for poetry.

139
00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:46.760
For fiction,
you can always read slower,

140
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.660
but now that you have a Ferrari instead of a Yugo,

141
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:54.600
you can choose from a wider range of speeds.
So there you have it.

142
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.640
Have Fun reading.

143
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.200
I recommend both how to get filthy rich in rising Asia and vagabonding among

144
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:04.320
many,
many others.
There's a world out there to explore us.
I'll let you get to it.

145
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.720
If you enjoy this video,
I want to propose you check out the podcast,

146
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.130
the Tim Ferriss show.
Why has it been number one on iTunes across all categories?

147
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.180
In some cases,
