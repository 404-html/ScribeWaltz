Optimal at this altitude,

00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:07.570
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.
Now

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.520
I'm a cybernetic organism.

24
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.360
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tim Ferriss,
again,
the Tim Ferriss show,

25
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.950
for those of you who are new to the show,

26
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.100
this is where I tried to dissect excellence,

27
00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:48.950
whether that is billionaire investor,
a chess prodigy,

28
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.550
and entrepreneur or otherwise,
how do they do what they do?

29
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.990
What are the tools and tricks and tactics that they use that you can use as
well?

30
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.580
And in this episode I tried to dissect the mind of Nick Ganju who,

31
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.080
uh,
who I've known for a very,
very long time since graduating from college.

32
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:09.290
Basically.
He is the Cto of Zoc Doc,
uh,

33
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:14.291
and has raised more than $95 million in venture capital as of June,

34
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.950
2003 or so.
And they have more than 6 million users per month.

35
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:21.110
And although nick would hate for me to describe it this way,

36
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.370
imagine open table for doctors,
uh,
elbow.

37
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.850
It fixes much more than that many other broken aspects of quality healthcare.

38
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.470
And in this episode we geek out on math,
which I'm phobic of.

39
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.610
I've had a lifetime fear of mathematics.

40
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:40.340
So we geek out on how to tackle numeracy if you're not comfortable with math,

41
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.290
poker,
ping pong,

42
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.820
how to write a hit song and the philosophical implications of Moss,

43
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.440
of Monsters Inc uh,
one of my favorite movies,
certainly among many other things.

44
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.030
It is not too dense.

45
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.140
That's the whole idea to try to demystify and disarm the things that are

46
00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:57.974
intimidating.

47
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.950
And Nick has just an incredible capacity for simplifying what is,

48
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.880
what appears to be the very,
very difficult.
So I had a blast with this.

49
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.300
I hope you do as well.
So please meet Nick Ganju.

50
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.581
Hello everybody.

51
00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:18.810
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode in addition of the Tim

52
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.500
Ferriss show.

53
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.030
Today is a rare treat because I have an old friend of mine who's got all sorts

54
00:03:24.031 --> 00:03:28.710
of dirt on me and knows all the skeletons in the closet.
Nick [inaudible] Nick,

55
00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:29.544
how are you?

56
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.120
<v 2>I'm great.
How are you doing?
I'm doing very well.</v>

57
00:03:32.121 --> 00:03:35.180
And you're in New York City at the moment.
Yeah,
that's right.

58
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.790
<v 1>So the uh,</v>

59
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.600
the beginning I suppose goes back some ways we initially met,

60
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.760
<v 2>it must've been in 2000.
Is that right?
Yeah,
I think so.
I think,
uh,</v>

61
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.140
you were,
uh,
looking for an apartment and uh,
and uh,

62
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.240
I had an extra bedroom that I was renting a,

63
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.910
<v 1>and I,
if I remember correctly,
I didn't make the cut.</v>

64
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.700
This was,
this was@theheightofthe.com boom.
At a,

65
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.260
at,

66
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.590
at a point where I suppose it was right at the top of the roller coaster and a

67
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:15.430
lot of ways and housing was just next to impossible,

68
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:18.810
not unlike what it's like right now.
And I guess it must,

69
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:23.710
it must have been craigslist casual encounters or um,
the,
uh,
the,

70
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:28.711
the rental section and we met up and didn't end up becoming roommates but ended

71
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:32.320
up becoming friends and playing a lot of pool.
And it was,

72
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.200
it was amusing to me to,

73
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.410
to read your official bio for the first time yesterday to try to get some

74
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.270
additional context.
See,

75
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.940
you ended up being the bay area billiards champion.
Is this right?

76
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.000
<v 2>Yeah.
Who was like a,
uh,
one of those leagues that you,
you join and uh,</v>

77
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.650
ended up being the champion that year.

78
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.740
I played a lot of pool in college and then since we were both just out of

79
00:04:54.741 --> 00:04:59.060
college,
I,
uh,
I had,
uh,
you know,
still retained all that skill.

80
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.740
If you played me right now,
I'd probably be really rough.

81
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.520
<v 1>And the what we're going to dig into some of the other,
uh,
very varied,</v>

82
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:09.080
eclectic,
sort of Doseck keys,
uh,

83
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.450
skills that you got the seem to have like table tennis and sort of deconstruct

84
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:16.510
why that is.
Um,
also get into the music.

85
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.030
But for those people who aren't familiar with you,
uh,
and,
uh,
we,

86
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:23.620
we can certainly get into the professional stuff.
But where did you,

87
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:25.340
where did you grow up?
What,
uh,
what,

88
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.970
what did your parents do it maybe you can give us some background.

89
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.080
<v 2>Sure,
sure.
Uh,
I grew up in Chicago,
uh,</v>

90
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.020
in the West suburbs of Chicago.
Uh,
my parents were both doctors,
so,

91
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.230
uh,
you know,
nice,
nice,
comfortable sort of upbringing.

92
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.440
I was very fortunate in that way.
Uh,
went to Undergrad,

93
00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:48.090
majored in computer science,
uh,
finished in 1998,
uh,

94
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:51.510
worked in Austin,
Texas at a company called trilogy for a year,

95
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.370
but then decided that the,
you know,

96
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:58.310
that the.com boom of the time was just way too hot for me to be,
uh,
working,

97
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.410
uh,
at a larger company.
So,
you know,
like all the,
all the gold,

98
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:07.280
a hunter's of of history.
I moved out West to California,

99
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.290
uh,
you know,
for,
for the gold rush of 1999,
I guess you could call it.

100
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.810
Um,
and uh,
you know,
and tried my luck at a couple startups there.
And,
uh,

101
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.580
<v 1>you,
you ended up then as far as bringing us to the,</v>

102
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.530
to the current day cofounding Zoc doc,
uh,

103
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.150
and uh,
the what,
what is the current state of,

104
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.200
of Zoc doc,
how many employees do you have?
Maybe you can give us some stats.

105
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.020
<v 2>Yeah,
sure.
Uh,
we're currently,
uh,</v>

106
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.610
about 500 to 600 employees.
Um,
and,
uh,

107
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.640
over 6 million people visit Zoc doc each month to search for a doctor.

108
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.530
And,
uh,
you know,
to,

109
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:55.110
to give a little background zoc doc is a site where you can come,

110
00:06:55.111 --> 00:06:58.110
you can search for a doctor and a,
you can see reviews,

111
00:06:58.111 --> 00:07:02.460
you can see photos and you can book an appointment right online.
So,
uh,

112
00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:04.440
in the way that you can book everything else online these days,

113
00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:08.370
we're trying to bring a doctor appointment booking online.

114
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.820
<v 1>Now,
for those people who haven't used the site,
would it be fair to,</v>

115
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.630
just as an imperfect analogy,
say that it's similar to a,

116
00:07:16.631 --> 00:07:21.600
it's a more refined open table plus a bunch of other extra benefits for doctors

117
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.330
that it has that sort of ease of use or,

118
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.620
<v 2>or more?
Yeah,
certainly.</v>

119
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.500
Certainly it has that open table aspect where you're going to book appointments

120
00:07:28.501 --> 00:07:29.334
online.
Of course,

121
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.000
it also has the ELB aspect where you can see reviews and you can see photos.
Uh,

122
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.940
and you can also now a check in,

123
00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:38.980
which means you can fill out your medical history forms,
uh,

124
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.550
online before you get to the doctor's office.

125
00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:45.000
So that medical forum is now prefilled and you know,
as,

126
00:07:45.001 --> 00:07:47.690
as you visit subsequent doctors,
you don't have to refill it medical forms.

127
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:48.780
So we're,
you know,
we're,

128
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.840
we're slowly adding more and more features that make that process as painless as

129
00:07:54.601 --> 00:07:55.434
possible.

130
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.000
<v 1>The one of the,
one of the topics that I wanted to talk about comes to mind.
Uh,</v>

131
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:06.130
when I call to my memory the first visit to the Zoc doc offices and we,

132
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:11.150
uh,
we've,
we've spent a lot of time together.
We've had plenty of wine together,

133
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:16.550
played a lot of pool together and I've always been fascinated by your,

134
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:22.420
your ability to not just test assumptions but also cut through a lot of the

135
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:27.821
fuzzy thinking too hard numbers and analytics and the displays that you had at

136
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:30.410
Zoc doc,
the a,

137
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:34.880
the real time displays of numbers and metrics.

138
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.680
I think we're a great sort of external representation for me of your mind.

139
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.850
And uh,
many people probably do not know that.

140
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:47.960
One of the reasons I went to,
I chose to go to Princeton Undergrad,

141
00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:48.651
which by the way,

142
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:51.710
those people who are listening who might be applying to colleges,

143
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:54.850
I was told by my guidance counselor,
I would not get into a,

144
00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:58.290
I talked about it encouragement.
Uh,
and,

145
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.440
and I think this is actually going to be relevant to our conversation later.

146
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.470
You have to look at incentives because,
uh,
it,

147
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:07.680
economics ultimately is the study of incentives and how people respond to them.

148
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.880
And what guidance counselors even at very good schools want to be able to say is

149
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.030
90% of my students got into their first choice.

150
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:19.120
The easiest way to do that is to make sure that their first choices are
mediocre.

151
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.290
Sure.
Uh,
so the,
the,
uh,

152
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.190
the one of the draws for Princeton was a,
it was one of the few schools in,

153
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.190
in the top group I was considering that did not have a math requirement.

154
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.810
And Ah,

155
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:39.250
I had a horrible experience in 10th grade with a math teacher.
Uh,

156
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.460
and,
and this might seem strange to folks,
but a,
uh,

157
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.800
she was a female math teacher who I think had just been really put through the

158
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:52.380
ringer to get to where she was.
And she was really,

159
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:57.381
really kind of belligerent towards a handful of boys in the class and they

160
00:09:57.761 --> 00:10:02.100
turned me off to math completely from that point forward.

161
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.630
In contrast,

162
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:07.620
my brother had the exact opposite experience in 10th grade,

163
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:12.621
had a wonderful teacher and he went on to major in math and get,

164
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.520
uh,
you know,
pursue a phd in statistics.
So I,

165
00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:20.490
I'd be curious to hear sort of the origins of your interest in computer science

166
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.040
and,
uh,
and,

167
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.240
and also sort of your general thinking on these types of skills.

168
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:33.650
I know that's broad,
but a lot of people like myself feared that it's,

169
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.260
it's something in Nate.
It's completely innate.
You either have it or you don't.

170
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.360
Um,
so maybe you could sort of rewind the clock and,

171
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.500
and talk about your experience with getting comfortable with this type of thing.

172
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.290
<v 2>Yeah,
sure.
Uh,
so in terms of the computer science,
uh,
you know,</v>

173
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.770
I started the way that many computer nerds start,
which is a,

174
00:10:51.771 --> 00:10:56.330
I started programming at an early age,
like nine or 10 years old on my apple,

175
00:10:56.331 --> 00:11:00.200
two c a and just trying to make games,
right?
Like we had those,

176
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.350
we had those games,
you know,
we had the Atari 2,600 and we had,

177
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.100
I had some simple games on my apple.
Uh,
and,
you know,
I was like,

178
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.540
I want to try to do this.
So I,
you know,

179
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:13.280
I bought a book on basic programming and I tried to make it a couple of games.

180
00:11:13.281 --> 00:11:17.750
I tried to reproduce,
uh,
the,
the game from war games that if you remember that.

181
00:11:17.751 --> 00:11:22.130
Oh,
sure.
Of course.
With Matt Broderick.
Uh,
so I tried to make,
I tried to,

182
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.420
uh,
reconstruct that game,
which is the game.

183
00:11:25.421 --> 00:11:30.421
And in that movie is called global thermonuclear war and some pretty violent

184
00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:32.630
game.
And I,
uh,
I,
uh,

185
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.690
I tried to recreate it as in with my nine year old brain trying to deconstruct

186
00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:40.820
where they'd like deploy nuclear missiles.
And,
uh,
I actually,

187
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.930
I was actually working on it at school and grade school and my principal walked

188
00:11:44.931 --> 00:11:47.690
into the computer lab and,
uh,
I got in big trouble because I was,

189
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:52.340
I was making a game called global thermonuclear war and in fourth grade.
And so,

190
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.980
um,
but,
uh,
you know,
but,
but that,
that was the,

191
00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.730
like the genesis of my interest.
And then,
uh,
in,
uh,
in,
in high school,

192
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:04.000
we had these programmable calculators.
Uh,
and I,

193
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.600
and I started writing games on the calculator and giving it to all my friends.

194
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.460
Uh,
you know,
in,
in,
in the way that misguided nerds are,
uh,

195
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.910
you know,
at age 15,
I thought,
I thought I would get a lot of girls this way.

196
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.480
And it turns out that writing,
you know,

197
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.790
a tetris on your calculator does not actually when you the cheerleaders.
Um,

198
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.680
but,
uh,
but that,
you know,
that was,
that was,
uh,
my best strategy at that time.

199
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:34.720
Uh,
suffice to say,
I was single for,
for high school,
um,

200
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.000
you know,
but then,
you know,

201
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.580
and so my guidance counselor kind of saw these kinds of things too and recommend

202
00:12:40.581 --> 00:12:43.030
it to me,
uh,
that I,
you know,

203
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:47.620
that I go and major in computer engineering or computer science.
Uh,

204
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.360
and that was something that was not even really apparent to me that,
that,

205
00:12:51.361 --> 00:12:54.250
that was a whole major and stuff.
And of course,
this is in the 90s,

206
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:57.670
and you couldn't just Google things.
Uh,
and so it's just information.

207
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.220
It was almost like,
uh,
you know,

208
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.150
a revelation to me that you could just go and do this as a,
as a profession,
uh,

209
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.300
and you know,
and there's like actually a formal training,

210
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:09.880
like you can actually go to a four year college and get and get a computer

211
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:13.990
science degree.
Um,
so that,
that was great.
Uh,

212
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.710
and so I,
you know,
I went to University of Illinois,
uh,

213
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.790
which is just like sort of a top five computer science school.
It kind of,

214
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.010
it kind of floats in and out of there.
Uh,

215
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:26.560
some years it's number four and some years this number seven or whatever.

216
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:31.060
It's tough to Austin,
didn't Mark Andreessen develop mosaic there?
Yeah.

217
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.970
Injuries since from their Max Levchin from paypal's,
from there.
Uh,
you know,

218
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.170
a bunch of sort of illustrious current,
uh,
you know,

219
00:13:38.171 --> 00:13:42.970
silicon valley mogul's are from there.
So,
uh,
yeah,
it's a good school.
Um,

220
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.680
and I,
you know,
I certainly really,

221
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.810
really fell in love with computer science when I,

222
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.560
when I did those four years and kind of knew that that's what I wanted to do as

223
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:53.800
a profession.
What made you fall in love with it there?

224
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.470
And what do you think makes it a good,

225
00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.260
what makes it a top five program?

226
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:04.180
Aside from maybe the selection bias and having really good applicants over time

227
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:07.270
start to selected?
Yeah,
and certainly that's,
you know,

228
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:10.420
certainly every school has that sort of self fulfilling prophecy when you start

229
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:13.870
to get that you gained traction in all the best kids want to go to your school.

230
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.100
Um,
but I think that they,
uh,

231
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:21.040
are very vigilant about keeping the computer science curriculum current.

232
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.530
Uh,
and so you can see,
and I had,
I had,
uh,
you know,

233
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.210
I had a couple of friends that had gone to different schools,
uh,

234
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.540
at that time and also majored in computer science.
And,
you know,

235
00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:35.830
I was learning Java at the time,
which was the hot new thing.
This is like 19,
uh,

236
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.790
1996 or something.
And,
and,
and,
you know,
there were,
we already had courses in,

237
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.990
in Java and my friends were still learning stuff in c.
Um,

238
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.580
and so,
uh,
you know,
I think that the,
the new schools are,

239
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.860
are the best schools are very diligent about the,

240
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.080
the curriculum uptodate especially in,
in computer sciences.
We all know the,

241
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.650
the industry and the technology has changed so quickly

242
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.560
<v 1>and in a,
in a world where that's changing so quickly,</v>

243
00:15:01.561 --> 00:15:05.580
I think this is part of what's so intimidating to a lot of folks,

244
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:10.110
whether they're just trying to get by and want to be employable,
uh,

245
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:15.260
or they are hoping to invest in technology companies,

246
00:15:16.141 --> 00:15:21.000
which is a very dangerous game to play,
I think for a lot of reasons.
But,
uh,

247
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:25.820
the how much past a certain point,
uh,
because I,

248
00:15:25.821 --> 00:15:30.630
I recognize,
for instance,
it's easy for me to look at learning natural languages,

249
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.830
which I assumed it was bad at learning up until 15 or 16.

250
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.520
And I can destroy a lot of myths and old wives tales about that.

251
00:15:41.581 --> 00:15:44.340
So when someone says to me,
Oh my God,
I'm too old to learn a language,

252
00:15:44.341 --> 00:15:48.630
it would take me at my entire lifetime,
takes decades to become fluent,
blah,
blah,

253
00:15:48.631 --> 00:15:51.180
blah.
I can,
I can very easily dismantle those.

254
00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:55.440
And get people excited about learning a language,
even if they're,
you know,
30,
40,

255
00:15:55.441 --> 00:15:59.550
whatever it might be with computer science and math.

256
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:00.990
Uh,

257
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:05.370
I have a lot of insecurities and I can do very basic stuff,

258
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.810
but never to calculus,
you know,
got up to precal and,
uh,

259
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.580
how,
how is,
how coachable are these things and,

260
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:19.790
and how valuable is it to try to become more comfortable with sort of the

261
00:16:21.631 --> 00:16:26.610
quantified side of life,
um,
at,
at,
uh,
at a later point,
right.
I just turned 37.

262
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:26.970
It's,

263
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.840
it's one of these things that dogs me as an insecurity much in a way that not

264
00:16:30.841 --> 00:16:34.190
being able to swim dogged me for until I was 30.
Yeah.
Uh,

265
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.360
but maybe you could maybe comment on that.

266
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.590
<v 2>Sure,
sure.
Uh,
I think,
you know,</v>

267
00:16:38.591 --> 00:16:43.180
there's certain fields of math that are extremely important and just become more

268
00:16:43.181 --> 00:16:46.760
and more relevant every day.
And you see like this kind of,
you know,

269
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.500
like the big data,
sort of a,
I hate to use buzz words,
but that,
you know,

270
00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:52.990
that sort of trend that that is,
uh,
you know,

271
00:16:52.991 --> 00:16:57.520
has come into favor in the last few years,
which is a very real thing.

272
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.980
Uh,
despite the buzzwords,
uh,
you know,

273
00:16:59.981 --> 00:17:03.250
there's a lot of sort of information to be gleaned and,
uh,

274
00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:06.010
improvements in our society to be had from,
from,
you know,

275
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.200
from statistical analysis.
So,
you know,

276
00:17:08.201 --> 00:17:12.370
statistics and probability in statistics or things that are just going to become

277
00:17:12.371 --> 00:17:16.960
bigger and bigger parts of our,
of our world.
Uh,
you know,
in terms of calculus,

278
00:17:16.961 --> 00:17:21.520
I don't think,
I think if anything,
calculus is sort of diminishing because,
uh,

279
00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.600
that,
that sort of,
that sort of field of map was more applicable when you,

280
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:30.930
when you didn't have a giant computer on every desktop giant in terms of

281
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.700
processing power,
uh,
to,
to crunch,
uh,

282
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:39.510
the crap out of out of numbers and a lot of things that were,
uh,
uh,

283
00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.370
I'm trying to make it like layman's a lot of things that were closed form

284
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:44.230
solutions,
which means,
uh,
you know,

285
00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:48.120
they got solved through these sort of complex equations that you see with,

286
00:17:48.121 --> 00:17:49.860
you know,
lots of weird symbols and the,

287
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:55.080
<v 1>uh,
now computers can just sort of brute force,
crank out the answers to them.
Uh,</v>

288
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.270
and,
and,
and in a better way to,
because it's sort of a,

289
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.270
you can more closely mirror reality,
uh,

290
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.310
with the computer than you can with a closed form solution,

291
00:18:05.311 --> 00:18:09.870
like a calculus equation.
And so,
um,
and so I don't think,
you know,
it's,

292
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.660
it's not a big deal if most people don't know calculus.
But there's,
there's,

293
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.980
there's fields of math which are certainly helpful in understanding what would,

294
00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:21.600
uh,
what would those areas be?
And I suppose just to jump right into it,
you know,

295
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.840
if you were,
I this,

296
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.600
this conversation is inspired for those people listening partially because we

297
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:32.580
sat down at Zoc doc offices to talk about,
uh,
encryption.

298
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.290
And,
uh,
I remember I was,
I would be,

299
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:40.370
I'd become really fascinated by encryption and ciphers and code breaking because

300
00:18:42.091 --> 00:18:46.530
of a science fiction,
I suppose you could call a science fiction book,
uh,
called,

301
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.270
uh,
cryptonomic con and yeah.

302
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.620
So we started talking about encryption and Ed,

303
00:18:51.621 --> 00:18:56.621
you got up and walked me through the basic principles of encryption,

304
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.230
uh,
in feel free to correct me or provide some details if I'm missing them,

305
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:04.230
but as it applies in a lot of computer science.

306
00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:07.830
Then we went out to dinner that night and sat down with a bunch of really

307
00:19:07.831 --> 00:19:12.480
impressive cts and a it guys who've been vps of engineering and we talked about

308
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:17.481
encryption and it just blew my mind that something that I felt so utterly out of

309
00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:20.880
my depth with a few hours earlier.

310
00:19:20.881 --> 00:19:23.040
I was able to actually see cogently,

311
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:27.260
listen to discourse about in a few hours.
Um,

312
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.490
and that really encouraged me,

313
00:19:29.491 --> 00:19:33.660
but it's been hard for me to determine how to,
how do I walk out?

314
00:19:33.661 --> 00:19:36.690
And I mean,
I know you're a good friend of mine,
but you're so busy,

315
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:39.840
so it's like I don't want you to be my,
uh,
my pro bono,

316
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.890
you know,
like mental model mentor.
Uh,
yeah.

317
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:49.260
So how,
how should somebody d how should somebody in,

318
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.630
in a fun or interesting way develop some of these skills,
right?
Because,

319
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.530
uh,
you'd look at this,
and this is such a simple thing,

320
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:03.210
but it kind of blew my mind when,
uh,
the probabilities.
All right,

321
00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:06.510
if we look at probabilities,
humans are so bad,

322
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.130
sort of intrinsically it seems at working with probabilities.
And,
uh,

323
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.500
if you have,
let's say a birth,

324
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.500
if you have a big party and people bump into each other and they have the same

325
00:20:16.501 --> 00:20:20.940
birthday party,
you know,
our birthday date,
they're sort of astonished,
right?

326
00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:23.460
They're like,
oh my God,
what are the chances?
It's like one in a million.

327
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.240
And I'm just,

328
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.110
and I'm just looking at this description here on Wikipedia of the the birthday

329
00:20:28.111 --> 00:20:30.840
problem or the birthday paradox.
And you know,

330
00:20:30.841 --> 00:20:33.620
the probability obviously reaches a hundred when the number of people reaches

331
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:38.310
367,
because there are,
you know,
that where we extrapolate from 365 days a year,

332
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:42.210
but you get to 50% probability with just 23 people.

333
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:47.110
And it's just,
it's so hard for people to grasp that so well to be,
to be,
well,

334
00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:48.160
let,
let,
let me refine

335
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.300
<v 2>it a little bit to be,
to just state it really precisely.
It's not the,
uh,</v>

336
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.800
one of those people,
one of those 23 people,
uh,

337
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.640
could go and ask the other 22 and odds are it would find the same birthday,

338
00:21:00.641 --> 00:21:04.180
right?
It's that any two of those 23 people have the same birthday.

339
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.910
Does that make sense?
It's a little,
it's a little bit different,
but it actually,

340
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.980
uh,
I think that's where the misconception comes in is that,
you know,

341
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:15.010
you kind of take from it like,
wow,
if I walked around and asked 22 people,

342
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.770
like there's a 50% chance that,
uh,

343
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.440
that I'd have the same birthday as one of them,
which is not the right,

344
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.060
not the right way to think about it.

345
00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.740
<v 1>Right.
And the devil's in the details,
right?
With those subtleties,</v>

346
00:21:25.741 --> 00:21:30.210
I mean massive miscalculations even by very smart,
experienced people,

347
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.570
right?
You look at something like longterm capital management,
right?

348
00:21:33.571 --> 00:21:36.720
They build this massively sophisticated system that doesn't take into account

349
00:21:36.721 --> 00:21:39.690
that somebody else could have a similar machine.

350
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.760
It would then sort of trigger trigger this a crazy back and forth,
uh,

351
00:21:44.761 --> 00:21:46.650
that would end in catastrophe.
Right?

352
00:21:46.651 --> 00:21:50.390
So if somebody feels as I do right,

353
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.640
that they want to be more comfortable with this type of thing,
but they're not,

354
00:21:53.641 --> 00:21:57.240
are there any particular approaches or books or anything like that that you

355
00:21:57.241 --> 00:21:58.030
would recommend?

356
00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.430
<v 2>I think I,
I think that,
uh,
people get intimidated because they,
you know,</v>

357
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.620
they sort of loot,
look online and Wikipedia especially does this,

358
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:06.490
you go and you're like,

359
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.630
what is expected value or something and you look at it and Wikipedia immediately

360
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:14.260
like gives you these Greeks symbols on the first and everyone's seen that,
right?

361
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:17.780
Like the first paragraph,
the first line of the problem.
Yeah,

362
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.640
yeah,
exactly.
And it's like,
you know,
and that,
that that serves the,
you know,

363
00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:26.050
that even intimidates me.
And,
uh,
I,
you know,
I think I know for a bit about math,

364
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.260
um,
but like it,
you know,
the,

365
00:22:28.261 --> 00:22:31.600
the best way to do this is just start really simple and then work your way up

366
00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:36.490
slowly.
Um,
and so,
you know,
when you want to talk about probability,
like,
you know,

367
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:41.260
let's play a game,
you and me,
right?
Let's play a game where,
uh,
we roll a die,

368
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:46.360
it's excited,
die,
right?
And,
um,
and if,
uh,

369
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.580
if the number of becomes six,
if the number is six,

370
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:51.760
I pay you a dollar and then it remembers one through five,

371
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.890
you pay me a dollar right now,
would you play that game?
No,

372
00:22:56.891 --> 00:23:00.510
not that I can.
Right.
So you wouldn't play that game.
And so you know,
it's,

373
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.560
it's intuition right now.
Now let's,
let's change the game and say that,
uh,

374
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.900
if,
if,
uh,
if a six comes up,

375
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:12.550
I pay you $1,000 and if one through five you should come up.

376
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:17.740
Uh,
you have to pay me $1.
Yes,
I'll play that again.
Right?
So you play that game,

377
00:23:17.741 --> 00:23:20.620
right?
So now the question is,
at which point,

378
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.290
at what point should you play or play it?
Not or not play it right?

379
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:24.500
What'd you play it at?
$3.

380
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.660
<v 1>Very Shakespearian.
No planning.
Yes.</v>

381
00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:32.460
<v 2>Play or not to play.
You know,
if,
if the six was $3,</v>

382
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.270
if I paid you $3 when a six showed up,
uh,
you know,

383
00:23:36.271 --> 00:23:40.560
would you play that game right?
Uh,
probably not.

384
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.730
<v 1>Yeah,
I,
I,
I have to start doing calculations here.</v>

385
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.000
That's that love

386
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
<v 2>it right at the genesis of it is the genesis of all math really is,</v>

387
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.190
is you starting from these common sense are these real world problems and
saying,

388
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:58.610
okay,
well,
you know,
how do I understand this problem?
Uh,
you know,

389
00:23:58.611 --> 00:23:59.720
my intuition says I,

390
00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:04.910
I wouldn't play it if I only want a dollar when I hit six and I would play it if

391
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:09.860
I want $1,000 when I played six.
Um,
you know what I do at a $10,

392
00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:13.730
would I do it at $3?
And,
and uh,
you know,

393
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.590
the,
the,
so,
so,
you know,
start,

394
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.830
start from there and we can walk through this problem,
right?
Let's say,
let's,

395
00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.660
the simple way to think about this problem is,
let's assume in six roles,

396
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.320
you get one of each,
right?
Like let's say we roll it six times and you get one,

397
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:32.270
one,
one,
two,
one three,
one four,
one five,
nine one six,
right?
So,
you know,

398
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:37.220
for the $3,
it's,
it's right.
You,
you would lose $5 for each of one through five,

399
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.630
right?
And then you would win $3 when you rolled a six.
Right?

400
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:45.800
So you would make $3 and you'd lose $5 so you'd be at negative two negative $2.

401
00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:48.740
Yup.
Right?
And so,
uh,
you know,

402
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:51.950
so you can start to see you at which point you,
you would break even,

403
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.840
which is five.
I'll,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll cheat and give you the answer,
but you know,

404
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.240
at at $5 you would break even.
Exactly right.

405
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.730
If I paid you $5 every time a six showed up,
right?

406
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:05.410
Then you would lose $5 for each dealer roles and the,

407
00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.560
and then you would win $5 when you got the six.
I'm trying to think of that.

408
00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.460
I'm tracking you so far.
I'm not as dumb as,
I'm like,

409
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.210
actually I'm a bit dumber than I looked,
but that's Sharon story.
And so,
right.

410
00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:17.900
But,
but then that's the genesis of it,
right?
So now,
now let's roll to die.
Right?

411
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.700
And like what are the odds of getting,
uh,
you know,
two sixes.
Uh,

412
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:23.091
right.

413
00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:27.860
So the odds are that each one has a one in six chance of getting a six.

414
00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:31.250
Each dye has the one in six chance of getting a six and you multiply those

415
00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:36.020
together and the odds of getting two sixes are one in 37 36.
Yep.
Yep.
And so now,

416
00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.660
right,
so now you,
now you could do the game again,
right?
Would I pay you?

417
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.350
How much should I pay you?
If you get a 36,
how much should I pay you?

418
00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:47.150
If you get to six is I should say,
and,
and,
and it just goes from there,

419
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:50.120
right?
It just gets more and more complex.
So,
uh,
right.

420
00:25:50.121 --> 00:25:54.920
And then you're like blackjack then is this is just more of the same thing?

421
00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:00.110
Yeah.
It's just a more complex version of the same thing.
Uh,
and so,

422
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.220
you know,
if you start simple and understand the,
the conceptual underpinnings,

423
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.520
uh,
you know,
and then just work your way up from there.

424
00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:11.340
I think that sort of every field of math can just be,
uh,

425
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.300
it can just be broken down that way.
You just start simple and not,

426
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.960
not get intimidated by all these Greek symbols.
And that the,
the,

427
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:23.050
one of the things that sparked my interest in exploring some of this was,

428
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:26.480
uh,

429
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.480
my experience in television when I was doing filming the Tim Ferriss experiment,

430
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.890
which Ha the future of which is TBD for those people listening and wondering.

431
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.390
It's the entire division at Turner that produced it was fired,

432
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.100
basically shut down and sitting on a shelf.
So

433
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.840
<v 1>I am,
I've been battling to try to rescue that for months.
Uh,
suffice to say,</v>

434
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:53.490
keep an eye out,
I may need some public support to get that done.
But the,

435
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.730
the episodes included at one point going to Vegas and being trained by really

436
00:26:59.791 --> 00:27:02.850
fascinating guy named Phil Gordon,
who has a CS background,

437
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.980
who's taking home millions of dollars in,
uh,

438
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.190
in winnings as a professional poker player.

439
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.880
And he had a week to train me to go a heads up,
you know,

440
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:14.970
one on one against a professional poker players.

441
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.840
And so you can imagine that week was a lot of this type of conversation or for

442
00:27:19.841 --> 00:27:23.880
sure.
And he would ask me these very,
very basic probability questions.

443
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.770
Then I would just have this like,

444
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.600
like stoned a Labrador retriever response with no words coming out of my face.

445
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:32.010
I need to just be like,
you're getting me right.

446
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:36.990
But work up to the point where he was able to give me a matresses for deciding

447
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.860
in a very binary way.
Like,
do you,
do you fold or do you raise?
Right?

448
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.330
And then it started it,

449
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.170
I started memorizing these sets of rules and it made it fun,
right?

450
00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:50.040
It gave it a context so that I wasn't grappling with,

451
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.260
uh,
some of these questions in a vacuum.
Um,
the,

452
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:59.400
the what,
what are,
and I know one of the books you recommended to me was,
uh,

453
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:04.320
how to measure anything.
And uh,
so some of it I found very interesting.

454
00:28:04.321 --> 00:28:06.960
And of course when we were,
uh,
not too long ago,

455
00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:10.350
sort of sitting in a hanging out at the pool and,

456
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:13.050
and brainstorming stuff like this and talking about investing,

457
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.760
you were able to throw an extra element into the conversation,
which was,
well,

458
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:19.170
you know,
if,

459
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:24.060
if you have it a 30% probability of doing x or 70% probability of doing y,

460
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.020
if the person giving you that information only tells the truth,
you know,

461
00:28:28.021 --> 00:28:31.590
60% of the time and then what?
Right.

462
00:28:31.591 --> 00:28:34.760
Like how does that affect the outcomes?
Um,

463
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:39.900
are there any other books or even just a games,
uh,

464
00:28:39.901 --> 00:28:41.610
or,
um,
uh,

465
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.770
or methods for making this a fun process for people?
Right.

466
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.330
Because the,
the,
the idea that I could spend a week learning poker and,

467
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:56.550
uh,
be able to play with without getting my total face ripped off.

468
00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.720
Yeah.

469
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.640
Probably 70% of the recreational players out there pretty easily is huge Roi.

470
00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:07.200
Right.
That's,
that's massive.
So that's great.
What else?
What else comes to mind?

471
00:29:07.201 --> 00:29:10.050
What other books would you recommend to people or resources?

472
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.590
<v 2>Uh,
yeah,
I love poker as well.</v>

473
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.190
I think poker is a great example of,
of math,

474
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.290
of a combination of math and like sort of,
uh,

475
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:25.260
emotional intelligence also coming into play.
Um,
but you know,

476
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:27.530
poker is a great sort of reflection of,

477
00:29:27.531 --> 00:29:30.610
of all the stuff we've been talking about.
Uh,
of course the,
you know,
the,

478
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.270
the books I've recently read a great book,

479
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.030
which is called how not to be wrong.

480
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.420
The power of mathematical thinking and this book,
uh,

481
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:45.110
by a guy named Jordan Ellenberg,
um,
is,
is a,

482
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.120
is it is exactly what we're talking about.
It's like,

483
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:53.710
it's written for an audience of people that have historically been intimidated

484
00:29:53.711 --> 00:29:55.150
by math or just thought,
gee,

485
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:58.690
I'm not good at math and introduce these things in a very simple way,

486
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:03.310
and then works up to more complex concepts in the way that we just broke down,

487
00:30:03.311 --> 00:30:07.080
you know,
probability with this dice game.
Uh,
and so that,

488
00:30:07.081 --> 00:30:10.690
that's a great book and I,
and I hope it does well and I hope it it,
uh,

489
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.570
alleviate some of this sort of,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,

490
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.000
intimidation that people have

491
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.690
<v 1>and,
uh,
does this,
uh,</v>

492
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.400
I know that we also chatted at one point about,
uh,

493
00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.540
your classes.
There might be a better term for them,

494
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:33.310
but internally at,
uh,
at Zoc doc trying to help,
you know,

495
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:34.091
poor,
poor,

496
00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:39.091
liberal arts majors like me become better at goal setting and things along those

497
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:44.860
lines.
So I know you're a fan of,
uh,
what is often referred to as smart goals.

498
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:50.220
What would you mind talking about how you set goals or how you suggest people

499
00:30:50.891 --> 00:30:55.690
set goals and common problems with,
uh,
or common mistakes that people make?

500
00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.840
<v 2>Yeah,
sure.
I mean,
I think that,
uh,
you know,
the easiest example is that people,
uh,</v>

501
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.660
so,
so smart goals means specific,

502
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:11.480
measurable,
attainable,
realistic and timely.
And,
uh,
and so,
right.

503
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:16.360
It's sort of a framework to,
to,
to help you pick goals that you are,

504
00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.330
you can objectively hit or miss.
So measurable.
It means I'm going to,
as you know,

505
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.420
I'm going to do,
I'm going to lose exactly 10 pounds or you know,

506
00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:27.100
at least 10 pounds in the next two months or three months.
And uh,
you know,

507
00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:29.800
and then you can objectively decide at the end,
uh,

508
00:31:29.801 --> 00:31:31.900
whether or not you've lost 10 pounds,
right?
As opposed to saying,

509
00:31:31.901 --> 00:31:32.770
I'm just going to lose weight.

510
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.800
And then you don't really know whether you know what kind of goal and you don't,

511
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.520
it doesn't work psychologically,
right?
You're just like,
ah,

512
00:31:38.521 --> 00:31:41.740
I'm just sort of vaguely losing weight.
Uh,
and you know,
putting that,

513
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:44.380
writing down that goal and literally putting it on while actually gives you

514
00:31:44.381 --> 00:31:48.460
something to strive towards.
But then the next problem after that.
So,

515
00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:51.010
so the first problem is just setting objective goals,
right?

516
00:31:51.011 --> 00:31:55.210
Instead of just saying,
let's try to accomplish x,
right?
Let's try to get x more,

517
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.090
like,
let's just try to get more people using Zoc Doc,
right?

518
00:31:58.091 --> 00:32:02.060
As opposed to let's get 10 million more people that use doc doc,
um,
our,

519
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:06.130
our different goals,
just,
just psychologically speaking.
And then,
you know,

520
00:32:06.131 --> 00:32:08.920
and then,
and then at review time,
it's,
it's,
uh,

521
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.570
it's easy to see whether he did it or not,

522
00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:15.460
but then the next problem after that is that,
uh,
you know,
people just say,

523
00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.070
uh,
yeah,
that sounds like a good number.

524
00:32:18.071 --> 00:32:22.240
Let's get a million more people to use it or whatever.
Uh,
and,

525
00:32:22.241 --> 00:32:25.420
but there's no basis in,
in how they're going to get to that million.
Right.

526
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.750
And so,
uh,
you know,

527
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.320
and the analogy I like to use is,
uh,
you know,

528
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:35.590
when they tried to put the first man in space was the first man on the moon.
Uh,

529
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.630
you know,
the,
they didn't just say like,
okay,

530
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:41.360
let's get on the rocket and like burn the rocket as hard as we can and maybe

531
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:45.410
we'll get into space.
Like they did all the math behind it,
right?
They were like,

532
00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:48.710
gravity pulls us this much and we,
you know,
we have to take this much weight up.

533
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.650
And so then when this much fuel,
uh,

534
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.300
but this much fueled on adds as much weight also to the,
to the rocket.
So,
uh,

535
00:32:56.301 --> 00:32:59.300
so that causes its own set of problems and then there's wind resistance and

536
00:32:59.301 --> 00:32:59.871
everything,
right?

537
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:02.750
And they did all the math to figure out how to get themselves into space.

538
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:07.870
But I feel like in business and in life,
people just say,
uh,
you know,

539
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.340
I'm just gonna,
I'm just gonna add this much,
or I'm just gonna,

540
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.930
I'm just going to create this much more,
uh,
x percent more of,

541
00:33:13.931 --> 00:33:16.180
of whatever's going to happen.
Um,

542
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.890
and they haven't really done the underlying math.
Right.
Let,
let's get it,

543
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.270
I think I'm guilty of that too.
Definitely.
Because you're,

544
00:33:21.271 --> 00:33:26.060
you're constantly told as a,
uh,
as a non quants,
comfortable person.

545
00:33:26.061 --> 00:33:28.530
Like you've got to think big and just people who are like,
okay,
great.
Like,

546
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:33.200
I'm going to build $1 billion company,
and then,
you know what I mean?
Right.
Yeah.

547
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:37.070
That's a good example,
right?
Like if you,
if you want to build $1 billion company,

548
00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:39.470
what do you,
what do you need to do?
Like,
uh,
right.

549
00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:42.440
What kind of revenue do you need,
uh,
to,
to justify,

550
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:45.680
or what kind of earnings do you need to justify being $1 billion?
And then,

551
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:46.400
you know,

552
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.580
what sort of markets or what sort of opportunities are available to that would

553
00:33:49.581 --> 00:33:52.250
create that much earnings and then how are you going to get there?
Right?

554
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:57.260
You can't just say like,
let's just build $1 billion company.
And so,
uh,
I mean,

555
00:33:57.261 --> 00:34:00.410
it's,
it's good to have that goal,
but then you need a plan to,
to execute as well.

556
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.300
And I think that,
uh,
you know,

557
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:07.110
one of the big improvements that we've done operationally is,
is,
you know,

558
00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.110
what I call business cases and what it's,
what,

559
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:13.970
it's the map of how you're going to get there.
Right?
And the example I use,
uh,

560
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:18.470
which is sort of just a fun example,
was,
um,
uh,

561
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.500
was we used that monsters inc.
So monsters are occurring.

562
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:24.930
Is there a Korean kind of theme,
uh,
at our,
uh,
at Zoc Doc?
So the,

563
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:29.900
like the monsters from Monsters Inc,
uh,
I'm blanking on their names now,

564
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:33.950
but,
uh,
those characters from that movie or you want to call one of them Elmo,

565
00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:38.510
but it's not the right name.
It's a lookout,
Mike,
Mike Makowsky or something.

566
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.760
And I can't believe I'm blanking.
Sounds good.
And just slowly,

567
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:45.260
it's slowly and then Mike would Koski or something.
Um,
anyway,
uh,
right.
So,

568
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.570
you know,
uh,
you know,
any,
uh,
team member that,

569
00:34:49.571 --> 00:34:50.480
that crushes it that week,

570
00:34:50.481 --> 00:34:52.940
we give them one of the stuffed animals and they're the monster of the week and

571
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:57.050
stuff.
So it's this sort of recurring theme.
Um,
but you,
you know,

572
00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:01.100
one of the Wa,
my example that I used to is,
uh,
they have a right,

573
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.030
they had these doors to,

574
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:05.600
to children's bedrooms where they go and they like make them either these to

575
00:35:05.601 --> 00:35:09.410
scare them,
but now they make them laugh or whatever.
Um,
jeans,

576
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.300
January,
Sully Sullivan and Mike Wazowski.
Mike was asking.
Yeah,

577
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.660
that was pretty classless.
That's cool.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
you know,
so,
so they,

578
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:21.650
they go into these children's bedrooms and they make them laugh.

579
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.280
And that generates electricity for the,
for the,
uh,

580
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.220
for the city that they live in.
Monster Propolis,
which was the name of the city.

581
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.940
And so,
right,
like,
let's say,
you know,
one day they're like short on electricity.

582
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:35.150
And so the first thing,
right,
like the first like,

583
00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:38.280
so then the CEO of monster droplets or a CEO of monsters,
zinc is like,

584
00:35:38.281 --> 00:35:41.250
let's generate more electricity and then a bad it,
you know,
a bad way to do,

585
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:43.680
it'd be like,
let's just try to generate more,
right?

586
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.430
And in a good way to do it and be like,

587
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:50.010
let's generate one more like one gigawatt more,
right?
And then it's like,

588
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:54.600
okay,
one gigawatt,
great.
How do we get there?
Right.
And then,
well,
okay,

589
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.580
so each door generates,
you know,
a megawatt,
uh,

590
00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:02.760
lean on each door that you,
you manufacturer to a new,
a child's bedroom,

591
00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:06.240
like generates one megawatt.
And so you need to generate a thousand more doors.

592
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:06.391
Like,

593
00:36:06.391 --> 00:36:11.391
you need to manufacture a thousand more doors to get to get this one gigawatt.

594
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.720
Uh,
and then,
and then,
so then how do you make a thousand more doors?
Well,

595
00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:18.300
you need like a hundred door manufacturers at each make 10,

596
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.900
and then you try to do that,
but then you realize there's like a 10% defect rate.

597
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:26.880
Right?
And so it's,
it's,
it's like sort of building up from there,
uh,

598
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.720
and,
and,

599
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.290
and understanding the math behind it and then understanding if that's realistic,

600
00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:35.550
can I have,
you know,
a hundred door makers or whatever,
whatever I just said,
um,

601
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.111
you know,
is,

602
00:36:36.111 --> 00:36:39.630
is it realistic to hire that many that quickly in one month or whatever?
Um,

603
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.330
but really breaking down the plan to,
to,
you know,
and,

604
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.070
and multiplying these numbers through to,

605
00:36:45.071 --> 00:36:49.410
to get to the goal is really the difference there between success and failure.

606
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:54.270
And,
you know,
it's not complicated math,
right?
It's just,
it's just,
uh,
you know,

607
00:36:54.271 --> 00:36:57.480
I need a thousand doors,
so I need,
I need,
uh,
you know,

608
00:36:57.481 --> 00:37:01.340
a hundred door manufacturers that can each make 10 doors in a month and then

609
00:37:01.341 --> 00:37:04.610
it'll have a thousand doors.
And so none of it's,
you know,

610
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:09.570
calculus or any of this other stuff,
but it is,
you know,
rigorous in terms of,

611
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.330
you know,
you have to be able to those,
those,
those into,

612
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.280
when you break it down to the individual components,

613
00:37:14.281 --> 00:37:16.140
those things have to be executable.
Right?

614
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.480
Can I actually get a hundred door makers and does it,

615
00:37:18.481 --> 00:37:21.270
each of them actually make $10 a month and etc.

616
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.410
<v 1>And the,
uh,</v>

617
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:29.950
how do you then translate that to say weekly Checkins more monthly check ins?

618
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:36.380
How do,
how do you,
how do people who take,
who do this case study,

619
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.480
hmm.
Uh,

620
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:43.420
who've set a quantifiable objectively measurable goal,
but,

621
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:44.150
uh,

622
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:49.150
then ensure that they are on track or at least a check in to see if they're on

623
00:37:51.741 --> 00:37:56.280
track or not.
How frequently is that done?
Um,
and,
and how,

624
00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.110
how do people improve the odds of hitting those goals once they've set it down

625
00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:03.840
on paper and taken,
say a sort of,
get the,
they have,

626
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:08.660
they've accepted and agreed that yes,
we need to understand sort of the,
the,

627
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:09.201
the,

628
00:38:09.201 --> 00:38:13.490
the different numbers that underpin this goal and the assumptions we're making.

629
00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.090
How do you,
how do they then,
how do you encourage them,
uh,

630
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:19.040
to keep on track?

631
00:38:19.041 --> 00:38:22.400
How often are they checking in or having someone else check in on them?

632
00:38:22.401 --> 00:38:23.234
How does that work?

633
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:28.720
<v 2>Uh,
yeah,
sure.
So the goals are set quarterly.
So every three months they have,</v>

634
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.390
uh,
you know,
they set this goal.
So,
so for you,

635
00:38:31.391 --> 00:38:34.360
going back to this monster thinking example,
that would be three months ago.

636
00:38:34.361 --> 00:38:37.750
It would be the,
uh,
you know,
we're going to generate one more,
uh,

637
00:38:37.751 --> 00:38:40.720
one extra gigawatt of power,
uh,

638
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.770
and then they have to write and then each week they're going to follow the

639
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:49.150
numbers that,
that you know,
that we're the breakdown of this plant.
So they say,

640
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:50.920
you know,
how many,
uh,

641
00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.410
how many door manufacturer that I actually hired this week and how many doors do

642
00:38:54.411 --> 00:38:57.360
they actually manufacture this week,
right?
And then,
right?

643
00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.800
And then you start to get confidence around those numbers,
right?

644
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.930
You start to see,
oh crap,
I can't,
I can't hire a hundred door makers in a month.

645
00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:07.180
It's actually going to take me two,
three months to hire a hundred,

646
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.900
but I can hire 30 in the first month and they're each going to contribute 10

647
00:39:10.901 --> 00:39:15.010
doors,
so I'll at least have 300 doors in the first month or whatever,
right?

648
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:18.820
And the,
you're learning something new,
you learn that,
that uh,
that Oh,

649
00:39:18.821 --> 00:39:20.260
10% of the doors are defective.

650
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.440
So it's actually not 300 doors generated in the first month.

651
00:39:23.441 --> 00:39:25.420
It's 270 doors generate in the first month.

652
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:30.570
And so then you add a new line in your,
in your,
in your business case here,
uh,

653
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.820
that you know is going to subtract 10% from your finished product of doors and

654
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.600
overtime over time,
you,
you,
you,

655
00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:41.800
you generate a really solid understanding of that game.
Of that,
of whichever,

656
00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:44.710
whichever initiative it is that you're planning,
uh,

657
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:48.970
as you add lines and as you refine the numbers,
uh,
free for each each line.

658
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.481
And then,

659
00:39:49.481 --> 00:39:54.481
so basically you start to fill in the actuals and you look at their deviation

660
00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:57.220
from your,
you know,
from your projections when you started

661
00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.820
<v 1>yeah.
From your base assumptions.
Uh,
which is something that,
uh,
you know,</v>

662
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.840
I'm constantly astonished and I do this in a very fringe,

663
00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:08.270
Flinstone sort of knuckle dragging kind of way.

664
00:40:08.271 --> 00:40:12.650
But I think if I look at just as a group,
for instance,
uh,
investors,

665
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.650
Angel investors or people who are doing early stage investments,

666
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:17.390
they form a thesis.

667
00:40:17.391 --> 00:40:20.330
They go out and raise a bunch of money and then they never modify,

668
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:26.270
you know?
Yes.
It's kind of like the parody of George W.

669
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:30.620
Bush that Stephen Colbert did at one point where he gave an address at like the

670
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:34.010
Republican National Convention or something.
And he said,
you know,
I love,

671
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.110
you know,
I,
it was,
this is a paraphrase.
Obviously we was like,

672
00:40:36.111 --> 00:40:39.530
I stand behind the president who no matter what happens on Wednesday,

673
00:40:39.531 --> 00:40:44.260
he still holds the same belief on Thursday that he did that Tuesday.
Yeah.

674
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.320
He was making fun it because cause they branded that banded John Kerry as a flip

675
00:40:48.321 --> 00:40:52.070
flopper right.
That's what it was.
And uh,
and it's like,

676
00:40:52.071 --> 00:40:55.010
it's sort of the mark of intelligence to learn from your mistakes and then

677
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:58.510
change your attitudes of thing.
Uh,
so,

678
00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.930
<v 2>so they were,
they were,
they were sort of a cold bear was,</v>

679
00:41:01.931 --> 00:41:06.880
was a ribbing which for,
for,
uh,
you know,
for brand and carries a flip flop.

680
00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.430
<v 1>Yeah.
I'm not sure the,
uh,
yeah,
that that worked out exactly as they expected</v>

681
00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.600
when you were a kid.
Just to really,

682
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:17.720
not entirely shift gears because this is closely related.
Um,

683
00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:22.010
actually before I go there,
do you have all of your employees trained on excel?

684
00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:25.080
Does that,
is that what that means when they're inputting these values,
things,

685
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:26.000
that monthly update?

686
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:29.710
<v 2>Yeah,
this is done in excel.
Each column is a month.
Uh,</v>

687
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.070
and so you can see the time progressing,
you know,
going to the right.

688
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.110
And then each row will be one of these things.
So like,
you know,
uh,

689
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.930
this monsters inc it's how many,
how many door manufacturers I have,

690
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:42.700
how many do they make in a month,
what's the defect rate,
et Cetera.
Uh,

691
00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.090
and then as a month,
like turns into reality.
You,
you feel,
you,

692
00:41:46.091 --> 00:41:50.810
you overwrite the projected assumptions with the,
uh,
with the,
with the actuals.

693
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.870
But it wa I think in general,
like what I'm saying sounds really simple.
Um,
but,

694
00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.240
but people don't do it.
People just don't do it.
Yeah.
You know,
in general at,

695
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.510
and you know,
lots of companies that I visited or like you said,

696
00:42:02.511 --> 00:42:06.320
like smaller startups that I,
that I help out with,
uh,
in an advisory role,

697
00:42:06.321 --> 00:42:08.530
they just don't do these things.
And you know,

698
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:13.400
if you think about the number of projects that fail in business,
um,

699
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:18.320
and then the amount of,
of research or forethought that goes into them,
uh,

700
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:22.310
you know,
in general that that's way,
way off.
Right.
And,
and you know,

701
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:25.340
to go back to probability if there's even an,
even,

702
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:30.170
even if you think there's a 90% chance of something succeeding and a 10% chance

703
00:42:30.171 --> 00:42:34.910
of failing,
uh,
well,
then it's worth it to spend 10% of the time,

704
00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:37.940
uh,
ahead of time to see if it's going to work.

705
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:41.360
And so what that means is if you're starting at 10 week project,

706
00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:45.500
you spend a week to research it,
right?
And people don't do that,
right?

707
00:42:45.501 --> 00:42:49.010
People spend,
people spend two hours thinking about it and then go,

708
00:42:49.011 --> 00:42:51.860
that'd be a great idea.
And then they,
and they hop off and do it for 10 weeks.

709
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.843
Right?
And Yeah,

710
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.940
<v 1>just to put that in perspective,
that means if it's a 10 year project,</v>

711
00:42:56.150 --> 00:43:01.100
it could take,
you could justify a year,
uh,
in doing due diligence,

712
00:43:01.101 --> 00:43:05.230
which is totally,
entirely not the case,
obviously,
in,

713
00:43:05.231 --> 00:43:08.600
in the vast majority of instances.
Um,
yeah.

714
00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.490
<v 2>And or budget,
right?
If,
if it's a,
if it's $100 million project,</v>

715
00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.040
you should spend $10 million just researching it.

716
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:19.270
If you think there's a 10% chance it's going to fail.
If right and,

717
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.900
and more than more than 10% are projects actually fail,
right?

718
00:43:22.901 --> 00:43:26.050
So if you think there's a 25% chance that it,
that it fails,

719
00:43:26.051 --> 00:43:30.340
you just spend $25 million researching,
uh,
$100 million project.

720
00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:31.710
This is assuming that you're going to take the,

721
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.190
the research project is going to take this Basel success to 100%.
But still,
it's,

722
00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.500
it's,
uh,
you know,
and,
and in a perfect,
you know,

723
00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:43.000
it's not a perfect world and nobody knows these exact numbers,

724
00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:47.800
but certainly the amount of forethought or research that's done in general is

725
00:43:47.801 --> 00:43:50.320
like way,
way,
way under.
You know,
what,

726
00:43:50.321 --> 00:43:53.560
even a ballpark estimate would say that the amount of forethought should go into

727
00:43:53.561 --> 00:43:55.460
it.
Do you,
uh,

728
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:56.430
<v 1>do you,</v>

729
00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:01.020
do you hire people who have preexisting excel experience?

730
00:44:01.021 --> 00:44:04.230
I do not.
For instance,
I mean,
I can read an excel document,

731
00:44:04.231 --> 00:44:06.420
but if I have to create macros and so on,

732
00:44:06.421 --> 00:44:10.080
I couldn't create an excel spreadsheet that functions to save my life.

733
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:14.040
And how would you,
how would you train,
how do you train someone to,

734
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:17.310
do you do it all internally?
Do you have a certain course you recommend?

735
00:44:17.311 --> 00:44:19.670
Anything like that?
Yeah,
we do it internally.

736
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:23.340
<v 2>And then again,
like Macros,
there are just way,
way ahead of,</v>

737
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.390
of anything we're doing,
right.
Just,
just getting a standard,

738
00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.200
a excel sheet working,
just,
you know,

739
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:33.810
just call it 10 rows and 10 columns is fine and then,

740
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:35.940
and right.
And you can build up from there as,

741
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:39.510
as you learn more and need to get more comfortable.
But you know,
again,
you know,

742
00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:41.830
this is going back to the attitude again saying like,
ah,

743
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:46.170
I can't do macros and I can't do like v lookups and,
and I can't do pivot tables.

744
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:50.820
Uh,
I can't do those either.
But you know,

745
00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:54.630
but basic excel is,
is none of that basic excel is I have,
you know,

746
00:44:54.631 --> 00:44:57.300
it's just that as I have 10 door manufacturers or whatever,

747
00:44:57.301 --> 00:45:00.330
a hundred door manufacturers that are making 10 doors and you multiply those two

748
00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:03.710
cells together and you get a thousand.
Um,
and that's how you should start,
right?

749
00:45:03.711 --> 00:45:06.630
You should start with just the one row.
So like,

750
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.410
let's start with just the one row of like,
uh,
I'm going to make a thousand doors.

751
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.650
And so it's just like literally one cell that says a thousand.
And then you say,

752
00:45:13.651 --> 00:45:16.890
okay,
well what's the math behind that?
And so then you say,
okay,

753
00:45:16.891 --> 00:45:20.010
well I need a hundred manufacturers that are each going to make 10 doors.

754
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.680
So you make two new cells and you say,
you know,

755
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:24.750
you put 101 cell and 10 in the other cell.

756
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:29.370
And then the third cell that used to just say a thousand is now you change that

757
00:45:29.371 --> 00:45:31.770
to be the product of those other two cells,
right?

758
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.740
So you say that that third sal equals the first of all times the second cell,

759
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:39.220
right?
And then,
so now if you change the numbers in the,
you know,

760
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.160
in the number of door manufacturers you have the,

761
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:45.750
the thousand will automatically shift,
right?
And then,
and then you say,
okay,

762
00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:48.230
well how many door?
Why do I have this many door manufacturers?

763
00:45:48.231 --> 00:45:51.720
Why did I think I have a hundred door manufacturers?
And it's like,
oh,
because,
uh,

764
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:55.980
I'm going to hire 50 this month and 50 next month.
And so,
right,

765
00:45:55.981 --> 00:45:58.110
so now that a hundred instead of just being a hundred is,

766
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.980
is the sum of two other cells that each say 50.
Right?
And so you just,

767
00:46:01.981 --> 00:46:03.140
you just work backwards from there.
You,

768
00:46:03.141 --> 00:46:07.110
you just take each cell and break it down into its sub components.
Uh,

769
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:10.650
and pretty soon you have a working excel document and it doesn't need to be more

770
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.920
complex than that.
And that's right.
And that's a great start.

771
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:16.770
And you'll do that for a while and then you'll be comfortable with that.

772
00:46:16.771 --> 00:46:17.680
And then you'll be like,
what does it,

773
00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:20.110
what does this pivot table nonsensitive one's talking about?

774
00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:24.320
Is it actually useful?
Uh,
and then you'll go into pivot tables and write,
but,

775
00:46:24.321 --> 00:46:25.730
but nobody that,
you know,

776
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:30.180
nobody in the history of excel no matter what kind of computer genius they were

777
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.840
like started day one and was like,
how do I make macros work?

778
00:46:32.841 --> 00:46:35.360
Or how do I make pivot tables work?
Right?
They all started this way.

779
00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.470
It's just the excel and you know,

780
00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:42.540
that's like the big sort of a secret of,
of mathematicians in general is that,

781
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:46.290
you know,
everybody started from one plus one equals two and fill through way up.

782
00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.190
Um,
and it's just the,
you know,
it's just,

783
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.730
each step is not a big step once you understand the previous stuff.

784
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:55.111
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

785
00:46:55.111 --> 00:47:00.111
There's a gentlemen and believe his name is Keith Devlin out of Stanford who's a

786
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:03.510
very good at,
at,
at speaking to this topic.

787
00:47:03.511 --> 00:47:07.200
And I always find myself sort of nodding and agreeing with him after every essay

788
00:47:07.201 --> 00:47:10.260
I read or interview I here.
And then,
uh,
once,
uh,

789
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:15.210
once I sort of look at the possibility of delving into numbers and I get cold

790
00:47:15.211 --> 00:47:17.910
sweats,
which I need to get over.
Uh,
let me,

791
00:47:17.911 --> 00:47:22.911
let me change gears just a little bit and ask a sort of fill in the picture of,

792
00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.980
of who Nick Ganju is and I,
and,
uh,
the,
the first,

793
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.400
do you have a

794
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.610
<v 2>favorite book or a book that you've given most as a gift?</v>

795
00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:39.210
Uh,
yeah.
I mean,
it depends in which context.
So you can give,

796
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.730
you could give a couple.
Sure.
Sure.
Uh,
so in,
uh,

797
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.410
for my software engineers,
I love a book called don't make me think,

798
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:52.240
which is a book about usability and making,
uh,
making,

799
00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.710
uh,
software and user interfaces that,
that are friendly to people.

800
00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:00.790
And often you see the software engineers where they kind of scoff and
everyone's,

801
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.380
you know,
encountered this guy.

802
00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.940
It's like an it guy or a software engineer that's scoffs at the novice user,

803
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:08.890
right?
They say,
Ha,
this guy doesn't know how to use this thing.

804
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:12.130
Like this guy doesn't know how to use Photoshop,
you know,

805
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.230
he said dumb or he doesn't know how to make his network.

806
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.810
He doesn't know how to connect to is his computer to the network.
And,

807
00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.990
and he's so dumb.
Uh,
and that,

808
00:48:19.991 --> 00:48:23.020
that attitude is something that needs to vanish.
Uh,

809
00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:26.140
and if you look at successful companies like apple where,
you know,

810
00:48:26.141 --> 00:48:30.280
things just work,
uh,
you know,
none of the engineers have that attitude,
right?

811
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:34.480
They have the attitude of,
you know,
a bad software company has the attitude of,

812
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.880
uh,
if somebody doesn't know how to use something,

813
00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:39.370
it's their fault because that user is dumb.

814
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.180
And then if an a good software company has an attitude of if they don't know how

815
00:48:43.181 --> 00:48:43.691
to use something,

816
00:48:43.691 --> 00:48:48.050
it's our fault because we did not make the software intuitive enough.
Right.

817
00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:51.610
And we didn't make it simple enough for,
for,
for people to use.

818
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:54.300
And,
you know,
you see apple,

819
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:57.820
apple is a shining example of that where they really go out of their way and do

820
00:48:57.821 --> 00:48:58.780
extra work.
You know,

821
00:48:58.781 --> 00:49:03.160
the engineer's do immense amounts of extra work to make it easy and some simple

822
00:49:03.161 --> 00:49:06.670
for the user and they're rewarded in the market and the,
you know,
and so,

823
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:11.920
uh,
the book that I love witch,
which helps reinforce that sort of culture,

824
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:15.340
you know,
that that user friendly culture here at Zoc doc is a book called,

825
00:49:15.341 --> 00:49:20.170
don't make me think,
uh,
which is,
uh,
a book on usability in it.
And it,

826
00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:25.230
uh,
you know,
it's sort of a simple book.
It's like a hundred,
250 pages,
uh,

827
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:27.580
lots of illustrations about like,
you know,

828
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:30.610
could user interfaces and Betty and your bad user interfaces.
And it's so,

829
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.940
it's kind of an easy read,
but it is a treaties on,

830
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:37.990
on why we should make usable interfaces,
um,
and not,

831
00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:40.960
not just how we should make them.
Like,
you know,
what,
what sort of,
you know,

832
00:49:40.961 --> 00:49:43.480
user interface,
sort of patterns work or don't work,

833
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:47.710
but also why we should do that.
Right?
And right.
And this is the reason,
right?

834
00:49:47.711 --> 00:49:51.240
Like,
I mean,
think about Zoc Doc,
right?
If you go to the homepage,
you know,

835
00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.520
people discovering us for the first time,
they go to the homepage and if it's,

836
00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:58.240
if it's complicated,
they're just going to leave,
right?
And if it's simple,

837
00:49:58.241 --> 00:50:01.990
they're going to stay in and book an appointment.
And so,
you know,

838
00:50:01.991 --> 00:50:05.220
it's all very well a nice of us to scoff about,
you know,
ha ha,

839
00:50:05.221 --> 00:50:08.260
that user didn't know how to use our homepage and we can be haughty and scoff

840
00:50:08.261 --> 00:50:10.480
about it,
but then we just didn't get that appointment.
Right?
It's our,

841
00:50:10.481 --> 00:50:14.330
it's our job to get people to book appointments.
And so,
right.
There's no,

842
00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.030
there's no room for being haughty about that.

843
00:50:16.031 --> 00:50:20.560
Like we need to make it accessible to,
to everybody.
Yeah.
As a side note,

844
00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:23.470
the best,
uh,
just to choose something that,

845
00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:28.370
that people are also often afraid of learning languages.
The best language

846
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:32.750
<v 1>teacher or one of the best language teachers I've ever encountered,
uh,</v>

847
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.750
was of the,
his name is Michel Thomas.
Amazing guy.

848
00:50:35.751 --> 00:50:38.120
If you can get the original recordings of the classes that he did,

849
00:50:38.121 --> 00:50:39.770
there's just a amazing,
and,

850
00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:44.750
and what he would say to the students right off the bat was don't worry,

851
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:49.160
don't be nervous,
don't try hard,
because if you,
if you don't learn,

852
00:50:49.161 --> 00:50:51.440
it's Myra,
it's my fault not yours.

853
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.720
It's the job of the teacher to make sure that you learn.

854
00:50:53.721 --> 00:50:58.721
So he sort of took the exact same approach with language learning and unburdened

855
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.990
the student to make it the responsibility of the teacher to make it easy,
uh,

856
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:07.220
which is I think partially why he was so spectacularly successful.
So it's,

857
00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:11.480
it just goes to show,
um,
and he could get people up to basic speaking in,

858
00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:15.170
in all of the romance languages and about eight hours of class time.

859
00:51:15.171 --> 00:51:17.810
It's really amazing.
Um,
so what other,

860
00:51:17.811 --> 00:51:20.930
what other books outside of outside of don't make me think,

861
00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.990
do you do you give most as a gift or recommend most,

862
00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.790
<v 2>uh,
and then you know how to measure anything,</v>

863
00:51:27.791 --> 00:51:32.680
which is what we talked about before,
which is,
uh,
which is about,
uh,

864
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:35.500
you know,
being outcome based and being,
you know,

865
00:51:35.501 --> 00:51:38.770
getting these measurable outcomes saying I'm going to lose 10 pounds as opposed

866
00:51:38.771 --> 00:51:43.010
to just saying,
oh,
I'm going to try to lose weight.
Uh,
is you know,
and this,

867
00:51:43.011 --> 00:51:46.420
this is a great book because,
uh,
you know,
people often complain

868
00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:52.450
that they can't measure something,
right?
Like how many people like our site,

869
00:51:52.451 --> 00:51:55.210
like if people,
do people really like our website?
Well how do you measure that?

870
00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.420
Well its measurable,
right?
You can do a survey,
you can ask people,
you can,

871
00:51:58.421 --> 00:51:59.680
you're going to just look at conversion rates.

872
00:51:59.681 --> 00:52:02.890
How many people actually do something on your website as opposed to just look at

873
00:52:02.891 --> 00:52:06.040
it and run away.
And so this book is,
as you know,

874
00:52:06.041 --> 00:52:10.410
I found is quite informative on to how to think about,
uh,
you know,

875
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.890
measuring things that you might have thought were intangible historically.
Uh,

876
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:19.320
and it also goes into these kind of ideas about,
uh,

877
00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.120
why it's valuable to measure something.
So going back to what I was saying about,

878
00:52:22.121 --> 00:52:24.280
you know,
if there's a 10% chance of something failing,

879
00:52:24.281 --> 00:52:28.780
well then you should spend 10% of your time like,
uh,
before doing it,
you know,

880
00:52:28.781 --> 00:52:33.150
deciding if it's going to fail or not.
And,
um,
uh,

881
00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:37.520
and so really getting that disciplined about,
about doing,
you know,

882
00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:41.210
doing enough forethought and like sort of reflection upfront,
uh,

883
00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:44.830
is another big sort of theme of this book.
I thought the confidence,

884
00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.710
<v 1>it's interval aspect was really fascinating as well.</v>

885
00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:51.620
Not something that I've thought enough about.
Um,
yeah.
And to just,
you know,

886
00:52:51.621 --> 00:52:55.220
if you're 90% confident that something is going to happen or that something is

887
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:59.050
correct,
what does that actually mean?
People throw that around.
Like,

888
00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.430
how certain are you have 75% certain,
like how,

889
00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:05.680
how should that be reflected in your actions and preparation and so on.
Right,

890
00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:09.920
right,
right.
Uh,
yeah,
I thought it was really,
really fascinating.
Um,

891
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.780
do you have a,
what is your favorite documentary or,
or your

892
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:16.780
<v 2>movie or favorites?
And these don't have to be hybrid.
It could be legally blonde.</v>

893
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:22.720
Oh,
I dunno.
Uh,
I really like Forrest Gump a lot.
I don't know.

894
00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:27.600
That's like a common one or cheesy one.
Um,
what do you like?
Well,
it's,

895
00:53:27.601 --> 00:53:30.120
you know,
it's like,
you know,
in the beginning,
I mean,

896
00:53:30.121 --> 00:53:31.630
it's sort of a obvious symbolism,

897
00:53:31.631 --> 00:53:33.240
but in the beginning there's like a feather floating around.

898
00:53:33.241 --> 00:53:38.230
In the end there's a feather floating around and he's sort of,
uh,
you know,

899
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:41.570
he kind of flips around,
right?
Like he kinda,
he kinda,
uh,

900
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.370
I forgot the exact story,
but like,
I think he's like running,
oh,
I know.
He like,

901
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:49.590
there's a football field and he kind of runs through it because he's running,

902
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.140
he's fleeing from something and he runs back and everybody.

903
00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.900
So then they kind of like,
oh my God,
we've got to get that guy to play football.

904
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:59.130
And then he plays football and then he goes to college because he plays football

905
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.530
at the end of college.
Like some,
uh,
uh,
uh,

906
00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.220
army recruiter just hands them a flier just at random and says like,

907
00:54:05.221 --> 00:54:07.080
you should join the army.
And he's like,
okay,
I'll join the army.

908
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:11.850
And so he's just kind of floating around on the wind there.
And I think it's,
um,

909
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:16.620
it's a good sort of a lesson where,
you know,

910
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:20.140
where you don't take yourself too seriously,
right?
Like,
it's like you're,

911
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:21.540
you're going to just like,

912
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:25.770
things are gonna happen and the more you stress out about like,

913
00:54:25.771 --> 00:54:29.400
life is not going exactly the way I planned a rhythm.
More unhappy.

914
00:54:29.401 --> 00:54:30.240
You're going to make yourself,

915
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.360
which is not to say you shouldn't try to do things,
but,
uh,
you know,

916
00:54:33.361 --> 00:54:37.110
you should certainly try to shape your life and,
and,
and all this.
But,

917
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:40.050
but you know,
don't,
don't take it too seriously or don't,

918
00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:42.580
don't stress out too much when things don't go exactly how you plan.

919
00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.330
<v 1>So how,</v>

920
00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:48.330
I would love to hear maybe a concrete example from your life because from all

921
00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.780
outward
indications,
I mean,

922
00:54:52.781 --> 00:54:56.170
you've done exceptionally well with Zoc doc and elsewhere.

923
00:54:56.650 --> 00:55:01.650
How do you choose how much to plan versus a sort of allow to,

924
00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.990
to,
to bend to Serendipity,
right?
Because you,

925
00:55:07.991 --> 00:55:10.510
you do a bunch of other things and we haven't gotten into yet,

926
00:55:10.511 --> 00:55:15.170
but the music you need to take very,
very seriously.
Um,
we're,

927
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:17.710
we're going to talk about ping pong now that you mentioned Forrest Gump,

928
00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:22.450
but like,
well,
like let's use ping pong as an example.
Let's tell it,
tell it.

929
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:27.310
Maybe you can explain the ping pong,
uh,

930
00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:32.230
the ping pong phenomenon.
What are your experience of Ping Pong and just,

931
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.370
<v 2>you know,
this goes back to what you were saying about,
you know,
uh,
uh,</v>

932
00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.640
older people wanting to learn something.
Uh,
you know,
people,

933
00:55:40.641 --> 00:55:42.050
I play guitar and people say,
Wow,

934
00:55:42.051 --> 00:55:45.020
I wish I had started guitar when I was a kid so I could play.
And I said,
well,

935
00:55:45.021 --> 00:55:49.490
I started when I was 28.
And so,
you know,
uh,
still young but not,
you know,

936
00:55:49.491 --> 00:55:53.870
I wasn't like a 10 year old and,
and ping pong.
Uh,

937
00:55:53.871 --> 00:55:57.950
I learned when I was,
when I was 36 and I'm 38 now.
Uh,

938
00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:02.360
and I thought that would be,
uh,
it's another interesting thing.
It's really,

939
00:56:02.361 --> 00:56:03.860
I think people limit themselves as to,

940
00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.980
they think they can learn or it's almost like an excuse to not have to try to

941
00:56:06.981 --> 00:56:09.060
learn something.
Right?
Right.
Oh,
I'm 36,

942
00:56:09.061 --> 00:56:11.450
like I can't learn ping pong now I'm too old.
And it's just,

943
00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:14.930
it kind of makes it easy to,
to say it's,

944
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.410
it's easy to not try to double down and actually learn something because you can

945
00:56:18.411 --> 00:56:21.780
just kind of cast it off and say,
Oh,
I'm too old to learn new things.
Right.
Um,

946
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:26.860
but the of the ping pong was that we got,
uh,
uh,

947
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:32.270
we purchased two or three ping pong tables for my office,
uh,

948
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.280
uh,
two years ago.
And,
uh,
and I was the worst player.

949
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:37.510
I had never played ping pong in my life.

950
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:42.310
I'd play it like five times in my whole life.
And,
and I was the worst player,
uh,

951
00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:45.880
out of everybody and,
and everybody was laughing and they were like,
ha ha ha.

952
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.800
Because you know,
it's always fun to like,
just screwed the boss,
right?
So,
so,

953
00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:52.750
right.
So the boss sucks at pink fung.
Ha Ha,
we're all beating the bus pink phone.

954
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:56.170
And so I got,
I got,
you know,
I got a little,
I got motivated,

955
00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.720
let's say they got motivated
and I,
and I,
you know,

956
00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:04.000
and I threw down the gauntlet and they said,
uh,
okay,

957
00:57:04.001 --> 00:57:05.410
I'm going to beat everybody here.

958
00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:08.420
I'm going to beat every at this company in 30 days.
Um,

959
00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:15.580
okay,
so you proclaimed this,
this was proclaimed it out loud and,

960
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:20.090
and uh,
you know,
and I,
and I Photoshop like the,
the highlands,
the highlands,

961
00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.150
there's a Highlander,
I don't know if you remember that movie,
the phones,

962
00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:25.070
they're going to be only one.
I'm like,
yeah.
So like,
you know,
there's a soul,

963
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:29.080
there's a photo of him with a sword in the air and the lightning is striking the

964
00:57:29.081 --> 00:57:29.890
sword.

965
00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:34.000
And I replaced the sort of the ping pong paddle and ladies drinking is a ping

966
00:57:34.001 --> 00:57:38.380
pong paddle.
And I wrote,
there can be only one and uh,
but you know,
but,
uh,

967
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:43.680
I practiced and practiced,
uh,
and in,
in 30 days,
uh,

968
00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:48.580
uh,
I had beaten all but two people at the company and then,

969
00:57:48.581 --> 00:57:51.850
and then,
and you know,
because this is like the long tail of,
of right,

970
00:57:51.851 --> 00:57:54.610
like at the end of the bell curve is going to be people who are exceptionally

971
00:57:54.611 --> 00:57:59.320
good,
but,
uh,
and getting mathy again.
I know,
right.
But,
uh,
no,
it's just like,

972
00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:02.650
I mean it's like,
uh,
you know,
Facebook and Peter teals portfolio,
right.

973
00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.350
There's just sort of like a power law.
Yeah,
exactly.

974
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:09.250
Last two people who are going to be monsters.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And so,

975
00:58:09.251 --> 00:58:12.910
but then in another 30 days I'd beat those two people.
And so I said,

976
00:58:12.911 --> 00:58:15.890
in 30 days I'll beat everybody,
but in 60 days,
uh,

977
00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:20.110
I beat everybody but two people in 30 days and then 60 days I beat everybody.
Um,

978
00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:22.510
how did you,
how did you go about learning it?

979
00:58:22.511 --> 00:58:23.890
Like when you sat down and you're like,
okay,

980
00:58:23.891 --> 00:58:28.891
now I run the risk of humiliating myself if I don't make this happen.

981
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:34.420
Yeah.
What was your,
when you sat down to like plan it out,
how did you do it?

982
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:37.810
Yeah,
so first of all,
I don't think like that,

983
00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:39.620
that's an interesting sort of way to put it.
It,

984
00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:43.150
it never occurred to me to say like,
Oh,
I'm humiliating myself.
I didn't do this.

985
00:58:43.151 --> 00:58:47.600
And maybe that's like a sort of a mentality that's a,

986
00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:51.670
maybe that's like illustrative of the mentality,
right?
I wasn't,
uh,

987
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:56.320
it until you said that now,
like two years later,
it never crossed my mind that,

988
00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:00.970
uh,
like the humiliation of defeat or how humiliating that would be.
Um,

989
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:04.810
and so,
you know,
maybe,
you know,
it's just,

990
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.030
it's more constructive to just think about,
like,

991
00:59:07.031 --> 00:59:10.880
to focus on the positive of when you're going to win and not,
and not,

992
00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.990
and not fret about the downside.
So when you were

993
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:20.650
gloating over
the other,
the employees and governing,

994
00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:25.780
yeah.
How did you sit down to two to plan it out or what,

995
00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.150
what was the method?
Because I actually want to get good at pink box,
I'm sure.

996
00:59:29.151 --> 00:59:33.950
Sure,
sure.
So this is the first thing was by far the most important thing was,

997
00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:38.760
uh,
I went to the pink Pong,
uh,
uh,
like,
uh,

998
00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:44.050
a parlor by my house and took lessons.
Right.
And so,

999
00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:47.340
right.
And that was,
and then when I,
at the end,
when,
when,
uh,

1000
00:59:47.410 --> 00:59:51.290
so as I was taking lessons once a week from there and I,
you know,

1001
00:59:51.291 --> 00:59:55.160
and that of course just,
just catapulted me in my skill level.
Um,

1002
00:59:56.510 --> 01:00:00.740
but,
uh,
and what,
what happened was at the third or fourth week,
uh,

1003
01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.000
uh,

1004
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.320
one of my coworkers came into that pink pong parlor and saw me and saw me taking

1005
01:00:06.321 --> 01:00:09.950
lessons and,
and spilled to the entire,
uh,

1006
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:13.730
a company that I had been taking lessons and which I thought was another

1007
01:00:13.731 --> 01:00:18.200
interesting sort of,
uh,
you know,
reflection on life,
which is,
you know,

1008
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:21.680
people are like,
oh,
you didn't say you were going to do that thing.
Right.

1009
01:00:21.681 --> 01:00:22.251
And I was like,

1010
01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:24.730
I didn't say what I was going to do or what I wasn't going to do is just

1011
01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.700
[inaudible] you're asking.
I said,
I'm going to beat everybody.
And you know,

1012
01:00:28.701 --> 01:00:33.110
when we started Zoc doc people said the same thing,
right?
People said,
Oh,

1013
01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:34.520
you'll never get like,
you know,
there's,

1014
01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:38.030
there's practice management software that exists out there.
And they said,

1015
01:00:38.031 --> 01:00:41.330
you know,
you'll never be able to integrate to these third party,
uh,

1016
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:44.840
practice management systems because there are too antiquated and uh,

1017
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:46.550
right there they're not going to release a new version.

1018
01:00:46.551 --> 01:00:48.410
And some of some of the companies are,
you know,

1019
01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:51.270
they're not even developing those things anymore.
And we went and you know,

1020
01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:55.130
we just went into reverse engineered some of the existing ones,
uh,

1021
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.180
just by literally like getting copies of the software and,
and,
uh,

1022
01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:02.660
deconstructing the file structure and really reverse engineering it.

1023
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.230
And we got it working and all of a sudden,
you know,
uh,

1024
01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.830
Zoc doc started working the,
you know,
the,
all these,

1025
01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:13.820
all these antiquated software is we're effectively communicating with us.

1026
01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.000
And then those naysayers were like,
oh,
you didn't say you were going to do that,

1027
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:17.631
right?
Like,

1028
01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:20.270
we thought you had to strike up partnerships with all these like software

1029
01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:20.990
companies.

1030
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:23.750
You didn't say you were just going to get the software and reverse engineer it.

1031
01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:27.950
And it's like,
well,
I didn't say I was or I wasn't.
But it's like,
you know,

1032
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:31.310
if you're thinking so inside the box and then when somebody thinks outside the

1033
01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:34.120
box and get something done that you didn't eat,
you know,
you,

1034
01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.870
you should learn from it.
You should be like,
oh,
that's slick.

1035
01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:38.690
You shouldn't be like,
oh,
I,
you didn't say you were going to do that.

1036
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:41.240
That's not fair.
Right.
It's not right.
And you know,

1037
01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:43.340
that's another sort of illustration of like,

1038
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.440
I'd say positive attitudes versus negative attitudes,
but you know,

1039
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:50.540
so I took these lessons,
so I took these pink pong lessons and then they go,
oh,

1040
01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:54.590
you didn't say you're going to do that.
And you know,
then they started saying,

1041
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:56.210
only you can afford lessons.
The Guy,

1042
01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.110
the guy that came and found me in the ping pong place was like,
uh,
he,

1043
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:03.980
he ran into me at the bar of,
there was a,
there's a bar in this ping pong parlor.

1044
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.070
And he said,
yeah,
not everyone can afford the lessons.
And I was like,

1045
01:02:07.071 --> 01:02:09.860
and he's like,
I was like,
how much did you spend on these drinks?

1046
01:02:09.861 --> 01:02:11.930
And he had bought her a round of drinks for four or five of his friends,

1047
01:02:11.931 --> 01:02:15.200
and he was like,
this is $40.
And I was like,
the ping pong lesson,

1048
01:02:15.201 --> 01:02:19.950
I just took us $35 and I'm not drinking,
I haven't put any drinks,

1049
01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:22.320
so I'm going to come out of this ping pong,
you know,

1050
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:26.790
place spending less than you have.
Uh,
but you know,

1051
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:29.250
so the first thing I did was that,
and uh,

1052
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:34.500
and started with a proper forum and then,
uh,
and then practiced a lot when,
uh,

1053
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:38.220
when people weren't around.
Um,
how did you practice when people weren't around?

1054
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:39.860
So there's like a one,
wasn't it?

1055
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.270
<v 1>What are,
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna Cheat here.
I guess.</v>

1056
01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:46.560
What are some of the most common mistakes that people make?
Playing Ping Pong?

1057
01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:47.940
Just like the randos who are like,

1058
01:02:47.941 --> 01:02:51.720
have a couple beers and grab a ping pong table.
Like,
what do,
when you watch it,

1059
01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:55.380
what makes you cringe?
What do you like?
Ah,
if they only knew the basics,

1060
01:02:55.381 --> 01:02:56.910
they should do this and not do that.

1061
01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:00.110
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
Number one is,
is the,
is the grip.</v>

1062
01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.540
So a lot of people just hold it atrociously,

1063
01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:07.040
just hold the ping pong paddle in whatever way that first your first inclined to

1064
01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:09.680
do it.
Um,
and you know,
the general way,

1065
01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:12.080
there's a couple of like schools of whole of holding it,

1066
01:03:12.081 --> 01:03:14.300
but the general you're supposed to do it is uh,

1067
01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:17.750
it's called the handshake and so you sort of extend your hand like you're having

1068
01:03:17.751 --> 01:03:18.630
a handshake,
you know,
here,

1069
01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.100
but to shake somebody's hand and then you put the handle in that way.

1070
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.270
Sort of hard to explain it.

1071
01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:26.790
<v 1>So your,
your,
your four fingers,</v>

1072
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:30.090
not your thumb then or extended kind of diagonally across the back,

1073
01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.600
the flat portion as opposed to the handle of,
of one of the paddles.

1074
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:38.000
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean you don't want to cover a large portion of the paddle with your hand</v>

1075
01:03:38.001 --> 01:03:41.220
cause then your backend will just,
you'll hit it,
it'll hit your fingers.
Right.
Um,

1076
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:44.540
but yeah,
that's essentially the right idea.
Okay.
People can Google it though.

1077
01:03:44.541 --> 01:03:49.310
The handshake,
handshake method and then,
and the handshake grip.
And then the,
uh,

1078
01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.740
the other thing is people just don't,
uh,
have any conception of,

1079
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:58.670
of how big a big,
how big a role spin is in the game.
And so it's a,

1080
01:03:58.671 --> 01:04:02.480
it's a very light ball and,
and spin has an immense effect on the ball.

1081
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:04.880
And so,
you know,

1082
01:04:04.881 --> 01:04:08.840
your normal like looping forehand is supposed to have a lot of top spin on it.

1083
01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:11.840
And so every ball should have spin on it.
And,
you know,

1084
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:13.880
depending on what you're trying to do,
if you're trying to slice it,

1085
01:04:13.881 --> 01:04:16.630
if you're trying to side span,
if you're trying to top spin,
um,

1086
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:19.640
if you're just hitting it flat,
then you're sort of,
uh,

1087
01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:23.090
forsaking and opportunity to do something,
you know,
tricky with it that,

1088
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:27.800
that would,
that would screw up your opponent.
And so,
uh,
you know,

1089
01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.920
learning how to hit the ball would spin as this,

1090
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:31.880
I'd say the second biggest thing.
Cool.

1091
01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:37.470
<v 1>Uh,
what do you,
what do you have any morning or evening rituals?</v>

1092
01:04:37.471 --> 01:04:39.600
Like what does the first hour of your day look like?

1093
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:44.990
<v 2>Uh,
that's an interesting question.
Uh,
I mean,
I suppose I,</v>

1094
01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:49.950
I don't really have any rituals.
I just get up and get ready and come to work.
Uh,

1095
01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:53.620
you know,
I think that you do brush your teeth every morning.

1096
01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:57.380
I do brush my teeth as long as other days.
I remember I brought,
uh,

1097
01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:03.370
no,
I,
I think that,
uh,
uh,
I'm very fortunate in that,

1098
01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.690
uh,
every,
every day has a different set of challenges and like,
uh,
you know,

1099
01:05:07.691 --> 01:05:12.520
I kind of have,
uh,
the whole,
the whole company is as part of,
you know,

1100
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:14.320
uh,
the stuff that I'm concerned with.

1101
01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.440
<v 1>So,
so let me,
let me rephrase that because I'm gonna,
I'm gonna,</v>

1102
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:19.150
I'm gonna push a little,

1103
01:05:19.151 --> 01:05:23.680
I bet you do have patterns at least at whether it's weekly or a daily.

1104
01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:28.740
And I'm just curious what of those patterns contribute to your sort of,

1105
01:05:29.711 --> 01:05:33.880
uh,
effectiveness,
uh,
or,
you know,

1106
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:38.400
just output or lower your stress,
right?
I mean,
so you,
you know,
music is,

1107
01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:39.670
is part of your life,
but are there,

1108
01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:41.590
are there things you do say on a weekly basis,

1109
01:05:41.591 --> 01:05:45.820
like one day a week or twice a week or whatever it might be that you think allow

1110
01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:49.870
you to be a high functioning person without your,
uh,

1111
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:53.190
sort of having to be put in a mental institution every once in a while to de

1112
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.033
stress?

1113
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:57.070
<v 2>Yeah,
certainly.
Uh,
you know,
I guess I don't really,</v>

1114
01:05:57.071 --> 01:05:59.710
I haven't really thought about it in those terms.
I don't,
uh,

1115
01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:00.830
I'm such a negative person.

1116
01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:05.350
I'm know it's like an illustration maybe that I'm not like maybe not self aware

1117
01:06:05.351 --> 01:06:06.800
that like today I need to,
you know,

1118
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:09.490
today I should do something that de stress cause my stress levels are,

1119
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.360
are high and,
and certainly I do get,
you know,
uh,
to,
you know,

1120
01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:15.460
there are certainly are days when the stress levels are high.

1121
01:06:15.461 --> 01:06:18.790
And I don't think I am self aware enough to like,
have like,
okay,

1122
01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:22.950
today I should meditate or whatever.
Um,
but,
uh,
you know,

1123
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:27.040
I certainly read a lot.
Uh,
you know,
I,
uh,

1124
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:31.090
I think I try to rid myself of,
of cognitive biases.

1125
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:33.840
That's something that is extremely nerdy thing to say.

1126
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:34.301
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1127
01:06:34.301 --> 01:06:37.570
Could you explain to people for those people who may not be familiar what that

1128
01:06:37.571 --> 01:06:38.404
means?

1129
01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:43.040
<v 2>Yeah,
sure.
So,
uh,
or give an example either.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So there's,</v>

1130
01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:46.280
there's a huge slew of,
uh,
you know,

1131
01:06:46.281 --> 01:06:50.090
what a psychologist would call cognitive biases that humans have.

1132
01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:55.520
And um,
what they are,
are things that make,
uh,

1133
01:06:55.550 --> 01:07:00.260
you know,
uh,
human,
but for whatever reason,
like,
you know,

1134
01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.090
evolutionary reason,
it makes them,
uh,

1135
01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:07.100
averse to something that they shouldn't be averse to or like irrationally

1136
01:07:07.101 --> 01:07:09.710
evaluate things.
And so I'll give you an example.

1137
01:07:09.711 --> 01:07:14.570
We can go back to gambling again.
Um,
you know,
uh,
let,

1138
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:18.040
let's use the same example.
So like if we,
if it was $10,
you know,
if,

1139
01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:22.290
if we rolled a die and each time we lost each time I,
it was one through five.

1140
01:07:22.291 --> 01:07:26.330
If you lost a dollar and if it was 61,
you know,
$10,

1141
01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.660
then you would play that game,
right?
Because over time you would,

1142
01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:34.300
you would be a positive.
But,
uh,
if each,
each time zooming,

1143
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.220
I have the bank roll.
Yeah,
correct.
Yeah.
Assuming you have the bankroll,

1144
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:42.230
but let's say each time that you rolled that die instead of,
uh,

1145
01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:46.580
instead of each role,
uh,
losing $1,

1146
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:49.820
one through five,
losing $1 and six gaining $10,

1147
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:54.560
let's say they each have one through five,
you lost $10,000,
and then,
uh,

1148
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:59.360
and then with a six,
you want $100,000.
Uh,
now would you play that game?

1149
01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.200
So it,
you know,

1150
01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.500
it turns out that most people wouldn't play that game even though the numbers

1151
01:08:03.501 --> 01:08:07.790
are the same.
Uh,
because the fear of losing that much money is,

1152
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:12.620
is a great sort of insurmountable.
And so people have these,

1153
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:14.270
uh,
even though you should play that game,
right?

1154
01:08:14.271 --> 01:08:18.500
And a large would play that game and even a rational actor would play that game.

1155
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:23.180
And so people have,
uh,
so that's a cognitive bias called loss aversion,
right?

1156
01:08:23.181 --> 01:08:25.490
Like losing $100,
uh,

1157
01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:30.740
you feel more bad for losing $100.
Then you feel good when you win $100,

1158
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.850
<v 1>right?
Yeah.
The sunken costs fallacy.
Close a close cousin.
Right?</v>

1159
01:08:34.851 --> 01:08:38.740
So you have people,
yeah,
yeah.
Hold onto an investment just because they have,

1160
01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:40.760
it's gone down a certain amount.

1161
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.630
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
My favorite story of,
of,
of sunk cost is,
uh,</v>

1162
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:49.860
is there's this,
uh,
tennis is tennis club where,
um,

1163
01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.910
where you can rent a,
where the outdoor courts are free,
but the indoor courts,

1164
01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.860
you have to rent and you have to rent them ahead of time.

1165
01:08:55.861 --> 01:08:58.380
You have to rent them like three weeks ahead of time and you just pay like 50

1166
01:08:58.381 --> 01:09:02.910
bucks for the court for an hour or whatever.
And,
uh,
and this is a real case,

1167
01:09:02.911 --> 01:09:06.840
I forgot where it was,
but in like march or April,
uh,
you know,
you and,

1168
01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:09.060
and the outdoor courts have generally considered to be far more pleasurable

1169
01:09:09.061 --> 01:09:12.010
because you're outside and it's warm and whatever sunny.
Um,

1170
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:14.730
and the indoor courts are,
you know,
this uncomfortable,

1171
01:09:14.731 --> 01:09:18.600
like white lights or whatever.
And so what happens is,
uh,
in April,

1172
01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:21.810
it'll be a beautiful sunny day.
Uh,
and,

1173
01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:24.630
and the people that we were playing on the indoor courts and the outdoor courts

1174
01:09:24.631 --> 01:09:28.190
are empty.
And you say,
well,
why are you playing on the indoor court?
Uh,

1175
01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:29.640
you should go play outside.
And they're like,
well,

1176
01:09:29.641 --> 01:09:32.080
we've already paid for the indoor court,
right?
Like we already have,

1177
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:34.650
we paid for it last week,
so now we're going to go to the indoor court,

1178
01:09:34.651 --> 01:09:35.550
we're going to play.
And you're like,

1179
01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:38.250
put the outdoor cord is far nicer and it's empty.
Why don't you go play there?

1180
01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:42.870
Right?
And they go,
well,
no,
cause we've paid for this one.
Right?
And so it's not,

1181
01:09:42.871 --> 01:09:46.470
it's a sunk cost fallacy,
right?
And it's,
it's,
uh,
this is a cognitive bias,
right?

1182
01:09:46.471 --> 01:09:49.620
You should do the thing that is most like,
you know,

1183
01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:53.640
you should play tennis on the most pleasurable court then it doesn't matter if

1184
01:09:53.641 --> 01:09:57.150
you paid 50 bucks a week ago for the less pleasurable court.

1185
01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.670
If the nicer court is open right now,
you should play in the nicer court.

1186
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:03.920
<v 1>So I should,
uh,
mention for folks,
uh,
as,</v>

1187
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:06.860
as imperfect as Wikipedia might be there.

1188
01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:10.310
If you search list of cognitive biases,
um,
don't,

1189
01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.860
don't search cognitive bias search list of cognitive biases.

1190
01:10:12.861 --> 01:10:15.290
There's a long list of these types of,

1191
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:19.250
of cognitive biases and they're also a lot of books explore this like think

1192
01:10:19.251 --> 01:10:23.840
twice.
Um,
but the,
there's sort of two approaches here,
right?

1193
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:29.290
Or two ways that you can minimize the damage of cognitive biases or extract

1194
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:31.160
value from them,
right?

1195
01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:34.220
The first is correcting those cognitive biases are at least becoming aware of

1196
01:10:34.221 --> 01:10:34.371
them.

1197
01:10:34.371 --> 01:10:39.371
The second is harnessing your inherent cognitive biases for something positive,

1198
01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:45.170
right?
It's,
for instance,
um,
there are,
uh,
cases where,

1199
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:49.970
uh,
experiments have been done with,
uh,
say gym memberships.

1200
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:54.620
And so having someone pay on a monthly basis for gym membership is not nearly as

1201
01:10:54.621 --> 01:10:55.401
effective as say,

1202
01:10:55.401 --> 01:11:00.200
having them overpay in advance and then giving them a refund of x amount for

1203
01:11:00.201 --> 01:11:03.890
each y number of,
of times they go to the gym.
Uh,

1204
01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.850
and sort of harnessing that type of prepayment and loss aversion and sunken

1205
01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:10.610
costs,
uh,
to,

1206
01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.310
to incentivize somebody to do something positive they wouldn't otherwise

1207
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:17.470
<v 2>do.
Um,
so it's a,
anyway,
this,</v>

1208
01:11:17.471 --> 01:11:21.270
this is also something that I like to nerd out about.
So yeah.
What's,
what's,

1209
01:11:21.271 --> 01:11:24.870
what's a behavioral,
what's a cognitive bias that you,

1210
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:28.020
that you overcame or something that you're currently working on?

1211
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:31.050
Anything in particular?
Uh,
yeah,
sure.
I mean,

1212
01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:35.070
I think all of these things were things that all of these things are things that

1213
01:11:35.071 --> 01:11:39.350
are very innate in everybody.
Uh,
and so I think,
you know,
I,

1214
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.630
I at some point I did have sunk cost fallacy at some point.

1215
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:46.740
I did have a loss aversion and these kinds of things.
Um,

1216
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:52.240
let me see,
what's a big one that I think another big one that everyone has,

1217
01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:56.720
this is anchoring and I certainly had that before,
which is,
uh,
you know,
in a,

1218
01:11:56.721 --> 01:11:59.670
in a negotiation when,
uh,
when it's not clear,

1219
01:11:59.671 --> 01:12:03.060
like what the price for something should be,
uh,
you should,

1220
01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:06.990
you should just throw out a huge number.
Like,
like,
okay,
like you said,

1221
01:12:06.991 --> 01:12:11.160
like if you wanted me to be,
if you wanted me to be your mentor or,
right.

1222
01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:13.920
And so it looks at an hourly rate be between you and me.
Like I have,
like,

1223
01:12:13.921 --> 01:12:17.470
I have no idea.
Like I don't,
I've never taught like,
you know,
for,
for,
uh,

1224
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:21.630
for a living and,
uh,
so we'd have no idea.
You and I,

1225
01:12:21.631 --> 01:12:24.270
so in that silent moment when,
when you and are like,

1226
01:12:24.271 --> 01:12:28.170
what do you think the price should be?
Uh,
I'm going to blurt out $1,000 an hour.

1227
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:31.890
That's what I'm going to say.
Right.
And is that because I think I deserve that?

1228
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:35.370
It's because now I've anchored the conversation saying a huge number like that,

1229
01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:41.220
uh,
has,
has like blown away.
You're like,
it's destroyed.
Like your brain,

1230
01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:46.140
I've just destroyed your brain.
It's not hard.
It's not hard.
And so,
right.

1231
01:12:46.141 --> 01:12:49.140
And so now when we settle on a,
on a final number,

1232
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:52.280
it's going to be much higher than it would have been otherwise.
And that,

1233
01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:55.380
that's just a cognitive bias.
And I,
and now like,
like you said,

1234
01:12:55.381 --> 01:12:56.340
you use these to your advantage.

1235
01:12:56.341 --> 01:12:59.850
This is a situation which I can use that to my advantage.
So,
right.
The final,

1236
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:03.070
especially because,
especially because I suck at math on top of that.
Yeah.

1237
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.030
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
right.
Where's the final,
you know,
if I hadn't done that,

1238
01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:12.210
the final price might have been $25 an hour.
Uh,

1239
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.980
and since I threw out that huge number,

1240
01:13:13.981 --> 01:13:16.710
it's like screwed up your brain now and uh,

1241
01:13:16.711 --> 01:13:20.790
and the final prices is instead going to be $40 an hour.
Uh,
because,

1242
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.560
because I've done anchoring thing.
And so,
uh,
and so that,
that's a great one.

1243
01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:30.300
Uh,
for all you listeners out there,
they go into negotiation,

1244
01:13:30.301 --> 01:13:35.070
go try it,
try this,
try this out.
Um,
it's,
it only works when there's a not,
not a,

1245
01:13:35.071 --> 01:13:40.020
a preset sort of yeah.
Reference Point,
right?
Like if you're like,

1246
01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:44.340
how much,
you know,
how much I'm going to sell you my used a Toyota.
Right?

1247
01:13:44.610 --> 01:13:47.760
And how much should it be?
And like,
you know,
a ballpark should be five grand.

1248
01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:49.530
I can't be like,
oh,
a hundred grand.
Right.

1249
01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:54.840
It just sounds stupid and like rude,
right to be so,

1250
01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:56.760
so it only works really when,

1251
01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:01.110
when there's not a good expectation from either party,
that that is a good point.

1252
01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.960
That negotiating is a fantastic way.

1253
01:14:03.961 --> 01:14:07.440
That's probably the most systematic way that I've tried to dress my own

1254
01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:12.490
self.
Defeating instincts would be another way to look at biases.

1255
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:17.050
<v 1>Right.
Um,
so the secrets of power in negotiating as a great book,</v>

1256
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:20.470
the audio is even better getting past,
no,
I think it was a fantastic book.

1257
01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:22.990
Better than getting to,
yes.
Do you have any,
have you,

1258
01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:25.990
have you read any particular books on negotiating or actually

1259
01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:29.750
<v 2>the first book that came to mind for me it was getting to,
yes.
Yes.
Okay.</v>

1260
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:33.720
What I love,
I love getting to,
yes.
And I love,
uh,
you know,

1261
01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:37.350
a lot of important things that people would misunderstand.
Uh,

1262
01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:39.950
and I've just further that with the example I just said was that not,

1263
01:14:39.951 --> 01:14:43.710
not all negotiation is a zero sum game.
Yeah.
I think getting to yes is a great,

1264
01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:48.090
is a great,
uh,
you know,
uh,
exposition of that.
Yup.

1265
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:51.760
<v 1>Yeah.
No,
it's,
it's,
uh,
I think you'd enjoy getting past,
no,</v>

1266
01:14:51.761 --> 01:14:55.480
it was actually written after getting to yes.
By one of the coauthors of getting,

1267
01:14:55.630 --> 01:14:56.570
getting to yes.

1268
01:14:58.860 --> 01:14:59.830
<v 2>What a,</v>

1269
01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:04.180
<v 1>when you think of the word successful or hear the word successful,</v>

1270
01:15:04.181 --> 01:15:06.370
who's the first person that comes to mind and why?

1271
01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.620
<v 2>Uh,
I think I'd say Bill Gates.
Uh,
maybe that's a cliche,</v>

1272
01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:15.380
like sort of obvious answer,
but,
uh,
you know,
it depends on,

1273
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:19.300
it depends on the reasons you give.
I guess he's in Tech,
right?
He is.

1274
01:15:19.301 --> 01:15:24.070
Slash was a computer nerd.
I'm a computer nerd.
Uh,
you know,
he built an immense,

1275
01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:27.480
and,
you know,
one of the greatest software companies,
uh,

1276
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:32.130
greatest technology companies ever.
Uh,
and something that I aspire to do.
Uh,

1277
01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:36.080
and then not,
you know,
not only that,
but then,
you know,
uh,
you know,

1278
01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.480
sort of the second chapter of his life,

1279
01:15:37.481 --> 01:15:41.290
he's now gone and done all this great philanthropy.
Uh,
and it's something that,

1280
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:43.930
you know,
I would,
I would love to follow in his footsteps on that.

1281
01:15:43.931 --> 01:15:46.060
When your retirement time comes for me,

1282
01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.640
is to go and give back and do this philanthropic efforts.
Uh,

1283
01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:56.860
<v 1>if you were to follow Bill Gates Path,</v>

1284
01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:01.080
uh,
in a lot of those respects that you just mentioned,
uh,

1285
01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:04.970
what are the things about Bill Gates?
It,
uh,
if you could opt out of emulating,

1286
01:16:04.971 --> 01:16:05.804
you would opt out?

1287
01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:12.350
<v 2>Uh,
um,
I dunno,
I guess,
uh,
uh,</v>

1288
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:16.620
it was a tough one.
I guess the,
he could see like,
you know,

1289
01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:21.380
I guess he was very rough on his own employees and,
uh,
within,

1290
01:16:21.381 --> 01:16:24.830
within Microsoft.
Uh,
and I think that,
uh,

1291
01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:29.540
at a younger age I was,
I was also very,
uh,
you know,

1292
01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:34.280
very abrupt and sort of,
you know,
uh,
you know,
fit to like,
uh,

1293
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:38.440
so susceptible to like bouts of anger and whatever.
Um,

1294
01:16:38.441 --> 01:16:41.660
and I think I've come a long way at,
at,
at this company to,
uh,

1295
01:16:41.661 --> 01:16:44.690
to be a lot nicer and write it as like,

1296
01:16:45.090 --> 01:16:48.740
I had a couple of startups in my twenties and I think I was very sort of

1297
01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:52.360
mercurial at,
in those,
in those startups.
But,
uh,

1298
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:54.320
by the time I had started Zoc doc,
uh,

1299
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:58.040
and sort of ironed all that out and it's much better to manage,

1300
01:16:58.370 --> 01:16:59.550
be nice for some of your management.

1301
01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.660
<v 1>I like mercurial.
That's a good adjective.
I was,
I,</v>

1302
01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:05.510
it makes me think of a comedian named Jim Gaffigan,

1303
01:17:05.511 --> 01:17:10.400
and if you've ever heard of him,
but he said,
he said,
yeah,
you know,
I wish I were,

1304
01:17:10.401 --> 01:17:12.800
I think he's,
he,
I think he said at some point,
and I'm paraphrasing,
he was like,

1305
01:17:12.801 --> 01:17:13.634
yeah,
you know,

1306
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:18.770
if you're a a Latin guy or woman and you're really angry,

1307
01:17:18.771 --> 01:17:21.770
people say,
wow,
it's just that Latin temper.
And he's like,

1308
01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:25.760
but if I behaved that way,
people just say,
wow,
that guy's a dick.

1309
01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:31.060
Uh,
but a mercurial,
I liked that choice.
Um,

1310
01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:36.070
it was just my Indian passion coming through.
Exactly.
I,

1311
01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:39.650
I dunno what the,
yeah,
I don't,
I don't,
I can't pull off Scandinavian passion.

1312
01:17:39.651 --> 01:17:43.910
Doesn't,
it doesn't,
it doesn't,
it doesn't,
uh,
it doesn't usually get accepted.
The,

1313
01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.000
uh,
so on the flip side,

1314
01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:52.970
what's the first face that comes to mind when you think punchable Oh,
Jesus.

1315
01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.130
Oh,
I dunno.
I don't know.
It doesn't have to be a real person.
I'll give you,

1316
01:17:58.131 --> 01:17:58.964
I'll give you an out

1317
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:04.740
<v 2>jersey shore people,
right?
Or the,
you know,</v>

1318
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:09.770
the sort of people that are,
uh,
you know,
famous for being famous.
Yeah.

1319
01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:11.280
Not,
not the people that are,

1320
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:15.340
have actually contributed built stuff and build stuff.
Yeah.

1321
01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.370
<v 1>What's the,
uh,</v>

1322
01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:23.980
what are the most frequently played albums or artists on your iPhone or

1323
01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:24.953
computer?

1324
01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.250
<v 2>Uh,
I,
well,</v>

1325
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:31.590
I love the Beatles a lot and I think that the more,

1326
01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:34.800
the more I listened to them,
uh,
the more complexity and,

1327
01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.700
and sort of stuff you discover is as he listens to their stuff over and over,

1328
01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:42.300
which is great,
right?
A lot of,
a lot of pop songs are just really simple.

1329
01:18:42.301 --> 01:18:45.600
And the first time you heard it,
you've heard everything there is to hair.
Um,

1330
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:49.140
but you,
you know,
and the Beatles early stuff was like that.

1331
01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:53.170
Like it was really simple and kind of about like chasing girls and stuff.
Um,

1332
01:18:53.610 --> 01:18:58.200
and then later on they,
they got really,
really sophisticated and,
and uh,
you know,

1333
01:18:58.201 --> 01:19:01.890
there's a lot of lovely complexity to the music.
And as you know,
I'm a big,

1334
01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:05.970
you know,
I play music myself and I understand quite a bit about music theory,

1335
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:10.050
which is,
uh,
you know,
again,
getting sort of mathematical,
but,
uh,

1336
01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.350
really understanding why things sound good and why this chord sounds great here

1337
01:19:13.351 --> 01:19:17.160
in this kind of stuff is all,
uh,
once again,
math and not,

1338
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:22.020
not complicated math,
simple math,
but,
um,
uh,

1339
01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:24.670
but I love music theory and,
and,
uh,
you know,
they,

1340
01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.380
those guys were the kings of that.
What's,
uh,

1341
01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:31.740
<v 1>what would be two or three tracks that you would suggest people listen to,</v>

1342
01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.760
to explore that?

1343
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:38.600
<v 2>Uh,
let me see.
Uh,
if you find,
uh,
let me,</v>

1344
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:42.860
let me think.
Uh,
I like across the universal law.
Um,

1345
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:46.370
so if you buy like you,
you're gonna,
you can even see like,

1346
01:19:46.371 --> 01:19:48.560
which once you understand music theory,
you can even see like,

1347
01:19:48.561 --> 01:19:52.790
which ones were written by whom.
And so you can see,
uh,

1348
01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:58.650
like,
uh,
Paul Mccartney always plays this.
Uh,
he,
he always puts the four minor in,

1349
01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:02.630
in his,
in his songs.
And that's,
uh,
that's sort of a music theory term.
But,
um,

1350
01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:08.070
he's a big fan of,
of,
of putting the four minor [inaudible] in his writing.
Uh,

1351
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:11.370
and so you can,
when you're here,
you know,
for minor come up,
you're like,
oh,

1352
01:20:11.371 --> 01:20:14.010
I bet this one was written by Mccartney and then you go look at interesting.

1353
01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.500
Right.
And so,
uh,
I like across the universe,
uh,

1354
01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:21.240
which does have a four minor in it.
Uh,
I like,
uh,

1355
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:27.150
uh,
I like something that's,
that one's by,
I think it's by George Harrison.

1356
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:32.220
Uh,
and um,
let me see what are some other good ones?

1357
01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:32.650
Ah,

1358
01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:35.730
certainly like the more psychedelic ones like Lucy in the sky with diamonds is

1359
01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:40.050
great.
Uh,
I am the Walrus is great and uh,
yeah,

1360
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:41.240
there's really no end to the,

1361
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:46.110
<v 1>to the list.
Yeah.
If you had a thousand people,
uh,</v>

1362
01:20:46.210 --> 01:20:48.430
non musicians,
people who listen to music,

1363
01:20:48.431 --> 01:20:52.840
but I've never played an instrument and you want it to get them hooked on.

1364
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:53.743
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1365
01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:57.470
<v 1>Learning more about music and potentially playing music.
Yeah.</v>

1366
01:20:57.650 --> 01:21:01.700
What would you have them read,
watch,

1367
01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:05.870
listen by whether it's an instrument or otherwise.
I mean,
you,
you are,

1368
01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:10.490
you are in large part responsible for getting me interested in a hand drawing.

1369
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:11.623
Right.
Um,

1370
01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:16.460
but I'm not sure if that's the best gateway drug with music,

1371
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:20.420
but what would you,
what would you have them listen to or buy or play with or do?

1372
01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:23.540
If you had a thousand people and you had like $1 million on the line,

1373
01:21:23.541 --> 01:21:26.590
I'm not sure what the minimal threshold is for you to,
to make it right.

1374
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:31.530
<v 2>Oh,
do a business case and say,
I can train this many of,
you know,
uh,
I think that,</v>

1375
01:21:31.670 --> 01:21:36.600
uh,
probably the guitar is the easiest because I wouldn't have guessed that.
Why?

1376
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:41.750
I think,
well,
for a couple reasons it's not,
it's probably not the easiest to,
uh,

1377
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:43.530
to play in terms of like,
I mean,
you know,

1378
01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:46.200
it's kind of hard to hold a chord and obviously with a piano you can just pump

1379
01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:48.060
the keys.
But,
um,

1380
01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:51.660
but the second you could get over the hump of learning three or four chords on

1381
01:21:51.661 --> 01:21:54.960
guitar,
uh,
you're off to the races,
right?
Because you can learn,

1382
01:21:54.961 --> 01:21:59.370
you can play so many pop songs,
uh,
with just three or four chords on guitar.

1383
01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:04.320
And,
uh,
so within a few weeks you can already start,
be playing,
uh,

1384
01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:09.240
you know,
simple songs.
And,
and then like twist and shout for example,

1385
01:22:09.241 --> 01:22:13.020
to go back to the Beatles is just three chords,
three easy chords.
Uh,

1386
01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:16.470
and so you can play,
twist and shout and you know,
in a week or two really well.

1387
01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:19.410
And then,
and then what you do is as you learn each new song,

1388
01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.420
pick a song with one extra cord in it,
right?
So,

1389
01:22:22.421 --> 01:22:24.750
so this next song has the same three chords as twist and shout,

1390
01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:27.990
but one minor chord in it.
And so now,
right,

1391
01:22:27.991 --> 01:22:31.170
so now you're learning that new song you're leveraging,
right?
75%.

1392
01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:33.890
You already know,
cause it's the other three chords,
uh,

1393
01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:37.940
and you're only picking up one new chord.
And so then as,
as you play,
you know,

1394
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:42.030
as you pick new songs,
just to add one new court each time,
uh,
on your repertoire,

1395
01:22:42.031 --> 01:22:46.630
girls of songs,
you know,
and the repertoire accords,
you know,
also grows.
Uh,

1396
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:47.610
and it makes right.

1397
01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:51.480
And so it's really easy to get into that groove where it's fun to play because

1398
01:22:51.481 --> 01:22:53.010
you're playing songs that everybody likes

1399
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:59.470
and it doesn't feel like work or,
or,
or rehearsal or practice is just,
you know,

1400
01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:03.560
each one.
I just have to practice one new cord,
uh,
and over time,
you know,

1401
01:23:03.561 --> 01:23:06.820
over the course of a year you'll learn a ton of a ton of songs.

1402
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.380
<v 1>Ned,
the,
uh,
as a couple of resources for,
uh,
for folks potentially.</v>

1403
01:23:11.381 --> 01:23:14.890
One is,
uh,
just googling axis of awesome,
uh,

1404
01:23:14.891 --> 01:23:16.450
who I think at or if you've seen this,
does it,

1405
01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:19.870
it does an amazing example of showing with three or four chords how you can play

1406
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:22.390
almost every pop song you've ever heard.
Yeah.

1407
01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:26.270
<v 2>But that chord progression,
it's called one,
five,
six,
four.
Uh,</v>

1408
01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:28.160
and uh,

1409
01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:31.460
<v 1>there you go.
People could just Google that.
So core progression one,
five,
six,</v>

1410
01:23:31.461 --> 01:23:32.294
four.

1411
01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.640
<v 2>Music theory notation,
it'd be one,
five,
six,
four,
and then,</v>

1412
01:23:34.670 --> 01:23:37.910
and they play like a hundred different songs.
Uh,
and it's really hilarious.

1413
01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.210
<v 1>Yeah.
They're,
they're amazing.
Uh,
are there any,</v>

1414
01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:46.300
for someone to add one quarter at a time without having to manually figure it

1415
01:23:47.331 --> 01:23:49.130
out themselves and kind of reinvent the wheel,

1416
01:23:49.131 --> 01:23:52.400
is there any particular approach that you would suggest in doing that?
Any,

1417
01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:55.100
any way that you would Google for that to figure it out?

1418
01:23:55.101 --> 01:23:58.970
Or a youtube approach or a teachers?
I mean,

1419
01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:04.570
<v 2>yeah,
there's a,
there's a,
I mean,
there's a extreme wealth of online of,
uh,</v>

1420
01:24:04.930 --> 01:24:08.800
you know,
online diagrams and youtube videos about how to do these things.
So,

1421
01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:09.820
you know,

1422
01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:12.280
<v 1>search for,
to whittle it down.
I think it's a paradox of choice,</v>

1423
01:24:12.281 --> 01:24:13.450
challenge for a lot of people.

1424
01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:19.540
<v 2>Yeah.
I,
uh,
I dunno really.
I guess it's not like for the basic chords,
it's,</v>

1425
01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:23.810
it's really like any,
anything we'll do,
uh,
you know,
for example,
uh,

1426
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:28.300
a d major chord is just,
you know,
it's three of your fingers,
your index,

1427
01:24:28.301 --> 01:24:30.340
middle and fourth finger,
uh,

1428
01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:32.730
and then you have to put them on the bottom three strings of the,

1429
01:24:32.731 --> 01:24:35.920
of the guitar on the Second Fret,
third Friday and second fret.

1430
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.870
And so you just have to,
you know,

1431
01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:42.850
it's just that it's not more complicated than that.
There's no like specific,
uh,

1432
01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.480
you know,
uh,
form that you have to do when you approach the guitar,
whatever.

1433
01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:49.420
You just got to slam your three fingers down on those three frets,

1434
01:24:49.421 --> 01:24:53.920
on those three strings and you'll play a d chord.
And so at that level,

1435
01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.700
uh,
you know,
you just need to know which fingers to put on which strings where,

1436
01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:02.650
and it's not,
you know,
it's not an intense sort of,
yeah.
You know,
form,

1437
01:25:02.651 --> 01:25:03.484
exercise or anything.

1438
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:07.820
<v 1>Cool.
All right,
last question for now.
In this installment,
uh,</v>

1439
01:25:07.821 --> 01:25:12.821
if you could give your 20 year old self advice at this point in retrospect,

1440
01:25:12.981 --> 01:25:14.660
what would it be?
And it doesn't have to be one thing.

1441
01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.400
<v 2>Oh Man.
Uh,</v>

1442
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:20.860
<v 1>or just 20 year olds in general could be you yourself,</v>

1443
01:25:20.861 --> 01:25:21.760
but it could be in general.

1444
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.550
<v 2>Sure.
I mean,
I guess it would go back to these.
Uh,
so I'd say certainly,</v>

1445
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.590
um,
when you're young,
do,
do the things,
do the entrepreneurial things,

1446
01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:35.640
because those are the things that will get you,
uh,
you'll,

1447
01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:38.760
you'll learn the most by far.
And so I did,
like I said,

1448
01:25:38.761 --> 01:25:40.990
I did two startups in my twenties,
and they were,
you know,

1449
01:25:40.991 --> 01:25:44.970
that neither one was a great hit.
Uh,
but,
um,

1450
01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:50.270
but the amount I learned in one year of doing a startup was like,
you know,

1451
01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:54.300
it was like seven years of working at a,
at a,
at a,
you know,
at a big company.

1452
01:25:54.690 --> 01:25:56.940
And so,
you know,
when you're young and you know,

1453
01:25:56.941 --> 01:26:00.600
you just finished college or whatever and you've got this,
uh,
you know,

1454
01:26:00.601 --> 01:26:05.570
you've got this freedom and you're not encumbered with,
uh,
you know,
uh,
you know,

1455
01:26:05.571 --> 01:26:09.350
with a spouse and kids that you have to,
that you have to pay for.
Uh,

1456
01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.180
and you can live on ramen noodles.
And all this stuff,

1457
01:26:11.181 --> 01:26:14.570
that's the time to go and take this entrepreneurial risk because you,

1458
01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:18.470
even if everything you do is a complete flop,
uh,
you know,

1459
01:26:18.471 --> 01:26:21.950
if you spend five years doing it,
you will have learned like 35 years worth of,

1460
01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:27.290
of,
you know,
career progression in life skills,
uh,
in those five years of,
of,

1461
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:29.600
of just risking and failing and risking and failing.

1462
01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:33.110
So even if it's a total flop,
they,
the person that you come out at the end of it,

1463
01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.510
uh,
as,
as is,
is far ahead of if you'd just gone and worked at a big company.

1464
01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.760
<v 1>So on that,
on that point,
I lied about the last question.</v>

1465
01:26:41.761 --> 01:26:46.761
This is more for people who are graduating now or considering a,

1466
01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:52.770
a shift,
a career change.
Uh,
I'm not sure if this is age dependent,

1467
01:26:52.771 --> 01:26:55.220
but let's just say for the sake of argument that they're,

1468
01:26:55.230 --> 01:26:59.610
they're single or they just have very low burn rate,
what would,

1469
01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:05.070
how would you suggest people choose their first Gig or their next gig?

1470
01:27:05.130 --> 01:27:06.780
I know it's a highly personal thing,
but let's,

1471
01:27:07.170 --> 01:27:11.100
let's just say people graduating college in the near future for the sake of

1472
01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:11.934
simplicity.

1473
01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:15.990
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,
it's just like figure out a market need,</v>

1474
01:27:15.991 --> 01:27:20.520
like anything that you have in your day to day world,
uh,
you know,

1475
01:27:20.521 --> 01:27:23.940
that that sucks.
Like what is,
you know,
is it hard to find parking or can you,

1476
01:27:23.941 --> 01:27:26.600
you know,
it was a movie theater,
dirty or whatever,
and,

1477
01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:30.600
and just try to solve that problem.
Uh,
and,
you know,
I,

1478
01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:35.550
I think that's a great way to get started.
And you know,
you'll learn a lot.

1479
01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:39.060
You'll do something,
uh,
you know,
you'll,
you'll,

1480
01:27:39.061 --> 01:27:41.370
you'll create a website where it shows you like,

1481
01:27:41.371 --> 01:27:44.070
which movie theaters are dirty and you'll realize,
wow,
I can't,
like,

1482
01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.110
there's no revenue from this website.
Like,
I can't,

1483
01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.050
I can't make any money telling people what movie theaters a dirty.

1484
01:27:49.170 --> 01:27:52.020
But then that's a learning by itself,
right?
And,
and,
you know,

1485
01:27:52.021 --> 01:27:55.770
and you come away from that and you're like,
okay,
I need to think about,
you know,

1486
01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:57.420
things with actual revenue opportunities.

1487
01:27:57.450 --> 01:28:01.080
And you'll do that iterative process and you'll,
you know,
you'll flop a bunch,

1488
01:28:01.081 --> 01:28:03.380
but that's fine.
Like that's the learning process and you know,

1489
01:28:03.381 --> 01:28:05.640
it's the school of hard knocks,
uh,

1490
01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:08.490
and you're going to learn a ton just doing that kind of stuff.

1491
01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:13.940
<v 1>Awesome.
Well,
nick,
I think,
uh,
this is,</v>

1492
01:28:13.941 --> 01:28:17.860
this is a great place to stop for now.
I'm sure we'll have,
uh,

1493
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:21.320
around two in person with some food and some wine,

1494
01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.510
but a lot of fun.

1495
01:28:23.690 --> 01:28:27.230
Where can people learn more about you or Zoc Doc?

1496
01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:30.560
Where would you like people to check?
Uh,
check what's step two out?

1497
01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:36.150
<v 2>Certainly.
Uh,

I,
I'm on the,
about us page of Zoc Doc,
so,</v>

1498
01:28:36.570 --> 01:28:40.650

more importantly,
if you know,
if,
if you need a doctor,

1499
01:28:40.651 --> 01:28:45.430
it really is the best place to find a doctor.
So zoc doc z o c d o C.

1502
01:28:54.210 --> 01:28:58.830
I've got a linkedin page you can find me on linkedin page I suppose,

1503
01:28:59.010 --> 01:29:02.280
but you know,

so go there.

1506
01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:16.750
next time we,
uh,
get together balls of fury style.

1507
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:20.490
awesome man.
Well thanks very much and I will talk to you soon.

1530
01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:46.470
Ex-Officio boy,
where do I begin?
I have a long history with ex-officio.

1531
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:51.870
Ex-Officio makes clothing and as far back as 2007 2008 I had a hit video that

1532
01:30:54.071 --> 01:30:57.010
went viral called how to travel the world with 10 pounds or less,

1533
01:30:57.011 --> 01:31:01.720
and I talked about ex-officio underwear.
Ex-Officio underwear is lightweight,

1534
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:05.920
ultra lightweight,
quick drying,
an antimicrobial.
Why is this important?
Well,

1535
01:31:05.921 --> 01:31:08.800
I've gone through 20 plus countries with two pairs of underwear before,

1536
01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:13.000
both from ex-officio,
and I'm not alone in this.
This might sound crazy,

1537
01:31:13.001 --> 01:31:16.240
but a lot of executives,
for instance,
we'll take this underwear,

1538
01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:19.600
they'll wash it in the sink or somewhere else,
roll it up in a towel,

1539
01:31:19.601 --> 01:31:24.160
like a Burrito step on it,
and a few hours later they are completely dry,

1540
01:31:24.161 --> 01:31:27.190
completely clean.
You don't have to just have to,
and yes,

1541
01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:29.260
they have to be comfortable for all day wear,

1542
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:32.200
but check out their clothing as well as their underwear.

1543

but this underwear,

1546
01:31:44.681 --> 01:31:48.340
this clothing is not just for the gents ladies.
You have choices too,

1547
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:53.440
and they really have an incredible collection of high quality products that I've

used for almost 10 years now.
