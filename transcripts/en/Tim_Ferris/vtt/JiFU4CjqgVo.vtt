00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.500
[inaudible]

2
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.520
<v 1>should you write a book?
Should someone or anyone write a book?</v>

3
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.210
I get asked questions about launching books all the time.

4
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.730
How can I make my book a bestseller?
Have you written a book?
No.

5
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:28.010
I'm going to write a book.
Have you written any books before?
No.

6
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.331
Why are you writing book?

7
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:34.331
And we get into this conversation and ultimately I ask one question and that is

8
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.820
for the period of a year,

9
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.740
can you make this your number one priority for period of at least a year?

10
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.970
Can this be your number one?

11
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.580
If you have a company that means your business is number two.

12
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.100
If you have a family that means your family is number two.

13
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.290
Can this be your number one priority for a year?

14
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.740
That's the general litmus test because if you put out a mediocre book or even a

15
00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:01.610
good book,
a good enough book,
which by the way equals Shitty,
um,

16
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.200
as Brian Grazer,

17
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:08.201
legendary film and TV producer would say it's more of a liability than a help.

18
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.920
Okay?
So a mediocre book is more of a liability than no book at all.

19
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.440
You can't take it back.
So as Michael Gerber told me,

20
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:19.970
who wrote the e myth revisited,

21
00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:23.600
which is a book that had a huge impact on me before I launched the four hour

22
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:27.440
work week.
He said,
if you're going to write a book,
write a fucking book,

23
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.060
meaning like you are all in,
all of your chips are into this book.

24
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.710
So how did I know that I should do the four hour work week?
Right?

25
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.450
Was it that obvious?
Was it cleared?
It was like dying to be a writer,

26
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.930
which by the way,
I don't think is unnecessary checkbox.

27
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.490
You don't have to write the book yourself necessarily open by Andre Agassi.

28
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.080
By the way,
all Gussie under Agassi was ghostwritten,

29
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.370
but it was a collaboration that took a long time and a lot of Andre's time

30
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.620
beautifully written,
but nonetheless required a lot of focus from him.
Uh,

31
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.560
so you can have a collaborator.
But my,
I suppose,

32
00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:11.561
hurdle was it was easier for me to get out of my head than it was for me to live

33
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.860
with it in my head.
All right.

34
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.660
It was less painful to put it down than to have it ricocheting inside my head.

35
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.350
And I had all these experiences from 2004 to say end of 2005 where I was

36
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:31.250
restructuring and reformulating my entire business to run without me traveling

37
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:35.300
the world for 18 months without any set schedule meeting all of these case

38
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:36.134
studies.

39
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.850
And I was teaching a class at Princeton twice a year,

40
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.990
sometimes in person,

41
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:45.890
sometimes remotely in high tech entrepreneurship where I was sharing my findings

42
00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:48.890
about scaling a bootstrapped business.

43
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.920
And that slowly morphed into lifestyle design,

44
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:56.921
how to create a business or career to allow you to take advantage of the most

45
00:02:57.531 --> 00:02:59.440
valuable nonrenewable resource,
which is time.

46
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.440
Some already giving these two to three hour classes and I would take notes and

47
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.570
uh,
over time,
because one of the students said,

48
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:09.880
why don't you just write a book and be done with it as opposed to teaching a

49
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.110
class of 40 students,

50
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.430
which was actually a snarky Princeton student response.

51
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:20.050
It wasn't a real suggestion,
I don't think.
Nonetheless,
I had insomnia for many,

52
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:21.190
many,
many,
many years,

53
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.250
and I couldn't get to sleep because these chapter ideas would come.

54
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.580
These stories would come to mind and I just couldn't get to sleep without

55
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.130
jotting down a little note on a piece of paper.

56
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.730
And I ended up with a huge pile of paper on lessons learned and so on.

57
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.410
And I knew that at least two of my friends,

58
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.420
and there were two specific friends in mind,

59
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.450
one who is trapped in a decent paying job where he had no time disliked what he

60
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:52.510
was doing,
but he could,
he could finally afford that Nice car,
right?

61
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.460
So he felt like he was trapped.

62
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.930
And then I had a friend who had started his own company,
who similarly,

63
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.710
it's making decent money but felt trapped and a monster of his own making.

64
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.550
And I felt these notes would help them.
Okay.

65
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.950
Did Not want to write a book at that point,

66
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.520
actively did not want to write a book.
All right.

67
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.550
But I felt a moral obligation to share this material somehow.

68
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:22.831
And a few of my friends who were authors recommended that I explore the path to

69
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:26.860
publishing it and I made a few assumptions going into it because keep in mind I

70
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:27.820
did not want to write a book.

71
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.270
I assumed it was going to be extremely difficult and brutal to write the book,

72
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.470
which was,
I mean we're talking repeated moments of doubt.

73
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:36.700
I should throw in the towel.

74
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.050
I am going to have a nervous breakdown repeatedly.
Okay.

75
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:44.230
That is more or less been the case for every book that I've written them at five

76
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:45.120
now.
Okay.

77
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.640
The second assumption was that I was going to probably hate the book itself,

78
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.480
which I did.
Okay,
and that has been largely true for every book.
I've done.

79
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.360
Assume that up until a year after the book comes out,

80
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.600
you're going to look at it and be disappointed with what you've produced.

81
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:02.440
Given that,

82
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.500
the third assumption was that I would write the book and if it even changed the

83
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:13.870
life of one or two people that would justify all the pain,

84
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.320
all the self-loathing,
all the loading of the book,

85
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.700
all of the opportunity costs of putting it together right.

86
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.160
And that last but not least,
it was easier for me,

87
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.370
less painful for me to get it out and throw a hail Mary and hope for the best

88
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.000
then to keep it inside of me and wonder what if.
Okay.

89
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.890
So a lot of different check boxes and the book keep mind four hour workweek was

90
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.300
rejected by 27 publishers.
And uh,

91
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.420
then when it was finally printed,

92
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.090
first print run was about 10,000 copies.

93
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:51.010
You don't even get national distribution with that.

94
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.050
Nobody really expected a whole lot.

95
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.350
And then with the same amount of focus that I put into the writing put into

96
00:05:57.351 --> 00:05:58.184
launch,

97
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.680
ended up hitting the New York Times bestseller list and now it's millions of

98
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:02.240
copies in 40 plus languages.
Okay.

99
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:07.241
But I don't think you get to millions of copies and 40 plus languages trying to

100
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:10.220
write a book for the world that is going to help your business.

101
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.500
I just don't think it happens.
I've never seen it happen.
And instead

102
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.030
check all the boxes that I mentioned and I wrote this book for two friends very

103
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:27.170
specifically.
And by personalizing it in that way,
by talking to them in a,

104
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.120
in a very conversational way,
uh,
we ended up with the results that we had,

105
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.040
could have very easily gone a different direction.
But,
uh,

106
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.260
if you can listen to everything I've just said and you think to yourself,

107
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.210
I should write a book,
then by all means go for it.
But for most people,

108
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.470
this doesn't mean I am a great writer,
therefore you need to be a great writer.

109
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:48.681
No,

110
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:52.790
I'm just saying it was less painful for me to put it out than to keep it in my

111
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:54.410
head.
Hey guys,

112
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.220
if you're enjoying the tips and tactics and how to on this channel or it in the

113
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:02.510
podcast,
the Tim Ferriss show,
I made this for you,
tribe of mentors,

114
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.860
short advice from the best in the world.
This is the book that I wanted to read.

115
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:08.360
So I went out and I put it together,

116
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.550
created a dream list of 130 of the best at what they do.

117
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:17.360
People who are icons,
legends,
and ask them all the same questions.

118
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:21.470
These are people in some cases I want it to reach out to my whole life ranges

119
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:25.820
from many,
many billionaires,
cofounders of every company imaginable,

120
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.170
elite athletes ranging from surfing to tennis to powerlifting,
everything else,

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.320
country stars,
actors,
directors,
and you can spot the patterns.

122
00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:38.270
So some of my friends have said this is the easiest to read,

123
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.240
most useful book that I've put together yet.
