Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:05.970
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.980
I'm a cybernetic organism.

6
00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:39.550
have used 99 designs for years including to get cover concepts for the four hour

24
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.140
Ex-Officio boy,
where do I begin?
I have a long history with ex-officio.

25
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.410
Ex-Officio makes clothing and as far back as 2007 2008 I had a hit video that

26
00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:51.550
went viral called how to travel the world with 10 pounds or less.

27
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:56.290
And I talked about ex-officio underwear.
Ex-Officio underwear is lightweight,

28
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.430
ultra lightweight,
quick drying and antimicrobial.
Why is this important?
Well,

29
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:03.340
I've gone through 20 plus countries with two pairs of underwear before,

30
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.540
both from ex-officio,
and I'm not alone in this.
This might sound crazy,

31
00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:10.780
but a lot of executives,
for instance,
we'll take this underwear,

32
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.140
they'll wash it in the sink or somewhere else,
roll it up in a towel,

33
00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:18.670
like a Burrito step on it,
and a few hours later they are completely dry,

34
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:21.790
completely clean.
You don't have to just have to and yes,

35
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:23.800
they have to be comfortable for all day wear,

36
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.740
but check out their clothing as well as their underwear.

37

but this underwear,

41
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:41.950
this clothing is not just for the gents ladies.

42
00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:46.870
You have choices too and they really have an incredible collection of high

quality products that I've used for almost 10 years now.
So check them out.

walk a walk,

45
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.250
a walk up,
boys and girls.
This is Tim Ferriss.

46
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.130
<v 2>Welcome to the Tim Ferriss show.
For those of you new to the program.</v>

47
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.810
This is the forum through which I try to dissect excellence to find the tools

48
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:10.300
and tactics or approaches that you can use.

49
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.720
And that ranges from billionaire investors to chess prodigies to mega platinum

50
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:21.240
musicians too.
In this episode's case,
comedian,
uh,

51
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.660
a Comedienne,
e n n e,
a n or standup comic,

52
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:29.050
depending on the terminology that you for Margaret Show,

53
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:34.051
she has an illustrious career and is a prodigious talent and she is also a

54
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:40.030
polymath.
She's not only a very celebrated standup comic,

55
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:42.880
but she's been a fashion designer,
a singer songwriter.

56
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.130
She's been in feature films of course,

57
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.720
and the TV series including sex and the city and 30 rock.

58
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.590
She's been on dancing with the stars and we don't have time to go through all of

59
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:54.424
her accolades.

60
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.640
But this particular conversation digs into her inspirations,

61
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.230
tricks of the trade,
uh,

62
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.980
different practices that you can borrow a sexuality,

63
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.180
including bisexuality and her topics of choice,

64
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.430
her different challenges,
addiction.

65
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.310
And we also delve deep into the slow carb diet.

66
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:20.050
So I hope you can indulge me on that particular segment of the program.

67
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.050
But it goes into some nitty gritty details because Margaret had a bunch of

68
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:27.010
questions.
She's followed it and is a fan of the protocol,

69
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.200
so perhaps it will help some of you out there and as always you can find the

70
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:33.560
show notes at four hour work,

71

week.com forward slash podcast for links and further resources.

72
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.800
It's a four hour workweek.com forward slash podcast and we're using a new audio

73
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:44.290
equipment in this introduction.
So let me know what you think.

74
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.410
Be Very curious to hear your thoughts.
Without further ado,

75
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.360
please meet Margaret Cho.

76
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.970
<v 1>Hello Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

77
00:04:52.971 --> 00:04:56.780
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

78
00:04:56.781 --> 00:05:01.781
I'm very excited for this episode because I have someone that I've admired for a

79
00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:02.660
very long time,

80
00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:07.520
been a fan of for a very long time joining us today and that is Margaret show

81
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.450
are good.
How are you?

82
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.340
<v 3>I'm doing great.
Thank you very much.
That's wonderful.</v>

83
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.520
<v 1>Of course I was,</v>

84
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:17.990
I was having one of my many nights of insomnia,
which I've,

85
00:05:17.991 --> 00:05:22.991
I've dealt with an improved on and that was a sort of scanning through Twitter.

86
00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:28.631
And I came across your profile because I'm a huge comedy fan and I saw also

87
00:05:28.821 --> 00:05:32.330
follows you and my eyes just about popped out of my head.
I was,
uh,

88
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.010
I was so taken aback and reached out and we connected and uh,

89
00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:38.570
and here we are and here we are.

90
00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:41.630
But where we're are we finding you at the moment?
I know you travel a lot.

91
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.010
<v 3>Um,
today I am in West Palm Beach,
Florida.
There is something,</v>

92
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.960
I'm a big storm outside,
so that's thunder.

93
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.450
But I'm,
I'm,
I'm always on the road.
So,
uh,
that,
that's,

94
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:56.530
I'm doing the show here today.

95
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.170
<v 1>Very cool.
And</v>

96
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.250
<v 3>um,
I know we have some precious time with you before you take off.</v>

97
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.510
It is hard for me to know even where to begin because you've done so many

98
00:06:06.511 --> 00:06:10.230
different things and it seems like lived so many different lives.

99
00:06:10.231 --> 00:06:13.140
You've had television,
books,
film,

100
00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:18.141
obviously the stand up when you meet someone who's unfamiliar with your work

101
00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:22.230
doesn't recognize you.
If they ask you,
what do you do,

102
00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:23.730
how do you even respond to that?

103
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.850
I think I identify mostly as a standup comedian.

104
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.230
And a thank you for your kind words.
I,

105
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.290
I was excited to connect with you too as I'm a big fan and I think,

106
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.720
but comedy is really,
um,
what I would say I do.

107
00:06:42.721 --> 00:06:47.640
I think probably you're the same in that you are quite a multihyphenate in the

108
00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:50.940
different things you write about and the different things you talk about.

109
00:06:50.941 --> 00:06:53.710
And so how would you define yourself?
Suicide.

110
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.460
Would it just be author or would it be

111
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.050
for body expert or we're thinking expert Moby Heisman.

112
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.920
It's are,
are kind of tricky.
Says,
you know,
so as you are an author,

113
00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:12.210
I guess I am a standup comedian,
you know,
that's the basic places to start from.

114
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.200
But there's so much more.

115
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.680
<v 1>No,
for sure.
It's something that I've,</v>

116
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.310
I've had trouble with for a very long time.
Uh,
it,

117
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:23.300
depending on who I'm talking to and how badly I want to kill the conversation.

118
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:26.780
If I think they're just being polite and trying to get through the three or four

119
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.060
cocktail questions so they can glance over my shoulder and move on.

120
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.250
I'll say something like,
you know,
professional dilettantes it comes to mind.

121
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.610
A drug dealer was one I used to use.
Um,
and um,

122
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.070
it turns out it's a great way to get people out of your house at a dinner party

123
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:45.610
if you will ask them if they want to do heroin or,
you know,
there,

124
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:46.660
there are a lot of sorts of tricks,

125
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.170
tricks of the trade depending on where you are.
Great at.
That's a great idea.

126
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.960
Now the,
uh,
the,
the,
the standup comedy side of things,

127
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.460
uh,
I,
I've,
I've had the good fortune of,
uh,

128
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.120
occasionally having the chance to chat with people when I've gone to live shows,

129
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:09.740
for instance.
And I'm always interested to know,
and if,

130
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.870
if you've been asked this question a thousand times,

131
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:13.730
feel free to answer a different question,

132
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:17.840
but what compels you to do comedy?

133
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:22.100
And is it the same now as it was in the beginning?

134
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.160
<v 3>It's exactly the same.</v>

135
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.220
The what compels me is I need to be heard and I need to make people laugh and

136
00:08:35.021 --> 00:08:39.400
then need to express what I think,

137
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:44.790
things that need to be said and also to do.
Just have a good time,
you know?
And,

138
00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:48.660
and I've had that impulse.
I think since I was about eight years old,
I,

139
00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:52.210
I've always wanted to be a comedian and,
um,
you know,
it,

140
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:57.210
it's the impulse to do with that.
The intention,
everything is the same.

141
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:59.730
It's nothing that's all altered.
And I think this is this,

142
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.270
this is probably the same for most comedians out there.
Um,

143
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.310
there are quite a lot of people who do develop a kind of aversion to it.

144
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.360
After doing it for say,
30 40 years,
they really feel like they need to retire.

145
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:16.230
But I more on the side of,
I think I need to do it more.

146
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:17.580
Actually as I get older,

147
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:22.581
so I'm fortunate in that it just sustains me is that it's the way that I make a

148
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:26.460
living,
but it's also my social life and,

149
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.090
and a great pastime and a great,
great,
great thing to do.

150
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.273
<v 1>The,
um,</v>

151
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:38.250
the aspect of my career that a lot of people ask about his writing and I've,

152
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.580
I've noticed her different breeds of writers.
Uh,
this is,

153
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:45.160
this is going to come back to the standup question.

154
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:50.200
What a lot of writers and I would say myself included,
have a com,

155
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.123
have a,

156
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:56.440
a need almost a therapeutic need to write at points no matter how hard the

157
00:09:56.441 --> 00:10:00.220
process is,
uh,
almost as a way of,

158
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.610
of self medicating and,

159
00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:05.410
and getting neuroses out of their heads.

160
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.910
And then I'm not projecting here,
but this is,
this is for me there.

161
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.450
There are many times when I will,
I will write in the morning and,
uh,

162
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.240
the material I know is pure garbage.

163
00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:19.350
It's just completely self indulgent morning pages,
but it's,

164
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.380
it's my equivalent of taking my psyche and sort of whacking the rug to get the

165
00:10:25.211 --> 00:10:29.230
dust out of it before I move on to my day.
So that I don't have all of the group,

166
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.680
the Gremlins in my head.
And I'm curious if,
uh,

167
00:10:32.681 --> 00:10:37.030
at least in the standup world or the comedy world,
uh,
it seems,

168
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:43.660
it seems that that people have different drives and different things that keep

169
00:10:43.661 --> 00:10:44.111
them going.

170
00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:47.530
And I'd be curious to know if you could comment on what it is for you.

171
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.610
<v 3>Well,
I think that I had the equivalent of a morning pages sort of thing,</v>

172
00:10:52.611 --> 00:10:56.960
cause I work almost every day.
I mean,
I perform a lust every day.
They're there.

173
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.980
There's different things that I do.
But,
uh,
as a standup comic,

174
00:11:00.981 --> 00:11:05.030
it is really a daily effort.
And so,
you know,

175
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.410
you kind of bone off all of those kind of like ideas that are like late,
late,

176
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.220
late floating on the top,
and then you can get to the real meat of it.
Um,

177
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.710
so I guess I have that kind of a meditation too.

178
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.370
I wish that I had more of that as a writer,
you know,

179
00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:23.510
as an author for me either that's something that I would like to pursue more,

180
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.630
but,
um,
I still don't have the intense need for it that I do.

181
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:28.910
As a standup comedian.

182
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:35.030
<v 1>When did you do your first professional stand up and when did you decide that</v>

183
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:39.930
you were going to,
uh,
do it professionally?

184
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.671
<v 3>Oh,</v>

185
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:46.200
I decided that I was going to do it professionally when I understood that I was

186
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:50.270
going to become an adult and that one at some point,
you know,

187
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.980
that this would be my job.
And,
and,
and then my,

188
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.690
as soon as I understood what the job of standup comedy was,
then I,

189
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.930
I became very committed to doing it.
And that's it.

190
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.740
I think an unusual thing maybe for somebody to choose the profession at eight

191
00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:09.400
years old.
But I,
I knew that it was actually more than a profession.

192
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:14.380
It was really,
um,
uh,
kind of a calling.
And then I really started early.

193
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:17.770
I started during professional performances at 14.

194
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.110
I was touring by 15.

195
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:23.320
I was making pretty great living by 18.

196
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:27.940
And then I was on television by 20,
so it was a,

197
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:29.050
it was a very,

198
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:33.970
very important thing for me and it was really destiny.

199
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.680
<v 1>Who were some of those early inspirations and role models for you that,</v>

200
00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:45.870
uh,
that you look to as models if it's,

201
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.790
if that were the case at all and in the very early days,

202
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.310
<v 3>the main model,
um,
for,
uh,</v>

203
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:58.730
my early years and then of course pretty much until now was Joan Rivers and

204
00:13:01.261 --> 00:13:05.210
that,
that's been a very difficult,
you know,

205
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.330
right now I'm,

206
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.250
a lot of comedians are feeling the loss of both her and Robin Williams.

207
00:13:11.251 --> 00:13:13.150
And then it's,
it's a really,

208
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.820
it's a terrible time in comedy because it's like we lost our,
the king and Queen,

209
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
you know,
and now it's like,
who is the heir apparent?

210
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:26.010
But mostly it's this sorrow and mourning,
so it's,
it's pretty terrible.

211
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.520
<v 1>What made,
what made you special?</v>

212
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.740
Obviously she had just an incredible career in longevity and endurance.
I mean,

213
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:37.510
my God,
but uh,
what,

214
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:42.511
what was it that of all of the people out there really appealed to you about her

215
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.530
when you were getting started?

216
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:50.690
<v 3>I think that she was so on afraid she was so just her fearlessness and she was a</v>

217
00:13:51.511 --> 00:13:56.010
woman and she was,
um,
just so mighty,

218
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.760
um,
you know,
as alive comic,
you know,

219
00:13:59.761 --> 00:14:04.320
like the stuff that she would do in clubs and at night,
like not,

220
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.160
you know,
not including like the,
any lows red carpet stuff and the Oscar stuff.

221
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.740
She was so filthy.
I mean,

222
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:14.820
she was so I need to the very end,
you know,

223
00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:19.500
just the most Raunchy comedian you could even imagine.

224
00:14:19.501 --> 00:14:23.250
And she would shock us,
you know,
the most unshockable people.

225
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.540
He was a incredible,
and,
and also the,
the,

226
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.240
the reason why she and I were close as that,

227
00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:33.870
she really taught me a lot about gratitude.
You know,

228
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:39.050
she had intense and immense gratitude for everything in our life and wanted me

229
00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:44.511
and all these other comedians that she would foster in a way that she wanted to

230
00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:48.900
instill that in us,
that,
that this was a really magical thing,

231
00:14:48.901 --> 00:14:52.590
this gift that we were given and that we should really grateful for it.
And,

232
00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:56.690
and that's the most valuable lesson I've ever learned from anyone.

233
00:14:56.691 --> 00:15:00.950
So she was really,
um,
combination parent,

234
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:03.830
like a mother and whatever.
Like Mister Miyagi,

235
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:08.430
like Pat Marina from karate kid.
Like she,
she was a really,
um,

236
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.840
she was a great mentor and a great woman.

237
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.600
Uh,
I should,
I mean,

238
00:15:28.601 --> 00:15:33.601
it would be really great to have that as a practice to make a gratitude list or

239
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.650
something like that.
But mostly it's just an attitude every day and like,

240
00:15:38.651 --> 00:15:42.910
I'm really happy in what I do.
I really love what I do.
Um,

241
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.380
it's,

242
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.380
it's a really great feeling to do what you love and,

243
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.670
uh,
you know,
for me it's about making money of course,

244
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:59.170
but that I would still do standup comedy without making anything.

245
00:15:59.171 --> 00:16:02.680
I put just as much effort into every show,

246
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.210
no matter how much they're making or whatever it is.

247
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.400
It's something that I always wanted an eye.

248
00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:12.970
I'm so happy that I get to do it and I think that,
um,
it's just wonderful.

249
00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:15.400
So I don't actually have a practice,

250
00:16:15.401 --> 00:16:17.970
but that might be something nice to implement later

251
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.530
<v 1>if we're looking at your schedule or your rituals.</v>

252
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.310
Actually,
before we even get to that,
you mentioned fearlessness.

253
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:34.300
I can imagine that would complete panic into my heart.

254
00:16:34.731 --> 00:16:38.600
More than getting up on stage doing stand up where you really have to,

255
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.520
you really are not going to be given any mercy.
Laughs by most people.

256
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.330
I mean you have to stand on your own merit.
What,

257
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.000
what are some of the,
when of you,

258
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:54.740
what are some instances where you have been most afraid on stage?

259
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:06.310
<v 3>And then I had to figure out how to do shows without having</v>

260
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.170
software and my computer.

261
00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.220
And then I also brought people on stage who would

262
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.880
or I would actually ask them out and they would read them.

263
00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.610
<v 1>Um,
so that was helpful.</v>

264
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.410
<v 3>Well,</v>

265
00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:30.410
but it was really terrifying to not have the capacity to deal with the Heckler,

266
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.790
which I'm very good at.
It's one of my speciality is

267
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.870
the,
this like,
you know,
kind of the immediacy of life performance.
You know,

268
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.660
I took away my spontaneity.
It took away,
um,

269
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:50.150
just a lot of the,
uh,
kind of freshness and the,
the,

270
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.870
the unpredictability of what life was forming some standup comedy is,

271
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:59.460
which to me is the greatest part of it.
So that was really terrible.

272
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.520
Um,
and then I've,
you know,
that dad show,
I mean,
I,

273
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.670
I probably have,
uh,

274
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.990
the worst shows that anybody in my category,
you know,
and in,

275
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.300
in the level that I am as a comedian because I'm so committed to taking risks as

276
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:18.090
a performer,
I can really do terribly.

277
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.300
And sometimes that can be really scary if you're a say in different countries

278
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:29.590
like in England or Scotland where it is,

279
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
there's a high angle you don't do well in comedy and you know that that the iPad

280
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.900
really bad fights and you know,

281
00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:44.280
a couple of instances where I was really scared for a physical harm

282
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.380
<v 1>because I really,</v>

283
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:51.130
<v 3>um,
I give it to people and really let them have it if I'm backed into a corner.</v>

284
00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:55.330
And so,
um,
it's a,
it can be,
it can be really nuts.

285
00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.920
People can get really angry.

286
00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.410
<v 1>When you said,
and I'm just paraphrasing here,</v>

287
00:19:00.411 --> 00:19:04.610
but I'd love for you to expand a bit on what you,

288
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.500
what you just mentioned related to sort of having the potential to do worst in

289
00:19:09.501 --> 00:19:14.360
your category or class of,
of comic.
Why do you have sort of higher,

290
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.520
um,
crash and burn potential?
Um,
or what's,
what's the,

291
00:19:19.521 --> 00:19:22.360
uh,
why do you have the added risk factor?
Yes.

292
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.820
<v 3>I think because I will come off as anything scripted and I will go with the flow</v>

293
00:19:28.311 --> 00:19:29.430
and then I will,
um,

294
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.160
really engage with an audience in a very personal level.

295
00:19:34.161 --> 00:19:38.570
Like I'm not the kind of artists that can go on autopilot,

296
00:19:38.571 --> 00:19:42.620
which actually happens much more than people realize,
right?
Like I don't have,

297
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.510
I don't really have that ability.

298
00:19:44.511 --> 00:19:49.370
So I build it from the ground up and build it from scratch every time from the

299
00:19:49.371 --> 00:19:51.800
beginning.
And so that in itself,

300
00:19:51.801 --> 00:19:56.801
it's a huge risk when you're not necessarily relying on the tried and true and

301
00:19:57.381 --> 00:19:58.220
things that,
you know,

302
00:19:58.221 --> 00:20:03.221
work and you're going into everything when it popular Rasa that you really are,

303
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.840
you plugging into something designed.
But that divinity it's not,
oh,

304
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.170
well is we're human,
right?

305
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.350
<v 1>So it can be,</v>

306
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.080
<v 3>does very scary.
Um,</v>

307
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.420
and I think that that's the energy that I thrive off of.
That's what I love,

308
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:24.890
but that's innately is,
is kind of a risky behavior.

309
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.340
<v 1>Sure.
Right.
Yeah.</v>

310
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:31.290
You can be knocking for the Muse and they might not be open for business.
Uh,

311
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.460
uh,
talking about hecklers.
So this,
this,

312
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:37.440
I would love to dig into a little bit.

313
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.660
What are your favorite ways of dealing with hecklers?
I mean,

314
00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:47.040
is there a,
uh,
sort of,
uh,
uh,
you know,
Margaret Cho?

315
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.070
Do you have any,
any particular responses?
If you're just like,
you know what,

316
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.630
I don't want to deal with this guy right now.

317
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.610
I need to cut them off at the knees.

318
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.990
What are some of the fastest ways of dealing with,
with hecklers?
And you know,

319
00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:00.760
maybe there are different types of hecklers.
I'm sure there are,

320
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:03.190
but I'd love to hear a little bit about that.

321
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.710
<v 3>Well,
there's different types,</v>

322
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.930
but the best thing to do is to really just out now engage somebody and really

323
00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:13.710
try to find out what they're trying to say.
And,

324
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:18.930
and so there's no like plant nurses set lines or the do scripted idea of what to

325
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:21.850
say to shut them down.

326
00:21:21.851 --> 00:21:26.851
It's really going deeper and finding out why this person with choosing to

327
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:33.060
disrupt a conformance that everybody has paid for and that everybody is there

328
00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:37.270
and agreed to sit four.
Why does somebody want to rebel against that?
And,

329
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.210
and so I,
I,
you know,

330
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.480
I'm curious about it and I'll usually give them quite a lot of time.

331
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:45.240
Like if I have,
uh,
there's,

332
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:49.380
cause there's a potential to create a whole show around them.

333
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.180
<v 1>And this is something I learned from,
Oh,
it's great.</v>

334
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:58.300
<v 3>I'm Paula Poundstone who's an absolute genius at that.
I mean,</v>

335
00:21:58.301 --> 00:22:02.620
she will,
uh,
he'll do a show and if somebody gets up to go to the bathroom,

336
00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:04.050
she'll go to their chair,

337
00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.320
she'll go to their care and she'll take your jacket and put it on and go through

338
00:22:08.321 --> 00:22:11.410
their pocket.
And really just,
I mean,

339
00:22:11.411 --> 00:22:16.030
she is so fearless when it comes to talking to an audience.

340
00:22:16.031 --> 00:22:17.890
And so I learned that from her.
I mean,

341
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.020
doesn't have to detract from your performance.

342
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:25.050
It can really be an incredible journey that will only be taken one time.

343
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.140
And,
um,
you know,
it's not to encourage actually it shows,

344
00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:32.800
but sometimes it's really inevitable.
So my,

345
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.150
my goal is to just try to take that road as it presents itself.

346
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.500
If it doesn't work,
if that,

347
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.440
usually the only reason it doesn't work as if the person is too drunk,

348
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.300
you can help this happen kicked out.

349
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.620
<v 1>Right.
So that's a whole nother thing.
No,
it's there.
It's there,</v>

350
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:50.120
not excessively drunk.
Uh,

351
00:22:50.121 --> 00:22:55.121
what type of question might you ask them or questions if there's like,

352
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.980
oh,
boom,
you know,
and you can tell they're not totally drunk,

353
00:22:57.981 --> 00:22:59.870
they're just being an idiot.
What,
what type of,

354
00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.420
what type of question might you ask them or what might you say to them?

355
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.620
<v 3>Well,
ask,
um,
you know,
why they're yelling out or what the,</v>

356
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.500
what the purpose is of what they need,
you know,

357
00:23:10.501 --> 00:23:12.240
and then I can ask them about who they are.

358
00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:17.180
I can ask the person there with about why they're saying that.
Like,

359
00:23:17.181 --> 00:23:20.570
why are they like that?
Or they like this all the time and he's a special day.

360
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.960
And then I'll get an explanation from the partner or whatever

361
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.460
you got.
And then you can also talk to other people around them,

362
00:23:28.461 --> 00:23:31.760
like people that are seated next to them.
Like what was it like before the show,

363
00:23:31.761 --> 00:23:35.000
but what were they saying and what,
you know,
like what led us to this.

364
00:23:35.001 --> 00:23:38.120
And then somebody from another part of the room will complain about it and then

365
00:23:38.121 --> 00:23:40.790
you go over there and do the same thing.
But it can be very,

366
00:23:40.791 --> 00:23:44.640
very interesting if you just utilize what they're saying and you,

367
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.700
you it into what you're doing.

368
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:51.320
And then if you have an encyclopedic knowledge of your jokes and therefore,

369
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.350
you know,
you can call on anything that you might have that would be,

370
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.430
would be relevant.
But I love that immediacy.

371
00:23:58.431 --> 00:24:03.110
I think it is really what is great about standup comedy is that there's that

372
00:24:03.111 --> 00:24:04.490
potential to do anything.

373
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.210
<v 1>Oh,
sure.
Yeah.
No,
absolutely.
I mean that's,</v>

374
00:24:07.211 --> 00:24:12.180
that's part of part of why I enjoy going to live shows.
It's just,
yeah,

375
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.800
I really don't know how the movie's going to end.
I mean,
you don't,

376
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.960
you have no idea of how things are going to develop.
Uh,

377
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.600
let's see here.
Are there any particular,
I'm just trying to think here.

378
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.470
Uh,
none stand up influences.

379
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:31.850
So people who are not standup comics who has affected,
and those,

380
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.160
this could be movies,
books,
anything where people,

381
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:38.480
but outside of the realm of comedy who have impacted how you perform,

382
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:40.580
how you present,
how you develop your material.

383
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.440
<v 3>Oh,
I think Madonna is great.
I love Chrissy Hind.</v>

384
00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:49.940
I love a lot of like female rock singers.
Like they,
I am a musician also,

385
00:24:49.941 --> 00:24:54.920
so we get a lot of inspirations and Bjork and um,
you know,

386
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:59.180
like just music is always really inspiring and,

387
00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:03.950
and you know,
just like the performance style of somebody like Janis Joplin,

388
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:08.240
I would love to capture as a comedian that would be my ideal if I could eat

389
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:11.150
comedian that that is the,
what is Janis Joplin at the thing?
Right.

390
00:25:11.151 --> 00:25:16.040
That would be great.
So singers are incredibly influential.
And,

391
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:20.440
um,
I think it's because a long,
long,
long time ago I,

392
00:25:20.441 --> 00:25:24.990
I happened upon a pet psychic who,
um,
there was it,

393
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.930
I had a dog who I love very much and you know,
she,
she,

394
00:25:28.931 --> 00:25:32.940
it was like this television show about psychic.
So I was doing it.
I,
uh,

395
00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.390
I was talking to her and she said that my daughter thought that I was a singer

396
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.980
because dogs don't understand what standup comedy is.

397
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.610
<v 1>So I thought that was the sweetest.
Okay.</v>

398
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.940
What idea?
He thought I was thinking this,
you know,
it's for him.
It is,

399
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.720
you know,
that's,
uh,
that's really what type of dog

400
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.970
<v 3>he was dead.
He died,
but he was a big shepherd mix,
like a big,</v>

401
00:25:57.971 --> 00:26:02.290
like fluffy guy that you would get at the pound.
It kind of every dog at one.

402
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.280
But he was at that,

403
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.990
<v 1>I,
uh,
it,
it makes me think of very,
very early on for me,
uh,</v>

404
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.970
when my first book had just come out in 2007,
I was,
uh,

405
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.170
headed to south by southwest for the first time to give my first real keynote.

406
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:21.920
And I was extremely nervous.
I was just a sweaty,

407
00:26:21.921 --> 00:26:23.810
nervous mess even days beforehand.

408
00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:29.260
And I had no real way to rehearse in front of people.

409
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.980
So I ended up going to my friend's garage.
He had three Chihuahuas,

410
00:26:33.981 --> 00:26:38.960
have different sizes and I realized that if I focused on presenting to them that

411
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.790
I assume they didn't understand a word,

412
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:45.330
but if my actual style of presentation was not really dynamic,

413
00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:50.010
they would get bored and walk away.
But if,
if I was,
if I was really animated,

414
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.410
they would sit there kind of bug eyed and look at me.

415
00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:56.390
So I used the Chihuahuas as my test audience for a,

416
00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:00.820
for developing my material for that first now.
Yeah.
Yeah.

417
00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.140
And it was a,
it actually worked out extremely well because my,

418
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.290
my tech failed,
my,
my laptop had some type of glitch in the,

419
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.620
the projector wasn't working so I had to go off,

420
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:18.330
I had to go off script and I had to,
to work without the tech.
Uh,
the,

421
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.800
the,
the question of,

422
00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:24.570
of fearlessness and being nervous on stage,
uh,

423
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.640
you,
you are not shy,

424
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.500
at least as people know you now about talking about race,
gender,

425
00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:32.490
sexuality,

426
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.570
I mean you really cross into all sorts of different worlds that,

427
00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:40.290
that many people I assume would avoid because they're perceived as sensitive

428
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:41.700
topics.
Uh,

429
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
were you ever nervous about broaching those types of subjects early on or have

430
00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:49.580
you for the very get go?

431
00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:53.070
<v 3>No,
it's a nerve wracking because you know,</v>

432
00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:58.070
you want to have a semblance of privacy and then sometimes when you reveal

433
00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:02.720
things on stage that,
you know,
are pretty,
they can,
it can be kind of weird.
I,

434
00:28:02.721 --> 00:28:04.610
you know,
like I,
I think that,

435
00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.800
I think that privacy is really overrated though because it's just a kind of a

436
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:15.090
social construct that doesn't really mean that much because all human beings
are,

437
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.280
we felt all the same things.

438
00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:21.720
We've had all the same heartbreaks and tragedies and dumb zee was in stupid

439
00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:26.610
things and you know,
we really are not,
no,
none of us are a stranger to that.

440
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:30.930
If you've lived at all,
you know,
so,
um,
you know,
it's not like anything I say.

441
00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:33.270
It's not like something we haven't,
everybody has itself,

442
00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:36.730
but still things can feel odd and weird.
Um,

443
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.560
but so I was more conscious of it when I was younger,
um,

444
00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.970
is that like I'm bisexual and I was really scared of revealing that or maybe the

445
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:49.971
first 10 years of my career because I was told by my management then that would

446
00:28:52.351 --> 00:28:57.351
be really bad to be gay in any way and that I should not express that.

447
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.720
And so that was a really scary thing because,
you know,

448
00:29:00.721 --> 00:29:03.790
I was in relationships with women and,

449
00:29:03.791 --> 00:29:06.120
and stuff and I had to hide that,

450
00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:09.760
which I'll always felt odd and weird,
um,

451
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.200
that I could have fine relationships with men and show that,

452
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:17.750
but with women who would somehow wrong and,
and so I,

453
00:29:17.751 --> 00:29:22.751
I really gave up trying to pretend that I was anything but myself very early.

454
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:28.780
<v 1>When did you,
when did you make that leap?
What was the,
this the,</v>

455
00:29:28.781 --> 00:29:29.830
the year roughly?

456
00:29:29.831 --> 00:29:32.740
I'm just trying to think of it in terms of the kind of cultural and political

457
00:29:32.741 --> 00:29:37.450
climate.
Uh,
when did you come out,
so to speak?
Publicly?

458
00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.500
<v 3>I think probably about 95,</v>

459
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.410
96 something like dark pretty early.

460
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.430
<v 1>Yeah,
pretty early on.</v>

461
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.250
<v 3>But then women are now,
I realized,</v>

462
00:29:48.251 --> 00:29:51.460
and I looked back on women's sexuality,

463
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:55.470
women's bisexuality is a lot more,
I don't know,
it,

464
00:29:55.471 --> 00:30:00.471
it's a lot more easy to deal with or people have a harder time dealing with men

465
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:08.050
and male sexuality and fluidity there.
But what's hard is,

466
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:13.120
um,
women who are just like to just the,
as lesbians,

467
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.210
they think they have a hard time as opposed to women who are bisexual.
There's,

468
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:17.260
uh,
there's some,

469
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:22.260
there's some kind of glamor and majesty attached to buy.

470
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.560
Not sure it's true,

471
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:30.090
but it certainly exists as a kind of a archetype or stereotype even.

472
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.550
<v 1>Oh,
sure.
I mean,
I think that,
uh,
you know,
even in,
uh,</v>

473
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:39.660
I live in San Francisco had been there for ages and it's sort of joked that,

474
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.520
uh,
you know,
bisexual women no matter what,
which is ridiculous of course.
But,
uh,

475
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.110
you know,
often referred to as Unicorns and,
um,
you know,
I think there's that,

476
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.080
there's that,
uh,
it sort of holds,

477
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:55.110
occupies a very unique place in the mind space of even a mainstream America for

478
00:30:57.341 --> 00:31:02.170
whatever reason.
Um,
but uh,
yeah.
Have you ever,
uh,

479
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:09.130
have you ever had a disclosed anything on stage that at least for a period of

480
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:10.930
time you regretted?

481
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.870
<v 3>Well,
I think that I,
earlier</v>

482
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.960
I'm working on this show that's really about,
um,

483
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.540
mental illness and addiction,
which is part of the,

484
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.360
the sort of trajectory and the thing that I'm trying to explain,

485
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:31.500
and I'm talking a lot about prescription pill addiction,

486
00:31:31.501 --> 00:31:35.420
which I had a really bad case in it for.
Um,

487
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.010
I stopped about a year ago,

488
00:31:38.011 --> 00:31:42.660
but before that it had been about five years where I was really having a
problem.

489
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.440
But you know,
it's like one of those things where you know,

490
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:51.530
that addiction is really strange because it's so deadly and destructive just in

491
00:31:51.931 --> 00:31:54.690
the way that a heroin it,
it shouldn't be,
but you know,

492
00:31:54.691 --> 00:31:58.890
it's prescribed by a doctor and I was actually getting it from my actual doctor

493
00:31:58.891 --> 00:32:00.660
and it was that,
you know,

494
00:32:00.661 --> 00:32:03.900
that there was all of these levels of legitimacy to it,

495
00:32:03.901 --> 00:32:07.410
that and then secrecy as well.
And so disclosing that is very,

496
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.580
it's very weird because you know,
it,

497
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:15.540
it really shatters a lot of these illusions of,
I don't know,

498
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.190
um,
I,
I'm maturity and,
uh,

499
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.570
you know,
like sanity and stuff.
So,
you know,

500
00:32:24.571 --> 00:32:27.240
that's a whole nother thing.
Like it's,
it's hard to disclose,

501
00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:32.241
but it's also important too because that honesty keeps me not sober because I,

502
00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.280
I still drink red wine,
but I think it keeps me,

503
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:43.040
it saying that I would because it's a really crazy addiction to have.

504
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:46.310
<v 1>Yeah.
I think it's a very insidious,</v>

505
00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:51.860
like you mentioned also because it's extremely common even among doctors

506
00:32:51.861 --> 00:32:53.480
themselves,
extremely common,

507
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:59.050
but it's not talked about nearly as much in detail as you pointed out,

508
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:06.320
for instance,
uh,
compared to heroin addiction or something like that.
Um,

509
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.710
what type of,
what type of medications,
just out of curiosity.

510
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.400
<v 3>Oh,
this is weird.
But</v>

511
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.530
which is like hydrocodone cough syrup.
Yup.

512
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.120
That or even to morphine or methadone or anything kind of any opiates like that,

513
00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:35.660
that,
that,
that was really my problem.
Um,

514
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.630
and it was really,
really destructive.

515
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.800
But it's the same time you don't exactly feel high,

516
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.030
so it's almost a cheat.
Like you're actually not really high.

517
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:51.140
You're just not sick after you get properly addicted to those drugs.

518
00:33:51.141 --> 00:33:54.500
They really are.
No,
they have no use at all.
Um,

519
00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.680
as I kind of a high,

520
00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:00.630
they really only serve to keep you from being sick,

521
00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.240
which is a bad thing.

522
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.980
<v 1>Yeah.
Just you need it to get to baseline to not have this physical withdrawal</v>

523
00:34:05.981 --> 00:34:08.110
symptoms.
Speaking personally,

524
00:34:08.111 --> 00:34:12.100
I think I've been very fortunate in a lot of respects of course.

525
00:34:12.101 --> 00:34:14.830
But one is that hydrocodone,
Vicodin,

526
00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:19.060
etc. All make me extremely nauseous.
So the,

527
00:34:19.061 --> 00:34:23.050
all of these sort of opioid derivative drugs make me very,

528
00:34:23.051 --> 00:34:25.500
very sick.
And uh,

529
00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:28.750
I learned that after shoulder surgery I was given all these painkillers and I

530
00:34:28.751 --> 00:34:32.800
couldn't really take any of them because they made me so sick,

531
00:34:32.801 --> 00:34:33.990
which I think is,

532
00:34:33.991 --> 00:34:37.990
is a blessing in disguise and a lot of ways because my likelihood of abusing

533
00:34:37.991 --> 00:34:40.130
those things is very,
very low.
Uh,

534
00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:45.300
do do you find at least within the world of comedy that people tend to,

535
00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:52.351
if they have addictive personalities and I have no idea if addiction is more or

536
00:34:52.721 --> 00:34:55.900
less common in,
in standup comics than the general population.

537
00:34:55.901 --> 00:34:59.800
Of course a lot of the tragedies are highlighted,
uh,
which I think might,

538
00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.960
might skew the public perception.

539
00:35:01.961 --> 00:35:06.961
But do people tend to be either addicted to sort of depressants and opiates or

540
00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:09.460
stimulants?
I mean,

541
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:13.720
do people often end up addicted to both or do they tend to fall on one side or

542
00:35:13.721 --> 00:35:14.554
the other?

543
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.250
<v 3>Standup comics,</v>

544
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:39.210
like our job is really to job is really to obsessed on things.

545
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:42.940
That's what stand up comedy is.
It just obsessing over a topic,
right?

546
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.870
And you just going crazy on some thing and you know,

547
00:35:45.871 --> 00:35:48.510
that's fine in the context of standup comedy,

548
00:35:48.511 --> 00:35:51.690
but it's terrible if you're just living in the world.

549
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.810
And so,
you know,
th the,
the,

550
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:59.100
the connection with comedy comics being depressed and self destructive and

551
00:35:59.101 --> 00:36:00.550
suicidal,
uh,

552
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.500
it goes with the territory because the job that Denise requires,

553
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:08.700
that kind of thinking.
So it can be pretty difficult to manage that.

554
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:12.210
And then if you add drugs on top of that,
you can do really,
really hard.

555
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:15.570
And then the lifestyle also,
because it's very solitary,
right?

556
00:36:15.571 --> 00:36:20.520
You're traveling all the time,
you're on sweep,
schedule is off.
It's weird.

557
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.830
The jetlag and then also,
um,
press and shows.
So it's a very,

558
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:30.810
it's a disruptive and very difficult lifestyle,
almost like being in a band.

559
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:35.670
But you were,
you're not with anybody else.
You're the only one.
So,
you know,

560
00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:38.410
as musicians are very legendary,

561
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.380
known to be very self destructive in the same way,

562
00:36:40.381 --> 00:36:43.920
at least they have a community,
um,
with them on tour,

563
00:36:43.921 --> 00:36:47.430
even if it's just a few guys on a,
on a,
in a van,
you know,

564
00:36:47.431 --> 00:36:52.020
so we don't have that as conduct.
We're just alone and it can be really messy.

565
00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:58.160
<v 1>Definitely.
And I think that perhaps to a lesser degree,
the see,</v>

566
00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.061
you see some,

567
00:36:59.061 --> 00:37:04.061
some very similar symptoms as problems servicing in a lot of writers as well.

568
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.570
Uh,
particularly writers who,
um,

569
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.130
develop a habit of not mean number one,

570
00:37:13.131 --> 00:37:15.050
they're going to be isolated almost by definition.

571
00:37:15.051 --> 00:37:17.960
And that's part of the reason that I'm taking a break from writing books quite

572
00:37:17.961 --> 00:37:21.140
frankly,
is because three,
three years at a stress,
uh,

573
00:37:21.141 --> 00:37:24.650
at three years at a stretch inside your own head is sometimes a scary place to

574
00:37:24.651 --> 00:37:26.280
be.
And,
uh,

575
00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.040
particularly those writers who develop a late night writing schedule,

576
00:37:31.041 --> 00:37:32.420
which is something that I have,

577
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:37.750
I think are more prone to bouts of depression and darkness.

578
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.810
Uh,
and I mean,

579
00:37:38.811 --> 00:37:42.110
of course there's a sort of long history of people like Hemingway who ended up

580
00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.350
not,
uh,
at a very,
uh,

581
00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:49.330
positive punchline at the end of things.
Yeah.

582
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:51.320
Personality wise,

583
00:37:51.321 --> 00:37:55.310
do you find that there are certain characteristics that are common among the

584
00:37:55.311 --> 00:37:56.480
people,
the people,

585
00:37:56.481 --> 00:38:00.290
the standup comics who were addicted to stimulants versus depressants?
I mean,

586
00:38:00.291 --> 00:38:01.720
do you find that there's,
you could,

587
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.730
you can kind of guess which people are going to go one way or the other.

588
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:11.250
<v 3>I think that people who are really
add,</v>

589
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.520
you know,
we're really kind of scatter brains and their,
their,

590
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:16.440
their minds are everywhere.

591
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:21.090
I think that just like hyperactive kids are given Ritalin and Adderall,

592
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:26.091
I think they're really helped where they tend to crave on stimulants because it

593
00:38:26.401 --> 00:38:30.000
focuses them.
Right.
And,
and then,
um,

594
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:35.120
I think that people who are pretty focused but depressed and kind of moody,

595
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.810
um,
minor chord,
like down,
down,

596
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.240
we're gazing bummed out.

597
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:48.270
People are really helped in lifted by opiates because they offered this

598
00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:50.890
injections of endorphins,

599
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.820
which is something that they're either laughing like your serotonin is messed up

600
00:38:54.821 --> 00:38:59.470
or whatever.
They're just not getting it.
And then the positivity that,

601
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.970
or the burst of positivity that an opiate can give you,
of course,

602
00:39:03.971 --> 00:39:06.460
it's just countered by terrible depression,

603
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:11.050
which is actually worse than your baseline,
makes everything way,
way where,
um,

604
00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.620
you know,
they,
I can see why it's that,
that,
that would be attractive.
I mean,

605
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:16.420
that's what I have,
you know,
I'm kind of,

606
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.370
I have that kind of a down would sort of say I,

607
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:25.270
I take some effort to look for positivity and also for gratitude,

608
00:39:25.271 --> 00:39:29.880
which is why I'm so grateful for like my own radically new way.

609
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.150
I need it so much.

610
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:36.610
<v 1>Sure,
sure.
How did you,
how did you decide,</v>

611
00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:42.070
what was the catalyzing moment that led you to start taking your prescription

612
00:39:43.041 --> 00:39:46.430
drug addiction seriously?
How did,
and then how did,
how did you end up kicking it?

613
00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:47.780
What was,
what did that look like?

614
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:53.670
<v 3>Well,
I just really,
uh,
I,
I,</v>

615
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.260
I just really had no idea how much I was taking.

616
00:39:57.261 --> 00:39:59.370
I really had no idea what I would say.
He,

617
00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:01.760
I didn't understand the contra indications.

618
00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:06.710
I could a con the complete like crazy.

619
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.950
Um,
you know,
I think as things I've,

620
00:40:09.951 --> 00:40:13.400
I was doing to myself and then I was taking like all the ambient,

621
00:40:13.401 --> 00:40:17.780
which is another thing which I think is actually very,
very dangerous drugs that,

622
00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.680
um,
people,
many,
many people are very dependent on.

623
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:25.940
But I also have a very,
it's a bit,
I have a bad insomnia problem.
And so,

624
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:30.590
um,
but that in combination with opiates is a deadly thing.
You know,

625
00:40:30.591 --> 00:40:33.290
my friend Anna Nicole Smith died from that.

626
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:38.650
And really it was that kind of suicidal behavior of taking so much pills and not

627
00:40:39.021 --> 00:40:43.040
knowing if I would wake up and not really thinking I would wake up.

628
00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.680
I think that that was really,
it just became really apparent.
So I just Kinda,

629
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:53.060
I,
I threw everything away and then,
um,
you and I told everybody in my,

630
00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:57.350
around me,
my circle and I,
you know,
my work and you know,

631
00:40:57.351 --> 00:41:01.820
I was talking about it on stage and I made it very clear that this is a problem

632
00:41:01.821 --> 00:41:04.460
that I was going through.
And I think just making that,

633
00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:08.360
making it not a secret anymore was really what it was all about.

634
00:41:08.361 --> 00:41:13.361
When I wasn't having to hide or talk,

635
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.030
talk,
you know,

636
00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.160
if I talked about it then it really resolve the situation.

637
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:24.190
I fortunately was able to just walk away and I was very sick for a time because

638
00:41:25.491 --> 00:41:29.850
it's the natural,
you know,
that's what happens when you take the drugs.
But um,

639
00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.450
afterwards I was much better and I didn't have,

640
00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.390
I kind of a need to go fast to it.

641
00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:40.160
R m a sense that this was going to be repeated.

642
00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.053
So you know,
it,

643
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:46.480
it wasn't like I went to rehab and it wasn't like I really sought treatment,

644
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:52.010
which most people should.
Um,
but I,
I just uh,

645
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.320
was able to escape fortunately.

646
00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.380
<v 1>Well,
the day that you threw out all of your medication,</v>

647
00:41:59.381 --> 00:42:03.250
why that day was there deeper?
Did you scare yourself somehow?

648
00:42:03.251 --> 00:42:04.660
Was there a conversation?

649
00:42:04.661 --> 00:42:08.050
Did you look in the mirror and see something you hadn't noticed before?
But what,

650
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.400
why that day

651
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:11.103
<v 3>I just made,</v>

652
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:16.750
there was so many patches in my memory that I didn't understand why I didn't

653
00:42:18.261 --> 00:42:20.240
remember and I didn't understand.
Like,

654
00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:24.380
I could feel the whatever the generation of my brain,

655
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:25.370
I can really feel it

656
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.500
sense that I don't think I'm going to get that part of my brain back.

657
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:33.560
Like I really felt an emptiness,
like a cleared out.

658
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:38.830
Like I had deleted files that I didn't want to delete and that was so terrible.

659
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:40.881
You know,

660
00:42:40.881 --> 00:42:45.530
when you just have like a blank space when you should have something there.

661
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:50.210
And um,
evidence that things that we're not going wrong,
like room service.

662
00:42:50.211 --> 00:42:53.180
I don't know that I ordered and um,
you know,

663
00:42:53.181 --> 00:42:58.181
like weird photos on my phone that I don't know who these people are and why I

664
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:00.260
have them.
Right.
Um,

665
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:05.630
and weird sexual situations that were like,
I should not,

666
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:07.010
or like who,
who,

667
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:11.930
who am I talking to in this manner that I don't remember even meeting?
Like,

668
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:15.230
what,
what is going on?
Like all these things at one.

669
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:16.363
<v 1>Right.</v>

670
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.700
<v 3>Um,
and you go,
I have to get out of this.</v>

671
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:22.980
Like this is really a weird space because it's almost like somebody takes over

672
00:43:22.981 --> 00:43:27.270
your body for you and drives it.
And that's really strange.

673
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:31.620
<v 1>No,
I agreed.
And I've seen,
just speaking of Ambien,
Oh,</v>

674
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:36.630
I've been on trips before with friends where I've seen them come downstairs

675
00:43:37.351 --> 00:43:41.220
after going to sleep,
like the walking dead on Ambien,

676
00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:45.750
go crazy doing all sorts of ridiculous things for hours,

677
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:50.720
go back to their bed and have no recollection of any of it the next day.
Um,
yeah,

678
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:56.310
one of my two best friends growing up about,
um,
I'd say a year and a half ago,

679
00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:01.610
uh,
died of an accidental contra indication.
Um,

680
00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:06.600
he was,
he had had a lot of alcohol,
never took any,
never took any illicit drugs,

681
00:44:06.601 --> 00:44:07.650
recreational drugs.

682
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:11.700
And he was complaining to a buddy of his about a headache and his buddy gave him

683
00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:15.960
a very strong prescription depressant and took it,

684
00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.840
never woke up and that was it.
It just took one shot.
So yeah,

685
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:23.370
people need to take the alcohol interactions really seriously.

686
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:26.940
<v 3>Yeah,
that's,
that's amazing.
That's a major,</v>

687
00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:31.110
major problem with alcohol and Ambien.

688
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.350
And also opiates too.
I mean,
the whole thing wrecks your liver,

689
00:44:34.351 --> 00:44:37.850
but on top of that,
uh,
you,
you,
you,

690
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.410
it's a judgment that goes completely out the window.

691
00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:41.690
Like you don't know what you're doing.

692
00:44:41.691 --> 00:44:44.280
If there's something that alcohol does in that,

693
00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:46.320
it just really messes everything up.

694
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.910
<v 1>Yeah,
for sure.
Well,</v>

695
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.590
I think it's very important sort of topic to explore for folks.

696
00:44:53.591 --> 00:44:56.300
But to switch gears a little bit because I'm,

697
00:44:56.330 --> 00:45:01.330
I'm constantly impressed with just how prolific you are and has been.

698
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:07.690
What is,
what does your process look like for developing material?

699
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:12.140
So let's just say that you've just finished,
uh,
you,

700
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.920
you've just finished a special or you just finished,

701
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:19.990
he basically aced whatever you'd been working on for the last x period of time

702
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.530
and it's time to,
it's time for you to start over.
You have that feeling.

703
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.640
What does the process look like?
How do you come up with your material?

704
00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.890
<v 3>Usually I'm at the,
uh,</v>

705
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.800
probably involved with the San Francisco actually.
Um,

706
00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:38.770
where I just started it recently.
You know,

707
00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:43.780
I came back to the city and I hung out with old comedian friends.

708
00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:47.970
See,
I haven't seen for awhile.
And you know,

709
00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:50.050
there's a lot of little shows that happened.

710
00:45:50.051 --> 00:45:54.190
There's like the deluxe on Haight street and then there's like,
um,
you know,

711
00:45:54.191 --> 00:45:58.510
a bunch of different kinds of nights that happened usually from like Sunday to

712
00:45:58.511 --> 00:46:01.120
Wednesday,
which is for comedians are days off.

713
00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:05.880
And so that's when I'll start to go to these like little kind of clubs in the

714
00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:09.490
city and work things out.
So I'll like kind of put together just everything new,

715
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:10.683
you know,
uh,

716
00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:15.640
just add a note that I have and I'll do that and I'll do that in different

717
00:46:15.641 --> 00:46:20.470
cities and out.
And then I'll work them into I larger performances where I,

718
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.050
I will have some like level of prepared material,

719
00:46:23.051 --> 00:46:26.780
but then I'll also work on the new script from anything,

720
00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:31.420
can also improvise where I am and it just grows,
you know,

721
00:46:31.421 --> 00:46:35.940
but usually it's built from a small,
um,
you know,

722
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:40.690
maybe two or three jokes in it will grow into an hour of comedy that would be

723
00:46:40.691 --> 00:46:41.010
ready.

724
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:45.400
We'll take about maybe a year to make it really perfect cause I would take it

725
00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:50.530
internationally and make sure that it is great and then I will actually commit

726
00:46:50.531 --> 00:46:54.400
it to either a special or album or something like that.

727
00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:59.860
<v 1>Did you take it international before you test it on the main stage in the u s is</v>

728
00:47:00.591 --> 00:47:03.800
the,
do you use internationals?
Yeah.
So that's really interesting.

729
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:05.810
That's the first I've heard of that.
And a,

730
00:47:05.811 --> 00:47:09.860
you know a lot of folks may not realize that even companies like Nike for

731
00:47:09.861 --> 00:47:14.000
instance,
we'll do tons of testing in places like New Zealand,

732
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:15.343
uh,

733
00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.680
smaller English speaking countries to refine the products and marketing and

734
00:47:22.041 --> 00:47:25.040
positioning and everything that they then bring back to the u s but they don't

735
00:47:25.041 --> 00:47:27.980
want to have their debutante ball in the,
in the major leagues.

736
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:29.530
That's really right.

737
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:35.310
<v 3>Why it's great because what's great about going internationally as part of the</v>

738
00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:40.771
joy and perform their audience is just so grateful that you came that they will

739
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:46.600
give you some scale,
cut you some slack tracing cause you can actually,

740
00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:50.060
um,
what negotiate a,
a,

741
00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:54.240
a of like a nice workshop with them because they,
they're,
they,

742
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:58.080
they know how far away it is.
They know you don't have to turn there but they,

743
00:47:58.081 --> 00:48:01.570
they know you from whatever different things and they so glad that you're there.

744
00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:03.850
So for me it's,
it's a great,

745
00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:08.660
great thing and it's not something that a lot of comedians from America do.
Um,

746
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:13.630
so I for some reason have the ability to travel and I get to do many,

747
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.890
many countries in Europe except the only country that have done shows in our,

748
00:48:17.891 --> 00:48:22.720
like Italy and Spain,
which it just gets the market.

749
00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.700
It's very different there.
But um,

750
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.260
every place that place also has been really fantastic.
And,
and Australia also,

751
00:48:29.261 --> 00:48:31.790
I had to cancel a New Zealand tour cause I've,
I've got it,

752
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:35.680
it was doing like a TV show.
But I definitely look forward to going back there.

753
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.810
But international markets are really wonderful for me to work out what I want to

754
00:48:40.811 --> 00:48:41.644
do in the future.

755
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:45.320
<v 1>What,
what makes Spain and Italy so different?
I'm very curious.</v>

756
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:47.970
<v 3>I think because of the Catholicism.</v>

757
00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.313
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

758
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.440
<v 3>I vote for Lyndon to talk about sex in the way that I do.
Right.
You know,
I,</v>

759
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:58.140
I very,
very,
um,
like there's this,

760
00:48:58.141 --> 00:48:59.400
this is a joke that I'm telling you.

761
00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.610
I don't even know if I should tell this joke,
but I,
it's just,

762
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.370
I haven't had sex in a really long time.
Not a really long time,

763
00:49:05.371 --> 00:49:09.510
but I was upset because Robin Williams died and Joan Rivers died and I can't,

764
00:49:09.511 --> 00:49:14.270
I couldn't,
I don't want to be now.
And I just did it feel like,

765
00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:19.190
um,
so I was out to dinner in San Francisco,
um,

766
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:24.450
not long ago,
and I was with two gay guys,
which is my way.

767
00:49:24.451 --> 00:49:27.630
I love gay men with these guys I love were at the house of prime rib,
which is,

768
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.910
<v 1>yeah,
I know exactly what</v>

769
00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.910
<v 3>good.
It's really good.
And we're eating and then the Somali,
Yay.
So cute.</v>

770
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:38.000
You know,
I'm talking to him and then I thought he was so adorable.

771
00:49:38.001 --> 00:49:41.950
And then he's really young too.
And we laughed.
And um,

772
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.250
then my friends are like,
well,
you know,
they're trying to encourage me.

773
00:49:46.251 --> 00:49:48.980
Like he was just talked to him cause he really like you.
I was like,
oh,

774
00:49:48.981 --> 00:49:49.791
he's too young.

775
00:49:49.791 --> 00:49:54.791
And I know one of them went back and gave the guy my phone number and I was

776
00:49:55.581 --> 00:49:57.230
like,
whatever.
And then so anyway,

777
00:49:57.231 --> 00:50:01.100
I went back to my hotel and it was like one in the morning and the guy actually

778
00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:05.000
called me,
which was amazing.
I thought it was so brave.

779
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:08.210
So he came over and it wasn't what

780
00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:12.080
it was like a therapy dog.

781
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:18.300
I don't think you can tell that too.
And it's not a joke,
it's two story,

782
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.330
but another,
you could tell that European,
Italy,

783
00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:23.570
we can tell that joke in Spain without some kind of repercussions of people

784
00:50:23.571 --> 00:50:27.980
getting really angry.
Like,
what are you doing?
Like can you just do that?

785
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.270
You know,
I'm 45 year old woman.
I,
I,
I'm really,
you know,

786
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:38.030
right.
He was much younger than me.
I really should have had sex with his father,

787
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.530
<v 1>but it was really what I needed,</v>

788
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:49.610
given the intensity of porn that comes out of Italy.

789
00:50:49.611 --> 00:50:50.444
Not that I would know anything

790
00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:56.800
that they would be so judgemental to people on the stage,

791
00:50:56.801 --> 00:51:01.090
but I guess there's the public facing laughing and then there's the private porn

792
00:51:01.091 --> 00:51:03.040
viewing.
And maybe those are two different mentalities.

793
00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:14.370
<v 3>I think it's hard for American comics just in general,</v>

794
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:18.440
but especially somebody that's really brash and talking about sexuality and

795
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:24.600
it's kind of
for that.

796
00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.860
So those markets has always been a little bit,

797
00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.830
<v 1>which markets on the flip side,</v>

798
00:51:29.831 --> 00:51:34.831
which countries respond best to the sex talk and everything else?

799
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:40.580
<v 3>Sweden.
France is incredible.
Germany is probably the best.</v>

800
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:45.470
Uh,
definitely Norway,
it's amazing.

801
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:48.880
All of Scandinavia is so down with that,
you know,
they're so excited.

802
00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.300
Denmark is incredible.
Uh,

803
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:59.470
traditionally been very,
very sex positive,
know their history in corn.

804
00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.950
It's pretty amazing.

805
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:05.540
So that's a great place to go to.
But um,

806
00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.380
a lot of like kind of sort of northern

807
00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:11.893
Germany,

808
00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:17.130
the ultimate place because there's so much kind of liberal thought.

809
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:20.930
They're so much a kind of ease about sexuality there.

810
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:22.850
That is really amazing.

811
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:25.880
<v 1>Yeah.
I'm glad you mentioned Denmark.
This is my people</v>

812
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:35.390
courtesy of my Danish genetics.
I didn't get the height though.

813
00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:39.830
I got the,
uh,
the,

814
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:44.890
the gigantic head pats square Bob or whatever his name without the,

815
00:52:45.541 --> 00:52:47.640
without the height.
Uh,

816
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:54.380
to jump to a different type of question.
Um,

817
00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:56.490
when you think of the word successful,

818
00:52:56.491 --> 00:52:58.620
who's the first person who comes to mind and why?

819
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:04.783
<v 3>Steve Jobs</v>

820
00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.490
and also

821
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.510
the visionary that became kind of legendary

822
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.630
beyond humans.
Um,

823
00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:27.460
so I think that would be my definition of success is somebody that sort of like

824
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:30.630
crosses a line,
uh,
from like,

825
00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:35.340
here's this to art too.
I don't even know what that is.
You know,

826
00:53:35.341 --> 00:53:38.310
that kind of visionary.
It's pretty profound.

827
00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.240
<v 1>Do you,
do you feel successful?</v>

828
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:42.130
I think a lot of people would consider you successful.

829
00:53:42.131 --> 00:53:43.870
Do you feel to successful yourself?

830
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:47.100
<v 3>Oh,
absolutely.
I know that I am,
you know,</v>

831
00:53:47.101 --> 00:53:52.080
I'm very grateful for that and I know that that,
um,
and achievement,
uh,

832
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:56.940
there's much,
much higher levels of success I would like to achieve.
But then,

833
00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:01.540
you know,
uh,
I'm no slouch,
especially because I'm probably like,

834
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:05.510
here is the one who was sustained at the longest.
You know,
that,

835
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:10.020
that I have been pretty active and out there,
you know,
very,

836
00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:13.530
very visibly for the last 20 years.
And so that's a good thing.

837
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:17.360
<v 1>Yeah.
It's hard to make,
it's hard to string it together for that long for sure.</v>

838
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.150
Yeah.
Yeah.
If,
um,

839
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:24.500
if you could change or improve one thing about yourself,
what would that be?

840
00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.790
<v 3>Oh,
well I would like to have a lower percentage of body fat,</v>

841
00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.620
which is why mt four hour body.

842
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:35.180
<v 1>Well,
I went.
Wow.
Awesome.
Well,
you know,</v>

843
00:54:35.181 --> 00:54:38.280
you mentioned before we started recording that you had some,
uh,
some,

844
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:41.510
some food questions.
I'm happy to answer those obviously.

845
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:44.650
<v 3>Well,
when you talk about your cheat day,</v>

846
00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.820
I almost dread mine because I am physically sick.

847
00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:51.110
Every time I over that,

848
00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:56.130
I've been eating now and the four hour body four very religiously now for about

849
00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:03.520
maybe several months,
four or five months.
And it's a big difference.

850
00:55:03.521 --> 00:55:08.500
But I try to go for the free day,
the cheat day,
and I dread it.

851
00:55:08.501 --> 00:55:11.560
Like I'm afraid of it.
It doesn't feel good to me because it,

852
00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:15.660
any kind of flour or,
um,

853
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.790
excessive amounts of sugar or anything,
they taste so good,

854
00:55:18.791 --> 00:55:23.410
but they don't feel good in my body.
And I wonder if there's a way to manage,

855
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:27.990
um,
I have a better suggestion during that time.
It's,

856
00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.540
um,
but it just doesn't,
it doesn't feel good to me.

857
00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.820
<v 1>Sure.
No,
I can comment on that.
The,</v>

858
00:55:33.821 --> 00:55:37.240
so the cheat day is designed to do a few things.

859
00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:42.810
The first is based on the assumption that people are going to cheat no matter

860
00:55:43.391 --> 00:55:47.590
what and you can contain the damage if you schedule it in advance.

861
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.390
So that's sort of principle number one.

862
00:55:49.391 --> 00:55:53.590
Principle number two is that by spiking chloric intake once a week,

863
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:58.950
you can help to prevent a lot of kind of downgrading of the metabolism,

864
00:55:59.291 --> 00:56:03.100
whether that's thyroid or otherwise.
Uh,
there are,
uh,

865
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:06.220
there are people out there who say,
for instance,

866
00:56:06.221 --> 00:56:09.590
while I'm only gonna have one cheat meal instead of a cheat day to,

867
00:56:09.591 --> 00:56:12.660
to limit the damage that I do,
uh,

868
00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:17.820
I only recommend that to people if that means they won't succumb to cravings

869
00:56:19.121 --> 00:56:23.050
later in the week.
So by being disgusted once a week,
it's not mandatory.

870
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:26.410
Typically what happens is exactly what you're describing.

871
00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:31.410
So people start to dread over doing it on cheat day and they naturally start to

872
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:34.300
dial it back a little bit.
Uh,

873
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:38.860
and in the beginning when people are most likely to quit any diet in the first

874
00:56:38.861 --> 00:56:43.150
two to three weeks,
that cheat day is so overdone.

875
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:46.540
They're dis just so disgusted the,

876
00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:48.430
that that evening and the following day,

877
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:52.510
they can't wait to get back to a cleaner type of eating because they just feel

878
00:56:52.511 --> 00:56:57.190
better.
Uh,
there are ways to cheat,
so to speak,

879
00:56:57.191 --> 00:57:01.540
to s to spike the caloric intake without having some of the digestive issues,

880
00:57:01.541 --> 00:57:04.360
if that is a problem for a lot of people,
for a lot of people,

881
00:57:04.361 --> 00:57:09.190
that means simply avoiding gluten among other things.
So,

882
00:57:09.191 --> 00:57:09.761
for instance,

883
00:57:09.761 --> 00:57:14.761
if I am training for athletics or I know that I have to have a lot of work done,

884
00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:22.330
uh,
on a,
on a Sunday or a Monday,
just the day after a cheat day,

885
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:23.620
uh,

886
00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:28.620
I will focus on say carbs or carb rich foods like sweet potatoes or brown rice

887
00:57:31.871 --> 00:57:36.340
or even white rice as opposed to getting it from wheat flour.

888
00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:41.200
Um,
things of that type that or I know going to just put up,

889
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:44.570
put up a huge fight going through my digestive track.
So there,

890
00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:46.110
there are definitely ways to do it,
um,

891
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:51.160
and minimize some of the discomfort while still checking the boxes that prevent

892
00:57:51.161 --> 00:57:52.480
you from cheating later.
Another,

893
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:57.570
another recommendation is that you can make the first meal of the day a slow

894
00:58:00.221 --> 00:58:05.080
carb compliant meal.
Uh,
and a very easy way to do that is to,

895
00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.840
um,
just this,
for instance,

896
00:58:07.841 --> 00:58:12.610
you could have a small amount of lentils out of a can.

897
00:58:12.611 --> 00:58:16.280
I mean literally,
this is something I'll do oftentimes is I will have in there,

898
00:58:16.281 --> 00:58:19.310
there are a lot of reasons for this,
but the fiber and uh,

899
00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:22.770
which is important for kind of Gut Flora and,
uh,

900
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.970
bacterial balance in the Gi track.

901
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:29.180
You could have just spoon out of a can literally,
uh,

902
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.500
lentils in the morning with maybe one or two eggs and that will,

903
00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:37.630
that will naturally inhibit your appetite,
uh,
later in the day.

904
00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:41.140
So you'll be able to cheat,
but you'll be less prone to put,
you know,

905
00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:45.970
to ingesting the last 2000 calories of rocky road ice cream with snickers on top

906
00:58:45.971 --> 00:58:49.450
or whatever.
Because it's usually,

907
00:58:49.451 --> 00:58:53.080
I think for a lot of people,
they do cheat day.

908
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:57.700
They get to a point where they're like,
Holy Shit,
I am about to explode.

909
00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:00.520
And they look at the clock and they're like,
but it's 10 o'clock.

910
00:59:00.521 --> 00:59:04.570
I have two more hours to go.
I can't,
I can't let cheat day.

911
00:59:04.571 --> 00:59:07.990
And without giving it one last hurrah.
And it's just,
it's,

912
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
it's that last extra serving or that last Guinness or whatever that just takes

913
00:59:13.031 --> 00:59:17.470
them from about to explode to just complete insulin coma.

914
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:20.210
Um,
so the,
the,
the,

915
00:59:20.211 --> 00:59:25.211
the slow carb meal early in the day can help the grapefruit juice plus caffeine

916
00:59:26.631 --> 00:59:31.631
early in the day because of the engine in and all of that can also help,

917
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.660
uh,

918
00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:37.610
because it will stabilize somewhat your blood sugar and your insulin response.

919
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:40.820
Um,
so those are,
those are a few recommendations.

920
00:59:40.821 --> 00:59:43.970
There are lots of ways to customize cheat day,
but the most important,

921
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:47.900
I think the most important thing to realize about cheat days that you should
not,

922
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:52.460
you should not feel like you are,
um,

923
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:55.730
restricting yourself on she did.
That's the most important thing.

924
00:59:55.731 --> 00:59:58.670
So some people will try to do a healthy cheat day,

925
00:59:58.671 --> 01:00:02.960
but then they have a to eat list of all these things that they don't want to

926
01:00:02.961 --> 01:00:07.280
give up and they end up cheating on a Wednesday night or a Thursday night.

927
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:10.070
And like most people who do that,
they say,
oh,
fuck it.

928
01:00:10.071 --> 01:00:11.510
I already had one cookie I'm going to have,

929
01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:15.110
now I'm going to have the rest of all these girl scout cookies because I already

930
01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:18.920
fucked up.
And then they bet then they backslide and they don't stick with it.

931
01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:23.810
So as long as you do,
as long as you don't feel like you are,
um,

932
01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.970
you have secret cravings that you're not satisfying during cheat day,

933
01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.300
you can pretty much do whatever you want.

934
01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:30.800
<v 3>Well,</v>

935
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:35.120
what's interesting about the Diet or just the way it is in my body and do what?

936
01:00:35.121 --> 01:00:39.410
I don't have any cravings,
but I just don't,
I don't actually care.

937
01:00:39.411 --> 01:00:43.160
I do the cheat day because it's tastes good,

938
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:45.980
but it's not because I had a craving,
you know,

939
01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:51.230
it's out to just do it because it's going to help my health,
my overall process,

940
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.340
which is I think I can get it.

941
01:00:54.341 --> 01:00:58.550
That's what's the best thing about it for me is that I don't have that need for

942
01:00:58.551 --> 01:01:01.040
pasta or bread that I did before,

943
01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.270
although it still tastes really good when they have it.
Um,

944
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.730
that's just the needs where they,
you know,

945
01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.890
the things that you think you can't do left before he started and then you

946
01:01:09.891 --> 01:01:12.380
started and then your idea about food changes.

947
01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.270
<v 1>Yep.
Yeah,
definitely.
And,
and it's,</v>

948
01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:20.330
it's very much a combination of biochemistry and psychology,

949
01:01:20.631 --> 01:01:23.410
right?
I mean,
you have a certain shift where I think the,

950
01:01:23.411 --> 01:01:28.411
the biochemical changes in the physiological changes proceed the psychological

951
01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:32.060
realization that you don't need certain things.

952
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:34.460
So you have a certain chemical dependency,

953
01:01:34.461 --> 01:01:36.380
just like getting off of prescription medications.

954
01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:40.370
You have a certain chemical dependency which could be related to,

955
01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:45.230
um,
the types of refined carbohydrates that people are accustomed to eating for

956
01:01:45.231 --> 01:01:45.771
breakfast,

957
01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:50.180
which sets the stage for the rest of the day and makes them fall asleep at one

958
01:01:50.181 --> 01:01:52.430
30 or 2:00 PM.
But when you start,

959
01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:55.280
when you start to add in the protein,

960
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:58.010
the fat and fiber,

961
01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.240
then those type of dramatic,
uh,

962
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:05.720
glucose swings start to level out.

963
01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:08.650
And as you're sort of like,
uh,

964
01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.540
your pancreas becomes resensitized,

965
01:02:11.541 --> 01:02:15.140
or at least you develop some degree of insulin sensitivity.
Again,

966
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:18.830
your body stops having to work so hard and it prevents a lot of the

967
01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.810
rollercoasters and then like you said,
about a week into it,

968
01:02:21.811 --> 01:02:24.690
two weeks into it you're like,
wow,
I don't crave those foods.

969
01:02:24.691 --> 01:02:29.400
I thought I would crave forever.
And um,
yeah,

970
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:31.020
it's,
it's,
it's really fascinating.

971
01:02:31.021 --> 01:02:36.021
And the entire diet is really designed to have the highest compliance rate

972
01:02:37.351 --> 01:02:37.980
possible.

973
01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:42.980
And I think this is sometimes lost on say a Paleo or Vegan purists who want,

974
01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:50.760
want everyone to convert to a very inconvenient diet on day one.

975
01:02:50.761 --> 01:02:52.430
And my point is the,

976
01:02:52.431 --> 01:02:55.890
the good program you follow is better than the perfect program that you quit.

977
01:02:55.891 --> 01:03:00.891
And the slow carb diet is a great gateway drug in a positive sense for getting

978
01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:05.610
people to eliminate the vast amount of garbage that they consume.
So,

979
01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.120
right,
right.
Yeah,
that's how I think

980
01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:12.490
<v 3>it's really very helpful.
I think the strangest thing that instead,</v>

981
01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:14.000
I'm really not hungry.

982
01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:19.460
Weird thing cause I was like starving all the time and I'm like,

983
01:03:19.461 --> 01:03:22.850
why do I,
I mean obviously there's reasons why,

984
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:27.110
but it's like I don't have that.
If I,
I,
I just don't,

985
01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:28.850
I'm never really hungry ever.

986
01:03:28.851 --> 01:03:33.830
Even when I haven't eaten for several hours and it somehow sustains my sits
down,

987
01:03:33.831 --> 01:03:38.240
it just burns.
Yeah.
And I'm not desperate for food.

988
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:42.060
<v 1>Yeah.
It's a,
it's a really cool,
um,</v>

989
01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:47.820
I think for a lot of people,
a very cool realization of self sufficiency that,

990
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:53.180
that,
that uh,
the people do not experience hunger in the same way.

991
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:56.950
It becomes a very different experience.
And,
uh,

992
01:03:57.110 --> 01:04:01.020
get a part of that is you're using things like cheat day and you're using in

993
01:04:01.021 --> 01:04:02.130
some cases supplements,

994
01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:06.900
but not certainly not necessary at all to change how,

995
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.840
how your,
your,
your brain and your body,
um,

996
01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:15.090
produce and respond to hormones like Ghrelin and all sorts of other things.

997
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:20.340
And uh,
what's,
what's really cool about it,
a read.
And recently I did a,

998
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.350
I did a seven day water fast,

999
01:04:22.351 --> 01:04:25.800
so I went seven days with nothing besides water with no supplementation,

1000
01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:27.150
no electrolytes known anything.

1001
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:32.510
And because of the indirect training of the slow carb Diet and,

1002
01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:38.100
uh,
effectively readying my system for that type of experience,

1003
01:04:38.101 --> 01:04:39.750
it really wasn't terribly difficult.

1004
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:44.160
And I'm not recommending anyone do that without medical supervision,
but the,
the,

1005
01:04:44.161 --> 01:04:48.330
the body becomes a very,
very resilient.
And,
uh,

1006
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:50.460
the,
the,

1007
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:54.720
one of the questions that I get before people start things in the,

1008
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:57.000
in the four hour body,
particularly the slow carb diet,

1009
01:04:57.001 --> 01:05:01.290
is what do I eat for snacks?
And my answer,
my answer is,

1010
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.850
if you're eating enough and you should be eating enough at your meals,

1011
01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:10.130
you're not going to be hungry.
You don't need snacks.
And,
and,

1012
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:11.430
and,
um,

1013
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:16.430
and typically what people realize is that the snacking is a compulsive,

1014
01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:21.650
habitual behavior.
It's not because they are hungry,
right.
They're,
they're,

1015
01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:26.140
they're basically feeding their pancreas,
not their stomach,

1016
01:05:26.141 --> 01:05:29.140
if that makes sense.
Because their insulin response is so out of whack.

1017
01:05:29.141 --> 01:05:30.550
And once you fix that,
it's like,
oh,

1018
01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:35.110
I want to have a bowl of fill in the blank crap next to my computer because

1019
01:05:35.111 --> 01:05:38.110
that's my habit,
but I'm not actually hungry.

1020
01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.450
<v 3>Right.
And then it puts into question,</v>

1021
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:47.130
what is food for anyway.
Right.
You know,
like there,
there isn't,
you know,

1022
01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:48.053
the cool thing.

1023
01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:50.940
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
And,
and my,
uh,
you know,</v>

1024
01:05:50.941 --> 01:05:54.510
at one of the ways to modify a cheat day so that it's,
it's,

1025
01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.300
it's a more rewarding and less disgusting.

1026
01:05:57.301 --> 01:06:00.480
Although I think that that getting people to the,
Oh my God,

1027
01:06:00.481 --> 01:06:01.770
I'm so disgusted with myself.

1028
01:06:01.771 --> 01:06:04.050
Point is actually very valuable and the first few weeks,

1029
01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:07.770
but when you graduate from that,
you're like,
okay,
I've covered the,

1030
01:06:07.771 --> 01:06:09.940
I'm disgusted with myself a checkbox.

1031
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:13.430
Like I want to be more functional.
Uh,

1032
01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.990
towards the latter third of my cheat day,
uh,
you,
you,

1033
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.520
you can start to set rules for yourself such as,
you know,
the food,

1034
01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:25.790
the food either has to be really good for me or it has to be fucking delicious.

1035
01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:27.730
And the,

1036
01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:32.400
the fucking delicious part is important because people on cheat day,

1037
01:06:32.401 --> 01:06:36.630
we'll often just shovel whatever shitty food is in front of them or around them

1038
01:06:36.631 --> 01:06:41.550
right into their mall.
And it gets really gross.
So when you,
and I would say,

1039
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:45.780
you know the,
in the same way that you're looking for a high quality,

1040
01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:48.710
if you choose to eat meat and I eat meat that you,

1041
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.240
you choose to try to find high quality meat,
right?

1042
01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:53.910
So if I'm sitting in San Francisco,
I'm going to look for grass fed beef.

1043
01:06:53.911 --> 01:06:57.030
I'm going to look for so on and so forth.
Similarly,
if you're cheating,

1044
01:06:57.210 --> 01:07:00.360
you can do the same thing and you can say,
all right,
I'm going to have pasta,

1045
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.220
but I want pasta made from fresh ingredients from that,
that,
that,
that does.

1046
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:05.580
I'm going to go to,
you know,

1047
01:07:05.581 --> 01:07:08.580
flour and water and this is just a restaurant in San Francisco and I'm going to

1048
01:07:08.581 --> 01:07:12.480
get pasta there,
or I want ice cream and I want high quality ice cream.

1049
01:07:12.481 --> 01:07:16.230
I'm not just going to go to Safeway and eat five gallons of the cheapest crap I

1050
01:07:16.231 --> 01:07:20.340
can find.
You know,
I'm going to go to buy right or whatever.

1051
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:23.160
And it might,
it might be a little bit more expensive,

1052
01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:26.340
but I'm going to get higher quality raw ingredients.

1053
01:07:26.341 --> 01:07:29.910
I'm going to have cheat meals,
but I'm going to have less,
fewer

1054
01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:34.890
preservatives and artificial sweeteners and all that shit.
Um,

1055
01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.320
so there are definitely ways to make your cheat day a little more regal.

1056
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:43.200
Yeah,
that's better.
Yeah,

1057
01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:48.940
<v 3>it really is.
Then it's a real tree and a real luxury.</v>

1058
01:07:48.941 --> 01:07:50.050
But you know,

1059
01:07:50.051 --> 01:07:54.790
like I've avoided my last couple of cheat days cause it just really made me
sick.

1060
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:58.960
And you know,
um,
the foods were wearing reminds me a bit of,

1061
01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:01.600
when you go to overeaters anonymous,

1062
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:06.680
there's a very specific,
there's two sets,
kind of sex Ed.

1063
01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:10.510
Overeaters anonymous is one is called POW and one's called the Cambridge group

1064
01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:15.270
where it's just a food plan that you cannot deviate from it.

1065
01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:17.060
You just can never deviate from.

1066
01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:22.160
But this gay people a lot of freedom from the addictive properties of eating.

1067
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.390
And um,

1068
01:08:23.391 --> 01:08:26.690
so we know in a sense it reminds me of that and that like now that the food is

1069
01:08:26.691 --> 01:08:29.060
out of the way,
the assessing about food is out of the way.

1070
01:08:29.061 --> 01:08:30.860
Now I can actually like live my life,

1071
01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.490
which I think is really the wonderful thing.

1072
01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:36.540
<v 1>No,
I mean,
and that makes me,
I mean that makes my day,</v>

1073
01:08:36.541 --> 01:08:39.700
it makes my week just to hear that it's,
it's,
it's,

1074
01:08:39.701 --> 01:08:42.150
it's a liberating point for people to reach.

1075
01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:47.210
And what I've found is that a lot of behavioral,

1076
01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.950
a lot of systems of behavioral change,
uh,

1077
01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:55.440
that have existed for many decades are completely just scientifically off base.

1078
01:08:55.441 --> 01:08:56.820
They haven't really been tested.

1079
01:08:56.821 --> 01:09:01.140
So the idea that you can take someone who's accustomed to eating a horrible diet

1080
01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:06.030
and put them on a strict vegetarian diet and they're going to adhere to that,

1081
01:09:06.031 --> 01:09:09.720
it will have less than 10% success rate.
You can't start there.

1082
01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:12.060
It's very difficult.
And if you want,

1083
01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:16.410
if you want 500 out of a thousand people to succeed instead of a hundred out of

1084
01:09:16.411 --> 01:09:20.790
a thousand,
then you provide them with sort of a graduated approach.

1085
01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:22.440
And I think there's,

1086
01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:27.390
I think there is an incredible tactical application of excess,
right?

1087
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:29.940
So people will say,
well,
everything in moderation.
I'm like,
actually,

1088
01:09:29.941 --> 01:09:33.330
I don't think that humans are good at moderation.

1089
01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:38.460
So that's why it's easier to go a month without alcohol then having one drink a

1090
01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:42.540
day.
If you're an alcoholic,
it's,
I actually eat at the end.
Um,
I,
there,

1091
01:09:42.570 --> 01:09:44.190
there are many examples of this,
but my,
you know,
my,

1092
01:09:44.191 --> 01:09:49.110
my mom was cured of smoking at one point because her,
her parents,

1093
01:09:49.111 --> 01:09:52.350
and I'm not saying this is a great in general parenting approach,

1094
01:09:52.351 --> 01:09:55.740
but they said to all the siblings,
they said,
oh,

1095
01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:00.840
I found out that one of you likes to smoke.
Well,
here's a box of cigars and a,

1096
01:10:00.841 --> 01:10:03.180
you guys can have all of the cigars and when you're done,

1097
01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:04.780
then you can come upstairs and,

1098
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:11.520
and then they did not touch anything for a very,
very,
very long time.

1099
01:10:11.521 --> 01:10:14.760
And again,
not,
not recommending that very old school,

1100
01:10:14.761 --> 01:10:17.010
but in the psychologically,

1101
01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.040
the cheat day for the first two or three weeks is it is achieving something very

1102
01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:25.020
similar.
Uh,
yeah.
So I mean,
I'm,
I'm thrilled that,

1103
01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:29.000
um,
that you've been,
been with it for a few months,
obviously.
I'm always happy to,

1104
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:32.970
to answer questions.
I never get tired of talking about this stuff.
Unlike email,

1105
01:10:32.971 --> 01:10:35.010
autoresponders and all that stuff from the first book,

1106
01:10:35.011 --> 01:10:36.990
which kind of bores me to tears at this point.

1107
01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:40.470
The physiological stuff is so rewarding

1108
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.940
because it's,
it's a tangible,
visible results.
Right.
And,

1109
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:51.930
and,
and when people go on it,
I mean,
you do get immediate feedback.
Um,

1110
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:56.940
and it's,
yeah,
it's really,
really awesome.
And for those,
for those,

1111
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.420
uh,

1112
01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:02.370
this is particularly true for certain nationalities,

1113
01:11:02.371 --> 01:11:04.080
and I mean,
there's obviously genetic differences,

1114
01:11:04.081 --> 01:11:08.860
but for a lot of women out there who might get discouraged early on,
um,

1115
01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.600
part of the reason for the first say 10 to 14 that some women in particular do

1116
01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:20.571
not see a dramatic weight change on the scale is because they're increasing

1117
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:27.270
their protein intake and they're actually losing a lot of visceral fat,

1118
01:11:27.271 --> 01:11:31.970
number one.
So organ fat and number two,
putting on muscle,
uh,

1119
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.440
which is a,
which is a very positive thing and almost every case.
Yeah.
And it's,

1120
01:11:36.441 --> 01:11:41.320
yeah.
And then they start to see the,
the subcutaneous fat that,

1121
01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.970
you know,
the fat under the skin,
which is more visible in the mirror,
obviously,

1122
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:49.380
uh,
start to drop off in sort of weeks.
Uh,
two and three,

1123
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:54.240
and that's why it's so important,
uh,
I think for a lot of people to,

1124
01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:58.350
to really take stock of how they feel.
Like you noticed the impulse,

1125
01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.470
a sort of the,
uh,
the desire to,
to the,
the Ha,

1126
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:06.490
the unnecessary hunger going away to take,
to take note of those things.
Uh,

1127
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.270
and instead of looking at the scale,

1128
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:12.270
because it's such a blunt instrument and it can be very misleading.

1129
01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:13.860
So those are the

1130
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:15.103
<v 3>wait myself,</v>

1131
01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.480
I know I can see the changes in the way that my clothes are fitting differently.

1132
01:12:20.511 --> 01:12:25.511
I'm wearing much more smaller sizes and I can tell in a way that my,

1133
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:30.770
the,
the,
just the way that I look and I don't really need to see it.

1134
01:12:30.771 --> 01:12:34.700
I know that when my exercise,
while I'm exercising more,

1135
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.350
that it's definitely a much more visible.

1136
01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:42.110
But,
uh,
and also when I'm Blake,

1137
01:12:42.111 --> 01:12:46.550
they're laying off and sometimes I'll get lazy and I'll just eat like beef jerky

1138
01:12:46.551 --> 01:12:50.330
or something like that,
which is not the fastest of all this stuff in it.

1139
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:54.240
But you know that there,
there's like when I,
when I really take the time to make,

1140
01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:59.300
make my own food and stuff,
that's when I can really see a huge difference.
Um,

1141
01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.490
it's,
it's that when I get lazy,
like,

1142
01:13:01.491 --> 01:13:04.400
do you know there's like the salad dressings and stuff like that,

1143
01:13:04.401 --> 01:13:07.750
which probably have hidden sugar and that,
you know,
I,

1144
01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:11.360
I can definitely backslide there,
but not that much.
Either.

1145
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:15.680
You're not eating anything that was in breading or anything like that,
you know,

1146
01:13:15.681 --> 01:13:20.150
or like sausage with flour,
then that's not too bad.
But it can be really,

1147
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:25.250
um,
you can't,
you can actually have pretty luxurious time eating on,
on program.

1148
01:13:25.251 --> 01:13:27.350
Not even,
I'm on a cheat day.

1149
01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.080
<v 1>Oh,
definitely.
And most people,</v>

1150
01:13:29.081 --> 01:13:32.680
if I go out to a meal with almost anyone at any restaurant,

1151
01:13:32.681 --> 01:13:37.480
they never ask me about my diet because they don't realize that I'm even on a

1152
01:13:37.481 --> 01:13:40.560
diet.
Generally.
It's very,
and,

1153
01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.510
and I would say to people out there also who,

1154
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.400
who are thinking of going on any type of diet.

1155
01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:51.820
And here's the thing,
even if you're not on a diet,
you're on a diet.

1156
01:13:51.850 --> 01:13:55.270
I mean diet is really in the scientific sense,
just the,

1157
01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:59.010
the food that you habitually consumed.
So you're on a diet one or the other.
Uh,

1158
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.280
but you have to rig the game in the beginning so that you can win,
right.

1159
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:05.470
At least for the first few weeks.
And so for instance,

1160
01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.560
I would like to say that I'm a,
you know,

1161
01:14:08.561 --> 01:14:13.030
whipping up a food network worthy every meal and just,
you know,

1162
01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:15.510
slicing and dicing and it's,
you know,
it's a,

1163
01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:18.580
it's worthy of recording for posterity,
but it's not,

1164
01:14:18.581 --> 01:14:20.320
I'm lazy like everybody else.

1165
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.680
And so if you were to look in my refrigerator right now,
literally I have,

1166
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:29.400
I have single serve Guacamole and single serve black bean hummus from I think

1167
01:14:29.411 --> 01:14:31.570
Bj's or one of these discount clubs.

1168
01:14:31.770 --> 01:14:36.770
I've got like leftover chicken wrapped up in some plastic foil and a handful of

1169
01:14:37.781 --> 01:14:40.780
other things.
And then I have a few supplements that are on hand,

1170
01:14:40.781 --> 01:14:42.910
like glutamine and whatnot.
So that I do,

1171
01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:46.570
I've done no cooking today and I'm not hungry.
Uh,

1172
01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:51.760
that's totally okay.
It's totally okay.
I have,
there are other,
I,

1173
01:14:51.761 --> 01:14:56.761
there are readers who have literally I kid you not a last,

1174
01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.880
you know,
50 to a hundred pounds and the only beans that they consume,

1175
01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:02.410
and you don't have to eat a ton of beans,

1176
01:15:02.411 --> 01:15:05.290
but they only beans they've consumed or refried beans

1177
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:11.670
eight does it,
he doesn't have to be fancy.
So,
um,

1178
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.430
in any case,
I am,
uh,
I'm,
I'm thrilled that you're,

1179
01:15:15.431 --> 01:15:19.650
that you're making progress and obviously I'm happy to help anytime,
but let me,

1180
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:23.920
let me ask you on the meal side of things,
so if you had your,
your last meal,

1181
01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.410
Oh,
you know,
you're,
you're on death row.
What are you going to go out with?
What's,

1182
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:28.303
what's your last meal?

1183
01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.630
<v 3>I think I would,
I would really want them as,
uh,</v>

1184
01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:35.760
the far follower with a South San and vodka,
you know,
the,
the,

1185
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:39.030
or the petty Elebond k that's my favorite.
Um,

1186
01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:44.000
standard and vodka and cream sauce with the talks is so good.
And,
uh,

1187
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.910
so that's probably that.
And then maybe some kind of the bread thing,

1188
01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:50.883
<v 1>not,</v>

1189
01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.150
<v 3>that's so many suites I guess.
Maybe a little,
but I don't really,</v>

1190
01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:59.130
I don't know the is the duck thing,
but you know,
again,

1191
01:15:59.131 --> 01:16:02.190
it's like I don't really,
I don't crave it.
Like I used to,

1192
01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:07.191
like I used to have to have it once a day at least like pasta salad or you know,

1193
01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.340
some kind of big breakfast pasta.
Oh,
that's so,
you know,

1194
01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:15.360
breakfast offset.
But I mean,

1195
01:16:15.361 --> 01:16:20.340
it's like so weird how I just don't have an,

1196
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:24.510
I don't know why he,
I don't even care.
You know?
It's just really weird.

1197
01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:29.800
<v 1>It's crazy.
It's crazy one that,
yeah.
When that type of shift happens,
uh,</v>

1198
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:31.510
do you have a favorite curse word?

1199
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:36.430
Is there any one sort of a curse word or insulting?
You're like,
God,

1200
01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.250
I love it.
Just,
it rolls off the tongue.
This is really,

1201
01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.040
this is really a keeper for me.
It just resonates.

1202
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:46.230
<v 3>Oh fuck.
Oh fuck.</v>

1203
01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:52.060
But that's one that I think I used the mall.
We just probably,

1204
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:55.690
um,
the one that everybody uses the most.
I think

1205
01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:59.690
<v 1>it's good.
It's a very flexible word.
They know it can,
it can,
it,</v>

1206
01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:04.880
it can take many different forms.
I think that's part of why it's so useful.
Yeah.

1207
01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:09.150
<v 3>It's like positive and negative and then it can be romantic,</v>

1208
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:10.760
which is really funny.

1209
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:16.810
He actually liked the most romantic thing that you can say and

1210
01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:20.560
weird.
Like it could be really horrible thing.

1211
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:22.630
You can say I'm to put the best way to,

1212
01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:27.640
so I really love the user friendly quality of the word.

1213
01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:34.080
<v 1>Just fuck.
There's a,
there's a wonderful little book called the,
uh,</v>

1214
01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:38.220
English as a second fucking language and it talks about all of the uses of the

1215
01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:41.790
word fuck because you think about it,
it's actually very,
very particular,
right?

1216
01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:46.140
Because you can say that's,
that's a fucking incredible,

1217
01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:51.120
that's a,
but you can't say that I got,
it's in credit.
Fucking bull.
Like you,

1218
01:17:51.121 --> 01:17:55.530
there are ways,
very specific ways that you can use it or not use it.

1219
01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.150
That's unbelievable.
Fucking bold.
Nah,
it doesn't really work.
Right.
So you,
uh,

1220
01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.030
you really have to,
you've,

1221
01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.430
you've sort of developed a fluency at a certain point as a native English

1222
01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:09.750
speaker with that word.
I find the Australians are,
are uh,
really fond of it.

1223
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:13.770
Um,
but yeah,
just an observation,

1224
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:16.670
<v 3>right word.
It's my favorite.</v>

1225
01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:21.330
<v 1>Yeah,
a good one.
So if you could,
uh,
I want to be,</v>

1226
01:18:21.331 --> 01:18:24.720
I know you have a show king coming up and uh,
that,

1227
01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:28.590
that you probably want to do some prep for that.
Uh,
speaking of which,
uh,

1228
01:18:28.591 --> 01:18:29.670
just a few more questions,

1229
01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:34.671
but if you look at your best performances in the say hour before you go on

1230
01:18:36.271 --> 01:18:41.070
stage,
what are the commonalities?
Like what,
what gets you in the zone?
What,

1231
01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:43.140
what rituals or routines do you have?

1232
01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:50.180
<v 3>Usually it's just a nice meal.
Sometimes I'll have a book,</v>

1233
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:56.260
sometimes I'll just be reading backstage,
which is a really nice thing to do.
Um,

1234
01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:00.410
sometimes it's very busy,
you know,

1235
01:19:00.411 --> 01:19:03.140
you can never really predict that there is no,

1236
01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:07.820
I have to perform so much that there's no way that I can regulate that hour

1237
01:19:07.821 --> 01:19:10.550
before it.
Cause it's always a different situation,
you know,

1238
01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:15.080
different cities or different social situations,
different social setting.

1239
01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:19.580
I'm coming from something else.
So there's really no way to gauge,

1240
01:19:19.581 --> 01:19:24.050
but I like to have,
you know,
sometimes a bit of wine,
a red wine.

1241
01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:28.600
<v 1>Any,
any particular type of any particular type of red wine.</v>

1242
01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:33.110
<v 3>I like that.
Something like that.
A Shiraz,</v>

1243
01:19:33.450 --> 01:19:36.190
Shiraz probably or a Malbeck.

1244
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:37.263
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1245
01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:43.740
<v 3>Dry.
Not Sweet.
Um,
just something kind of pilot.</v>

1246
01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:49.160
That's a very hard to Harkey but flavorful but not like juice,

1247
01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:51.440
like a red,
like a grape juice,
like very,
very

1248
01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:56.000
intense swine that,
that'd be nice.

1249
01:19:56.530 --> 01:20:01.240
<v 1>If you're able to read what type of book would,
uh,
would you choose?</v>

1250
01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:06.810
<v 3>Oh,
I love biographies.
And um,</v>

1251
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.560
so I'm reading right now how to be a movie star,

1252
01:20:10.561 --> 01:20:14.510
which is like all about Elizabeth Taylor.
I think it's really fascinating.
Um,

1253
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:20.060
I love movie star biographies and the way that Hollywood was like two people

1254
01:20:21.391 --> 01:20:25.890
like Liberace and um,
Elizabeth Taylor and you know,

1255
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:30.980
these kinds of figures who were very flamboyant and symbolic at the time,

1256
01:20:32.281 --> 01:20:35.280
but led pretty tortured lives too.

1257
01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:40.350
So that can be is really interesting.
So I like that kind of stuff.

1258
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:43.480
<v 1>Do you know people who are</v>

1259
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:50.320
operating at the higher level in Hollywood who are not tortured?

1260
01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:55.120
It just seems like it's a tortured town in a lot of ways,
but are there,

1261
01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.400
are there people who come to mind who are very successful in some capacity in

1262
01:21:00.401 --> 01:21:04.270
Hollywood who are not tortured and if so,
why are they not tortured?

1263
01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.170
<v 3>How about,
I don't know.</v>

1264
01:21:07.171 --> 01:21:12.130
I think that there is a high level a of people who are touching the Gen.

1265
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:17.210
There's also a lot of uh,
uh,
when,

1266
01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:17.900
you know,

1267
01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:22.530
a lot of people who have done taking taken measures to help them sounds like

1268
01:21:22.531 --> 01:21:27.531
through whether it's through sobriety or some kind of program or even some kind

1269
01:21:28.741 --> 01:21:32.710
of a religion that makes things a little bit better.
Um,

1270
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:35.430
but I do see happiness out there.
You know,

1271
01:21:35.431 --> 01:21:40.200
I do see a lot of joy in regards to your work,
but you know,

1272
01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:45.180
sometimes the more brilliant somebody is,
the more crazy they are too.

1273
01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:50.690
So we don't really have a really good handle on people is realize.

1274
01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:55.050
Um,
the most well adjusted person,

1275
01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:58.600
the nicest and well that was just an end famous and successful,
uh,

1276
01:21:58.730 --> 01:22:01.700
was probably Dave Grohl from the foo fighters.

1277
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:07.510
He is the most sunny individual I've ever met and so generous and times and

1278
01:22:09.481 --> 01:22:12.780
really one of the most fantastic artists all time.

1279
01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:15.770
<v 1>Oh,
so incredible.
Yeah.
Just phenomenal.</v>

1280
01:22:15.771 --> 01:22:19.190
What do you think that,
that,
that uh,

1281
01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.820
why do you think he is that way?
Because of course,

1282
01:22:22.821 --> 01:22:25.680
I mean he's seen some dark things,
no doubt,

1283
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:30.060
<v 3>very dark things.
Uh,
I think he allows himself to just be,
you know,</v>

1284
01:22:30.061 --> 01:22:34.230
and I think that part of it is also drummers tend to be very positive people and

1285
01:22:34.231 --> 01:22:36.480
I think it is the physical activity.

1286
01:22:36.481 --> 01:22:41.220
I think you did that high intensity interval training that is drumming.

1287
01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:46.850
<v 1>Yeah.
That's a great observation.
I never really thought of it that way,
but that,</v>

1288
01:22:46.851 --> 01:22:50.870
that actually makes perfect sense to me.
Yeah.
Interesting.
I need to get

1289
01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.180
<v 3>positive.
Yeah.
Did a drum set.</v>

1290
01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.910
<v 1>I need to,
why have some hand drums?
I got to tell you,</v>

1291
01:22:55.911 --> 01:23:00.560
it's like the difference between a day of even 10 minutes of drumming in a day

1292
01:23:00.561 --> 01:23:05.320
of no drumming is very,
very,
um,
stark.
I mean it's,
it is,

1293
01:23:05.321 --> 01:23:09.400
I think the physical movement and using the hands for something other than

1294
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:13.420
pecking at a keyboard.
A for sure.
So,
yeah.

1295
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:17.200
So on that note,
I'll let you,
I'll let you get off the phone,

1296
01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:21.280
but where can people find more from you,

1297
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:23.770
learn more about you,
where can people check out what you're up to?

1298
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:29.890
<v 3>Well,
my website is Margaret cho.com,
and that's where all my tour dates are.</v>

1299
01:23:29.891 --> 01:23:34.490
I have some blog,
blog stuff up there.
I had a kind of everything,

1300
01:23:34.491 --> 01:23:38.950
photos and you know,
just to like kind of an overview of what I do.

1301
01:23:38.951 --> 01:23:39.890
And then I have,
um,

1302
01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:44.260
I'm on Twitter at Margaret Cho and I'm on Facebook at Margaret Cho and,

1303
01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:49.650
um,
that's,
I do a bit of Instagram.
It's Margaret Underscore Cho.
Uh,

1304
01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:53.920
but yeah,
that's,
that's all my stuff and I'm very active,
uh,

1305
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:58.630
everywhere there,
you know,
I really enjoyed that too.
So,
um,
you know,

1306
01:23:58.930 --> 01:23:59.770
I get a lot,

1307
01:23:59.930 --> 01:24:04.180
it's funny how much easier life is when you can verify people

1308
01:24:04.650 --> 01:24:07.410
<v 1>on Twitter.
Yeah,
definitely.</v>

1309
01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:10.960
<v 3>Oh,
you know,
it's like,
oh yeah,
it really is that versus like,</v>

1310
01:24:10.961 --> 01:24:15.340
it's like you could really see them,
so makes life much easier.

1311
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:20.630
<v 1>Yeah,
it certainly does.
Thank you so much for making the time.</v>

1312
01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:23.330
Hopefully next time you're in ss,
uh,

1313
01:24:23.331 --> 01:24:26.270
we can share a glass or two or three of wine.

1314
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:30.720
<v 3>I would love to test to a four hour body,
which is,
you know,
you,</v>

1315
01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:35.760
you will see me and I think that you will be really excited because you from my

1316
01:24:36.121 --> 01:24:38.410
photographs from like stuff that I've done,

1317
01:24:38.411 --> 01:24:42.430
you then really tell the difference and I haven't had like a photo shoot or

1318
01:24:42.431 --> 01:24:43.031
anything,

1319
01:24:43.031 --> 01:24:48.031
so I look forward to that so that you can see what things have been done.

1320
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:51.100
You know,
it's also given me a lot,
it made me feel a lot younger too,

1321
01:24:51.101 --> 01:24:52.240
which I appreciate.

1322
01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.190
<v 1>Awesome.
Yeah,
my pleasure.
Thank you for putting the words into action.</v>

1323
01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:58.500
I just write it,
write a bunch of stuff down on a couple of pages,

1324
01:24:58.501 --> 01:25:02.400
but it really makes my entire week and uh,

1325
01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:07.640
we can decide whether it's going to be a cheat meal or a or standard compliant

1326
01:25:07.641 --> 01:25:10.410
slow carb meal.
But either way we'd love to,

1327
01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:15.030
we'd love to join you for a bite or drink.
And uh,
thank you so much for the time.

1328
