00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.620
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.
I know.

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.880
What else are you posting a question?

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.590
I'm a cybernetic organism.

5
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.280
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by teeter.</v>

6
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.390
I am so thrilled to have connected with these guys because I've used teeter

7
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.460
products for many,
many years.

8
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:36.900
I've traveled around the country and the world with teeter products and I'm

9
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:41.901
sitting about 15 feet in my home from one of their inversion tables and we're

10
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:44.580
going to talk more about all of that.

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.720
One of my rituals is hanging and I should say not really that it's a maintenance

12
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:52.500
and performance program.
I hang not just in the morning potentially,

13
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:55.560
but particularly after a day of bearing weight,

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.670
whether that includes weight training and Jersey Gregorich world record holder

15
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:04.290
insists on this type of inversion therapy after training or just wearing heavy

16
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:09.000
backpack around a few minutes.
It goes a long way towards better sleep.

17
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.270
In my case,
less back pain,
neck pain,
leg pain.

18
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.370
It's not a panacea obviously,

19
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.930
but inversion therapy which uses gravity and your own body weight to decompress

20
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:20.160
the spinal relief pressure.

21
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.160
On the discs and surrounding nerves seems to help with a whole slew of

22
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.380
conditions and just as a general maintenance program,

23
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:33.000
it's one of my favorite things to do.
So what to say about that teeter?

24
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:37.320
Why teeter teeter is the best known name in inversion table since 1981 more than

25
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:40.440
3 million people have put their trust in teeter teeters.

26
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:44.760
Also the only inversion table brand that has been both safety certified by

27
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:48.420
underwriters laboratories.
That's a UL for you.
People in that industry,

28
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:53.220
you will recognize it and registered with the FDA as a class one medical device

29
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.750
and they're giving a very special offer just to you guys,
my listeners,

30
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.630
for a limited time,

31
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.350
you can get the teeter inversion table with bonus accessories,

32
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.300
which I have a bunch of again in the room next to me and a free pair of gravity

33
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:09.780
boots so that you can invert at home or take the boots with you to the gym.

34
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.830
So these gravity boots,

35
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.250
I have three separate pairs of gravity boots bought with my own monies in three

36
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:18.810
different cities that I've had for a very,

37
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:21.120
very long time because I don't want to travel with them necessarily.

38
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.150
They look kind of like ski boots,
but without the foot portion,

39
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.870
and they hook you upside down so you can take them really anywhere you want to

40
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:29.370
go to get this deal,

41
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.400
which is a savings of over $148 it's very specific,

42
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:39.411

130
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.990
<v 1>Hello,
and thank you.
I'm super excited to be here.
You know,
this is,
this is our,</v>

131
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.520

It's a very long home in a way for us.
It is.
It is.

132
00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:59.521
And you are partially to blame slash credit for me having a podcast in the first

133
00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:01.421
place,

134
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:06.421
because I recall when you interviewed me for girl on Guy Podcast in San

135
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:09.880
Francisco,
uh,

136
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.880
at my place and I had so much fun speaking with you and fielding some fantastic

137
00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:22.760
questions,
one of which I'm going to bring up and then we'll,
we'll backpedal.

138
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.850
Okay.
But this one,
the question will not be surprising to you,

139
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.050
I don't think,
and I'm going to ask you to bring it up,
but the,
uh,

140
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.080
the conversation that we had in part contributed to me deciding to take a break

141
00:08:37.571 --> 00:08:38.351
from writing books,

142
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:43.330
which had completely burned me out and in turn helped birth the show.

143
00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:48.010
So thank you for helping to send me on this path because it's become one of the

144
00:08:48.011 --> 00:08:52.390
most gratifying and fascinating things I could possibly imagine doing.

145
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.190
So thank you for that.
That's so thrilling to and really,

146
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.150
<v 4>really gratifying.
Um,
uh,
yeah,
I mean that's a,
it's amazing.</v>

147
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:04.700
I think podcasts are wonderful and terrible beast,

148
00:09:04.701 --> 00:09:09.270
but like really satisfying even even when they're like punishingly difficult to

149
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:12.480
manage,
they're still so satisfying.
So I'm really happy.

150
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:16.170
I'm happy that you're enjoying it and you have,
uh,

151
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.250
we're not going to get into this right now,
although we can you have a,

152
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.340
a book titled Self Inflicted Wounds,
subtitle,

153
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:25.440
heartwarming tales of epic humiliation.

154
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:31.260
And can you maybe repeat or,

155
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:36.330
or even paraphrase the question that you would always ask guests on your show?

156
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.720
Oh,
absolutely.
I mean,
th th that came,

157
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:42.480
that the name for that book came from this part of my show,

158
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.360
self inflicted wounds,
which is what,
you know,

159
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.370
tell me a story about something that's gone wrong in your life that's your own

160
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:54.180
fault.
Like a,
you know,
you can't blame anyone else,
you know,
not your,
not your ex,

161
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.570
not the bullies in your school,
not the man,
you know,
you did it to yourself.

162
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.650
And it was,
it was,

163
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.670
it was really a way of initiating a conversation about risk and failure because

164
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:03.630
I feel like,
um,

165
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:08.430
people see people who are successful and assume that a part of that success or

166
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:10.650
the reason that the successes that they haven't made any mistakes and they

167
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:11.161
haven't failed,

168
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:14.760
that they've got a charmed life in some way or are they figure some kind of

169
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:17.280
formula out.
And you know,
the,
the,

170
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:21.210
the most successful people are people who not,
don't just manage risk,

171
00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:25.980
but engage in risk and,
and,
and court failure actively.

172
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.230
Um,
and I,
so I always love to,
you know,

173
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.070
have people listening see that some of that they admire and that they think is

174
00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:34.590
really accomplished is really shit the bed

175
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.900
at some point in their lives maybe multiple times.
Because I just think it's,

176
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:40.770
it's instructive.

177
00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:45.060
I think people don't start because they're afraid they're going to fail.
And,
uh,

178
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.900
and,
and there's just no way around,
you know,
the,

179
00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:51.060
the path to success is through failure.
You just can't get around it.

180
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.460
So there are so many different directions I could go with this and I want to,

181
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.420
to go way back as a,

182
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.020
maybe like sort of a montage flashback that we could have as a visual overlay as

183
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:06.540
you're,
as you're saying some of these things.
Uh,

184
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.930
and that is to your dad.

185
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.920
And I've in the process of doing homework,
uh,

186
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.150
read about your dad's favorite saying or,

187
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.530
or question that he would ask.
And I was hoping you could,

188
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.250
you could explain this or share this with people who are listening because I

189
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:30.810
think it's kind of amazing.
Yeah.

190
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.610
Um,
well,
I was raised,
you know,
my parents divorced when I was 10,
and,
um,

191
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.900
and my father,
my parents,
you know,
I always joke that like,
you know,

192
00:11:39.901 --> 00:11:42.300
it's only rich people that can afford to fight about custody.

193
00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:42.721
You know what I mean?

194
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:46.380
Poor people just do whatever they have to do to like manage.
And my parents,

195
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.830
neither of them could really afford to kids and also neither of them could

196
00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:54.100
afford to pay child support.
So each of them just took one

197
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.790
<v 5>of us.
And,
um,
I was older,
so I went with my father and he was like,
you know,</v>

198
00:11:57.791 --> 00:11:59.230
which,
which one can wash itself.

199
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.160
And then that was the one that he took it with me.
Um,

200
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.080
and he,
you know,
my father is the king of the,
like the,

201
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.570
the very terse and pointed motivational speech.
Um,

202
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.450
so I would leave for school in the morning.
And,
uh,
we lived in,

203
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:17.980
I grew up in San Francisco and,
uh,

204
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:21.000
and at one point we lived upstairs and a Victoria.

205
00:12:21.001 --> 00:12:25.060
And so I'd go down these very steep stairs and she'd lean over the railing and

206
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:29.200
he'd go,
whose day is it?
I'd have to say,
it's my day.
And then he'd say,

207
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:31.870
what are you going to do?
And I'd have to say,
grab it by the balls.

208
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.880
I didn't want,
are you going to do what I'd have to say and twist and twist.

209
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.140
Um,
but,
you know,
it's funny because it was like my dad was just,

210
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.320
he was such a great dad.
He was a really engaged guy.
But you know,

211
00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:52.240
I mean it was a,
c was a single father and relatively young.
So maybe there,

212
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:57.130
there were a few boundaries of propriety that he danced along.
But,
um,

213
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:02.140
but he just encouraged me,
you know,
um,
it just encouraged me to be aggressive,

214
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:06.280
you know,
he was one of those,
I think it's very hard for,
for single parents,

215
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:10.420
period.
And I think it's very hard for fathers and daughters because,
you know,

216
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.080
I just think if you're a dad,
the world just looks like,
you know,

217
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:17.320
a field of broken glass and potholes and molten lava.

218
00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:20.110
And then you've got this little kitten and you're just like so terrified to put

219
00:13:20.111 --> 00:13:22.720
the kitten down.
So either big grip very tightly.

220
00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:27.030
Or in my father's case they throw you up in the air,
you know,

221
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.400
and expect that they've given you the skills to land.
And that was definitely

222
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:35.070
<v 1>strategy.
Now you mentioned the,
the,</v>

223
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:35.861
the divorce,

224
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:40.861
which I have read was amicable and it ended up,

225
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:46.190
ended up resulting in you going with your father and you have one sibling,

226
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:51.350
a younger sister,
and she stayed,
she stayed with your mom.
What was that hard or,

227
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:56.380
or did it not even occur to you to be hard because it just is what it was or

228
00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:59.070
was,
were,
was that difficult and,

229
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.980
and did you have constant contact or what was the dynamic like?

230
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.850
<v 5>You know,
it's interesting because I think it was more the second for me.</v>

231
00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:11.510
Like it just was what was happening.
And,
and I,

232
00:14:11.511 --> 00:14:13.060
I don't ever remember,

233
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.960
I don't ever remember struggling in any grand way with the way that things were

234
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:21.580
going.
I,
you know,
and look,
maybe that's my nature.

235
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:22.030
I do my,

236
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:27.030
I know my parents worked very hard to be loving and available to both of us and

237
00:14:27.671 --> 00:14:31.360
I had like lots of access to my mother and I talked to her all the time and I

238
00:14:31.361 --> 00:14:35.350
call her for advice and when she got to kind of be the fun mom or the advice
mom,

239
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:35.471
you know,

240
00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:37.990
she didn't have to discipline me and she could just be the person who was there

241
00:14:37.991 --> 00:14:41.620
when I needed like emotional support.
Um,
I,
I do know that like,

242
00:14:41.621 --> 00:14:42.910
one of the things that resulted in,

243
00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:47.290
at least when we were younger was my sister and I,
but we weren't super close.

244
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.590
But,
but I,
you know,
lots of siblings aren't super close in their kids,

245
00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:51.950
whether they're living in the same house or not.

246
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:55.430
They're fighting and they're competitive.
But I,
but as we got older,

247
00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.400
I became like wildly protective of my sister.
And,
um,
and,
uh,

248
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.700
like my relationship with her is so intensely loving and affectionate now.

249
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.180
And I don't know,
maybe if we lived in the same house driving each other,

250
00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:14.150
you know,
nuts all the time.
We wouldn't be as close as we are now.
I mean,

251
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.330
we spent the formative years of our lives living in different houses,

252
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:21.440
but we like the same stuff and,
and we care about the same things and,
and our,

253
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.350
our connections really deep.
So I,
you know,
I can't,

254
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.650
I don't ever remember kind of sitting up at night feeling any kind of agony

255
00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:29.210
about the fact that my parents were divorcing.

256
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.490
I did watch them try very hard to stay together.

257
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.370
Like I do remember that when they got a divorce,
I was like,

258
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:38.620
they really gave it a shot.
You know,
I could see that.
They really like,
you know,

259
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:38.990
I just,

260
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.850
they would break up and they'd get back together and they'd break up and they

261
00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:41.960
get back together and I'd ride,

262
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.540
I'd like walking on them and they'd be making out on the couch.
I was like,

263
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:46.520
they are really giving us to go.
So

264
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.070
when they decide it was over,
I was like,
okay.
Yeah,
I don't,
I don't ever,

265
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.270
I don't ever remember it being like a point of agony.
He just thinks changed,

266
00:15:56.271 --> 00:15:57.104
you know,
and,

267
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:02.390
and maybe as a result I tolerate change better than I would otherwise.

268
00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:04.340
Or maybe I even crave change.
I don't know.

269
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:11.010
<v 2>Has it been your demeanor to generally look at things through a positive lens</v>

270
00:16:12.341 --> 00:16:17.200
like that where you would frame what other people might try to frame is a very

271
00:16:17.201 --> 00:16:20.800
difficult agonizing experience into something that was,

272
00:16:20.801 --> 00:16:24.260
or at least as framed as something positive that you benefited from or,

273
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.220
or have you had more of the time,

274
00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:29.830
a tendency to frame things negatively?

275
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.580
<v 5>That's a really good question and I think about that a lot cause I think that
my,</v>

276
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.960
my attitude or my point of view about things is half biochemistry and,

277
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:45.720
and half,
uh,
like child rearing.
Um,
my father is just like a,

278
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.170
like a preternaturally optimistic person.
Like it's,
it's extraordinary.

279
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.390
I always make this joke that if my father's house was on fire,

280
00:16:51.391 --> 00:16:55.140
he would like get a stick and marshmallows.
Like he just cannot be deterred.

281
00:16:55.141 --> 00:16:57.930
You don't worry if you can't,
I've never seen it.
You know,
he's just never down.

282
00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.670
And I,
and so I think that I inherited that and maybe it's attitude.
No,

283
00:17:02.671 --> 00:17:07.500
I think I just probably make the chemicals in my brain that kind of keep me

284
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.260
typically upbeat,
you know what I mean?
And,

285
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.780
and I think it's important because I think a lot of times when people,

286
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:14.250
when people are,

287
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.430
or if they have a hard time seeing the world positively or they're struggling

288
00:17:17.431 --> 00:17:19.740
with depression,
people like we just need to look at it a different way.

289
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.680
But I think that I probably just make more of the chemicals that enabled me to,

290
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.560
to be optimistic.
I just,
you know,
I've never,
I've never really been depressed,

291
00:17:28.561 --> 00:17:33.100
but my father also was just a walk it off that he just did not feel sorry for
me.

292
00:17:33.101 --> 00:17:35.910
And you know,
and I was not allowed to feel sorry for myself.

293
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.980
And so when things went wrong,

294
00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.910
and this is definitely sustained until I was an adult,
I just,

295
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.460
I just get up and I keep going.
And that was because of,
you know,

296
00:17:44.461 --> 00:17:47.820
my father was raised,
he lost,
his father wouldn't,
he was very,
very young.

297
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.500
He's raised by a single mother,
you know,

298
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:55.040
like tumble down Pittsburgh with the very few opportunities for a black man at

299
00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:58.740
that time.
And he just never felt sorry for himself.
He was just like,
look,

300
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.340
I can complain about the situation or I could just keep moving.
And,
and I,
and I,

301
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:06.360
so I think I've been nurtured in that way as well,
which is the world is unfair.

302
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.670
Uh,
they're,
you know,
it's shot through with assholes.

303
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.450
I still have to get up in the morning and make a life for myself.
Um,

304
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.090
and so it's probably a combination of those two things.

305
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.720
<v 2>Were you,</v>

306
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.710
would you say good at following his advice of not only grabbing life by the

307
00:18:20.711 --> 00:18:23.680
balls but twisting,
which is a whole new level?

308
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.350
Those are two really like,
yeah,

309
00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.950
like you can gently grab balls.

310
00:18:29.951 --> 00:18:34.010
You can't really gently grab and twist balls that's hosting.
Is that,

311
00:18:34.011 --> 00:18:37.840
that's an elevated,
yes.
That's embarrassed form of aggression.

312
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.010
<v 5>Yeah.
I mean,
I don't know,
like it's hard to say like,</v>

313
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:48.170
oh,
I a nail on it,
you know,
that's not how I feel.

314
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.710
But I do think that like that attitude of like,
you know,

315
00:18:51.711 --> 00:18:54.680
just kind of go and I wrote about it a lot about it in my book.

316
00:18:54.681 --> 00:18:57.930
Like the idea that like my parents raised me to be brave and,

317
00:18:57.931 --> 00:19:00.200
and in some ways maybe to brave,

318
00:19:00.201 --> 00:19:05.000
but the result has been like a relentlessness.
Um,

319
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.900
and in the pursuit of the things that are important to me.

320
00:19:08.901 --> 00:19:10.420
And that's not the same as like I'm winning.

321
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:11.960
I don't really think about things that way,

322
00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:16.400
but it's just if I want to do something that I do it and I don't really worry

323
00:19:16.401 --> 00:19:18.320
too much about whether it's going to go my way,

324
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.240
not because I expect it to go my way,

325
00:19:20.241 --> 00:19:24.560
but because it doesn't matter if it goes my way because it's the engagement

326
00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.740
that's most meaningful to me.
It's the effort.

327
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.520
<v 2>I got it.
So the bay engagement,
you mean sort of the dog [inaudible] persistence?</v>

328
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.720
Yeah.
That you're developing

329
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.690
<v 5>the engagement in,
in,
in your,
in your personal goals.</v>

330
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:40.800
Like if I want to do something,
whatever,
I don't know,

331
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:42.210
let's pick something really innocuous.
Like,

332
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:45.540
if I want to like hike everyday for a month or if I want to start meditating,

333
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.290
if I don't dial it,
it's not as important to me as,
as,

334
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.560
as not looking back and saying to myself,
Oh,
I should have done it.
Like it's,

335
00:19:52.561 --> 00:19:56.130
it's the,
it's the doing for me.
That is the reward.

336
00:19:56.131 --> 00:19:58.590
And then sometimes things go away and sometimes they don't.

337
00:19:58.591 --> 00:20:03.591
But the thing I find most upsetting his regret.

338
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.911
Yeah.
Because that's,

339
00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:09.230
that's something I have control over in the sense of like if you didn't do it,

340
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.740
you have nobody to blame but yourself,
you know.

341
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.390
<v 2>Right.
You can always attempt.
You can't predetermine</v>

342
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.680
<v 5>yes,
yes.
Yeah.
You can't predetermine the outcome,</v>

343
00:20:18.681 --> 00:20:21.670
but you can predetermine the effort because the effort is,

344
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:26.420
is the only thing that you own.
You can't own results.
You can only own,

345
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.390
you can only own initiative.

346
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.990
<v 2>Do you recall any,
you mentioned your dad being a,
walk it off dad,</v>

347
00:20:32.991 --> 00:20:36.970
I want to explore that a little bit.
Do you remember any,
uh,

348
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.860
while you were still under his watch or not,
uh,

349
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.770
early disappointments or self inflicted wounds and,
and,

350
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.030
and how your dad responded or,

351
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.170
<v 4>yeah.
Um,
well this isn't,
this is,</v>

352
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.020
this isn't exactly a good example of a disappointment,
but it's,

353
00:20:54.021 --> 00:20:58.030
it's a perfect example of his attitude.
I am,
I was going to camp,
I was,

354
00:20:58.031 --> 00:21:02.470
I was going to camp,
I must have been about eight or nine,

355
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.290
nine,
I'll say nine.
And,
um,
that was going to like,
you know,
Jujitsu camp.
Uh,

356
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.450
and this was still a,

357
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.710
this was still during the free range parenting era where you just got up in the

358
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.230
morning and you left at home and you came back later and that stuff was your

359
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:18.910
responsibility.
You see eight or nine.
And then Jujitsu camp,
I was,

360
00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.590
I was really into martial arts and I was a kid.

361
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:24.280
So it's making me think of the movie.
Hannah,
we're,

362
00:21:24.281 --> 00:21:29.020
this Eric Bana trades his daughter to be a super killer.
I wish I was that good.

363
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:35.040
All right.
First thing that was not,
what am I strong?
Stronger.
Um,
but,
uh,
but as I,

364
00:21:35.041 --> 00:21:37.630
as I pointed out,
it wasn't the result that was important.
It was just the effort.

365
00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:41.160
So I would ride my bike to camp every day,
um,

366
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:45.040
and right at home and it was a good,
you know,
it was a good ride.

367
00:21:45.041 --> 00:21:48.490
It's like a five mile right to camp.
And,
um,

368
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.030
I fell one day coming down like a pill,
you know,
kind of,
I dunno if you know,

369
00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.920
this is,
this was like no helmets.
This was a long time ago.
I'm very old,
like,

370
00:21:56.921 --> 00:22:00.580
you don't know how much,
just like Willy Nilly your backpack on and you know,

371
00:22:00.581 --> 00:22:02.320
you're not signaling.
And,
uh,

372
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:07.150
I fell and I hurt my arm very badly.
And,
uh,

373
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.350
I went,
I can't remember,
but I contacted my dad and he's like,
oh,

374
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.120
but I'm not going to come get you.
I can't leave work.

375
00:22:13.121 --> 00:22:17.320
You have to get home on your own.
Um,
and,
and I,

376
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.950
so I rode my bike back from camp,
you know,
like another three,

377
00:22:20.951 --> 00:22:24.990
four miles and my arm was broken.
It was definitely broken.
I broken my arm.
Um,

378
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.930
and I got home and my dad was like,
ah,
your arms not broken.
I mean,

379
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:32.210
you see this needs to stop complaining.
You know,
it was a sore.

380
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.010
The next day I woke up,
it was like black and swollen and I had to like,
you know,

381
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.740
like lifted off the pillow and he finally took me to the doctor and it was

382
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:42.310
absolutely like,
come,
come up,
fracture the bone,
hadn't come through the skin,

383
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:47.260
but it was a multiple fracture.
Um,
but my,
I,
I think at the time it felt cruel,

384
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.160
but I think my dad's larger attitude was like,

385
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.220
no one is coming to save you.
You have to save yourself.

386
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.940
You have to find a way every single day to save yourself.
And,

387
00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.470
and as a result,
I think that,
you know,
as an adult,

388
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.690
it just don't spend a lot of time like a anguishing over what other,

389
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.660
what's been done to me,
you know?
Um,
and I was fine.

390
00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:13.960
I did ride my bike home and my arm was broken,
but I still got home on my bike.

391
00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:16.330
And then the next I got a super dope cast.

392
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.720
I think we just raised like these,
I mean I know I sound like everybody's mom,

393
00:23:22.721 --> 00:23:24.760
but I just feel like we're just,

394
00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:29.790
we're curating young people's experiences so aggressively nowadays that they

395
00:23:29.921 --> 00:23:34.780
just don't have any way to discover things about themselves.
They don't develop,

396
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.530
not just self sufficiency but like a curiosity about themselves and their

397
00:23:38.531 --> 00:23:42.240
abilities and what they can tolerate and what they can do if left alone cause

398
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:46.040
they're just never left alone.
And I was just,
I had

399
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.260
<v 5>a lot of time alone when I was a kid and,
and uh,</v>

400
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.980
and I still really like being alone as an adult.

401
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.011
<v 2>Right.</v>

402
00:23:53.011 --> 00:23:58.011
And also it strikes me that if you're so protective of your child and your

403
00:23:58.261 --> 00:24:03.261
child's ego that you effectively disallow them to fail or engage with risk that

404
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.630
the,
the delta,

405
00:24:06.631 --> 00:24:11.631
the difference between their actual competencies and abilities for self

406
00:24:12.871 --> 00:24:17.871
preservation and their overinflated sense of their capabilities is actually a

407
00:24:18.091 --> 00:24:19.230
huge disservice.

408
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.900
<v 5>Absolutely.
And,
and their sense of like,</v>

409
00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:28.690
you need to know what it feels like to fail and then what,
what,

410
00:24:28.691 --> 00:24:32.930
what comes next?
BecauseW is what comes next is what did I learn?

411
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.470
How can I just,
how do I pivot?
How do I move forward?
And just,

412
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:39.950
most people don't develop those mental skills.
They just,

413
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.720
they're crushed by failure.
And it's,
it's just an unavoidable element of life.

414
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.020
And,
and,
you know,

415
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.840
there's so many people that I know who's out of real.
I mean,
you know,

416
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.230
genuine love parents.
Like I just don't want to see my kid in pain,
but like,

417
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:58.040
how are you going to,
how do people move through the,
the,
the planet?

418
00:24:58.041 --> 00:25:00.920
How do the people move through life without pain?
That's,
that's a,
that's a,

419
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.370
that's a false theory.
It can't be done.
It just cannot be done.

420
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.420
And so people just become incapacitated the first minute they hit a,

421
00:25:08.421 --> 00:25:11.440
any kind of a speed bump in their lives and,
uh,

422
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.320
they just don't know how they don't,
how to navigate disappointment.
Uh,

423
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.870
whereas I was just deeply disappointed throughout my childhood,

424
00:25:17.871 --> 00:25:22.040
so I know exactly what it feels like.
I guess like a maximum,
like,

425
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:23.990
oh that didn't go my way.
Moving on,
you know.

426
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.310
<v 2>Well yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's,</v>

427
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.690
it makes me conjure in my mind the image of this,

428
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.080
this increasing sort of amplitude of pain consequence over your life from like

429
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:42.370
childhood to adulthood where the consequences grow potentially greater and

430
00:25:42.371 --> 00:25:44.140
greater.
We're in the beginning,
like when you're a child,

431
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.310
you're basically engaging with,
with pain,
and I shouldn't say Pam,

432
00:25:48.311 --> 00:25:51.710
but failure in many cases,
not all cases but many cases where you're,

433
00:25:51.711 --> 00:25:55.810
you're effectively in one of those like birthday party,
blow up sumo suits,

434
00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.470
do you what I'm talking about.
And it's like all right you so you can,

435
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.800
you can sort of engage with failure that way and if you get knocked on your ass

436
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:07.090
it doesn't,
there aren't really real consequences.
And then you get,

437
00:26:07.091 --> 00:26:08.950
you get to high school,
college and it's like okay,

438
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.980
you're out of the sumo suit but you've got big kind of blow up boxing gloves on

439
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.260
and huge piece of headgear.

440
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:20.020
And then you then when you get out into some aspects of the real world,

441
00:26:20.021 --> 00:26:24.390
it's just a bare knuckle brawl.
And so if you haven't had the chance,

442
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.850
permanent consequences.
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.

443
00:26:27.851 --> 00:26:31.210
So if you haven't had the chance to get wailed in the face with the sumo suit,

444
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.500
you're not going to be ready for the bloat,
boxing gloves and the head gear.

445
00:26:35.501 --> 00:26:36.460
And if you,
certainly,

446
00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:38.500
if you don't get whacked in the face a few times doing that,

447
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.640
you're just going to be crippled when you get out into the real world and get

448
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.040
know,
drop kicked

449
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.930
<v 5>in the face by,
by someone who doesn't follow the same rules,
uh,
and,
and,
and,</v>

450
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:51.330
and crippled in that way.
You know,

451
00:26:51.331 --> 00:26:54.840
and I know you've interacted with people like this in that way where you know,

452
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:58.450
when something bad happens there,
their whole monologue.
It's like,
why me?
Like,

453
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.230
why did this happen to me?
You don't understand what I'm going through.

454
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:03.330
It's like you're not at,
you're not special.

455
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:07.200
Everybody is experiencing the same thing.
Everybody,

456
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.380
everybody's heart as being broken.
Everybody isn't getting the job they want it.

457
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.630
Everybody isn't going to sleep with what the hot person they want.

458
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:16.320
Everybody is experiencing this same failures.
He's same injuries,

459
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:19.500
but you just don't know how to tolerate them.
You are not special.

460
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.770
And that's not the same as saying you have potential for being special,
you know,

461
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.160
you do.
There's nothing anybody's doing now that hasn't already been done at,

462
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:28.260
that won't be done in the future.
And I,
those,

463
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.770
those kinds of personalities drive me crazy because they just,
uh,
there's,

464
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.480
there's so stuck and boring.

465
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.061
What did,

466
00:27:39.061 --> 00:27:43.620
what did you think you were going to be when you grew up?

467
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:47.370
When you were in high school or college?
Oh God.

468
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.920
In high school.
I,

469
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.350
it's so interesting cause I was like super academic and I think I was thought

470
00:27:55.351 --> 00:27:57.290
I'd be an attorney.
I was really,
I was like,
you know,

471
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.720
I was like a big activist and organized and marched and did all that stuff.

472
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:02.990
And I was,
I was at like really like in the,
you know,

473
00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.670
the outing club and I rock climbed and all that stuff.

474
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:08.310
So I thought I was going to be like an environmental lawyer,
um,

475
00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:12.570
either an environmental lawyer and environmental engineer.
And then I got to,

476
00:28:12.571 --> 00:28:14.670
and I want it,
I really wanted to go to a school that was like,

477
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.440
like really grounded in relationship to nature.
So I was applying to like,

478
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:23.130
you know,
Marlboro College and read and,

479
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.890
and Bard and these schools that were like out in the woods.

480
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.070
And I ended up going to Dartmouth,
which is,
you know,
in,

481
00:28:31.071 --> 00:28:34.620
in New Hampshire and has this big land grant around it.
And uh,

482
00:28:34.621 --> 00:28:36.930
and I thought I would be an environmental engineer and I think I just took like

483
00:28:36.931 --> 00:28:40.740
the first prerequisite math course for engineering and I was like,
yeah,
okay.

484
00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:45.030
It's not just not going to be,
this is not fake.
I always loved,

485
00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:47.480
I always loved science,
but um,

486
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.420
I'm just a person of letters I guess and I didn't have the appetite for it.

487
00:28:51.421 --> 00:28:52.620
It wasn't as glamorous as I thought.

488
00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:54.220
I think when I took my first engineering I did,

489
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.250
I think I've got through the math class,
like did fine,

490
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:59.150
like I've applied myself and I got a good grade.
And then I went into my,
like,

491
00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.370
you know,

492
00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:04.370
an introduction to engineering three and it was about like building like a fecal

493
00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:06.960
matter treatment plant.
And I was like,

494
00:29:06.961 --> 00:29:09.300
this isn't feeling like hugging trees at all,
man.

495
00:29:09.301 --> 00:29:11.580
We're just talking about poop all day.
Um,

496
00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.520
I lost my appetite for that.
Really.

497
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.350
So then what,
did you just have this great access,

498
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:26.540
existential angst or did you sort of shift to something else immediately

499
00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:28.494
following that?

500
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.540
I was always doing kind of like performing things on the side.
Like I,

501
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:38.630
I went to a high school that had a performing arts kind of like magnet or like a

502
00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:40.500
pocket school within the,
the,

503
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.800
the regular school called the j u d mcateer school of the arts.

504
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:48.190
So I was kind of doing my regular class work and then doing like Improv and

505
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:49.660
stuff and sketch on the side.

506
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:52.960
And then I went to Dartmouth and I was doing some of the same stuff.
Like,

507
00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:56.730
you know,
I wasn't one of those in infernal,
you know,
Ivy Leagues,

508
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.780
acapella groups that have been popularized since then by shows like glee.
And,
uh,

509
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.690
so it was always kind of doing that as a hobby because it just never felt like a

510
00:30:04.691 --> 00:30:08.410
real job.
Um,
and I graduated and I was,

511
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.560
I was living in San Francisco and I was working for a conservation organization

512
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.640
that was like a killer.
It was like,
I got like my dream job.
It was a,

513
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:20.470
a group that purchased like blighted urban land and turned it in at the parks

514
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:23.350
and underserved neighborhoods that didn't have any outdoor space for kids to

515
00:30:23.351 --> 00:30:26.440
play.
And you know,
it was like the mission was great because it was,

516
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.660
it wasn't just kind of conservation of contraries and sake.

517
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:33.040
It was like conservation focused on engaging underserved communities.

518
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:38.041
And it was the grooviest and I was just miserable and I just miserable because I

519
00:30:38.861 --> 00:30:42.670
just,
I didn't know.
It was a really good question.
You know,
it was like,

520
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.040
why,
why,
if I have my dream job in the city of my birth,

521
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.790
uh,
why am I so unhappy?
And I'm,

522
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:54.390
and I just did a lot of soul searching and I realized it was because I,

523
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.800
for the first time in my life,
I wasn't doing anything created.

524
00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.270
I wasn't performing.
And so,
um,
I,

525
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:05.800
I'm,
I'm a problem.
I'm a problem solver.
I'm a matrix builder.
I was like,
well,

526
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:09.910
how can I solve this problem right now?
And,
um,

527
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.330
I looked at all the ways that I could get on stage and stand up.

528
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:17.730
Comedy was the only thing I didn't need to know anyone for have a,
an agent or a,

529
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.520
or a band or connections,
I could just do stand up right away.

530
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:26.290
And so I started studying it and watching the precursor to comedy central,

531
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:30.280
which was this network called ha of very short lift network,
uh,

532
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:33.670
and make taking notes.
And um,
then,
you know,

533
00:31:33.671 --> 00:31:36.700
after a while just kind of screwed up the courage to go and do an open mic.

534
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.700
And then that was,
it was just transformational.
I was like,
oh,

535
00:31:39.701 --> 00:31:40.990
this is what I want to do with my life.

536
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:46.720
<v 2>Was the thinking immediately on how to turn performance into a career or did</v>

537
00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:49.600
you,

538
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.800
did you expect that you would continue doing your job and doing stand up on the

539
00:31:53.801 --> 00:31:54.220
side?

540
00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:59.080
Like was it a career move from when you first built the Matrix and decided on

541
00:31:59.081 --> 00:32:01.900
stand up or was it,
you know what,
this is going to be great.

542
00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:06.790
I'll continue doing this job and I'll scratch my creative performance itch on

543
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:08.110
the weekends with open mics.

544
00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:09.683
<v 5>Yeah,
it,</v>

545
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.560
it's so funny because like I don't think I even realized that standup comedy was

546
00:32:13.561 --> 00:32:15.330
a job.
Um,
you know,

547
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.830
was like a really bookish kid and I know a lot of guys will have these stories

548
00:32:19.831 --> 00:32:23.880
about how they grew up,
you know,
with like Red Fox,
you know,

549
00:32:23.881 --> 00:32:27.900
on vine all that they listened to hundreds of times or you know,
following,

550
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:32.550
you know,
Lenny Bruce or you know,
these idols or bill Hicks.
I just,
I didn't like,

551
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.460
I remember seeing live on the sunset strip when I was a kid,

552
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.460
but like I just saw Richard Pryor was an alien.
Like,

553
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:42.590
I don't even think like a magical person who came down to do this thing.
I just,

554
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.780
the idea that that was like a vocation was just not in my head.

555
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.640
So,
um,

556
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:54.680
I remember seeing Stanhope at Dartmouth when I was like a sophomore and coming

557
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:57.710
out of a show and being like,
like,
do you like,

558
00:32:57.711 --> 00:33:00.890
do people know that this like you can go and have this feeling for an hour.

559
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:01.910
Like this is insanity.

560
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.270
Like I just remember like everything hurt from laughing my face and my stomach

561
00:33:05.271 --> 00:33:09.940
and I just never experienced live comedy before.
So it,
it,
it,
it,
it,

562
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.560
it didn't dove tail into like a job at first.

563
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:14.960
It was just I something I was going to do for fun.

564
00:33:14.961 --> 00:33:18.340
I kept my day job 100% and I kept her a long time.
I,

565
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:23.570
I also didn't want to be like one of these kind of like miserable,
you know,

566
00:33:23.571 --> 00:33:26.740
sweating standups or like gripping their,
you know,

567
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.120
kind of inky notebook and sleeping on their buddy's couch.
You know,

568
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:30.590
like I was in a relationship and,

569
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.740
and I had a job that paid great and I could make flyers for my shows at work was

570
00:33:34.741 --> 00:33:37.510
like embezzling,
you know,
a copy paper,
uh,
and,

571
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.810
and push pins as well as aggressively as I could.
So,
uh,

572
00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:45.740
I was,
I was,
and I still am of the opinion that like,

573
00:33:45.741 --> 00:33:50.150
you should absolutely keep your day job,
uh,
which I know is not the most popular.

574
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.970
<v 2>I'm a Barista.
I'm over the same opinion.
Absolutely.
Yeah.</v>

575
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:57.670
<v 5>Yeah.
I think,
I think it gives you a freedom.
People think it traps them,</v>

576
00:33:57.671 --> 00:34:00.580
but I think it gives you this incredible freedom to just pursue art for Art's

577
00:34:00.581 --> 00:34:03.460
sake and led a job,
pay for it,
and,

578
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:07.020
and do it for so long that everything you do is just for joy and,

579
00:34:07.021 --> 00:34:11.320
and it changes the way that you,
it changes the way that you approached your art.

580
00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.640
Um,
you know,
I would like get up and I'd go to work at like seven and I,
you know,

581
00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.040
six or seven in the morning and I work until four and then I jumped in the car

582
00:34:18.041 --> 00:34:19.930
and I'd drive two hours to Sacramento,
do you know,

583
00:34:19.931 --> 00:34:23.590
set and I come back at midnight,
I do it all over again,
but I could do that.

584
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.530
And it was just purely about the experience of performing and not about whether

585
00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:27.430
I was getting paid or not.

586
00:34:27.431 --> 00:34:30.010
So I did that for a long time before I finally quit my job.

587
00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.510
<v 2>Now,
for those people who don't know the geography of,</v>

588
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.720
of Northern California where I lived for 17 years,

589
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.340
and coincidentally the s the high school that you went to,

590
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:45.320
is that now the Ruth Asawa school on O'shaughnessy?
Um,

591
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.930
<v 5>yeah.
But up to that they are at the let kind of like</v>

592
00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:53.310
<v 2>the excess of [inaudible] slash Glen Canyon.
Exactly.</v>

593
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:58.670
I literally lived for five or six years about a quarter mile from that school.

594
00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.850
It was right there.

595
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.430
<v 5>Not a big city.
Even though I think you,
when you feel it,
when you live there,</v>

596
00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.260
it feels like it.
But it's like it's an intimate right

597
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.770
<v 2>place.
And,</v>

598
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
and given the density of San Francisco and the fact that it is,

599
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.600
well,
I'm not going to go.

600
00:35:18.601 --> 00:35:21.000
So I don't know if people would consider it a comedy town,

601
00:35:21.001 --> 00:35:22.470
but there certainly clubs.
And

602
00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.670
why would you go all the way to Sacramento?

603
00:35:26.671 --> 00:35:29.400
Sacramento is not for those people who don't know the area.

604
00:35:29.401 --> 00:35:33.090
It's not like a 10 minute drive away from San Francisco.
It's far,

605
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.770
<v 5>always had.
San Francisco has always had a reputation for a comedy town.</v>

606
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:41.850
Like the big comedy towns in the United States,
uh,

607
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.470
from comedians perspectives are San Francisco,
Chicago,
Boston,
and New York.

608
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.180
La is not,
I mean,
La is a company town,
but it's not a comedy town.
Um,

609
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.480
and San Francisco was always one of those places that people saw as like a real

610
00:35:54.481 --> 00:35:57.150
crucible for kind of original comedy.
You know,

611
00:35:57.151 --> 00:36:01.380
it was like where the alts comedy movement happened.
Um,

612
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.161
and you know,

613
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:05.460
when Mark Marin and Janeane Garofalo and these kinds of alternative comics,

614
00:36:05.461 --> 00:36:10.440
Brian Plus Sane,
uh,
came out of,
and uh,
it was a comedy town,

615
00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:14.700
but when I started doing comedy,
it was like the beginning of the contraction of,

616
00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.320
of the comedy economy.

617
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.580
So there was a period of time when there were just hundreds of comedy clubs

618
00:36:20.581 --> 00:36:22.740
everywhere and you could make a living doing standup.

619
00:36:22.741 --> 00:36:25.110
He could kind of go from place to place and you could get a Gig and you could

620
00:36:25.111 --> 00:36:25.590
get paid.

621
00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:30.330
And I started doing standup at the beginning of the end of the comedy bubble.

622
00:36:30.331 --> 00:36:31.740
So when I started doing standup,

623
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.770
the club community was contracting and some of the big clubs in San Francisco

624
00:36:35.771 --> 00:36:38.700
are closing.
I think at one point they were maybe like five or six active clubs.

625
00:36:38.701 --> 00:36:41.610
And then by the time I was working consistently,
there were only two.

626
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.210
And there was just a lot of competition for stage time.

627
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.220
And to get good at comedy,

628
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:52.260
you can't just do it like once a weekend,
you know,
you need to be on stage.

629
00:36:52.261 --> 00:36:57.060
Like every night I,
it's,
it's,
it's like being a high diver or you know what,
it's,

630
00:36:57.061 --> 00:37:00.270
it's literally like Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hours and you're not going to get

631
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:02.730
10,000 hours of standup hanging out in San Francisco.

632
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.630
Like you have to go everywhere and take every single opportunity to be on stage

633
00:37:06.631 --> 00:37:10.650
that you can get.
So,
um,
I would drive to Sacramento,
I would drive to Fresno,

634
00:37:10.651 --> 00:37:12.330
I would do these terrible,
you know,

635
00:37:12.331 --> 00:37:17.331
like bar shows and in Menlo Park and Oh God,

636
00:37:18.121 --> 00:37:22.950
I don't even remember some of the places.
Um,
for t Cupertino and Martinez,

637
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:26.250
I mean you would just go anywhere that you could get six minutes on stage and

638
00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:28.860
then other people trying to get those same six minutes.

639
00:37:28.861 --> 00:37:30.180
So it was really competitive.

640
00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:33.030
I mean the co the culture where I think was pretty supportive,

641
00:37:33.031 --> 00:37:34.860
like comedians were supportive of each other,
but it just,

642
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.370
there just wasn't enough stage time so that you just do anything and go anywhere

643
00:37:38.371 --> 00:37:39.204
to get it.

644
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:44.290
So what to ask about this comedy contraction?

645
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.023
Uh,

646
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.110
we won't spend too much time on this because I don't want to take us completely

647
00:37:49.111 --> 00:37:53.070
off the reservation.
But
what happened?
I mean,

648
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:55.920
it was like beanie babies,
like people were really the beanie babies.
It's like,

649
00:37:55.921 --> 00:37:59.850
no call.
It isn't cool anymore.
And then all the clubs close.

650
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:03.840
W W was it just a macroeconomic downturn?
I mean,
what happened?
I think,

651
00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:07.260
I think it was,
there were three factors.
One factor was just,

652
00:38:07.261 --> 00:38:09.320
there was just a glut.
They're just,
you know,
it,
it,

653
00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:14.380
it for a live comedy in some ways in the seventies and eighties was kind of a

654
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.510
new thing.
And it's not like people had been doing stand up prior to that.

655
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.710
But the proliferation of standup comedians in the,
in,

656
00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:28.130
in the culture really started happening at that time.
And,
uh,

657
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.530
what that was fueled by,
I honestly don't know,
like,

658
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:34.170
why were there so many more comics doing standup in the 70s and eighties maybe

659
00:38:34.171 --> 00:38:38.060
because that was the period where there were these superstar comics,
um,

660
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.550
that were kind of,
you know,

661
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:44.260
I'm trying to think of who would have been really popular besides like Bill

662
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.310
Hicks.
And,
um,
I could see that though,
maybe it's analogous to like celebrity,

663
00:38:48.311 --> 00:38:50.440
the celebrity chefs in the last 15 years.

664
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.510
And part of the reason why there so many more celebrity chefs because they've

665
00:38:54.511 --> 00:38:56.630
started to be celebrity chefs on television.
Right?

666
00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.910
And so if you think about that in terms of comedy,
what you,

667
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.960
what you see is,
oh,
that's a job.
I can make money at that.

668
00:39:04.961 --> 00:39:07.720
Whereas people weren't really encountering live comedy if they didn't go to a

669
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:09.820
live comedy show.
Uh,

670
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:14.560
and so you start to see these guys on TV and you think,
and honestly,

671
00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:17.810
when the,
when ha the precursor,
um,

672
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:22.930
to comedy central started,
they needed,

673
00:39:22.931 --> 00:39:25.840
like they needed comics and they needed opportunities.
They needed clubs,

674
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:30.280
they needed,
they needed content.
It was a 24 hour network.
So there were,

675
00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.030
there were some good comedians on that station and there was some really,
uh,

676
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:38.410
some really shit
really bad.
Um,

677
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:43.330
and so a lot of people watching probably thought,
well,
I can do that,

678
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.650
you know?
Um,
I also think about guys like,
you know,

679
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.100
Sam Kinison and Andrew dice clay.

680
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:50.800
There was kind of like a golden era in that time and we were seeing all those

681
00:39:50.801 --> 00:39:54.300
people on TV.
Then we were seeing a lot of people that were like really subpar.

682
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:55.300
And a lot of people are thinking,
well,

683
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.930
if that guy can write five crappy minutes about an airplane,
I can.

684
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.550
Then you coupled that with this explosion in comedy clubs,

685
00:40:03.551 --> 00:40:05.950
which were a relatively new phenomenon.
I mean,

686
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:07.900
when Joan Rivers was doing stand up,

687
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:12.240
she was doing standup and in strip clubs there were very few comedy clubs and

688
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.650
comedy was kind of a part of a Vaudeville approach.
So you'd,

689
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:17.440
you'd hire a singer and then you'd hire a comment,
but there wasn't a,

690
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.340
there weren't places dedicated to comedy.
So these comedy clubs opened.

691
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:25.090
It was really easy to wait way to make money because comics,

692
00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.040
comics weren't that expensive.
And you know,
you had a two drink minimum,

693
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:33.220
people would come and they would get wasted.
You have huge margins on your boots.

694
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.630
So all these comedy clubs started proliferating and then they're just was just

695
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.080
peak.
There was just Pete clubs that it became unsustainable.

696
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:45.490
So they started to contract because of,
of market saturation.

697
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:50.670
The economy started to contract in the 80s and people could watch comedy on TV.

698
00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:56.580
The proliferation of comedy on television affected people going out to see it in

699
00:40:56.681 --> 00:41:00.910
a club.
So they were like kind of those three factors.
Oh,

700
00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:06.070
all kind of intersecting.
Um,
and when it happened it was really aggressive.

701
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:06.461
Like I said,

702
00:41:06.461 --> 00:41:09.160
I think there were maybe like five or six comedy clubs in San Francisco when I

703
00:41:09.161 --> 00:41:12.190
was in high school.
And then by the time I was doing standup in my twenties,

704
00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:16.600
there were two.
Wow.
So you,
you,
you would do and you know,

705
00:41:16.601 --> 00:41:19.540
and they were attracting like,
you know,
like high end,
like peak talent.

706
00:41:19.541 --> 00:41:21.970
So for example,
this club still there,

707
00:41:21.971 --> 00:41:25.970
it's called the punchline lunch a few times.
And uh,

708
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.220
there was the punchline and there was cobs.
And those are still the,
the,

709
00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.170
the only two clubs.

710
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.530
And maybe there's some minor clubs that have sprung up since then,
but you know,

711
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.090
they would book these big headliners.

712
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:37.820
So the only time you could go up if you are an amateur,

713
00:41:37.821 --> 00:41:42.470
like a young comic was on a Sunday or a Wednesday and there'd be 20 other guys

714
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:47.060
trying to get on it,
you know,
as well.
And it would be wildly competitive.
Um,

715
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.440
and you wouldn't be getting paid,
you know,
and,

716
00:41:49.441 --> 00:41:54.350
and then you'd be super anxious because you'd be like hoping,

717
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.370
okay,

718
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:58.220
I need to go up and I need to destroy it because I want this club owner to hire

719
00:41:58.221 --> 00:42:01.040
me again so I can't go up and I can't work out.
I can't,

720
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.720
I can't fail in front of this guy because he won't see this.
Like,

721
00:42:05.721 --> 00:42:07.670
um,
you know,
when you watch like a,

722
00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:11.510
an Olympic skater during practice and they're falling,
I mean that's,

723
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.600
that's what practices,

724
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:17.030
four practices for like finding your weak spots and reinforcing them.

725
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.330
But when you're up in front of the comedy club on our new,

726
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:22.040
it's been six months that you've been trying to get all of this club and you

727
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:26.390
finally get five minutes.
It's got to be a monster,
five minutes and,

728
00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:30.080
and so,
um,
there was just no way to improve.

729
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.960
If you can't improve,
you can't just going to say,
how do you,

730
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.940
how do you get in your rough drafts?
And I mean,

731
00:42:34.941 --> 00:42:39.830
how do you work on the material drive to Martinez?
Oh,

732
00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:42.860
I see.
I see.
So you'd write work out the kinks with

733
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:49.510
the crew at the such and such casino and God knows where Turlock fubars or

734
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:55.620
rooster t feathers or you know,
one of these other places.
Yeah.
Um,
and,
and it,

735
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.190
there was this,
um,
you know,

736
00:42:58.191 --> 00:43:03.191
it's different than being an author or an athlete or even a musician because

737
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.600
there's an autonomy to comedy.
Absolutely.
But you need other people.

738
00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.860
You,
you can't do it.
It can't just sit around your place practicing.

739
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.220
You know what I mean?
Like with music,
you know,
it's,
you know,

740
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.560
if you're sharp or flat,
you know,
if you hit all the notes,
you know,

741
00:43:18.561 --> 00:43:19.820
if the tempo is right.
But with comedy,

742
00:43:19.821 --> 00:43:22.590
the only way it works is in front of an audience.
Um,

743
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:26.690
and so you're very dependent on,
on stage time and that's,
it's everything.

744
00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:28.310
When you're a young comic has stage time.

745
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.780
Do you remember your early content or what kind of,

746
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:36.410
what was your approach early on?
Uh,
do,
do you remember the first,

747
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:39.590
and maybe if I in a different way to approach this,
you can take it,

748
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:40.640
answer it however you like.

749
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.000
Do you remember the first time that you bombed or the f what is your first

750
00:43:44.001 --> 00:43:47.600
memory that comes to mind of bombing?
Oh God,

751
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:52.400
I bombed so many times.
It's just hit all seeps together into an inky blackness.

752
00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:57.440
Um,
any comic,
any comic,
it tells you that ever bond is lying.
And,
and,
and again,

753
00:43:57.441 --> 00:43:59.910
the only way to get funny as to bomb you.
No one ever,

754
00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:03.380
no one ever gets funnier after they kill.
You know,
they just walk on that,

755
00:44:03.381 --> 00:44:05.390
follow that bitches and they dropped the bike.
You know what I mean?

756
00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.970
They go off and do shots of their friends.
I mean you really need to,

757
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.130
you really need to bomb and bomb.
Hard to get funny.
Um,

758
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.230
I remember doing this one show.
Oh God.
So there was,

759
00:44:15.231 --> 00:44:20.100
there was an open mic in a laundromat,
um,
in like,

760
00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:25.310
like south and market around the police station there.
So what maybe like,

761
00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:30.050
you know,
eighth a mission or something like that for San Francisco.
Uh,

762
00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.250
I think it was called brainwash.
Think the,
the

763
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.430
<v 4>place was called brainwash and they would have this open mic in the back of this</v>

764
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.180
laundromat and comics.
No,
you know,
with these open mics,

765
00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:40.380
with these local open mics at,

766
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:43.980
typically there are no actual audience members in the audience.

767
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:47.340
It is just a room full of comedians waiting for you to be done so that they can

768
00:44:47.341 --> 00:44:51.120
try on their material.
You know,
look,
all of them looking at their notebooks,

769
00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:54.580
not listening,
not laughing,
and you're just kind of trying to gut it out and,
and,

770
00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:57.000
and pause where you think the laughter might occur if you were in front of

771
00:44:57.001 --> 00:45:01.560
actual human beings.
And,
um,
I just did,
I sit a set where I just,

772
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:06.490
I did not get one laugh and I remember that,
well,

773
00:45:06.491 --> 00:45:10.540
not even like,
not even like a cursory titter and I remember just size.

774
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:14.910
It's just like really like,
like just a wall of silence.
And I got off.

775
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:18.390
I was even thinking about it right now.
It's so funny to me,

776
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:21.330
like I called a friend or I talked to a girlfriend,
I,
I was like,
oh my God.

777
00:45:21.331 --> 00:45:24.900
Like I couldn't even call that Yvette said,
I don't know what that was,

778
00:45:24.901 --> 00:45:29.430
but it was so funny to me that I didn't get a laugh.
Like I,
it was,

779
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:31.140
it,
there was this,

780
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:36.830
there was this like bulletproofness that I got from that set that just made me

781
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:39.720
impervious to anything ever going wrong in my,

782
00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:44.550
in my life or career again and at every like,
even when I'm talking about it now,

783
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.790
it's like there's a huge smile on my face because it was so funny how,

784
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.980
how little,
how little I was able to elicit that of that audience.
Um,
but,

785
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:57.000
but it made it,
it made me,
it just made me so mentally strong.

786
00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:02.090
Was that the immediate response that you had had or were you in the middle of

787
00:46:02.191 --> 00:46:06.120
the set when you're like in the back of your mind thinking,
wow,

788
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.650
no one is laughing.
Was there,
did you go from like Penn,
it,

789
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:13.800
was it like the reverse of the five stages of grief?
Like what,

790
00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.640
or did you just go straight to like,
yeah,
mother fuckers,
this is great.

791
00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.280
Like I've just accepted,

792
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:22.560
this is going to make a great story of however many years from that on Tim

793
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.490
Ferriss's podcast.
Well,
one thing comedians love is,
is agony.

794
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:30.090
I mean it's way we dine out on it is definitely like our stock and trade.

795
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:33.900
So a comedian very quickly,
uh,
transitions from,
Oh my God,

796
00:46:33.901 --> 00:46:35.400
this is the worst night of my life too.
Oh my God,

797
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:39.520
this is going to make a great story that happens almost instantaneously.
Um,
so,

798
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:42.750
so we,
we have a little bit of a,
we have some armor and in that regard,

799
00:46:42.751 --> 00:46:44.440
because you know,
you could just,

800
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.520
we could wake up like naked and shivering on the side of the road with like no

801
00:46:47.521 --> 00:46:48.990
money and no phone and you know,

802
00:46:48.991 --> 00:46:51.040
and not speak the local language and you'd be thinking,
okay,

803
00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:54.360
well if I live this is going to make a killer story.
Uh,

804
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:59.070
so I think in the moment I just thought I had watched a couple of other people

805
00:46:59.071 --> 00:47:03.480
go up and not do very well either.
I was prepared for it not going my way.

806
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.540
And I just thought,
I'm just,

807
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:10.380
and I think also there's a discipline to comedy that if you're not a community

808
00:47:10.381 --> 00:47:13.800
you can't understand,
which is that you've got to get up and do your set.

809
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.110
There is,
there is no,

810
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:19.410
you don't get to tap out like tapping out as tapping out as true failure.

811
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.120
You know,
if you,
if you went up and you've had a bad set,

812
00:47:22.121 --> 00:47:24.600
well you just need to write new jokes,
but if you go up and you give up,

813
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:30.010
that's true.
Failure for a comedian.
Um,
and,
and there,
there are some really

814
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.650
<v 5>famous examples of this online.
Um,</v>

815
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.020
I don't know if you know the comedian bill burr,
but I,

816
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:39.820
so I interviewed Belper about a year and a half ago and I played the video which

817
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:42.790
he had never seen.
Reclaimed has never seen is some real,

818
00:47:42.791 --> 00:47:46.360
he has still has some psychic,
he has some,
he has some trauma.
He has.
Can you,

819
00:47:46.361 --> 00:47:50.200
for people who don't know the story,
can you please describe it cause it's just

820
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.060
amazing,
right?
It's insane.
So he was,

821
00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:56.830
he was doing like one of those big like radio,

822
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.190
you know those radio station concerts like the jingle ball or whatever.

823
00:48:00.191 --> 00:48:01.780
And I don't remember,
it was called the weenie roast.

824
00:48:01.781 --> 00:48:02.740
I think it was the weenie roast.

825
00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:06.880
That's what's one of the shows at like some local station k rock eight 97 point

826
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:09.730
rock a rock,
you know,
like one of those shows and it's like,
you know,

827
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:11.800
I don't know wheezers too cool of a band.

828
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.600
It would be like Nickelback and you know,

829
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.810
some other band that sounds like nickel back and then nobody,

830
00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:21.520
man you'd never heard of anyway.
And,
but they paid.
Uh,
they,
they,

831
00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:23.260
I don't know why people still do this,
but you know,

832
00:48:23.261 --> 00:48:24.940
if you're a comic and someone offers you money,
you take it.

833
00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:28.420
So they would hire a comic to kind of warm up the crowd,
you know,

834
00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:31.270
early in the day.
And you know,
no one,

835
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.810
no one pays to see Nickleback and then wants to sit through 15 minutes of

836
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:35.471
standup.
You know,

837
00:48:35.471 --> 00:48:38.740
everyone's drunk and on frogs and they're not even facing forward.

838
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:41.110
You know what I mean?
It's just like the work,
like there's nothing,

839
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:45.010
the only thing worse than performing in front of an outdoor audience is

840
00:48:45.011 --> 00:48:47.580
performing in front of people who are eating.
Yeah.
Yeah.

841
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:52.830
Because this was like a tailgate at like 11:00 AM or 1:00 PM or something.

842
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:55.960
Yeah,
everybody's been,
you know,

843
00:48:55.961 --> 00:49:00.280
everybody like busted out there like you know their marijuana brownie recipe for

844
00:49:00.281 --> 00:49:02.320
the year.
They're all by completely looped,
you know,

845
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:04.960
like one of their eyes is completely dilated and the other one is like falling

846
00:49:04.961 --> 00:49:07.900
out of their head.
Nobody cares about your jokes about your mom and your family.

847
00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:12.040
So it was just like could not muster compassionate.
They tried.

848
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:17.280
So he starts doing stand up and he just immediately starts getting booed and

849
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.420
it's just this dislike,
this title wave of,
of,

850
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.720
of disdain.

851
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:27.430
And he knows if he doesn't finish he will not get paid.

852
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:32.020
But it's not like,
it's not like,
like silence you could tolerate.
Right.

853
00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:36.100
But like people are screaming at him to get off stage and he,

854
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:38.350
he makes it very clear to the audience.

855
00:49:38.351 --> 00:49:39.850
You have to watch it cause I'll never be able to do it justice.

856
00:49:39.851 --> 00:49:43.360
But he makes it very clear to the audience that he is not leaving the stage

857
00:49:43.361 --> 00:49:46.690
until he does his 10 minutes,
that he does not care how they feel about him.

858
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:51.470
And he's,
and he's counting down the minutes every minute.
He's like,

859
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:56.650
not admit it.
You fucking fuck.
He says living really outrageous.

860
00:49:56.651 --> 00:49:59.500
Like,
I don't care.
Mother gets cancer,
the center of her asshole.

861
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:05.720
So it's,
it's,
it's,
so,
um,
it's,

862
00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:10.210
it's just a demonstration of tenacity.
You know,
he,
he later,

863
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:14.260
you know,
he was embarrassed by it,
but every comedian understands,

864
00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:16.390
you know,
this kind of,

865
00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:21.190
this kind of blood battle that you sometimes have with an audience where you

866
00:50:21.191 --> 00:50:21.911
know,
you're not,

867
00:50:21.911 --> 00:50:24.490
they're not going to scare you and they're not going to drive you away.

868
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:27.710
You're going to deliver the material that you were hired to deliver.

869
00:50:27.711 --> 00:50:30.980
You're going to make your money and then you're going to go off and spend it on

870
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:34.610
light beer and chicken wings.
But,
uh,
but no one is,
you will not be deterred.

871
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:35.930
And so,
um,

872
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:39.200
so I think because you understand that as a comedian very early on in your

873
00:50:39.201 --> 00:50:44.150
career,
no matter what happens on stage,
uh,
you know,
I,
I will,

874
00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:47.810
I will not be moved.
So I just,
I had material to do and I did it.

875
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:51.450
And I think I remember Ryan thinking almost immediately welcome.

876
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:52.161
I'm not going to any last.

877
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:54.630
So I'm just gonna kind of like listen to the set and see what it feels like,

878
00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:58.230
see what the words feel like,
see what might play in front of actual people.
But,

879
00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:00.170
but it started to get really delicious.

880
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:02.480
And I think if you watched the bill burr video,

881
00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:04.760
you'll also see that he starts to really enjoy it.

882
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:09.790
It starts to be like this kind of like savory masochism towards the end where he

883
00:51:09.891 --> 00:51:14.240
just,
he's so powerful in his,
in his,
in his lack of caring,
you know what I mean?

884
00:51:14.241 --> 00:51:18.230
Like,
and,
and,
uh,
and I,

885
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:19.640
you watch it and it's,

886
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:24.230
it is to be studied because he goes from kind of anguish to rage.

887
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:29.180
This kind of delightful detachment by the end of the set.
Uh,
and I've seen it,

888
00:51:29.181 --> 00:51:32.270
I've seen some other guys do similar stuff and it's always really fun to watch.

889
00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.020
<v 1>So a couple of,</v>

890
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:38.490
a couple of things that I want to use as teasers for people who should watch

891
00:51:38.491 --> 00:51:41.580
this video.
I think,
I think it wasn't Phil.
I'm almost a hundred percent positive.

892
00:51:41.581 --> 00:51:42.420
It was in Philadelphia.

893
00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:46.140
<v 5>I don't either that or Jersey but yeah,</v>

894
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:50.880
<v 1>I think it was Philadelphia because he started ridiculing rocky and he said your</v>

895
00:51:50.881 --> 00:51:55.881
hero is a fictional person and just tearing into them and he basically for the,

896
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:58.050
for half of his set,

897
00:51:58.051 --> 00:52:01.710
just decided to abandon his material and just attack these people in the town.

898
00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:06.390
And a way is a no,
no.
Generally no.
No.
Generally,

899
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.490
<v 5>uh,
probably like if people hate you,
like you know,
there's,</v>

900
00:52:10.491 --> 00:52:12.560
I mean there were like these unwritten rules of comedy and one of them is like

901
00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:14.480
you don't,
if some of the people in the audience,
hey,

902
00:52:14.481 --> 00:52:19.340
you like don't turn all of them against you.
Yeah.
And this is just a sidebar,

903
00:52:19.341 --> 00:52:21.860
but don't forget what you were going to say.
There's another very famous video,

904
00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:26.150
very famous.
And it happened at the punchline in San Francisco where there's a,

905
00:52:26.151 --> 00:52:26.790
Ha there's a guy playing,

906
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:31.790
he's a good guitar comic and a guy's heckling him and uh,

907
00:52:31.971 --> 00:52:35.030
it's Kinda just a combative back and forth but nothing too extreme.

908
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:39.700
But then the guy gets up and he comes towards the AH,
the stage or you know,

909
00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:43.310
whatever to defend himself or the girl is with something like that and the guy

910
00:52:43.311 --> 00:52:45.890
just hauls off and hits him in the head with a gun.

911
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.590
<v 1>Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Not Funny.
It's tragic.</v>

912
00:52:50.591 --> 00:52:52.740
But Jesus Christ,
you have any left.

913
00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:55.810
<v 5>What happens is up until that beat,</v>

914
00:52:55.811 --> 00:53:00.811
the whole audience has been on the comedian side against this guy and it is a,

915
00:53:01.121 --> 00:53:05.460
it is a hairpin turn from them being like yeah,
shut up.
Cause it got,
because the,

916
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:06.640
you know the comics like hey you know,

917
00:53:06.641 --> 00:53:09.520
people can enjoy the show cause you're talking keep,
you know,
keep it down.

918
00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:13.750
And then he hits this guy in the whole audience just turns on him just like

919
00:53:13.751 --> 00:53:14.890
instantaneous,
like

920
00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:20.050
Frankenstein's monster mob just to pitch forks come flying out.
And so the,

921
00:53:20.051 --> 00:53:23.290
one of the unwritten rules of comedy is that you know,
you,
you just don't,

922
00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:26.160
you want to try to at all costs,
avoid turning everybody against

923
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.360
<v 4>you,
which so so bill broke a bunch of rules but,
but he just,
he,
he never gave up,</v>

924
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:32.210
you know,
which I think it becomes this,
you know,

925
00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.220
it's like the Rudy moment at the end of the movie.
Like,
man,
that sucked.

926
00:53:35.221 --> 00:53:40.190
But you sort of set in there and he got a standing of wall.

927
00:53:40.191 --> 00:53:41.220
I mean every reserve standing,

928
00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:45.920
but he got massive applause from the audience at the end,
which is just

929
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:48.480
like,
what the fuck?

930
00:53:48.481 --> 00:53:52.440
Like it didn't even fit into like any mental sharistics of comedy that they

931
00:53:52.441 --> 00:53:57.210
could expect.
It was freight prison that was straight prison yard dynamics.
Right?

932
00:53:57.211 --> 00:53:58.400
Like nobody know

933
00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.670
how to fight.
Right.
Just like the yard,
nobody backing down,

934
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.580
nobody's backing down.
And he just,
you know,
I think they,

935
00:54:08.581 --> 00:54:11.520
there was like a thousand of them to want it for probably like 10,000 of them to

936
00:54:11.521 --> 00:54:14.970
one of him.
And he just did not back down.
He got,

937
00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.980
he got the slow with Spec clap at the end of God.

938
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.530
So I wasn't going to go to heckling,
but why not?
Since we're already here,

939
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.680
do you have any memorable heckling stores?

940
00:54:25.681 --> 00:54:30.360
Did you recall the first time you got heckled?
God,
yeah,

941
00:54:30.361 --> 00:54:34.290
I mean again,
I mean I started doing standup like 25 years ago.

942
00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:38.970
So at this point like all the sets of just kind of blended,
but um,

943
00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:41.520
and heckling can be lots of different things.

944
00:54:41.521 --> 00:54:44.730
It doesn't always have to be like the conventional kind of use suck.

945
00:54:44.731 --> 00:54:49.731
Haeckel I one I one time where this woman and this kind of dovetails perfectly

946
00:54:52.141 --> 00:54:53.880
with the old,
like don't turn the audience against you.

947
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:57.180
Where this woman was talking to me,

948
00:54:57.181 --> 00:55:00.880
she was sitting in the front row and she was talking to me the entire show,

949
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.010
just loud enough that I could hear her but not really loud enough so the

950
00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:07.050
audience could hear her except for the people right around her.

951
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:11.940
And it was driving me crazy.
That's awful.
It was like a B in my ear.

952
00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:14.130
And as a result,
I just seemed insane.

953
00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:18.730
This topic to yell at this person that no one could hear.

954
00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:24.900
It wasn't very effective echo because she just completely derailed my show and I

955
00:55:24.901 --> 00:55:26.040
just seem like a Dick because I was,

956
00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:28.770
you're like shut up lady and but no one could hear what she was saying.

957
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:30.680
Nice Lady.

958
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:35.080
And it really,
I mean it was,

959
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.830
I remember that I really went off the rails last night and I generally have a

960
00:55:37.831 --> 00:55:41.040
rule with hecklers that unless they're really disruptive to the entire room,

961
00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:44.370
I just never addressed them.
Because what you do is again,

962
00:55:44.371 --> 00:55:48.200
you've derail a show for 500 or a thousand people to deal with one person and,

963
00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:48.530
and,

964
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:51.540
and everyone's never gonna really understand what's going on unless that person

965
00:55:51.541 --> 00:55:52.680
is so loud that they are,

966
00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:56.430
that they're affected everybody else's enjoyment of the night.
Um,

967
00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:01.080
but sometimes the affection hecklers are the worst because cause they don't,

968
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:05.580
you know,
typically hecklers just want to be a part of the show.
And so,
you know,

969
00:56:05.581 --> 00:56:07.290
they say something is slammed them a little bit,

970
00:56:07.291 --> 00:56:09.360
they shut up cause they think they're helping you out.
He was,

971
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.530
the famous line is they'll come up and be like,
hey,

972
00:56:11.531 --> 00:56:12.810
you like how it helped you out.
I'm like,
buddy,

973
00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:15.510
I came with jokes and I don't need this.
I don't,

974
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.700
I don't have a box jumper and my action right.
I showed up ready to go.
But um,

975
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:25.700
when people are affectionate,
you can't insult them and they're the,

976
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:28.420
they're the most unmanageable kind of how by affection you me.

977
00:56:28.421 --> 00:56:30.850
So it was like I love you,
I love you.
I love you.

978
00:56:30.851 --> 00:56:34.270
I this one girl at one show in San Francisco,
just so drunk,
I'm just cross side.

979
00:56:34.271 --> 00:56:37.420
And for that 90 minutes I was on state cause I love you.

980
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:40.603
And I was just like,

981
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:46.860
lady like your w w all you're doing is making me want to hit you in the head

982
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:51.670
with this microphone stand.
Your affection is,
is not welcome here.

983
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.900
And everybody else is like staring at this woman,
but she,

984
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.930
this is a genuine expression of emotion for this person that is destroying my

985
00:56:58.931 --> 00:57:02.230
joy completely.
So,
um,
you know,
I,

986
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:06.100
if I really have a habit of just not talking to hecklers,

987
00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:11.080
what did you do in that case?
Did you ignore?
I think that I kept saying like,

988
00:57:11.081 --> 00:57:15.720
thank you,
that's super sweet.
Shut the fuck up.
But that was like,

989
00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:18.670
like,
you know,
clearly you are and how good up as a child.
I mean,

990
00:57:18.671 --> 00:57:21.460
I just eventually got mean because it was just like I couldn't get this woman to

991
00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:24.010
stop talking.
Um,
and uh,

992
00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:27.850
and I think the people around her got embarrassed and they eventually kind of

993
00:57:27.851 --> 00:57:31.390
shut her up,
which was nice.
Um,
and I,
I'm trying to think,

994
00:57:31.391 --> 00:57:34.810
are there any other really good Eckler's that,
uh,
oh,

995
00:57:34.811 --> 00:57:39.070
I had one guy and it's a mental discipline too because,
you know,
like again,

996
00:57:39.071 --> 00:57:41.980
like it's your show,
you have the microphone,
you're in control.
You know,

997
00:57:41.981 --> 00:57:43.780
I think the audience thinks they're in control,
but they're not,

998
00:57:43.781 --> 00:57:46.510
I mean that the build we're scenario is a perfect example.

999
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:50.350
The person with the microphone has all the power,
uh,
and as long as they,

1000
00:57:50.351 --> 00:57:54.090
as long as it can not be moved,
they will,
they will eventually win.
But I had,
um,

1001
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.620
this one guy who was sitting really close to the stage,

1002
00:57:56.621 --> 00:58:00.430
it was like a group of 12 people and they were all like laughing their asses off

1003
00:58:00.431 --> 00:58:02.530
and then he was just arms crossed,

1004
00:58:02.531 --> 00:58:06.830
just look like he just had just eaten a big scoop of fecal matter.
And I just,

1005
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:08.470
it was all,
he was all I could see,
like,
you know what I mean,

1006
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:10.330
like the whole audience and disappeared.

1007
00:58:10.331 --> 00:58:15.331
And it was just like straight vignette on this guy's like sourpuss face and I

1008
00:58:16.181 --> 00:58:20.290
couldn't,
it was,
there was this wrecking my whole night.
And uh,
I finally said,

1009
00:58:20.291 --> 00:58:23.110
if you don't want to be here,
just fucking go,
man,
I'll give you your money back.

1010
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:25.330
I cannot look at your face for one more minute.

1011
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:30.070
And then I met him.
It wasn't even a joke.
I was just like,

1012
00:58:30.071 --> 00:58:33.590
get out and you are harshing my mellow so hard.
And,
and,
and uh,

1013
00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:35.890
and he left and I didn't feel bad about it.

1014
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:39.550
And then I went out with a show and his girlfriend goes,
he had a bad day.

1015
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:44.530
I was like,
but what was great was nobody else at the table,

1016
00:58:44.531 --> 00:58:47.070
one is leave.
They're all like,
you know,
good riddance to bad rubbish.
And He,

1017
00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.990
you know,
he went on and that's the people enjoy their night.
So,
but again,

1018
00:58:49.991 --> 00:58:51.520
that was me.
That was my,
you know,

1019
00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:54.520
I should have been disciplined enough not to be distracted by,
you know,
old,

1020
00:58:54.521 --> 00:58:58.450
Sour Puss,
but
I'm only human,
you know what I mean?

1021
00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:01.750
The Grinch's if the Grinch is sitting in the front row,
you know,

1022
00:59:01.751 --> 00:59:06.340
something must be done.
When you were just getting started,

1023
00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.890
how did you get better at comedy?

1024
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:13.180
And what I mean by that is you're very smart.
Uh,
you,

1025
00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.690
like you mentioned matrix capable.
Uh,

1026
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:20.920
did you do any type of postgame analysis?
Did you watch video of yourself?

1027
00:59:20.921 --> 00:59:22.070
Did Watch video of other

1028
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:22.903
<v 5>comics?</v>

1029
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:28.190
How did you hone your craft or eight or maybe a better question is what helped

1030
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:32.870
the most in honing your craft?
That's a good question.
Um,

1031
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:34.491
you know,
it's interesting,

1032
00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:39.491
like I think that there's definite math to comedy and then there's also a

1033
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:43.720
secondary kind of like ineffability,
you know what I mean?
And,

1034
00:59:43.721 --> 00:59:47.840
and I guess what I mean is like you can learn how to be a better comic,

1035
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:53.650
but you can't learn how to be a comic or even had a different way.

1036
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:58.160
I really wanted to be an engineer and I could have really suffered and struggled

1037
00:59:58.161 --> 01:00:00.410
through like that high,
like the elevated math.
It would,

1038
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:05.720
I would need to become an engineer,
but it would never be effortless for me.

1039
01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:11.840
And I think with comedy there are people who very workmanlike can learn how to

1040
01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:14.480
do comedy and then there's some people were just naturally comedic and they

1041
01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:18.680
still have to work to be better at it.
You know,
like you say,

1042
01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:21.920
bolts still has to train,
even though he was born with,
you know,

1043
01:00:21.921 --> 01:00:23.420
more fast twitch muscles and everybody else,

1044
01:00:23.421 --> 01:00:26.990
he still has to train to become a champion.
So I feel like with comedy there,

1045
01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:29.990
you know,
people can be the class clown and it can be like,
I was naturally funny.

1046
01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:34.940
There's still a methodology and there's still a mathematics to becoming a comic.

1047
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.090
And then at the same time,
if they have this,
this ephemeral,

1048
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:43.130
ineffable kind of understanding of the math of comedy,

1049
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.880
they're going to be able to do something magical with those skills.

1050
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:52.130
So for me,
I don't know that I thought I was a funny kid,

1051
01:00:52.131 --> 01:00:56.030
but I was an observer and I wasn't really nerdy and a little bit of a social

1052
01:00:56.031 --> 01:00:59.060
pariah.
So story telling me came a way to make friends,
you know what I mean?

1053
01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.640
Like to like a gray shape myself.
I would,
I,
you know,

1054
01:01:01.641 --> 01:01:05.330
I would kind of like try to talk my way into situations or if I was in a social

1055
01:01:05.331 --> 01:01:09.190
situation,
talk really fast to try to keep myself engaging,
not be,

1056
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:11.120
not be rejected.
Um,

1057
01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.420
so like that was what I brought to,

1058
01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:17.450
it was like that combination of being an outsider and an observer and then,

1059
01:01:17.451 --> 01:01:21.740
and then using those skills to try to kind of connect with people.
Um,

1060
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:26.900
but w with comedy,
like I never took any classes.
I never read any books.
You know,

1061
01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:29.060
they're,
they're definitely people who can say,
Oh,
you know,

1062
01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:30.950
there's a total methodology to comedy.
It's,
you know,

1063
01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:33.260
the rule of threes and you know,
stretch,
stretching,

1064
01:01:33.261 --> 01:01:36.440
the stretching reality to the point of breaking but not pass it.
I mean they're,

1065
01:01:36.441 --> 01:01:40.190
you know,
some specific,
what's the rule of threes?
Oh,

1066
01:01:40.191 --> 01:01:44.810
the rule of threes is that,
um,
I definitely maintain your train of thought,

1067
01:01:44.811 --> 01:01:47.850
but I probably won't even be able to articulate it properly.
It's,

1068
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:51.200
it's just that like if you're going to do a series of jokes or a series of

1069
01:01:51.201 --> 01:01:54.030
builds to a punchline,
it needs to be three I guess.

1070
01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.500
And also if you're going to do any kind of a of a diversion,

1071
01:01:57.501 --> 01:01:59.580
if you're going to lead people in one direction,

1072
01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:02.960
then snap around to a different kind of absurdist results.

1073
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:06.170
You can't do that in a,
you can't do that in two.
It has to.
That has to be,

1074
01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:10.850
it has to be,
the pace of it has to be three.
I see.
Um,
and then pass through.

1075
01:02:10.851 --> 01:02:15.350
You're starting to,
you know,
draw things out too long.

1076
01:02:15.351 --> 01:02:19.140
But two doesn't give people enough of a time.
All the,

1077
01:02:19.141 --> 01:02:22.830
to a false sense of security before you kind of pulled the rug out from under

1078
01:02:22.831 --> 01:02:24.740
them.
Um,

1079
01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:28.710
and then as soon as you start explaining that at the math of,
of comedy,

1080
01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:30.540
like none of it makes any sense.
You know what I mean?
Like it's this,

1081
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:33.810
it's those two things.
You know,
someone who's really gifted at physics there,

1082
01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:34.800
they know that there are rules,

1083
01:02:34.801 --> 01:02:38.430
but still they see things that other people can't see.
You know what I mean?
They,

1084
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:43.080
they see the world as numbers and the data and the rest of us are just like

1085
01:02:43.081 --> 01:02:46.080
table chair,
water sec.
Um,

1086
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:51.290
so I guess the way that I did it was that I ha I'm also really an on disciplined

1087
01:02:54.931 --> 01:02:58.090
comedian.
And what I mean is like,
um,
like there's a,

1088
01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.760
there's a documentary about Gary Shandling out right now,

1089
01:02:59.761 --> 01:03:01.320
which I haven't watched,
but um,

1090
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.830
but I'm sure that this is in there because he was very famous for being a really

1091
01:03:04.831 --> 01:03:07.800
disciplined writer.
Like he would get up and he would write every single day.

1092
01:03:07.801 --> 01:03:11.200
And sometimes it would be pages and pages of material without fail other comics.

1093
01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:12.960
Like,
Hey,
let's get a beer and be like,
no,
I have to write.

1094
01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:16.090
And everyday he would write like on this like legal,
this is,

1095
01:03:16.091 --> 01:03:19.750
this is probably true.
And Apocrypha at the same time on this,
like legal,

1096
01:03:19.751 --> 01:03:22.260
I knew about these tiny handwriting and he would just write and write and write

1097
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:25.950
and write.
I do not do that.
I've never worked that way.
Um,

1098
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:31.140
I just get on stage.
I try a bunch of stuff.
I keep what works.
I know what works.

1099
01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.880
I already know right away what works.
I'll run off stage,

1100
01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:34.400
I'll write down the things that I knew hit,

1101
01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.300
I'll write down the things I know didn't hit,

1102
01:03:36.301 --> 01:03:38.190
and then I'll go back and try it again.

1103
01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:43.440
Dropping the stuff that wasn't good and putting new stuff in.
I record my sets,

1104
01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:45.870
but I never,
I cannot listen to my own voice.

1105
01:03:45.871 --> 01:03:49.770
So I have hours and hours of material on tape that I just have never listened
to.

1106
01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:55.070
So I don't know why I still engage in that behavior when it's clearly not useful

1107
01:03:55.111 --> 01:03:59.880
to me.
But,
um,
but I,

1108
01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:01.530
I,
I think the more you do it,

1109
01:04:01.531 --> 01:04:03.810
the more you intuitively understand that this is a rich area.

1110
01:04:03.811 --> 01:04:06.390
People are connecting with this,
this other stuff.

1111
01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:09.960
There's also something you learned s as you move through comedy,
which is,

1112
01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.090
is not just important to get a laugh.

1113
01:04:12.091 --> 01:04:16.230
Like does this material say something specific and personal about me?

1114
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:18.690
Because when you're a baby comic,

1115
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.810
every joke is meaningful to you cause he only have like eight jokes,
right?

1116
01:04:21.811 --> 01:04:26.400
And so even if they're stupid or juvenile or unsophisticated or,
or,
or,

1117
01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:30.720
or valueless or,
or coreless,
you'll still do that because that's all you have.

1118
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.760
And then as you get older you start thinking,
okay,

1119
01:04:32.761 --> 01:04:35.490
like I want to have a body of work here.
Does this hang together?

1120
01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:38.310
Does it have a strong point of view?
Does it have an identity?

1121
01:04:38.311 --> 01:04:39.870
And then those are the jokes start to fall away.

1122
01:04:39.871 --> 01:04:43.380
And then the material really becomes about trying to tell some kind of a story

1123
01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:45.150
about yourself and the way you perceive the world.

1124
01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.440
And then that's how you shape that.

1125
01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:49.110
And so sometimes things that are really funny go away.

1126
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:52.020
Things that are less funny stay because they,
they're more impactful.

1127
01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.250
Does that make sense?
Yeah,
it does make sense.
Um,
absolutely.
Yeah.

1128
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.800
For musicians,
I think it's true for

1129
01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.760
writers to probably for writers it's like I'm going to find a space that's,

1130
01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.920
that really says something about like my accumulated understanding and knowledge

1131
01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:11.791
of the world.

1132
01:05:11.791 --> 01:05:15.690
And it's not just enough to say something like I need to say something that's

1133
01:05:15.691 --> 01:05:19.420
uniquely mine,
you know?
And as something you can only do with,

1134
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:23.470
by being prolific because you need to be able to let things go in order to

1135
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:24.610
figure out what should stay.

1136
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:26.750
<v 2>Definitely.
Yeah.
There's,</v>

1137
01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.510
I mean there's a certain volume to it or the thinking of it almost as a funnel

1138
01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:34.800
and uh,
you know,
I think,
and I certainly hope for the sake of our,

1139
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:36.930
not to sound like an old man,

1140
01:05:36.931 --> 01:05:40.020
but I guess that's what I'm turning into a for the sake of our just

1141
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.620
society in general.

1142
01:05:43.621 --> 01:05:47.190
I would hope just seeing the number of hatchet jobs and the amount of yellow

1143
01:05:47.191 --> 01:05:52.191
journalism and click baiting with pieces that have not been fact checked and so

1144
01:05:53.881 --> 01:05:55.260
on.
Uh,

1145
01:05:55.261 --> 01:06:00.261
and take down pieces of folks who are otherwise doing actually a lot of good in

1146
01:06:00.361 --> 01:06:01.950
the world,
but,
um,

1147
01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:06.900
people feeling no compunction about running pieces that get a lot of clicks

1148
01:06:06.901 --> 01:06:11.310
because that's the only metric they're focused on at some point.

1149
01:06:11.311 --> 01:06:13.290
Go from,
you know,
what,

1150
01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:18.240
what can I write that will get the most clicks to what can I write that I will

1151
01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:21.620
be proud of?
That may or may not.
Yeah,

1152
01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:26.600
I think you can figure out a way to make it a non-binary decision.
Uh,

1153
01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:27.893
in other words,

1154
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:32.280
you could figure out something you can be proud of that is simultaneously,
uh,

1155
01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:37.740
likely to have fun to find some type of sizable audience.
Right.

1156
01:06:37.741 --> 01:06:40.680
And,
uh,
I think in the beginning there's a temptation,

1157
01:06:40.681 --> 01:06:43.110
particularly if you have quit your job and you're like,

1158
01:06:43.111 --> 01:06:44.730
where's my next rent check coming from?

1159
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:49.380
How can I appeal to the widest number of people possible?

1160
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:52.530
And that's a very precarious position,

1161
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:57.970
a or mindset to put yourself into if you're hoping to do anything creatively.

1162
01:06:58.201 --> 01:07:01.140
Yeah.
Uh,
Evergreen.

1163
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:06.050
<v 5>Right.
And I also like,
it's interesting like,
you know,</v>

1164
01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:11.240
like when I went to school,
you know,
we had,
we had the,
you know,

1165
01:07:11.241 --> 01:07:12.520
the honor system and,
and,

1166
01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:17.120
and you were just expected to hold yourself to a high standard because that was

1167
01:07:17.121 --> 01:07:20.150
what was right.
That's what you did.
You know what I mean?
You just,

1168
01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.440
you were going to be,

1169
01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.200
we're going to be called upon to stand behind your work and,

1170
01:07:23.201 --> 01:07:26.900
and so you tried to work very hard to make sure that you can defend it.

1171
01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.640
I think that,

1172
01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.550
I don't think that it's like we're any less ethical than we've ever been.

1173
01:07:31.551 --> 01:07:34.110
It's just like you said,
our metrics have changed.
Like,

1174
01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:39.700
and I think that people value fame for fame's sake rather than for the,

1175
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:44.450
like the foundational reasons that people become famous and,

1176
01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.090
and I think that's the problem.
And I don't think it just exists in journalism.

1177
01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:47.421
I think,

1178
01:07:47.421 --> 01:07:51.680
I think that people value infamy or they can't distinguish between fame and

1179
01:07:51.681 --> 01:07:56.540
infamy.
And you know,
with a 24 hour news cycle,
like,

1180
01:07:56.570 --> 01:08:01.070
you know,
uh,
uh,
bright burst is as meaningful as a slow burn.

1181
01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.890
And I don't really know.
I don't,

1182
01:08:03.891 --> 01:08:06.260
I actually don't really know what we do or what,

1183
01:08:06.261 --> 01:08:10.370
what should be done or what should happen to counteract that other than people

1184
01:08:10.371 --> 01:08:14.420
start to maybe get hip to it and start rejecting,

1185
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.970
you know,
baseless journalism and,
and,
you know,
it's just,

1186
01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:22.820
it's just so hard to describe.
I don't know.
I find it,
I me take that back.

1187
01:08:22.821 --> 01:08:25.250
I find it very easy to distinguish between things that seem like they've been

1188
01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.590
thoroughly vetted and things that are bullshit.

1189
01:08:27.591 --> 01:08:30.620
But I think that people are working very hard to make it harder for the rest of

1190
01:08:30.621 --> 01:08:33.530
us to distinguish between the two.
So there are,
you know,

1191
01:08:33.531 --> 01:08:36.410
without me sounding like a crazy person,
there aren't a Pfarius,
you know,

1192
01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.950
forces at work trying to make it very hard for us to figure out what's real and

1193
01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:40.820
what's not real.

1194
01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:46.400
And I think we have to start to raise people who are just more critical

1195
01:08:47.151 --> 01:08:47.511
thinkers.

1196
01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:49.490
But it's hard to be a critical thinker when you're just scrolling through your

1197
01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:51.530
Instagram feed,
looking at like butts and cupcakes.

1198
01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:52.613
<v 2>How long</v>

1199
01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:58.190
have you been watching my,
my feet?

1200
01:08:58.191 --> 01:09:01.810
Are you looking over my shoulder or are you one of the nefarious forces and

1201
01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:06.230
following you and I know,
I know what you're into.
I see what you got.
You know,

1202
01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:11.250
I have to all admit there was a day and you would think supposedly being a tech

1203
01:09:11.931 --> 01:09:15.650
investor and all this stuff for 10 years that I would figure this out.

1204
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:20.950
There was a day when I was scrolling through cupcakes and thongs and I looked up

1205
01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:25.100
at my flat,
my profile,
and I was like,
wait a minute.

1206
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:30.230
People can see what I follow.
And I was like,

1207
01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:34.770
Oh fuck.
Uh,
you know,

1208
01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:35.980
fortunately I've,

1209
01:09:35.981 --> 01:09:40.760
I've systematically dismantled and deliberately tarnished any semblance of any

1210
01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:45.761
reputation I might have very deliberately so that I feel so that I don't feel

1211
01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.220
doing you now.
This is so interesting.

1212
01:09:49.221 --> 01:09:54.221
So that I don't feel I have any Stepford wives polished persona to purse to

1213
01:09:58.370 --> 01:10:01.120
preserve.
Right?
Yeah.
Oh

1214
01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:05.170
<v 5>good.
That's so interesting to me.
And it's different than just being a slob.</v>

1215
01:10:05.171 --> 01:10:10.171
What you're seeing is I refuse to create a box within which I will be kept by

1216
01:10:10.721 --> 01:10:15.190
others.
And I think like that comes also from a curiosity about the world.

1217
01:10:15.191 --> 01:10:18.880
I actually think that like people were trying to remain perfect all the time.

1218
01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:21.850
Our fear-driven like that's not,
that's not,
that's not a,

1219
01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:23.790
that's not a position of strength.
You're not meeting,

1220
01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.990
people think they're maintaining position of strength when they're trying to

1221
01:10:25.991 --> 01:10:29.920
maintain an appearance of perfection.
But that is by its very nature,

1222
01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.510
a posture of fear,

1223
01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:35.320
which is I cannot be seen to have imperfections that cannot be seen to have

1224
01:10:35.321 --> 01:10:39.610
flaws.
I,
there can be no chinks in my armor and,
and,
and that's,
I have,

1225
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:41.290
I am terrified of being judged,

1226
01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:44.500
but there's something very liberating and I think it comes from age as well.

1227
01:10:44.501 --> 01:10:47.500
And from experience,
I don't mean experience like a resume,

1228
01:10:47.501 --> 01:10:52.501
but like just having experiences to realize how little you know and how the only

1229
01:10:54.491 --> 01:10:59.491
way to learn is to constantly be like skinning your knees and that,

1230
01:10:59.801 --> 01:11:01.960
that doesn't go away.
Like in the older you get,

1231
01:11:01.961 --> 01:11:06.790
the more you know that you know very little and that you cannot learn if you are

1232
01:11:06.791 --> 01:11:11.410
constantly trying to maintain a posture of perfection.
Absolutely.

1233
01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:13.950
And that's why I'm a total mess.

1234
01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.810
<v 2>What if you don't,</v>

1235
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:21.810
if you don't practice skinning your knees just to like really bleed the metaphor

1236
01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:24.570
for all it's worth,
if you don't practice skinning your knees,

1237
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:26.670
you're not going to develop the Callus for ink,

1238
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:29.970
sort of increasingly painful grades of sandpaper.

1239
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.990
This is really awkwardly,
uh,
overextended now.

1240
01:11:33.991 --> 01:11:36.330
But the point being,

1241
01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:41.780
if you operate from a place of fear and want to please,

1242
01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:47.220
this is nebulous majority more than you want to please yourself.

1243
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:51.060
Uh,
and that's not to say that I'm always,

1244
01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:54.780
I've always viewed my tire life and all my decisions as a singular locus of

1245
01:11:54.781 --> 01:11:57.120
control and the palm of my hand and I care what no one thinks.

1246
01:11:57.121 --> 01:12:00.990
That's not true because that's not how humans evolved.
But if you are,

1247
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.540
if you are deferring to others,

1248
01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:08.820
your perception of what others want a on the small things,

1249
01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.880
then it's going to become harder on the medium things and then impossible,

1250
01:12:11.881 --> 01:12:14.790
and then it's going to become harder and impossible on the big things.

1251
01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.460
And for that reason,

1252
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:24.850
I find it very valuable to a deliberately expose yourself to different types and

1253
01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:32.550
levels of discomfort so that you can actually stand up for the important stuff

1254
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.720
when it matters.
Because if you don't practice on the smaller stuff,
for instance,

1255
01:12:36.721 --> 01:12:40.980
I,
if,
if I'm so humiliated by the fact that I liked gorgeous female acids and I'm

1256
01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:44.520
like,
oh my God,
and I put something up about,
I put up this picture.

1257
01:12:44.521 --> 01:12:46.530
So this is what I do occasionally when I'm like,
you know what?

1258
01:12:46.531 --> 01:12:47.700
I think I'm getting a little,

1259
01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:52.500
a little fat and happy and complacent and maybe I have too much fomo or

1260
01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:56.430
something like that.
I will,
I remember at one point this,

1261
01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.280
I put up this photo of this gorgeous,

1262
01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:03.540
the Latin ass and I'm female and uh,

1263
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:07.020
and it said like Nego Ophelia and I had this in Spanish,

1264
01:13:07.021 --> 01:13:11.880
this explanation of this fake condition,
which was nego fee nego Ophelia.
Anyway,

1265
01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:13.790
I think it was not enough for you to anyway,
Les Nuggets.

1266
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.880
It's like ass and in Spanish.
And so anyway,
so I put this up on Instagram.

1267
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:24.110
That's right.
It's Spanish for like ass man ass man syndrome.
Right?
Or ask me,

1268
01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.230
I disorder and I put it up and it is to be expected.

1269
01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:30.090
There is immediate outreach.
I mean,

1270
01:13:30.091 --> 01:13:31.920
there are there plenty of people who think it's kind of funny.

1271
01:13:31.921 --> 01:13:33.420
Plenty of people who are like,
yeah,
high five.

1272
01:13:33.421 --> 01:13:36.900
And then there are plenty of other people who are just completely outraged,

1273
01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:42.850
disgusted with this fact that I find attractive women.
Attractive and outrageous.

1274
01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:46.510
Yeah.
It's so,
uh,
but I left it up,
uh,

1275
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.770
because I like to call my audience number one.

1276
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.930
Uh,
you don't want to be here please.

1277
01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:58.250
I invite you to unfollow and yeah,
exactly right.
Like,

1278
01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:01.670
it's like the sour puss in the front row.
It's like,
let me give you,
like,

1279
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:05.130
you look,
you look like you're unhappy,
but you're still here.

1280
01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:07.680
And let me give you,

1281
01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:11.440
let me give you another reason to leave if I'm not your thing,

1282
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:12.610
because go find something else.

1283
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:14.560
<v 5>Opinion is valuable to you.</v>

1284
01:14:14.561 --> 01:14:17.470
Like I think there's a freedom in saying I don't need everybody to like me.

1285
01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:19.060
I that's,
you know what I mean?
I think,

1286
01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.080
I think that like there is something very meaningful and saying like,

1287
01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.820
this is who I am.
I'll defend it,

1288
01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:29.020
but I'm not here to be savaged by you.
And honestly,
we don't know each other.

1289
01:14:29.021 --> 01:14:32.890
I don't care what you think and the way you know,

1290
01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:34.780
um,
uh,

1291
01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:38.830
or maybe that person makes you think more critically about what you did and then

1292
01:14:38.831 --> 01:14:41.680
you take the big booty picture down.
I don't know.
But,
uh,

1293
01:14:41.681 --> 01:14:44.790
but I think you put it up purposefully to see what you were going to get back.

1294
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:47.840
<v 2>I totally did entertaining and there another other,</v>

1295
01:14:47.841 --> 01:14:52.000
there are cases just so I don't sound like a complete Dick.
Uh,

1296
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:56.720
there are other cases where I put something up without really thinking about it

1297
01:14:56.870 --> 01:15:00.350
and I do get feedback and realize,
you know what,

1298
01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:03.410
that's actually a really kind of insensitive thing to put up.

1299
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.990
And I didn't think it through.
Take it down there.

1300
01:15:05.991 --> 01:15:10.760
There are cases when they do that and people give me hopefully constructive

1301
01:15:10.761 --> 01:15:14.960
feedback that isn't just spitting acid into my face and that,

1302
01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:20.000
and I take it down.
So I do pay attention.
Uh,
at the same time,

1303
01:15:20.150 --> 01:15:24.020
I try to keep in mind,
uh,
advice that I was given years ago.

1304
01:15:24.021 --> 01:15:27.110
I don't remember who gave me this advice,
but they said the advice was,

1305
01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:30.890
it's not about how many people don't get it.
It's about how many people get it.

1306
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:36.290
So as long as you have a certain critical mass,

1307
01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.370
whatever that means to you.

1308
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:40.820
And there's an article called 1000 true fans by Kevin Kelly that everybody

1309
01:15:40.821 --> 01:15:42.800
should read to this effect if you're creative.

1310
01:15:42.801 --> 01:15:44.780
But as long as you have a critical mass,

1311
01:15:44.781 --> 01:15:49.470
and it can be a very small number of people who love your stuff,
pay it,

1312
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:52.400
that's all that matters.
That's like a pass fail,
right?

1313
01:15:52.401 --> 01:15:53.660
As long as you have that pass,

1314
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:58.640
like you're green and instead of focusing on the vast majority who hate your

1315
01:15:58.641 --> 01:15:59.361
shit,
it's like,
look,

1316
01:15:59.361 --> 01:16:02.870
there are millions of people who hate like Christopher Nolan stuff.

1317
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:06.200
There are millions of people who can't stand Wes Anderson.
It's like,
look,

1318
01:16:06.201 --> 01:16:08.780
some people just aren't going to fucking like Wes Anderson.

1319
01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:10.820
<v 5>Exactly.
Exactly that.</v>

1320
01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:13.970
So it's really interesting also because I think if you're an artist
specifically,

1321
01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:16.400
this is a really important conversation to have with yourself,

1322
01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:19.460
which is like when I first started at at stand up,
you know,

1323
01:16:19.461 --> 01:16:22.640
this was like kind of the period where like def comedy jam was really popular

1324
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:26.260
and you know,
and,
and for,
for lack of a better way of articulating it,

1325
01:16:26.261 --> 01:16:29.450
like black comedy had a very specific look and feel and style and tempo.

1326
01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.630
And I just wasn't doing that kind of comedy and I wasn't ever going to be able

1327
01:16:32.631 --> 01:16:34.370
to do that kind of comedy.
It wasn't who I was.

1328
01:16:34.371 --> 01:16:37.190
It wasn't experientially what I was doing.
And I didn't want to lie.

1329
01:16:37.191 --> 01:16:39.950
And I knew that were comedians who were kind of falling into that stylistic

1330
01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.460
approach to comedy and it was really very false.
You know,
they,

1331
01:16:43.461 --> 01:16:46.700
they'd kind of be one way offstage and then kind of fall into this character on

1332
01:16:46.701 --> 01:16:49.520
stage.
And there's nothing wrong with trying to connect with an audience,

1333
01:16:49.521 --> 01:16:52.640
but I just didn't want to copy other people to try to get people to like me.

1334
01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:53.541
And you know,

1335
01:16:53.541 --> 01:16:57.770
for a long time I really struggled and then eventually my tribe found me but I

1336
01:16:57.771 --> 01:17:01.130
was able to stay.
Oh now I sound like a self help book.

1337
01:17:01.131 --> 01:17:05.300
But like true to who I was because that was the only way forward.

1338
01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:09.650
The only way forward as an artist is to be,
is to be truthful in end.

1339
01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:12.140
Your work is not going to be interesting or meaningful if you were trying to

1340
01:17:12.141 --> 01:17:15.500
emulate somebody else or trying to figure out what people want from you or what

1341
01:17:15.501 --> 01:17:20.120
they like or what's popular.
Meaningful art only last.
It only connects if it's,

1342
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:25.100
if it's authentic and if it comes from euro,
your own personal experiences.

1343
01:17:25.101 --> 01:17:27.740
And if,
and until you figure that out,
like what that is,

1344
01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:31.730
it's never going to be interesting.
It's never going to be good.

1345
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:35.930
And I always tell people it's not being funny is not really actually the most

1346
01:17:35.931 --> 01:17:40.931
important part of comedy being truthful is because if someone sees a good show

1347
01:17:41.181 --> 01:17:43.760
they go,
that guy was really funny.
But when you tell the truth about yourself,

1348
01:17:43.761 --> 01:17:45.710
people go,
oh my God,
Holy Shit,

1349
01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:50.270
that guy like spoke to me or about me or was so vulnerable in that moment.

1350
01:17:50.271 --> 01:17:51.830
Like that was amazing.

1351
01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:55.400
And that's the difference between good comedy and great comedy or big queen,

1352
01:17:55.401 --> 01:17:57.170
good art,
great art or writing or anything.

1353
01:17:57.730 --> 01:17:59.020
<v 2>Yeah,
that's truth.
That's,</v>

1354
01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.540
that's advice that I've also heard for screenwriting and many other things.

1355
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.550
It's like,
yeah,
uh,

1356
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:07.970
I'm so glad you said that and reminded me of that.

1357
01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.180
<v 5>These yourself,</v>

1358
01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:12.960
I mean you just have to please your self period cause it might not go your way

1359
01:18:12.961 --> 01:18:15.850
anyway.
But the worst thing is creating something.

1360
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:19.020
I figured out what people want and then creating some piece of shit,

1361
01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:21.150
some like crass,
you know,
Glib,

1362
01:18:21.370 --> 01:18:23.580
solicitous piece of shit and people don't buy it anyway.

1363
01:18:23.670 --> 01:18:25.860
Why not make something you love and the people don't buy and least it was

1364
01:18:25.861 --> 01:18:27.720
something that you love,
then you're not embarrassed by it.

1365
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:32.710
<v 2>Right.
And you said it may not work out.
And if you're in the creative game,</v>

1366
01:18:32.711 --> 01:18:35.380
at least from what I've seen,
particularly in the beginning,

1367
01:18:35.650 --> 01:18:40.110
most things are not going to work out and nothing ever goes away.
Right?
So,

1368
01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:44.440
so you might as well have one person who's happy about the process and uh,

1369
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:46.460
exactly.
And uh,

1370
01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.220
<v 5>saying about engagement,
at least the experience was satisfying.</v>

1371
01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:55.950
<v 2>And I would also,
I feel like I'm talking too much,
so I'm going to,</v>

1372
01:18:56.050 --> 01:18:57.080
I'm going to stop in a second.

1373
01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.360
But the,
the,
uh,
the other,

1374
01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:09.200
the other thought I might underscore for folks that is kind of practical,

1375
01:19:10.201 --> 01:19:12.120
tactical,
from a competitive standpoint,

1376
01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:16.650
if you're trying to play someone else's game by taking on a persona,

1377
01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:20.820
someone who is actually in,
for instance,

1378
01:19:20.821 --> 01:19:24.030
in the def comedy jam example that you gave,
right?

1379
01:19:24.031 --> 01:19:28.320
If somebody is on stage and they're playing their game,
that is who they are.

1380
01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:34.040
You are never going to be able to take on like the cognitive load and the

1381
01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:40.100
fatigue of pretending to be that type of person and beat someone who is good at

1382
01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:45.380
that game.
You're just not going to,
so here's so right.
Yeah.

1383
01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:47.210
You're just not going to win.
So it's like you,

1384
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:52.080
you will not ultimately in any field that is competitive,

1385
01:19:52.081 --> 01:19:56.860
which is effectively every field that people get paid for.
Uh,
the,
Oh,

1386
01:19:56.890 --> 01:19:59.520
if you want to be the best,
you actually,

1387
01:19:59.521 --> 01:20:04.521
you have to harness your latent abilities and,

1388
01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:08.500
or you're fucked.
Like you can't,
like you mentioned,
uh,

1389
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.700
on the engineering front of me,
there's so many places where,
for instance,

1390
01:20:11.701 --> 01:20:14.700
in writing,
it's like I could try to be,
uh,

1391
01:20:14.730 --> 01:20:17.820
John McPhee who writes for the New Yorker or one of these folks,

1392
01:20:17.821 --> 01:20:21.270
but I can't be those people.
I'm not going to be,

1393
01:20:21.271 --> 01:20:25.800
I'm not going to ever be the word Smith that say a Tolstoy was,
but,

1394
01:20:26.150 --> 01:20:27.420
uh,
do I like teaching?

1395
01:20:27.421 --> 01:20:32.070
Do I obsessively think about teaching and deconstructing things that are

1396
01:20:32.071 --> 01:20:33.150
complex?
I do.

1397
01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:38.151
So I can use books as a medium for teaching and thinking of it.

1398
01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:42.240
Think of it that way.
Because if I try to be,
if I tried to out nicotinic fee,

1399
01:20:42.241 --> 01:20:46.110
I'm going to get my face ripped off.
Okay.
And um,

1400
01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:51.480
well,
you know,
th this is,
we're talking about creativity and creative pursuits,

1401
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:55.550
which by the way,
almost everything is even if you were,
uh,
if you,

1402
01:20:55.551 --> 01:20:59.370
if you meet people who are the top of their game in accounting at the top of the

1403
01:20:59.371 --> 01:21:02.070
game,
I'm not talking about shady,
uh,
money laundering shit.

1404
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:05.940
I'm just saying in accounting,
in,
uh,

1405
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.680
technology,
there's an element,
there's certainly an element of creativity.

1406
01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:15.660
If you're looking at the people who are really at the top and innovating in any

1407
01:21:15.661 --> 01:21:19.880
way doing exceptional work,
you have done so many different things.
You know,

1408
01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:24.420
acting,
comedy,
directing,
writing,
activism.

1409
01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:28.590
You've been a host,
you've done voiceover,
you have,

1410
01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:33.980
you've engaged in so many different acts of creation.

1411
01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:39.870
I want to talk about short films,

1412
01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:43.650
films and so on.
I want to talk about movies

1413
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:48.440
because as long term listeners will know,
I've been,
uh,

1414
01:21:49.650 --> 01:21:52.080
sort of teasing with the idea,

1415
01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:56.870
which by the way just means procrastinating of right.

1416
01:21:57.030 --> 01:22:00.930
Writing some short films and I'm,

1417
01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:05.040
I'm still at step zero and I'm ashamed of that.
But,
uh,

1418
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:08.230
no shame.
There's no shame.
Yeah.
So how did you,

1419
01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.260
how did you decide to get into film and why?
I mean,
film is hot.
Film is heart.

1420
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:14.183
Why do it?
Yeah,

1421
01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:15.450
<v 5>it is tough.
Yeah.
Like,</v>

1422
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:17.910
so that's a really good question cause I feel like there's the,
you know,

1423
01:22:17.911 --> 01:22:22.770
that like really humiliating,
kind of,
you know,
clam,
uh,
about,

1424
01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.400
you know,
well,
I'm an actor,
but what I really wanted to do is direct them and,

1425
01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:30.000
and it feels very cliched.
I feel like it was more organic for me because I,

1426
01:22:30.001 --> 01:22:34.750
you know,
I,
I,
again,
I wasn't someone who kind of,
I didn't go to film school.
Uh,

1427
01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:37.260
and I also don't think I had the Hubris to think like,
Oh,

1428
01:22:37.261 --> 01:22:40.470
I've done this a cup for a couple of years now I can direct it was,

1429
01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:44.190
I had written some,
I love movies.
Like,
you know,
we were talking earlier,

1430
01:22:44.191 --> 01:22:48.000
I was raised by a single dad and you know,
I,
I was one of those kids who like,

1431
01:22:48.001 --> 01:22:48.834
I'd go,

1432
01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:52.740
I'd go with my dad to see like diehard or road warrior and you know what way too

1433
01:22:52.741 --> 01:22:57.240
early of age,
super inappropriate.
Um,
you know,
or like by the time,
you know,

1434
01:22:57.241 --> 01:22:58.320
like when I was in high school,

1435
01:22:58.321 --> 01:23:01.800
I'd seen the terminator like the First Terminator from like 20 or 30 times.

1436
01:23:01.801 --> 01:23:05.500
Like I,
I just loved movies.
I'd go to the theater,
I buy matinee ticket nights,

1437
01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:07.270
stay in the theater until like eight o'clock at night.

1438
01:23:07.271 --> 01:23:09.460
And I would just like watch movie after movie after movie.

1439
01:23:09.850 --> 01:23:14.410
And so it just came out of a,
like a real end users love for film.

1440
01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:18.950
Like I was just someone who was transported by movies.
And then when,

1441
01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:23.960
when I left talk soup,
um,
I had been writing on that show and,

1442
01:23:23.961 --> 01:23:28.961
and like there was a void and I wrote a script that I was developing with a,

1443
01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.570
with a company and,

1444
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:34.840
and I just kept talking about how I thought it should look and how I thought it

1445
01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:37.030
should feel.
And you know,

1446
01:23:37.031 --> 01:23:39.880
it was just so much more specific than being a writer and they,
they were like,

1447
01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:42.370
you know,
you should direct,
this is clearly like a movie that you should direct.

1448
01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.560
And I hadn't really thought about it,

1449
01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:49.570
but I was just so intertwined with the material and what I wanted it to feel

1450
01:23:49.571 --> 01:23:51.250
like because I know what I,

1451
01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:54.880
what movies that I love make me feel like that I wanted that if someone is

1452
01:23:54.881 --> 01:23:57.910
create that experience for other people.
And I just realized like I didn't,

1453
01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:01.240
I wasn't,
I couldn't,
I didn't know what directing entailed.

1454
01:24:01.241 --> 01:24:03.430
I didn't have any idea about what that was going to be like.

1455
01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.420
And I just went away and started trying to learn about directing.

1456
01:24:07.421 --> 01:24:12.421
And so I kind of would call people that I knew that were directors.

1457
01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:13.810
If I wasn't working on something,

1458
01:24:13.811 --> 01:24:16.840
I would ask to come back to set when I wasn't working so I can hang out and

1459
01:24:16.841 --> 01:24:17.261
shadow,

1460
01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:19.270
which is where you just kinda hang around behind the director and watch them

1461
01:24:19.271 --> 01:24:22.750
work.
And I ended up shadowing with some really incredible people.

1462
01:24:22.751 --> 01:24:27.520
Ended up spending several days on the wire and it's last season and wow.
Yeah.

1463
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:31.660
And just got to just be on the other side of a process that can be relatively

1464
01:24:31.661 --> 01:24:32.660
opaque when you're an actor,

1465
01:24:32.661 --> 01:24:35.650
you're just kind of show up and say your lines and leave.
And um,

1466
01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:37.750
and then I started making shorts and I,

1467
01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.490
and I guess this is going to sound very Glib,

1468
01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.710
but uh,

1469
01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:47.230
cause I mean I'm sure I have the resources available to me that lots of people

1470
01:24:47.231 --> 01:24:50.980
don't.
But I do feel,
I do believe in it.

1471
01:24:50.981 --> 01:24:54.160
Like I just believe in personal aggression.
Like I just believe in doing stuff,

1472
01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.290
said personal aggression,
depression.

1473
01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:58.540
Like I just believe that like if you want to make a movie,

1474
01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:00.940
just start making a movie.
And I don't mean like,
oh,

1475
01:25:00.941 --> 01:25:01.960
get a camera and start shooting it.

1476
01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.220
But what I do mean is like be be hard on yourself.

1477
01:25:06.221 --> 01:25:08.620
Like learn,
read,
learn,
watch,
study.

1478
01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:12.940
I think critically ask people questions and then make a movie and then let it be

1479
01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:15.640
shitty and then make another one and let that one be shitty and keep doing it

1480
01:25:15.641 --> 01:25:18.310
until you get better at it.
Like the first short film I made was,

1481
01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.770
I mean it's an abomination.
It will be never see the light of day.

1482
01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:22.150
I had no idea what I was doing,

1483
01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:24.010
but that didn't make me not want to be a director.

1484
01:25:24.011 --> 01:25:25.900
It just made me realize I needed to learn more.

1485
01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:29.590
And then I uh,

1486
01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:33.040
I started to feel like I was more ready and I was like,

1487
01:25:33.041 --> 01:25:34.030
I need to make some stuff.

1488
01:25:34.031 --> 01:25:37.240
So first thing was I did a comedy central Special Ed and I took the money.

1489
01:25:37.241 --> 01:25:41.650
That would have been my salary and I use it to make us like a little short music

1490
01:25:41.651 --> 01:25:43.810
video that opens the comedy special.

1491
01:25:43.810 --> 01:25:45.790
It wasn't anything that was mandated by the network.
I was like,

1492
01:25:45.791 --> 01:25:46.810
I want to do something different.

1493
01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:51.070
So I wrote this song and I performed it and I made music video and that was the

1494
01:25:51.071 --> 01:25:52.060
kind of the first thing I directed.

1495
01:25:52.061 --> 01:25:54.610
I just use the crew that was already working on the,
on the special and,

1496
01:25:54.611 --> 01:25:58.520
and shot video with that.
That's really smart.
So I would imagine,

1497
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:59.590
not to interject,

1498
01:25:59.591 --> 01:26:03.590
but you piggybacked on something that was in your main line business,

1499
01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.490
so to speak.
Exactly.

1500
01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:10.590
I imagine you saved a lot of costs by doing that,
right?
I mean,
you had like,
yeah.

1501
01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:11.780
Yeah.
Like,
like the guy,

1502
01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:16.580
the crew was already going to come up the day before and leave the day after to

1503
01:26:16.581 --> 01:26:18.740
shoot the special.
Um,

1504
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:22.370
and we'd already rented the cameras and everything like that.
Uh,

1505
01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.490
but I had to sell it to pay them for the extra workers.
Took my,

1506
01:26:25.491 --> 01:26:29.480
I took my fee and I used it to pay everybody else.
Um,
and then,

1507
01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:32.030
and then because I didn't have any more money after that,
I,

1508
01:26:32.031 --> 01:26:33.200
I learned how to edit it.

1509
01:26:33.201 --> 01:26:36.010
I edited it myself and I delivered it to the network because I couldn't afford

1510
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:38.660
to pay for additional at at time.
Um,

1511
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:43.260
and then after that I thought,
okay,
I,
uh,

1512
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:46.330
I want to do more of this.
So then I,
um,
I rented a camera,

1513
01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:50.060
rented like a Canon Five d and I had some friends who were in bands.
And again,

1514
01:26:50.061 --> 01:26:52.880
like it sounds fancy,
but everybody probably knows somebody who does something,

1515
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:53.750
you know,
it just,

1516
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:55.910
cause I had some friends who were in a famous band doesn't mean that people out

1517
01:26:55.911 --> 01:26:57.110
that don't have friends were in bands.

1518
01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:59.930
So I just called some buddies of mine that were in bands and I said,
hey,

1519
01:26:59.931 --> 01:27:03.500
if you let me come on tour with you,
I will make you a free music video.

1520
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:06.050
Just a piece of fan art.
You can use it however you like.

1521
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:08.930
I'm not going to charge anybody any money for it,
but just,
I,

1522
01:27:08.931 --> 01:27:12.350
I want to make something and I want to make something for you.
Um,

1523
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:16.580
and so I ended up going on the road with Silversun pickups for a couple of dates

1524
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.140
and then spending a day with clutch when they're performing an Anaheim.

1525
01:27:21.141 --> 01:27:24.860
And then I just gave them,
I just cut music videos and delivered it to them.

1526
01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:29.650
Um,
and so then I just started to have like examples of what I could do,
why,

1527
01:27:29.670 --> 01:27:31.760
why music videos instead of something else.

1528
01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:36.320
It just felt like a way to get more people to see it.
Um,

1529
01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:38.960
I had done that first music video for my comedy central special,

1530
01:27:38.961 --> 01:27:40.790
which was really like a comedic video.
But then I was like,
oh,

1531
01:27:40.791 --> 01:27:43.070
I really like working in this space.

1532
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:46.310
And a lot of directors come out of music video because you can be kind of

1533
01:27:46.311 --> 01:27:47.540
radically creative and that space,

1534
01:27:47.541 --> 01:27:50.900
you don't have need to have any like narrative linearity.
You can experiment,

1535
01:27:50.901 --> 01:27:54.080
you can be radical.
It could just be like a series of images.
Um,

1536
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:57.840
and I also thought,
well,
people who,
who like this band and I love,

1537
01:27:57.890 --> 01:28:00.650
I love this band will want to see something that about them.

1538
01:28:00.651 --> 01:28:04.010
It'll be a great way for people to see something and then hopefully I can tell a

1539
01:28:04.011 --> 01:28:06.470
story at the same time.
Um,

1540
01:28:06.630 --> 01:28:10.250
so I did three of those and then I did a little action short.

1541
01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:12.230
Like I just kind of kept making stuff and you know,

1542
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:15.230
every time I did it I learned something.
Every time I did it,

1543
01:28:15.231 --> 01:28:19.100
I took a bigger risk.
Creatively.
How,
how long are these shorts?

1544
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:22.160
Like three to five minutes.
Three to five minutes.

1545
01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:26.630
Can you think of any particular lessons that you took away from any one of
those?

1546
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:32.420
Yeah,
like I think a lot of it was just skill building.

1547
01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:36.020
Like how do you frame up and how do you make choices and how do you do coverage

1548
01:28:36.021 --> 01:28:38.810
and you know,
uh,
and the,
how do you edit?

1549
01:28:38.811 --> 01:28:42.080
Like a lot of it was just really tactical as you would say,
practical,
tactical,

1550
01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:43.493
uh,

1551
01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:53.960
stealing it from to,
and then,
um,

1552
01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:56.450
and then a lot of it was just calm.
Like,

1553
01:28:56.451 --> 01:29:01.070
just getting confident with my own ability and my ability to articulate.

1554
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:05.040
I wanted,
uh,
from other people,
you know,
just how to,

1555
01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:09.120
how do the other jobs on a set work,
who does what,
what do I need?
Oh God,

1556
01:29:09.121 --> 01:29:09.801
this didn't work.
You know,

1557
01:29:09.801 --> 01:29:13.070
I didn't work because I didn't have this kind of a person on set.
Like,
you know,

1558
01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.810
w w w we,

1559
01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:19.940
I was shooting digitally and then on one show a on one of my things that I shot,

1560
01:29:20.161 --> 01:29:23.650
like we didn't have,
um,
uh,
like a tack on set,

1561
01:29:24.570 --> 01:29:25.500
on set to like,

1562
01:29:25.501 --> 01:29:28.380
to help me make sure that it looked the way that I wanted it to look like,

1563
01:29:28.381 --> 01:29:30.300
that the levels are set properly.
So when I got home to edit it,

1564
01:29:30.301 --> 01:29:31.980
like add some problems,
but like,
it wasn't,
they weren't,

1565
01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:35.280
they were catastrophic problems.
They were just because,
because I,
you know,

1566
01:29:35.281 --> 01:29:37.620
I wasn't making star wars,
you know what I mean?
I was just able to be like,
well,

1567
01:29:37.621 --> 01:29:42.030
this is what it is and I'm gonna make this and move on.
And,
and then,
um,

1568
01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:46.260
I was getting ready to,
I really wanted to do a feature.
I didn't,

1569
01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:49.290
I had some material I'd written but it was kind of going to be an expensive

1570
01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:51.870
movie,
but I was still shadowing.

1571
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:55.470
So I had friend who had a show called penny dreadful.

1572
01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:57.420
I let John Logan and create a penny dreadful.

1573
01:29:57.421 --> 01:30:00.540
I've met him at comic con hosted the panel for that show and he was like,
hey,

1574
01:30:00.541 --> 01:30:02.820
why don't you,
you love the show,
you should come visit us in Ireland.

1575
01:30:02.821 --> 01:30:04.920
And I remember thinking like to myself,

1576
01:30:05.130 --> 01:30:07.710
people always say that and then you always say,
yeah,
then you never do it.

1577
01:30:07.711 --> 01:30:10.140
I was like,
I'm going to do it.
I'm fucking going on Ireland,
man.
That's,

1578
01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:12.440
I'm going to be cool.
I'm getting,
I want to,

1579
01:30:12.441 --> 01:30:16.650
I will say I'm going to be a cool kid for once in my life at a and so I ended up

1580
01:30:16.651 --> 01:30:20.400
going over visiting penny dreadful and vikings shot right up the road.

1581
01:30:20.401 --> 01:30:22.020
So I got them to let me visit that set.

1582
01:30:22.021 --> 01:30:25.830
I just hung out at like passed out sandwiches and you know,

1583
01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:29.320
lifted stuff and ask questions and watch them work.
And,

1584
01:30:30.330 --> 01:30:33.170
and then while I was over there,
I met a bunch of,
uh,
Irish actors and,
and,

1585
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:37.020
and one of them,
two of them actually,
one was,
it was a,
was an actor,

1586
01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:39.330
composer and one was a writer,
a screenwriter and an actor.

1587
01:30:39.331 --> 01:30:43.050
And we ended up making a short film together in Ireland at the end of 2014.

1588
01:30:43.051 --> 01:30:46.300
That was my first narrative short,
my first kind of story-driven short.
Uh,

1589
01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:49.350
and it was,
it was just great.
It was just like,
I was like,
oh,

1590
01:30:49.351 --> 01:30:53.220
this is like totally who I am.
This is what I want to do with my life.

1591
01:30:53.690 --> 01:30:57.560
And where did you film in Ireland and in Gull Bay and Galway,

1592
01:30:57.570 --> 01:30:59.850
which is a beautiful tone.
Yeah.

1593
01:30:59.851 --> 01:31:04.490
Such a great place for a month in 2005 thing.

1594
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:08.100
All that's so cool.
Credible arts festival there.
It's a really beautiful spot.

1595
01:31:08.410 --> 01:31:11.700
It is.
It's like,
it's,
it's like the arts center of,
of Ireland.
You know,

1596
01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:13.720
they've got a beautiful film festival in the summer.

1597
01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:17.970
They've got an arts festival,
you know,
like local theater.
And,
um,

1598
01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:22.560
it was just a great experience.
Uh,
and,
you know,

1599
01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:25.610
things went wrong and things went right,
but you know,

1600
01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:30.000
we got it in the can in three days and it was just super cool and personal.

1601
01:31:30.001 --> 01:31:34.530
And then,
uh,
that same writer who had written that Short,
uh,

1602
01:31:34.531 --> 01:31:38.130
had a feature he had already written and he asked me if I wanted to take a look

1603
01:31:38.131 --> 01:31:40.980
at it and it was just a perfect first film and that that's the film that became

1604
01:31:41.010 --> 01:31:45.660
access.
Okay.
So I want to dig in to access,

1605
01:31:45.661 --> 01:31:49.380
but before we get to that,
you're taking these trips,

1606
01:31:49.381 --> 01:31:52.590
doing these music videos during that period,

1607
01:31:53.210 --> 01:31:54.450
are you,

1608
01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:59.500
did you save up for that period noting knowing that you would need to work out

1609
01:31:59.501 --> 01:32:00.340
of your savings?

1610
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:06.030
<v 2>Are you depending on royalties and other streams to pay your bills?</v>

1611
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:11.910
How are you covering the necessities of life as you were handing out sandwiches

1612
01:32:12.701 --> 01:32:13.950
and doing all these various things?
Okay.

1613
01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:15.251
<v 5>Well it wasn't a,</v>

1614
01:32:15.251 --> 01:32:19.690
it wasn't as prolonged of a period is it sounds like I was on hiatus.
Um,
so like,

1615
01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.000
uh,
I was,
I was working on,

1616
01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:25.720
I was working on the talk at the time and we get a month off every year,

1617
01:32:25.721 --> 01:32:28.170
so I went in that month.
Um,

1618
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:32.840
but I think if I was talking to a lay person who didn't work in television,
I,

1619
01:32:32.841 --> 01:32:34.840
I would,
I would say like,
you know,
if,

1620
01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:39.370
if what you want is to grow in whatever field you're interested in,
like,

1621
01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:42.960
just create a space for that.
Like,
you know,
make that your vacation,
you know,

1622
01:32:42.961 --> 01:32:46.690
like,
I didn't,
it wasn't like,
I like was like riding around in a limousine.

1623
01:32:46.691 --> 01:32:48.730
Like I just flew over and I hung around,
you know,

1624
01:32:48.731 --> 01:32:51.780
for like a week and watch people work.
And,
um,
it,

1625
01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:56.670
it wasn't any more or less burdensome than taking a vacation.
Uh,

1626
01:32:56.770 --> 01:32:57.280
but I,

1627
01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:01.720
but one thing I was more interested in doing as I got older and we started with

1628
01:33:01.721 --> 01:33:04.480
this in the beginning,
it's like you said it,
I know,
and I,

1629
01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:07.720
I think we kind of went past it,
but it's so interesting to me.
It was,
I just,

1630
01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:12.790
I was more,
I just really wanted more discomfort in my life.
I was like,

1631
01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:17.050
you know,
it's just very easy.
The older you get to be like a,
you know,
get in car,

1632
01:33:17.051 --> 01:33:21.400
go to work,
eat bag,
lunch,
get in car,
go to the gym,
go home,
eat food,

1633
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:25.470
watch TV,
go to bed.
And then you just think like,
am I my growing?
Like,

1634
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:28.420
it's like any of this interesting.
Am I going to,
you know what I mean?

1635
01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:33.550
Like I have one life and I'm just spending it in this like torpor.
And so,

1636
01:33:33.610 --> 01:33:36.520
um,
for that I was going to a place where,
I mean,

1637
01:33:36.730 --> 01:33:38.770
I knew I knew one guy at at petty dreadful,

1638
01:33:38.771 --> 01:33:40.270
but I didn't know anybody at this other show.

1639
01:33:40.271 --> 01:33:44.260
And I just kind of cold called them and said,
you know,
can I,
can I come visit?

1640
01:33:44.261 --> 01:33:46.890
And they were super gracious.
Okay.

1641
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:52.400
<v 2>I'm so curious just to interrupt you.
You yet again.</v>

1642
01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:54.350
What does that mean?
What does that email say?

1643
01:33:55.730 --> 01:34:00.230
<v 5>Uh,
it says,
um,
hi.
Uh,
and again,</v>

1644
01:34:00.231 --> 01:34:03.140
I understand that maybe this is going to feel a little rarefied.
Hi,

1645
01:34:03.141 --> 01:34:07.510
I'm an American actress.
I,
I've worked on these shows.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm Chad,

1646
01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:09.560
I've been shadowing to direct for a long time.

1647
01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:13.460
I would be really grateful if I could come and visit your show for a few days

1648
01:34:13.461 --> 01:34:18.110
and shadow.
Um,
and I will be as unobtrusive and,
and,

1649
01:34:18.170 --> 01:34:22.930
um,
and invisible as I possibly can.
Uh,
and I'll be here these days and,

1650
01:34:22.931 --> 01:34:26.330
and um,
you know,
I understand if you can't accommodate me,
but I,

1651
01:34:26.331 --> 01:34:31.040
I really be grateful and I think it helped in my particular case because I had

1652
01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:33.560
tweeted a lot about how much I loved Vikings.

1653
01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:37.280
So we kind of knew that I was a big fan of the show and I,
and I did.

1654
01:34:37.281 --> 01:34:39.250
So tweeting from sat,
you know,
I kind of,
I kind of like,
I

1655
01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:44.140
<v 2>paid my way in,
in,
in,
uh,
you know,</v>

1656
01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:49.330
like flacking their show for them.
But,
um,
which can occur just to,
I,
I,

1657
01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:52.690
I'm not over caffeinated.
I swear to God,
I'm just,
you're making,

1658
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.720
you're making so many important points that I just want to pause and help,

1659
01:34:58.770 --> 01:35:01.130
uh,
well as much for myself as anyone else,

1660
01:35:01.131 --> 01:35:05.990
just people to reflect on what you did in terms of tweeting.

1661
01:35:05.991 --> 01:35:06.471
People might say,

1662
01:35:06.471 --> 01:35:09.890
well I don't have a verified account and nobody's going to pay attention to one

1663
01:35:09.891 --> 01:35:11.330
tweet and the the,

1664
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:15.230
the Twitter feed of 10,000 if it's a popular TV show.

1665
01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:20.770
But I can tell you from personal experience that you could for instance,

1666
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:28.870
write something for medium or for fill in the blank outlet that has a high

1667
01:35:29.151 --> 01:35:31.340
Google another.
In other words,

1668
01:35:31.341 --> 01:35:36.341
page rank and to end that many of the producers,

1669
01:35:36.801 --> 01:35:38.000
actors and so on.

1670
01:35:38.001 --> 01:35:43.001
We'll have Google alerts or other alerts set that deliver to their inboxes.

1671
01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:48.040
Relevant media that mentioned say the show or the actors and you do not need to

1672
01:35:48.681 --> 01:35:53.681
be a famous actress or an author or any of those things to do that.

1673
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.930
<v 5>Do you,
is,</v>

1674
01:35:54.930 --> 01:35:59.930
is his work at the highest possible caliber of quality that you can,

1675
01:36:00.661 --> 01:36:02.310
I mean,
I think you also touched on this,

1676
01:36:02.311 --> 01:36:04.980
about the idea that people are like more interested in being expeditious than

1677
01:36:04.981 --> 01:36:09.480
they are in the,
and being good.
I think that,
you know,
that this holds very,

1678
01:36:09.481 --> 01:36:12.650
very true for this business.
A lot of people have gotten,
have,

1679
01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:15.780
have made headway because they did something that nobody saw.
But when they,

1680
01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:17.340
when people ask them what they did,

1681
01:36:17.341 --> 01:36:19.320
the thing they were able to show was extraordinary.

1682
01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:21.480
And I don't mean like expensive,
extraordinary.

1683
01:36:21.481 --> 01:36:24.750
I just mean unique and personal and,
and crafted with care.

1684
01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.360
And so if that's something that you wrote or if it's something that you made,

1685
01:36:27.361 --> 01:36:31.800
if you made,
you know,
the number of,
I mean,
this is not the best example,

1686
01:36:31.801 --> 01:36:32.850
but it's a,
it's a good one.

1687
01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:38.700
20 years ago there was this video tape going around Hollywood,

1688
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:44.010
uh,
the of these guys in an apartment.
Uh,
and it was a VHS tape.

1689
01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.340
That's how long ago it was.
Uh,

1690
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:48.000
people were dubbing it and sending and giving to friends of these guys.

1691
01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:51.360
And Department of these three black guys where the one guy goes up and it's the

1692
01:36:51.361 --> 01:36:53.370
little inner comma goes was that,
and then the other guy,

1693
01:36:53.371 --> 01:36:54.500
because it was a high and the third guy,

1694
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:58.710
one that was a short film that some guy made on like a digital camera.

1695
01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:00.630
None of them were famous.

1696
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:04.440
They were just some guys in New York that ended up being that Budweiser
campaign.

1697
01:37:04.530 --> 01:37:07.040
That's crazy.
I had no idea that was the origin.

1698
01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:09.260
It was a short film and it wasn't.
It was a,

1699
01:37:09.261 --> 01:37:12.450
it was a two and a half minute short film.
That was just funny.

1700
01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:15.030
You didn't know who was it?
He didn't,
we didn't know these guys.

1701
01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:19.740
No one knew who they were and and they didn't have any connections and I think

1702
01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:23.610
it was just about doing something that felt original and personal.
And I get,

1703
01:37:23.611 --> 01:37:26.190
it just comes back to like,
don't try to figure out what people want,

1704
01:37:26.191 --> 01:37:29.430
just do what's interesting and important to you and then keep doing it until you

1705
01:37:29.431 --> 01:37:30.750
come up with something extraordinary.

1706
01:37:31.110 --> 01:37:34.230
And that will be your calling card and made it happen as fast as you want or as

1707
01:37:34.231 --> 01:37:38.190
aggressively as you honor,
as expansively as you want.
But in the meantime,

1708
01:37:38.191 --> 01:37:39.660
you're doing cool shit,

1709
01:37:39.810 --> 01:37:44.340
which should be your primary goal in any event.
Um,

1710
01:37:45.250 --> 01:37:47.520
you know,
and when,
when I made access,

1711
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:50.970
honestly I just wanted to make a movie to show people I could make a movie.

1712
01:37:51.150 --> 01:37:54.730
I wanted to make the best movie I could.
And I was very rigorous in,

1713
01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:58.170
in leveraging the resources that I had to the best of my ability.
But I,
I,

1714
01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:01.290
I don't know that it had a lot of expectations that a lot of people would see
it.

1715
01:38:02.010 --> 01:38:06.180
It's just because I made the best movie I could that,
you know,

1716
01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:09.340
it got all of this attention,
but I,
but I don't think I was going in my,
like,

1717
01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:12.000
this is going to be a massive hit.
I was like,
I'm gonna make this little movie.

1718
01:38:12.210 --> 01:38:14.700
And then for the next one when people say,
well,
what have you done?
I can be like,

1719
01:38:14.701 --> 01:38:16.080
look at this little king I made.
You know?

1720
01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:19.830
So I think you have to always be focused on the results,

1721
01:38:19.890 --> 01:38:24.600
not the result on the thing and not the result because the result is directly

1722
01:38:24.601 --> 01:38:27.830
tied to the quality of the thing.
So it's not about infamy,

1723
01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:30.060
it's about fame and famous based on quality of your work.

1724
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:32.430
So just be doing excellent shit all the time.

1725
01:38:33.150 --> 01:38:35.370
And eventually one of those things will connect with other people.

1726
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:39.480
<v 2>Yeah.
Not to sound like a fortune cookie on top of all of that public.
The,</v>

1727
01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:42.050
the only uncrowded market is great.

1728
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:44.510
Like there's always a fucking market for great.

1729
01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:49.800
<v 5>Yeah,
exactly.
And,
and,
and to like,</v>

1730
01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:53.290
and like be radically great.
Like don't be like,
I saw 10 things like this.

1731
01:38:53.291 --> 01:38:58.090
Let me do the 11th thing.
Like be brave enough to court failure.

1732
01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.130
That's probably when you're going to do something great.

1733
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:05.780
<v 2>Absolutely.
And if you get,
if you are really in love with something,</v>

1734
01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:09.590
and I'll give two examples.
If you're really in love with say,

1735
01:39:09.591 --> 01:39:14.591
screenplays and film or if you're really in love and passionate about maybe is a

1736
01:39:15.471 --> 01:39:16.304
better word,

1737
01:39:16.670 --> 01:39:20.780
a possessed by technology investing early stage technology,

1738
01:39:20.781 --> 01:39:25.781
investing two phenomena to uh,

1739
01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.740
uh,
companies at this point,

1740
01:39:27.741 --> 01:39:32.300
certainly that are worth looking at and just investigating the stories of,
uh,

1741
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:37.870
demonstrate very clearly what you can do if you are just rejected by the

1742
01:39:37.941 --> 01:39:42.530
establishment or if you want to not operate within the existing power structure

1743
01:39:42.531 --> 01:39:42.911
to it.

1744
01:39:42.911 --> 01:39:47.911
So the two examples are the blacklist look up Franklin Leonard and the blacklist

1745
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:50.780
ample.
Absolutely.
And then the second is,
and we,

1746
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:52.610
we don't have to get into both of these right now.

1747
01:39:52.611 --> 01:39:55.550
The second is just by coincidence also has the list at the end,

1748
01:39:55.820 --> 01:40:00.410
but angel list and naval Ravikant and people can look up.
Uh,

1749
01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:02.283
the,

1750
01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:07.100
well the avenging angel was the title of his interview and his alumni magazine

1751
01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:12.050
at Dartmouth.
In fact,
uh,
but,
um,
I get excited when I,

1752
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:14.390
when I hear these types of stories.
So this check them out.

1753
01:40:14.391 --> 01:40:18.630
And this let's come back to,
let's come back to access.
Oh,
sure.

1754
01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:21.110
What is access?
And did you,

1755
01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:25.550
did you have anybody try to talk you out of doing access?

1756
01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:29.710
<v 5>Um,
out?
That's such a good question.
Well,</v>

1757
01:40:30.970 --> 01:40:35.710
so access is a thriller,
um,
about,
uh,

1758
01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:41.520
about an expatriate Irish actor who living in Los Angeles who has had a lot of

1759
01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:47.230
success,
kind of explosive success in his youth.

1760
01:40:47.231 --> 01:40:52.231
And it's really just used all of his resources to just wreck his life.

1761
01:40:52.450 --> 01:40:53.050
You know,
he's,

1762
01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:55.770
he's a drunk and he's a drug addict and he's terrible at relationships and is it

1763
01:40:55.771 --> 01:41:00.340
dick to everybody?
Um,
and,
uh,
and when we,

1764
01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:04.920
when we meet him,
he's trying to turn his life around.
Uh,
and,
and it,

1765
01:41:04.921 --> 01:41:09.080
and it's really about a guy who's not a bad person,
but he's done,

1766
01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.980
done some bad stuff,
which I think almost every human being can relate to,

1767
01:41:11.981 --> 01:41:13.540
you know,
I mean,
we all,

1768
01:41:13.541 --> 01:41:16.480
we all have a little bit of a demon inside of us and I think this is just a guy

1769
01:41:16.481 --> 01:41:19.840
who's been,
he's,
he,
he's,
he's been frail in the past,

1770
01:41:19.841 --> 01:41:22.720
but he's really trying to be a better version of himself,

1771
01:41:23.050 --> 01:41:26.080
but slowly over the course of an afternoon and the movie takes place in real

1772
01:41:26.081 --> 01:41:30.190
time as he's driving through Los Angeles,
uh,
his,
his life starts to unravel.

1773
01:41:30.190 --> 01:41:32.100
And it's really about him trying to hold things together,

1774
01:41:32.110 --> 01:41:33.220
trying to be a better person,

1775
01:41:33.250 --> 01:41:35.560
trying to be a better person in his relationships with his family,

1776
01:41:35.561 --> 01:41:39.430
with people that he works with.
Um,
just trying to,
trying to be better.
Uh,

1777
01:41:39.431 --> 01:41:43.950
it's really dark.
It's very funny.
Uh,
I,
I have been thinking about this,

1778
01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:47.750
I'm sure I'll get some letters about this,
but I happened to find a,

1779
01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.110
that addicts are really entertaining people

1780
01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:57.330
and I don't mean they're funny,
like,
like laugh at them.
I,
I find that they,
um,

1781
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.400
that typically people who are,
uh,
who have broke,

1782
01:42:01.401 --> 01:42:05.350
who broken themselves down are just more honest than people were trying to be

1783
01:42:05.351 --> 01:42:09.400
perfect all the time.
And so,
um,
you know,
he's just,
he's,

1784
01:42:09.401 --> 01:42:12.520
he's a guy who's self aware.
He's aware of the mistakes he's made.

1785
01:42:12.521 --> 01:42:16.300
So it's a very darkly funny movie.
Uh,
and then it's very twisty.
It's,

1786
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:19.090
it's a thriller.
So it's got a lot of secrets,
uh,

1787
01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:22.870
and at the most unique aspect of the movies that the whole thing takes place in

1788
01:42:22.871 --> 01:42:26.200
real time inside a car as he's driving through Los Angeles.
So the,

1789
01:42:26.201 --> 01:42:26.870
the lead actress,

1790
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:29.950
the only actor on screen and all the other actors are our voice actors on the

1791
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:32.560
phone with him.
What was your,

1792
01:42:32.561 --> 01:42:35.830
how would you describe your experience of being involved with this film?

1793
01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.880
It was so wonderful.
You asked if people tried to dissuade me from doing it.

1794
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:43.510
And the short answer is in,
in Hollywood,

1795
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:46.090
the way that people dissuade you from doing stuff,
it's just by not,

1796
01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:50.140
do not helping you to find out if he did.
If he says you don't even get no,

1797
01:42:50.141 --> 01:42:54.220
you just get like silence.
But,
but this happened very quickly,

1798
01:42:54.221 --> 01:42:58.090
so I didn't have a traditional kind of like discouraging period of frustration

1799
01:42:58.091 --> 01:43:01.570
with trying to put this movie together because I read it,
uh,

1800
01:43:01.571 --> 01:43:03.130
in like September,

1801
01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:08.160
August or September of 2015 and I was kind of at peak engagement at the time in

1802
01:43:09.491 --> 01:43:10.151
terms of work,

1803
01:43:10.151 --> 01:43:15.040
like I was on four shows and I really only had a little bit of time off in 2016

1804
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:18.750
and I realized if I didn't make the movie in this one single week in,

1805
01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:23.850
in May of 2016 that I wasn't gonna be able to make it at all in,

1806
01:43:24.701 --> 01:43:26.680
in that year and I have to push to the next year.

1807
01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:29.080
And so then it just became about hitting that target,

1808
01:43:29.081 --> 01:43:30.640
like how can I hit this target?

1809
01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.000
So I never even went like the traditional way of trying to find like people to

1810
01:43:34.001 --> 01:43:36.850
finance the movie in a studio because they were going to say like,
we don't know,

1811
01:43:36.851 --> 01:43:40.000
this actor is like,
he's an unknown.
Can we put somebody famous in this role?

1812
01:43:40.001 --> 01:43:43.460
Can it be Ryan Gosling?
And then can it not be with Pete,
just him on camera?

1813
01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:45.640
Can we have other actors in the movie?
And then can we,

1814
01:43:45.641 --> 01:43:48.100
can we make it not in a car?
Can we make it,
I mean,
like we're just going to,

1815
01:43:48.101 --> 01:43:50.830
you know,
the whole kind of concept of the film was going to unravel.
You know,

1816
01:43:50.831 --> 01:43:51.980
it's very typical in Hollywood

1817
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.000
<v 4>where people are so risk averse that they take all of the edge and,
and um,</v>

1818
01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:58.580
and like singularity at our project.

1819
01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:02.450
So very quickly I realized that I was going to have to probably crowd fund the

1820
01:44:02.451 --> 01:44:06.440
movie if I want it to do it my way and on my time,
on my timeframe.

1821
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:10.820
So,
uh,
in about,
in,
in,
in,

1822
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:13.430
in March of 2016,

1823
01:44:13.431 --> 01:44:17.270
I had my like first exploratory conversation with like the people around me and

1824
01:44:17.271 --> 01:44:19.820
with Kickstarter,
I wa I was able to,
you know,

1825
01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:23.750
they have people over there who are kind of like around to like help you kind of

1826
01:44:23.751 --> 01:44:27.440
figure out how to put a project together.
I built the campaign in three weeks.

1827
01:44:27.441 --> 01:44:28.820
I launched it in April.

1828
01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:33.470
And one of the rules about crowdfunding and Kickstarter specifically,

1829
01:44:33.471 --> 01:44:36.650
it's not hard and fast rule.
It's not like can rules that they enforce,

1830
01:44:36.651 --> 01:44:39.410
but it's just like a rule of thumb that if you raise half of your money in the

1831
01:44:39.411 --> 01:44:41.060
first week,
you'll probably fun fully.

1832
01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:45.980
So we had raised half of our money in that first week and then I started hiring

1833
01:44:45.981 --> 01:44:50.700
people,
uh,
on the film.
Um,
and we rea,

1834
01:44:50.701 --> 01:44:53.720
we did raise a lot of money for a feature.
It was about $200,000 that we raised.

1835
01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:56.450
And so that was what we had to make the movie.
Um,

1836
01:44:56.510 --> 01:45:00.680
and so originally it was,
we were going to make it nine days,

1837
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:04.520
but I realized if I made it faster,
I'd have more money available to me.

1838
01:45:04.521 --> 01:45:08.030
Like daily,
I'd have to like,
my daily resource load would be higher.

1839
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:11.930
So we cut the scheduled from nine days to seven days,

1840
01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:14.900
which is incredibly aggressive for a feature.

1841
01:45:14.901 --> 01:45:18.050
Whenever I tell people I made it in seven days,
they ask,
well how is it a short?

1842
01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:22.880
But,
um,
so we had to be really aggressive.

1843
01:45:22.881 --> 01:45:24.410
So everything we know,

1844
01:45:24.411 --> 01:45:29.411
we ended up doing it in this way that was so terrifying and so breakneck but so

1845
01:45:30.021 --> 01:45:30.920
exhilarating,

1846
01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:35.510
which is that we shot the first 15 pages of the movie in the first day and then

1847
01:45:35.511 --> 01:45:39.130
we shot that next 65 pages of the movie.
It was actually,

1848
01:45:39.131 --> 01:45:40.510
you said about 17 pages on the first date,

1849
01:45:40.511 --> 01:45:44.030
about six 67 pages on day two through seven.
Uh,

1850
01:45:44.031 --> 01:45:48.130
and that meant that the actor had to do 67 pages of dialogue day.
Uh,

1851
01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:49.940
for people that don't know,

1852
01:45:49.941 --> 01:45:54.170
typically on a movie you do like between three and six pages of dialogue a day.

1853
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:57.860
So he was essentially doing the entire movie all the way through every day,

1854
01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.340
locked in a hot car with no air conditioning in,
in,
in May,

1855
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:05.390
the beginning of June,
essentially in Los Angeles.
Uh,

1856
01:46:05.391 --> 01:46:07.910
and it was just so intense,

1857
01:46:07.911 --> 01:46:11.870
but we shot three cameras.
So by day three,

1858
01:46:11.871 --> 01:46:15.230
we essentially had the entire movie in the can because,
you know,

1859
01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:17.180
we were doing the whole thing all the way through from three angles.

1860
01:46:17.181 --> 01:46:21.260
So my day to be at six and goals and we had the whole movie on,
on,
uh,
you know,

1861
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:24.050
not on wax,
on the digital version of wax.

1862
01:46:24.051 --> 01:46:27.960
And so then the next four days we're just about kind of creative play.
And,

1863
01:46:28.230 --> 01:46:32.650
and I think that what the result is,
is this,
I made a movie in a week.

1864
01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:36.090
Um,
it's experimental.
It's unusual.
It,

1865
01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:41.640
it's transporting and strange and going in,

1866
01:46:41.991 --> 01:46:43.520
I thought,
I'll never make a movie this way again,

1867
01:46:43.521 --> 01:46:46.550
but now I would make a movie that way again because,
um,

1868
01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:49.860
I just didn't have any time to,
to

1869
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:54.660
<v 5>be afraid or feel down.
I just,
there was no time to be,
to,</v>

1870
01:46:54.710 --> 01:46:59.370
to be anxious.
I just had to go.
It was really,
it was,
it was wonderful.
It was,

1871
01:46:59.371 --> 01:47:01.350
it was this like one of the seminal experiences

1872
01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:02.213
<v 2>because of my life.</v>

1873
01:47:03.110 --> 01:47:08.110
There's definitely some magic in the ether when you have a hyper aggressive

1874
01:47:10.311 --> 01:47:10.731
deadline,

1875
01:47:10.731 --> 01:47:15.530
there's just something that happens to the space time continuum and what you can

1876
01:47:15.531 --> 01:47:16.610
achieve.
Yeah.

1877
01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:21.180
When everything gets compressed that intensely.
Yes.

1878
01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:24.210
<v 5>Certain things just come to the surface like it.</v>

1879
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:27.640
Certain things I've thrown into relief and it's not like you can't make
mistakes,

1880
01:47:27.970 --> 01:47:32.950
but I think you get a clarity sometimes because you can't dither.

1881
01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:37.000
Right.
You can't.
You can't.
There's,
there is no time for paralysis by analysis.

1882
01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:41.680
I am making this decision.
I'm making it definitively.
It may be the wrong one,

1883
01:47:41.710 --> 01:47:45.010
but I'm going to lean all the way into it and we're going to see what happens

1884
01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.670
and also because we shot the whole movie all the way through.
If I,

1885
01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:53.680
if there were errors I had the next day to recalibrate in a way that you don't

1886
01:47:55.061 --> 01:47:57.730
get when you typically make a movie for people again who don't know,

1887
01:47:58.150 --> 01:47:59.830
like on a like on it,
you know,
I'm an actor as well.

1888
01:47:59.831 --> 01:48:02.410
So like when I'm on a TV show or I'm doing a movie or whatever,

1889
01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:04.330
I'll leave at the end of the day and go,
Oh shit man,

1890
01:48:04.331 --> 01:48:07.870
I wish I'd done this with that scene.
I wish I tried this.
But every day,

1891
01:48:07.871 --> 01:48:09.670
the next day we got to wake up and go,
you know what?

1892
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:12.070
We have a whole new bite at this apple.

1893
01:48:12.190 --> 01:48:14.980
We're going to do it a whole different way today.
Um,

1894
01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:17.650
and so at the end I really felt like we,

1895
01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:21.310
we really fully explored the material which would not have,

1896
01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:24.430
we wouldn't have been able to do if we had making movie in seven days and not

1897
01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:28.300
doing it like with this kind of volume approach that we had.

1898
01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:35.200
<v 2>So I'm looking at text in a book that you contributed to,</v>

1899
01:48:35.530 --> 01:48:38.720
happens to be this,
this,
this.

1900
01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:43.390
I've tried to mend this fantastic book.
Oh,
let me see here it is for the,

1901
01:48:43.391 --> 01:48:47.050
for those of you who get the,
for the,
for those of you who get the,

1902
01:48:47.051 --> 01:48:51.070
what about Bob Reference,
there's this groundbreaking new book.
Oh yes,
here it is.

1903
01:48:51.071 --> 01:48:54.880
And there's an entire shelf of the therapist's own bucket.
Uh,
Richard Dreyfus.

1904
01:48:54.881 --> 01:48:58.390
In any case,
the,
the question to what you would put on a gigantic billboard,

1905
01:48:58.810 --> 01:49:02.230
metaphorically speaking to get a message to millions or billions of people.

1906
01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:07.620
In this case what you selected was a Jack Canfield quote.

1907
01:49:07.721 --> 01:49:12.721
Everything you want is on the other side of fear and many of the stories that

1908
01:49:13.091 --> 01:49:16.210
you've told so far illustrate that.
Certainly.

1909
01:49:17.090 --> 01:49:18.820
What are you afraid of now?

1910
01:49:18.821 --> 01:49:23.821
Or what fear are you hoping say in the next year to get on the other side of,

1911
01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:27.190
does anything come to mind?

1912
01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:34.430
<v 5>That's a good question.
Well,
you know,</v>

1913
01:49:34.431 --> 01:49:36.830
it's interesting cause like I think like the one that feels the most obvious,

1914
01:49:36.831 --> 01:49:40.830
it's like I'm afraid I won't get to make another film,
but I,
I,
I,

1915
01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.820
I'm not really legitimately afraid of that because I feel like I'm just going to

1916
01:49:43.821 --> 01:49:45.510
put this next movie together and make it like,
you know what?

1917
01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:49.180
Like I didn't know that I've done one like no help and no assistance from

1918
01:49:49.181 --> 01:49:54.130
anybody.
Like the next one's going to be cake.
Um,
I mean I had help.
I had my team,

1919
01:49:54.131 --> 01:49:56.830
but I didn't have the kind of traditional Hollywood help or I'd like a team of

1920
01:49:56.831 --> 01:49:58.960
agents kind of,
you know,
making magic.

1921
01:49:58.961 --> 01:50:02.350
Like it was really just like a scrappy little group of filmmakers,
you know,

1922
01:50:02.351 --> 01:50:05.670
doing this film would meet the,
the lead actor and screenwriter and,
and uh,
and,

1923
01:50:05.671 --> 01:50:09.340
and my creative executives.
It was a small group of people,
you know,
outside,

1924
01:50:09.341 --> 01:50:12.100
completely outside of the system.
Um,

1925
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:16.970
but what am I afraid of?
God,
that's a really good,

1926
01:50:17.150 --> 01:50:19.280
and that it's not that I'm fearless,
it,

1927
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:24.310
it may just be that the things that are interesting to me now don't engender

1928
01:50:24.771 --> 01:50:29.690
fear the way that they used to.
I can also,
I can also,

1929
01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:33.980
I think tackle this from a different angle,
which is what do you currently,

1930
01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:38.210
what is one of your greatest struggles right now?
What do you struggle with?

1931
01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:43.630
Uh,
if,
uh,
if,
if anything,
you know,
I,
I,

1932
01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:46.630
my main struggle is just always a being as effective as I want to be.

1933
01:50:46.930 --> 01:50:49.330
You know what I mean?
I'm just super ambitious.

1934
01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:53.470
I have like highly developed.

1935
01:50:53.471 --> 01:50:58.260
I don't mean like I'm good at it.
I mean like,
it's like very far advanced.
Uh,

1936
01:50:58.330 --> 01:51:02.370
like workaholism I mean like,
like I have pathological,
we're calling them.
It's,

1937
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:06.430
it's like a sickness.
And when I tell,
whenever I say I'm workaholic,

1938
01:51:06.431 --> 01:51:09.940
people always laugh and I go look,
look at it.
Like it's a problem,
you know?

1939
01:51:09.941 --> 01:51:12.880
I don't know how to rest.
Um,
I don't,
I don't,

1940
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:18.220
it's not that I don't like to play.
I do like play,
but,
um,

1941
01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:22.730
like I don't think I have any time to,
to rest I and,

1942
01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:25.920
and I worry that it makes me,
it,
it,

1943
01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:29.020
it could result in me not being an interesting artists because I think you need

1944
01:51:29.021 --> 01:51:31.480
to play into daydream and to rest and to experience things,

1945
01:51:31.481 --> 01:51:34.600
to be able to tell interesting stories.
You know,
no one wants to hear about,

1946
01:51:34.601 --> 01:51:37.840
you know,
your daily trek from your home to your office.
It's just not compelling.

1947
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:42.940
I remember,
you know,
I think it was Amanda Palmer said this,

1948
01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:47.110
I apologize to ever set it if a misattributing uh,
but the,

1949
01:51:47.170 --> 01:51:51.590
the Amanda Palmer creative musician extraordinaire and she said,
you don't,

1950
01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:55.660
God,
I think it was her who said in order to ha she married to Neil Gaiman.

1951
01:51:55.661 --> 01:51:58.570
She is,
yeah.
All the time.
Okay.
Yeah,
exactly.

1952
01:51:58.690 --> 01:52:02.890
For those of you who are you and after me,
yeah.
Yeah.
I will.

1953
01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:04.690
I will bow at the feet of Neil,

1954
01:52:04.691 --> 01:52:09.691
came in as a writer and everybody should listen to his audio book of the

1955
01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:14.380
Graveyard Book narrated by him.
He is also the most soothing voice imaginable.

1956
01:52:14.410 --> 01:52:18.760
But I digress.
Uh,
what the fuck was I saying?
Uh,

1957
01:52:19.290 --> 01:52:23.770
Amanda Palmer has a quote.
Ah,
yes.
That,
uh,
either if,
if life,

1958
01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:29.200
uh,
if,
if art imitates life,
in order to create art,
you have to have a life,

1959
01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:33.220
right?
Yeah.
Yeah,
absolutely.
And,
and like,
and I'm paraphrasing,
it's butchered.

1960
01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:36.910
It makes the point that you can't,
you know,
I'm sure there are other theories.

1961
01:52:36.911 --> 01:52:41.440
There's,
I,
there's a very famous French writer.
It's not sounds but sits.
It's,

1962
01:52:41.730 --> 01:52:45.950
uh,
it's somebody anyway about like have bourgeois leaf and be real

1963
01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:49.450
<v 4>life and be radical in your work.
But I actually don't think I,
I,</v>

1964
01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:51.300
and I actually think that you,

1965
01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.450
you need to be fully engaged in your life in order to be an interesting artist.

1966
01:52:54.750 --> 01:52:57.360
Um,
because you know,

1967
01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:02.460
you need to be alive to be able to speak about the human condition.

1968
01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:04.800
<v 1>So if you've had,</v>

1969
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:09.620
if you have advanced early onset workoholism,
right.

1970
01:53:09.621 --> 01:53:10.070
You've,

1971
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:15.070
you've really turned this into a default mode.

1972
01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:19.190
What are you doing anything to,

1973
01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:25.160
to try and manage that or create more slack in the system for the daydreaming

1974
01:53:27.651 --> 01:53:28.484
and so on?

1975
01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:31.200
<v 4>I mean,
it's like,
that's my daily practice.
That's my life.</v>

1976
01:53:31.470 --> 01:53:32.670
That's my one day at a time.

1977
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:38.470
Like just constantly trying to remind myself to rest.

1978
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:43.530
Um,
I,
I engage socially a lot more than I used to.
Uh,
my social,

1979
01:53:43.531 --> 01:53:47.760
you mean out in the real world?
The real world.
I can go out and I,
and I,
you know,

1980
01:53:47.761 --> 01:53:50.070
I try to not just be like,
you know,

1981
01:53:50.071 --> 01:53:53.310
I just had a period of life where I was just like up Jim,
work,
sleep,
you know,

1982
01:53:53.311 --> 01:53:56.410
and just,
I just remember one day I was like,
I'm going to die.
Like the,

1983
01:53:56.430 --> 01:54:00.830
I'm going to,
I'm going to die of boredom.
I bore myself,
you know what I mean?

1984
01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:03.960
And so,
you know,
like I,

1985
01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:07.590
I think I try to court danger in a safe way.

1986
01:54:07.591 --> 01:54:11.010
It's not like I'm jumping on a plane with no parachute or bull fighting or you

1987
01:54:11.011 --> 01:54:15.030
know,
bare knuckle brawling in an alley,
you know,
filled with needles.
But I,

1988
01:54:15.031 --> 01:54:18.570
but I am trying to dislike B,
B.

1989
01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:21.120
Not always have my head in my computer,
but,
but look,

1990
01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:24.560
the reason that people are workaholics,
well,

1991
01:54:24.570 --> 01:54:26.790
there's lots of reasons I'm sure social presses,
but for me,

1992
01:54:26.791 --> 01:54:31.560
I just get this big like serotonin release as a Serotonin was the brain.

1993
01:54:31.561 --> 01:54:35.070
What's the satisfaction drug up dopamine,

1994
01:54:35.071 --> 01:54:39.960
perhaps dopamine,
Serotonin,
sleepy,
sleepy time.
Uh,
yeah.
I mean,

1995
01:54:39.961 --> 01:54:44.040
I get a dopamine release when I,
when I complete tasks and I just,
you know,
I get,

1996
01:54:44.130 --> 01:54:46.650
I get higher and higher.
The more that I execute,

1997
01:54:46.651 --> 01:54:49.560
I find executing in and of itself really enjoyable.

1998
01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:53.640
So I'm just trying to apply that aggression to like,
like leisure.

1999
01:54:53.641 --> 01:54:56.110
Like can I get the same satisfaction from it?
If I,
if I,

2000
01:54:56.220 --> 01:54:59.550
if I make it to do list and one of the things is have fun,
well,

2001
01:54:59.551 --> 01:55:03.850
I get the same dopamine release.
If I had a lot of fun,
um,

2002
01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:11.040
how can I turn fun into work most effectively?
Then I'd be like,
ah,

2003
01:55:11.041 --> 01:55:15.960
I don't know about you guys,
but I just fucking crushed my to do list.
You know?
I,

2004
01:55:15.961 --> 01:55:20.550
uh,
I,
I realized that like,
I,
even though I can feel very harried,

2005
01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:26.180
it's interesting to me to be feeling like a part of being on this planet to like

2006
01:55:26.190 --> 01:55:30.750
fully engaging and doing everything I can do and everything I'm interested in

2007
01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:33.900
and am because I don't want to look back and be like,
man,

2008
01:55:33.901 --> 01:55:36.030
I should have tried that.
I'm happy to look back and say,
man,

2009
01:55:36.031 --> 01:55:38.900
I tried that and it went terribly for me.
That's a,

2010
01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:41.130
that's a perfectly comfortable space for me to be like,
man,

2011
01:55:41.131 --> 01:55:44.620
I tried that and I completely shit the bed.
But,
but what,

2012
01:55:44.630 --> 01:55:48.620
what I find very uncomfortable is the idea that I always wanted to do something

2013
01:55:48.621 --> 01:55:50.820
and I never did it.
And so that's what I fear.

2014
01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.750
What I fear is what I fear is not,

2015
01:55:55.470 --> 01:56:00.060
is not trying,
not experiencing all the things that I want to experience.

2016
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:05.530
<v 2>How do you think you get some money?
Yeah.
How do you think your life,
because you,</v>

2017
01:56:05.531 --> 01:56:08.740
you have,
you live so aggressively,

2018
01:56:09.070 --> 01:56:14.070
you milk the most out of the hours that you have.

2019
01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:19.620
How would you or your life be different if you didn't have exercise as an

2020
01:56:20.561 --> 01:56:22.000
element do you think?

2021
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:26.080
<v 4>Well,
it's interesting because I really,</v>

2022
01:56:26.170 --> 01:56:29.320
I really love working out,
uh,

2023
01:56:29.530 --> 01:56:34.030
but there's a constant battle for me between like being effective,

2024
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:36.570
like with work and like,
you know,
I,
I'm,

2025
01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:40.270
I'm the queen of like getting up at like 5:00 AM to work out putting on my

2026
01:56:40.271 --> 01:56:42.670
workout clothes and them being in front of my computer at four o'clock in the

2027
01:56:42.671 --> 01:56:45.340
afternoon and I haven't moved.
Like,
I mean,
that's just like my,

2028
01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:48.880
as just a normal day.
Like didn't,
didn't move,
didn't eat and do anything,

2029
01:56:48.881 --> 01:56:53.230
just been in front of the computer for like 11 hours.
Um,
but it just,

2030
01:56:53.490 --> 01:56:55.390
it's just such a great stress manager.

2031
01:56:55.391 --> 01:56:59.200
And I also think that there's another thing there,
which is it just,
again,

2032
01:56:59.201 --> 01:57:01.600
like puts you back in your body,
you know,

2033
01:57:01.601 --> 01:57:05.770
this like thing that's carrying your brain around and making you effective.

2034
01:57:05.771 --> 01:57:07.540
And you know,
I'm,

2035
01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:13.500
I think that with everything that all of the stimulus that we stimuli that we

2036
01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:15.160
experienced nowadays,

2037
01:57:15.161 --> 01:57:18.700
all the pictures and the images of perfection that are coming in at a much

2038
01:57:18.701 --> 01:57:21.600
faster and more voluminous pace,
it's really easy to fall into like a,

2039
01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:24.430
like an abusive relationship with,
with exercise,

2040
01:57:24.431 --> 01:57:26.830
either doing it so much that you know,

2041
01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:29.830
you're hurting yourself or not doing it.

2042
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:33.030
And then the engaging that inner monologue about how you're like,

2043
01:57:33.031 --> 01:57:34.390
you're worthless and you can't get your shit together.

2044
01:57:34.391 --> 01:57:35.860
And I don't have either of those things.

2045
01:57:35.861 --> 01:57:39.520
I just know I'm happier and better when I work out a,
but I don't,
I don't,

2046
01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:43.570
I don't do,
I've finally dropped the monologue about like,
you know,
I'm like,
no,

2047
01:57:43.630 --> 01:57:47.230
I'm not.
I'm not a good person if I don't like,
I've,
I don't crush your workout.

2048
01:57:47.231 --> 01:57:50.830
I just try to do it every day because I know what I'm better mentally.

2049
01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:54.610
And I also cheat completely.
Like I have my five hot,
took a hike today,
you know,

2050
01:57:54.611 --> 01:57:56.710
I had my phone with me and like,
I stopped every 10 minutes.
Like,

2051
01:57:56.711 --> 01:57:59.680
write something down,
you know,

2052
01:57:59.681 --> 01:58:02.440
I'm not really like fully and I'm not being in the moment when I'm working out.

2053
01:58:02.441 --> 01:58:05.230
A lot of times I'm stopping like in the hundreds of times to make notes and

2054
01:58:05.231 --> 01:58:07.600
remind myself of stuff I have to do or put stuff on my calendar.

2055
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:10.010
<v 2>Do you still use a concept too</v>

2056
01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:13.460
<v 4>or rowing machine?
I still use my grandmother or my constituted commoner.</v>

2057
01:58:13.490 --> 01:58:16.490
I have had it since 2000.
It is 18 years old.

2058
01:58:16.491 --> 01:58:21.330
I have never had to repair it or replace any parts.
Uh,
it's,
uh,
it's the best.

2059
01:58:21.331 --> 01:58:24.240
It's the single best piece of equipment that I have my whole gym now I have my

2060
01:58:24.241 --> 01:58:28.290
whole gym.
I'm in my place.
I have a TRX bodyweight system.

2061
01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:32.040
I have two kettle bells at 25 and 35.
I have my org arbiter.

2062
01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:34.860
I have battle ropes that are attached to my dining room table.

2063
01:58:35.190 --> 01:58:39.810
And I have one big power step that I just used to do like pistols and stuff like

2064
01:58:39.811 --> 01:58:43.840
that.
And I get everything done with five things.
That is fantastic.

2065
01:58:43.841 --> 01:58:47.230
So pistols for villa donor,
those are one legged squats.
Uh,

2066
01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:51.180
and uh,
they can be very,
very difficult,
uh,

2067
01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:54.730
dependent depending on how you go about it or a step can help you because it

2068
01:58:54.731 --> 01:58:58.000
could just kind of do like single leg step downs until you build up your,

2069
01:58:58.030 --> 01:59:00.070
your quad and your glute strength to do pistols.

2070
01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:05.160
What could you describe for us a recent workout or what a prototypical work out

2071
01:59:06.041 --> 01:59:09.590
of yours might look like?
Um,
well I,

2072
01:59:09.850 --> 01:59:11.870
I hike today that was just like a 90 minute hike,

2073
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:14.790
which is this more about like feeling groovy.
But,
um,

2074
01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:18.070
right now I'm obsessed with my urometer.
Uh,
I like,

2075
01:59:18.071 --> 01:59:20.440
I kind of go through periods of like mount rowing and then periods of rowing

2076
01:59:20.441 --> 01:59:25.180
really aggressively.
And uh,
this is,
this is gonna be right up your alley,
Tim.

2077
01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:29.950
I'm ready.
This is like center,
this is like Bullseye for you and your audience.

2078
01:59:30.250 --> 01:59:34.600
I started going to a naturopath so I'd be like supplementing differently and I

2079
01:59:34.601 --> 01:59:39.601
started taking good if I on and I'm rowing like faster now than I did in my

2080
01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:46.060
twenties.
Like I just keep getting personal bests on it,
bro.
It's confusing.
I'm,

2081
01:59:46.061 --> 01:59:47.950
I'm,
I'm a lot older than I am,

2082
01:59:47.951 --> 01:59:49.930
a lot older than I was when I was running competitively.

2083
01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:53.890
And I just keep like knocking like 30 seconds and then 45 seconds and then a

2084
01:59:53.891 --> 01:59:55.530
minute and 10 seconds off my rowing times.

2085
01:59:55.531 --> 01:59:59.290
So now I'm just obsessed with by kidding,
personal best every time I row.
Okay.

2086
01:59:59.710 --> 02:00:04.000
Let's dig into this.
So the Glutathione,
uh,

2087
02:00:04.210 --> 02:00:09.190
how is it for those who aren't familiar glutosiome is thought of a simple way to

2088
02:00:09.191 --> 02:00:12.490
think of it or the way it's often described as,

2089
02:00:12.491 --> 02:00:16.270
as a a master antioxidant of sorts.
Uh,

2090
02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:20.270
how are you having administered?
Is it being in that,
oh,

2091
02:00:20.290 --> 02:00:23.710
this is so inside baseball sometimes I get Ivs,
I get ivs if I really like,

2092
02:00:23.711 --> 02:00:27.580
if I'm a wreck,
it's like if I travel a lot or I went to Coachella.
And is that,

2093
02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:30.730
is that pure,
is that,
is that,
is that pure,

2094
02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:34.930
is that just gludethyon or are you doing that at the B vitamins?

2095
02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:35.950
I can do at the end of my IB,

2096
02:00:35.951 --> 02:00:39.490
I'll get like B vitamins and glutathione push at the end.

2097
02:00:40.810 --> 02:00:41.501
But you can get,

2098
02:00:41.501 --> 02:00:44.410
you can get like fat soluble can get this like fat soluble good Osi on that.

2099
02:00:44.411 --> 02:00:47.530
You just take a,
you just like gulped down

2100
02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:52.410
like axle grease.
Yeah,
I

2101
02:00:54.250 --> 02:00:58.680
is this,
what is this company a lipid?
It's lipid spheric.
That's the name.

2102
02:00:58.681 --> 02:01:01.210
Like the spirit.
Yeah.

2103
02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:04.510
I remember getting into the glutathione because before the glue of the fine,

2104
02:01:04.511 --> 02:01:08.890
I was running slow and now I'm just like a Jack Rabbit so it could be something

2105
02:01:08.891 --> 02:01:11.050
else,
but I'm going to,
I'm going to say it's the good if I on,

2106
02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:12.910
I will warn people in advance.

2107
02:01:12.970 --> 02:01:16.600
I had some of this life life spheric Ethan at one point and I gave it to a

2108
02:01:16.601 --> 02:01:21.040
friend of mine and I think it might've been for those who know my buddy Kevin

2109
02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:24.820
Rose since I like to mention him even miss attribute things to him just for fun.

2110
02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:29.080
Um,
I think I gave him one and he said something like,
what is this horse semen?

2111
02:01:29.081 --> 02:01:30.280
It does have a weird,

2112
02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:35.830
very weird consistency and Tara,
no,

2113
02:01:35.831 --> 02:01:37.880
my father calls it axle grease.
That's what he's like,

2114
02:01:38.170 --> 02:01:41.390
give me this axle grease because I gave it to my dad.
I was like,

2115
02:01:41.391 --> 02:01:44.990
I think this would really help you and you're supposed to take it and liquid.

2116
02:01:44.991 --> 02:01:47.210
But he's just been eating on a spoon and he's up.
He's up.

2117
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:48.620
He's a better man than I.
Oh,

2118
02:01:48.621 --> 02:01:52.730
I just like squeegee it out of the little packet into your mouth to mouth.

2119
02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:54.561
I take it,

2120
02:01:54.561 --> 02:01:58.310
I take it with like about to like two ounces of Kombucha and the morning so I

2121
02:01:58.311 --> 02:02:01.670
don't have to think about it,
but he'll like,
I've take soap.
I mean you're,

2122
02:02:01.671 --> 02:02:02.780
I'm sure you're like this or maybe you,

2123
02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:04.670
maybe after all of that experimentation on yourself,

2124
02:02:04.671 --> 02:02:07.940
you just get up and have a bowl,
like frosted flakes in the morning.
10.

2125
02:02:07.970 --> 02:02:10.640
But you know,
it's like I do that.
I'm,

2126
02:02:10.650 --> 02:02:14.270
I have my bowl of supplements so that I have my fish oil and then I have my

2127
02:02:14.330 --> 02:02:18.210
curcumin and then I haven't my turmeric like by the end of the morning,
like I,

2128
02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:21.200
I've just,
I've supplemented that.
It's like a banquet.

2129
02:02:21.201 --> 02:02:23.840
Like I don't even need to eat.
I've taken so many crappy tablets

2130
02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:27.560
just to just hit pause again.

2131
02:02:27.561 --> 02:02:31.670
So you is the exercise before breakfast,

2132
02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:35.270
is it the first thing you do?
What is your first ideal morning?

2133
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:38.940
What's the first 90 minutes?
60 to 90 minutes of like,

2134
02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:44.120
um,
uh,
a special shot glutathione.
What time?
What time do you wake up?

2135
02:02:44.850 --> 02:02:48.280
It depends on the day.
Like,
you know,
between like six and seven.
Okay.

2136
02:02:48.330 --> 02:02:49.250
I just pick up a lot earlier,

2137
02:02:49.251 --> 02:02:51.830
but I let one of my shows go so I don't have to wake up at the crack of dawn

2138
02:02:51.831 --> 02:02:52.400
every day anymore.

2139
02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:56.720
So it's like between like six and seven o'clock and then work out in the morning

2140
02:02:56.721 --> 02:02:58.670
or I won't get,
I won't,
I won't wake up.

2141
02:02:58.730 --> 02:03:03.730
You have espresso shot glutosiome with always have coffee before I work out,

2142
02:03:03.890 --> 02:03:07.190
like without fail.
And then the glue to phone with the Kombucha.

2143
02:03:08.060 --> 02:03:11.990
Any particular type of Kombucha that's your preferred axle?
Grease mixer.

2144
02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.610
I like better booch um,
and I like,

2145
02:03:16.611 --> 02:03:20.720
was it life fade I think is one of the other,
I love Kombucha.
I'm just,
I'm,
I'm,

2146
02:03:20.721 --> 02:03:24.630
I'm very,
I'm s I'm very slutty when it comes to come put y'all drink.
They come.

2147
02:03:24.850 --> 02:03:29.270
It's a fan.
All right.
So then,
then you,
then you buckled down to workout.

2148
02:03:29.810 --> 02:03:34.580
And this is going to sound like,
I'm just looking for opportunities to plug,

2149
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:39.380
which maybe I am,
but the,
you described your,
your work,
the one of your workouts,

2150
02:03:39.410 --> 02:03:43.460
the concept to like mid distance five k rose punctuated by short distance,

2151
02:03:43.461 --> 02:03:45.710
two k hit sprints,

2152
02:03:45.711 --> 02:03:48.830
high intensity interval training or high intensity interval training with,

2153
02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:52.040
with a 10 kid long distance rail once or twice a week.
Is that,

2154
02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:57.050
would that be the current workout?
That's typically my workouts.

2155
02:03:57.051 --> 02:04:01.010
And then I'll do like,
I'll do like,
like a set of five,
five by 25 kettle bells.

2156
02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:02.730
Sounds like,
you know,
like I'll get up one morning,

2157
02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:07.100
just do 125 kettlebell swings in front of the television and then sometimes I'll

2158
02:04:07.101 --> 02:04:11.700
do a TRX workout.
Uh,
because I didn't have really a way to stimulate pull ups.

2159
02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:15.080
So that was like,
that was why I got the CRX,
so I could do that.

2160
02:04:15.081 --> 02:04:16.970
Was like the one thing I didn't have and here was a pull up bar.

2161
02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.500
Is The TRX attached to it to a door?
Is it a,
that's like a railing,

2162
02:04:21.501 --> 02:04:22.490
like I have like a,
like a,

2163
02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:27.440
an upstairs railing and it just hangs off of the railing.
Got It.
And,
and,

2164
02:04:27.890 --> 02:04:28.910
and that's it.
I mean,
I tried,

2165
02:04:28.911 --> 02:04:32.170
I tried to keep it like relatively simple so then I'll do it.
Um,

2166
02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:35.420
I don't really train with anybody because I just can't,
I can't,

2167
02:04:35.421 --> 02:04:37.950
I can manage the hour workout,
but I can't manage the,

2168
02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:40.700
the transit between up mice home and ups.

2169
02:04:40.710 --> 02:04:43.380
I don't have enough time to do that too.
You know what I mean?

2170
02:04:43.410 --> 02:04:46.140
Like I've got the hour,
I don't have two hours,
so I just,

2171
02:04:46.170 --> 02:04:49.710
I don't go to a gym anymore because I just,
I just would be,

2172
02:04:49.711 --> 02:04:52.560
I wouldn't have the time for it.
Um,
the transit time,

2173
02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:55.950
transit time was what killed me and I was like,
I have an hour to work out,

2174
02:04:55.951 --> 02:04:59.100
but I don't have an half hour on either side of that to,
to go,
go to the gym.

2175
02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:02.160
Do you still watch shows when you row?
Totally.

2176
02:05:03.690 --> 02:05:06.000
Any recent favorites or what are you watching currently?

2177
02:05:06.330 --> 02:05:09.960
Just like fantastic junk.
Uh,
I mean some good stuff.
Like I love,

2178
02:05:09.961 --> 02:05:11.520
I watched the walking dead fear,
the walking dead.

2179
02:05:11.550 --> 02:05:14.640
That's what he's really good workout shows right now I'm watching the magicians,

2180
02:05:14.730 --> 02:05:18.480
um,
during my workouts and then when I finished that,

2181
02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.770
what will I watch after that?

2182
02:05:20.010 --> 02:05:22.710
Sometimes I watch stuff that's on streaming services cause I hate to have to,

2183
02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:23.401
when I'm growing,

2184
02:05:23.401 --> 02:05:26.640
I don't want to have to watch commercials and I can't stop to fast forward

2185
02:05:26.641 --> 02:05:31.340
because I'm trying to beat my previous road time.
So,
uh,

2186
02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:33.840
like I'll stream the extreme stuff on Hulu,

2187
02:05:33.841 --> 02:05:38.841
like a x files or Handmaid's tale or I just watched a show called Deutschland

2188
02:05:39.391 --> 02:05:44.040
83.
That was pretty great.
Um,
it has to be something that I can kind of watch,

2189
02:05:44.041 --> 02:05:47.610
which is why I'll typically watch something that's like not too mentally

2190
02:05:47.670 --> 02:05:51.090
demanding.
Uh,
you know,
so I don't,
I,
I can't,

2191
02:05:51.091 --> 02:05:53.100
I can't pay attention too closely to plot points.

2192
02:05:55.850 --> 02:05:59.160
Uh,
do you make New Year's resolutions?

2193
02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:02.910
Do you have any routines or rituals around New Year's worth?

2194
02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:05.760
We're talking just for people who may be listening to this at another time.

2195
02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:08.250
We're chatting at the end of March,

2196
02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:14.820
like any this year.
Right?
I make the same one every year,
which is to rest more.

2197
02:06:15.490 --> 02:06:17.910
I mean,
it's the same resolution every arrest.

2198
02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:21.720
So how are you going to do that this time?
I don't know.
I should just give up.

2199
02:06:21.721 --> 02:06:24.550
I should stop making resolutions and then I won't have to have not have not,

2200
02:06:26.550 --> 02:06:30.090
I mean look,
maybe,
maybe,
maybe a part of success or like,

2201
02:06:30.220 --> 02:06:32.840
like success at being you like figuring out,
being you,

2202
02:06:32.841 --> 02:06:35.610
it's like understanding what your strengths and your weaknesses are.
You know,

2203
02:06:35.611 --> 02:06:39.930
like my strength is,
my strength is,
is my aggressive work ethic.

2204
02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:44.700
And,
um,
um,
it was when I like when I was a young comic,
I would be like,
oh,

2205
02:06:44.701 --> 02:06:47.160
I should be writing every day.
I should write.
It should be like this guy.
Well,

2206
02:06:47.161 --> 02:06:49.440
like that's just not my,
that's just not how I operate.

2207
02:06:49.441 --> 02:06:54.441
So I think once you accept like what your own methodology of this is why this is

2208
02:06:54.541 --> 02:06:59.480
why you watched the Terminator 30 Times like this,
this is my people,
right?

2209
02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:03.180
I mean I have definitely have a CDM,
definitely a personality,

2210
02:07:03.181 --> 02:07:07.080
but like once you accept like this is mice,
how these are my strengths,

2211
02:07:07.081 --> 02:07:09.460
this is where I excel,
this is how I excel.

2212
02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.480
Rather than try to force yourself into someone else's like workflow,

2213
02:07:12.481 --> 02:07:16.920
like figure out what yours is.
I as a writer and you've written lots of books.

2214
02:07:16.921 --> 02:07:17.790
I've only written two,

2215
02:07:17.791 --> 02:07:22.791
but with both books I had this huge lead time and it wasn't that I was lazy or

2216
02:07:22.981 --> 02:07:24.720
procrastinate and like the book wasn't there yet.

2217
02:07:24.810 --> 02:07:27.270
And then just one day the book was there and then I sat down and I wrote the

2218
02:07:27.271 --> 02:07:31.590
entire book in a few weeks,
but it just needed to Gel.

2219
02:07:31.590 --> 02:07:32.730
It needed to synthesize.

2220
02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:35.320
And if I had been trying to sit down and kind of write a little bit every day,

2221
02:07:35.321 --> 02:07:37.660
it would have just been like this,
like big agglomeration of glop.

2222
02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:39.820
But just one day I was like,
Oh,
the book is in,

2223
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:43.600
the book is in me now the book has in me.
And then I got it out,
you know?
Oh God,

2224
02:07:43.601 --> 02:07:47.540
I wish that,
I wish I had that experience,
man of so jelly.
Oh,

2225
02:07:47.650 --> 02:07:50.110
but everybody's different.
Like a long time.

2226
02:07:50.111 --> 02:07:52.930
I would have wanted to be more like you like disciplined and sitting down and

2227
02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:54.190
because you know there's,
there's a,

2228
02:07:54.250 --> 02:07:57.910
there's a panic that didn't suit you when you are seven weeks when your deadline

2229
02:07:57.911 --> 02:08:00.590
and you had nine months to write a book.
And Yeah.

2230
02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:03.280
But it's just like that for me,

2231
02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:08.400
certain threads have to connect and that requires like rumination and,

2232
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:13.120
and time and,
and you know,
I,
I can't just can't do it any other way.
So I don't,

2233
02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:17.530
I think,
I think my strength is eating every day,

2234
02:08:17.531 --> 02:08:21.190
trying to eat a wheelbarrow full of glass and shit out diamonds or something

2235
02:08:21.191 --> 02:08:25.240
like that.
That should be a tattoo.

2236
02:08:27.260 --> 02:08:28.093
Uh,

2237
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:33.210
<v 1>well,
speaking of eating glass,
uh,
so what this is this,</v>

2238
02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:35.880
uh,
this may might be predictable,
but I'm okay with predictable.

2239
02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:40.680
I would like to start to wrap up with a handful of questions.

2240
02:08:40.681 --> 02:08:42.660
And the first one I'm going to ask is,

2241
02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:48.120
and you actually give people a head a heads up on this with the self inflicted

2242
02:08:49.201 --> 02:08:53.740
wounds.
So,
uh,
usually say at some point I'm going to ask you about x,

2243
02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:56.460
but I'm,
I'm sure you've had time to think about this.

2244
02:08:56.790 --> 02:09:01.790
So do you have any favorite stories of self inflicted wounds of your own that

2245
02:09:05.161 --> 02:09:06.270
you could,
that you could share?

2246
02:09:06.590 --> 02:09:09.890
<v 4>I mean,
obviously the book is just a collection,
not even a comprehensive one,
but,</v>

2247
02:09:09.891 --> 02:09:13.700
but,
but quite detailed of many,
many mistakes that I've made.
Um,

2248
02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:16.760
I'm trying to think of something that's happened recently.
It's,
it's interesting.

2249
02:09:16.761 --> 02:09:19.400
I see my mistakes differently now than I did when I was younger.

2250
02:09:19.401 --> 02:09:24.401
They just feel like an aspect of being human versus like some kind of tragic,

2251
02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:26.810
uh,
why exactly.

2252
02:09:26.811 --> 02:09:29.970
They just see it just seemed like an unavoidable aspect of being alive.
Um,

2253
02:09:30.210 --> 02:09:32.870
and I'm trying to think if there's,
if there's one like,

2254
02:09:32.871 --> 02:09:34.880
and then I'm thinking of ones that recently that don't feel like that,

2255
02:09:34.881 --> 02:09:38.050
that cataclysmic.
So they're like,
they're like lame,
lame stories.

2256
02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:41.980
<v 1>Oh,
you could pick a classic,
uh,
also like the,
the,
the greatest hits.</v>

2257
02:09:41.981 --> 02:09:46.570
Like if you're watching TV 15 years ago and it's like hits from the 80s,

2258
02:09:47.710 --> 02:09:50.040
we could,
we could take one of those as well.
Okay.

2259
02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:54.030
<v 4>Of that.
Um,
Oh God,
uh,</v>

2260
02:09:56.910 --> 02:10:00.280
think of it.
I think Megan,
Megan,
Megan,
we're going to go anyway.
It's interesting.

2261
02:10:00.281 --> 02:10:04.570
Like I was talking about that short film that I made,
uh,
that,
um,

2262
02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:09.100
uh,
that was like the one that will never be seen by any human being.
I actually,

2263
02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:11.170
I think it's been destroyed where it was just like,

2264
02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:14.440
I just thought that I could just charm my way to this short.

2265
02:10:14.441 --> 02:10:17.950
And I had a bunch of friends kind of show up and it was such an odd,

2266
02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.800
it was such an odd idea.
I didn't even make any sense.

2267
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:24.820
It was about a guy who flashed women,
uh,

2268
02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:28.450
and um,

2269
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:32.590
he flashed women and I can't remember why he flashed women,

2270
02:10:32.591 --> 02:10:37.390
but it was to do with like bravery.
Uh,

2271
02:10:38.570 --> 02:10:43.570
it was like a metaphor for bravery that the sky would like flash women and,

2272
02:10:43.821 --> 02:10:45.440
and also maybe like,
like Hubris,

2273
02:10:45.450 --> 02:10:48.410
like the idea that like people are going to be super excited to see this guy's

2274
02:10:48.411 --> 02:10:51.080
penis and he would kind of like try to use it as currency and it would never

2275
02:10:51.081 --> 02:10:53.810
kind of go his way,
but it just made no sense.

2276
02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:57.290
It just ended up being like a series of vignettes about a guy like reeling his

2277
02:10:57.291 --> 02:11:00.020
penis straight.
Harris.
I just remember at the end,

2278
02:11:00.021 --> 02:11:02.870
like literally thinking it's one thing to think like people don't get me.

2279
02:11:02.871 --> 02:11:07.340
I was like,
I don't get myself,
I
accomplish here.

2280
02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:11.930
Um,
and it was,
it,
it,
it,
it just never ever coalesced.
But,

2281
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:14.600
but it was,
it was fine because it was like,

2282
02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:18.050
I remember kind of enjoying the process of making it and then being really kind

2283
02:11:18.051 --> 02:11:19.760
of surprised and delighted by what a piece of shit.

2284
02:11:19.761 --> 02:11:23.180
It was a much like that set where nobody laughed.
I thought,
well man,

2285
02:11:23.181 --> 02:11:28.010
that didn't work at all.
Okay,
I need to go back and figure out what to do next.

2286
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:30.650
And I think like,
I think every artist,
you know,

2287
02:11:30.651 --> 02:11:33.290
I think Quentin Tarantino is a famous story about his first film being

2288
02:11:33.291 --> 02:11:37.910
unwatchable,
you know?
Um,
I think,
I just think,
you know,

2289
02:11:37.911 --> 02:11:41.360
sometimes if,
if your personality is to be really aggressive and kind of dive in,

2290
02:11:41.670 --> 02:11:45.770
you're bound,
you're bound to make some spectacular failures,
you know,
and,

2291
02:11:45.771 --> 02:11:49.460
and you just have to have a high tolerance for that and,
and,

2292
02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.720
and not take it personally and keep moving forward.
But yeah,

2293
02:11:53.721 --> 02:11:57.360
I literally was like,
I know you guys don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't know.

2294
02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:00.740
I can't explain it to you if I have no idea what I was thinking.

2295
02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:03.380
Thank you for putting yourselves in my hands.
It was a terrible mistake.

2296
02:12:03.381 --> 02:12:07.070
On your part,
but you're very gracious to have trusting me with your lives.

2297
02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:10.340
What does,
what's the name of the short,
it was called the Wipper

2298
02:12:13.330 --> 02:12:16.490
all sorts of images and it makes no sense whatsoever.

2299
02:12:17.330 --> 02:12:21.080
When have you been extremely proud of yourself?

2300
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:23.510
Could be any point in your life.
Can you,

2301
02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:27.760
can you think of standout point where you're like,

2302
02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:31.220
God damn like,
good for me.
Fucking I hate,

2303
02:12:31.221 --> 02:12:33.800
I hate to have it be about this because it sounds like it's super self

2304
02:12:33.801 --> 02:12:38.540
promotional,
but I really am proud of this film and I,
for a variety of reasons,

2305
02:12:38.541 --> 02:12:42.040
I think because it,
it didn't,
it did was yeah.

2306
02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:44.900
Access because it was such a,
um,

2307
02:12:45.170 --> 02:12:48.620
I mean I was lucky that I was brought a great script and I add a really talented

2308
02:12:48.621 --> 02:12:53.450
actor,
but we put this movie together like so quickly.
Um,

2309
02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:55.760
and I knew and I had a vision for it,
but I also was,

2310
02:12:55.940 --> 02:13:00.410
because we were moving so fast to feeling my way,
it's too dark in some aspect.

2311
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:02.740
And I think one of the reasons why it,

2312
02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:05.840
it came together the way that it did was because I was,
I was both,

2313
02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:09.910
I both had a vision for the film,
but I was open to modulating.

2314
02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:12.050
And I think that's really important in anything that you're doing,

2315
02:13:12.051 --> 02:13:13.100
no matter what field you're in,

2316
02:13:13.101 --> 02:13:16.820
is that you have to both we prize vision and kind of rigidity and in this

2317
02:13:16.821 --> 02:13:17.151
culture.

2318
02:13:17.151 --> 02:13:22.151
But I think that being able to pivot and be nimble is way more important than

2319
02:13:22.821 --> 02:13:25.020
being kind of a rigid visionary.
Um,

2320
02:13:25.070 --> 02:13:28.490
you have to be able to look at data and interpreted and then apply it to your

2321
02:13:28.491 --> 02:13:32.100
situation.
Or are you just,
you're just to keep banging your head against

2322
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:35.850
<v 5>the wall.
So,
you know,
we,
we made this movie,
we,</v>

2323
02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:39.930
we got into the very first,
second day of filming.
We,
we started really late.

2324
02:13:39.931 --> 02:13:42.600
We lost our light.
We had to kind of pivot that day.

2325
02:13:42.601 --> 02:13:45.190
I ended up having to throw all that footage away.
Um,

2326
02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:47.930
another day we lost light and had to get back up at five in the morning,

2327
02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:50.280
kind of shoot don for dust.
But we just kept pivoting.
We just kept,

2328
02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:52.320
nothing was catastrophic.
Okay.
Like,

2329
02:13:53.090 --> 02:13:54.900
and I think that's something I got from my father.
It's like,
okay,

2330
02:13:54.901 --> 02:13:57.180
this isn't working.
Okay,
so we're going to do this.
Okay,
that's not working.

2331
02:13:57.181 --> 02:13:59.220
We're going to do this.
Rather than,
Oh my God,
this is the end of the world.

2332
02:13:59.221 --> 02:14:01.410
What are we going to do?
Um,

2333
02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:06.060
and then in post I had very little money for post and very little time to cut

2334
02:14:06.061 --> 02:14:09.900
the movie together and about four weeks in the editor that I had cutting,

2335
02:14:09.901 --> 02:14:11.490
there'll be,
who was a great guy,
really talented,

2336
02:14:11.491 --> 02:14:13.290
just wasn't connecting with the material.
It wasn't,

2337
02:14:13.291 --> 02:14:15.780
wasn't able to assemble the movie.
It was an unusual movie.

2338
02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:20.460
It's one guy in a car and I had to let him go and then I had to learn avid,

2339
02:14:20.461 --> 02:14:23.670
the avid system and start cutting the movie myself.
Uh,
but again,
I wasn't like,

2340
02:14:23.671 --> 02:14:25.620
what I'm going to do,
I don't have an editor.
I'm going to die.
Just said,
okay,

2341
02:14:25.621 --> 02:14:26.340
well like the,

2342
02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:30.360
the answer here is that I'm going to learn this skill set and I'm going to keep

2343
02:14:30.361 --> 02:14:33.990
moving forward.
Um,
and then,
you know,

2344
02:14:33.991 --> 02:14:37.560
I made this little film that was seen as strange and atmospheric and dreamlike

2345
02:14:37.561 --> 02:14:38.640
and you know,

2346
02:14:38.641 --> 02:14:41.160
it didn't get into Sundance and everybody always wants to get into Sundance,

2347
02:14:41.161 --> 02:14:44.460
but then it got into eight other festivals and won two awards and got picked up

2348
02:14:44.461 --> 02:14:45.121
for distribution.

2349
02:14:45.121 --> 02:14:49.570
And the result has been much better than I ever could have anticipated.
Uh,

2350
02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:53.580
and,
and um,
I'm really proud of it because I mean,
I made,

2351
02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.060
made it for what is typically the catering budget,

2352
02:14:58.890 --> 02:15:02.930
autumn on a regular,
a Hollywood movie.
You know what I mean?
It,

2353
02:15:03.630 --> 02:15:07.470
we made it for just no money and in no time.
And,
um,

2354
02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:09.030
and I think it also says something.

2355
02:15:09.031 --> 02:15:12.540
I think what I'm also proud of is that the movie actually does have a strong

2356
02:15:12.541 --> 02:15:17.541
point of view and a strong visual personality and a strong style that is my own.

2357
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:20.730
When I look at it,
I don't think I'm trying to emulate anybody.

2358
02:15:20.731 --> 02:15:23.310
I feel like this is,
this is something that I made.
It's my,

2359
02:15:23.730 --> 02:15:27.690
it's my little lumpy ashtray from shop class and,
and I,
I really love it.

2360
02:15:28.910 --> 02:15:32.950
<v 2>Good for you.
And it's
there.</v>

2361
02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:35.330
There's this,

2362
02:15:36.710 --> 02:15:41.450
I think it's easy to not not,
I'm not saying you,

2363
02:15:41.451 --> 02:15:44.150
but for humans to look at.

2364
02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:49.490
The people who were showcased on the covers of magazines are on the front pages

2365
02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:53.600
of popular websites and think,
wow,

2366
02:15:53.690 --> 02:15:56.810
they figured out all the secret sauce,

2367
02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:01.960
or they have the keys to the kingdom and they're able to show up and just hit

2368
02:16:03.621 --> 02:16:05.330
home runs every time they step to the plate.

2369
02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:10.360
And when you look at the origin stories of some of these incredible creations

2370
02:16:12.531 --> 02:16:14.720
that people are familiar with,

2371
02:16:14.721 --> 02:16:19.310
whether it's a jaws or the company,
Alibaba is one example.
Jack Ma,

2372
02:16:19.311 --> 02:16:20.144
the founder,

2373
02:16:20.590 --> 02:16:24.590
I think he's the richest man in China or certainly one of the top few at this

2374
02:16:24.591 --> 02:16:26.570
point.
And he said,
I'm paraphrasing,

2375
02:16:26.571 --> 02:16:30.220
but we had a huge advantage in the beginning and that was we had no

2376
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:31.930
<v 1>experience,
no money and no plan.</v>

2377
02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:38.910
And it forces you to really think outside of the box.

2378
02:16:39.670 --> 02:16:44.670
And even if that project doesn't succeed by outside measures,

2379
02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:50.640
the confidence that you develop in exploring areas outside of the box can then

2380
02:16:53.111 --> 02:16:57.280
transfer to future projects.
I remember there was this fantastic documentary,

2381
02:16:57.490 --> 02:17:00.730
I'm going to butcher his name.
It will,
it's fantastic.
Mostly for the message,

2382
02:17:00.731 --> 02:17:03.250
not for all of the content,
which I hope makes sense,

2383
02:17:03.490 --> 02:17:05.860
but it's called a Yoda worst skis doing.

2384
02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:09.910
And it's the story of this attempt to make a movie about Dune.

2385
02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.510
And the thing is a complete unmitigated disaster,

2386
02:17:13.511 --> 02:17:16.760
like complete under the disaster.
But the,
the,

2387
02:17:16.770 --> 02:17:21.770
the talent that was assembled went on to just do incredible things.

2388
02:17:22.210 --> 02:17:24.370
And if that disaster hadn't happened,

2389
02:17:25.690 --> 02:17:29.810
one could argue that if you,

2390
02:17:30.050 --> 02:17:31.690
if you'd stepped on that butterfly,

2391
02:17:32.290 --> 02:17:35.800
these other careers wouldn't have lost him in the way that they did and you

2392
02:17:35.801 --> 02:17:40.801
wouldn't have the Geiger design of the alien that people now know as the Elliot

2393
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:44.620
of Aliens and so on.
So it's a,
I just love,

2394
02:17:45.390 --> 02:17:48.900
<v 5>yeah.
This,
that no one ever learns from success.
I mean,
you,
you,
you can kind of,</v>

2395
02:17:49.020 --> 02:17:52.020
you can kind of do a postmortem and say,
oh,
this stuff works.

2396
02:17:52.021 --> 02:17:55.800
But failure is where it is,
where you have explosive growth,

2397
02:17:55.860 --> 02:17:59.250
where you really have to reconsider all of your assumptions.
And,
uh,
and it's,

2398
02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:03.510
it's so much more powerful than success is at making you eventually successful.

2399
02:18:04.350 --> 02:18:07.510
<v 1>Um,
so yeah,
the aggressive,</v>

2400
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:13.190
the aggressive a,
G,
G R E s S.
Ivy.
Oh,

2401
02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:17.980
totally.
Yes.
I,
that's,
that's,
that's my life philosophy.
Be Aggressive,

2402
02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:23.110
be aggressive.
And uh,
we want you around for a long time.

2403
02:18:23.111 --> 02:18:26.770
So take your cat naps at the very least.
That's my goal.

2404
02:18:26.860 --> 02:18:31.860
And I do you have anything you would like to say or ask of the audience

2405
02:18:35.261 --> 02:18:38.040
suggestions you'd like to make?
Anything at all that you'd like to,

2406
02:18:38.590 --> 02:18:42.520
to say before we wrap up?
Other than watch my movie.

2407
02:18:42.521 --> 02:18:46.370
How other than watch your movies.
Exactly.
Um,

2408
02:18:47.050 --> 02:18:51.100
<v 5>that's interesting.
I mean,
I,
I mean,
I guess like,
I like when I,</v>

2409
02:18:51.130 --> 02:18:54.100
when I did my podcast,
you know,
like it somatically,

2410
02:18:54.310 --> 02:18:56.500
the stuff that we've talked about was always stuff that I talked about,

2411
02:18:56.501 --> 02:19:01.240
which is like,
it doesn't matter what your,
what you want to do,
like,
you know,

2412
02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:06.220
and again,
it sounds very greeting card,
but like the barriers are,

2413
02:19:06.250 --> 02:19:08.410
they're imagined,
you know what I mean?
And,
and,

2414
02:19:08.470 --> 02:19:11.200
and it may be you're going to have to start small and maybe we're going to have

2415
02:19:11.201 --> 02:19:15.630
to start,
uh,
close to home.
But like the,
the,

2416
02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:19.480
the greater regret will always be not having started.
And,

2417
02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:23.740
uh,
this,
it's,

2418
02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:28.280
I'm always trying to find a way to be more bold in my life and hopefully share

2419
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.980
<v 1>the things that have helped me do that with other people.</v>

2420
02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:34.400
So it is exciting to be having the conversation with you because I think that's

2421
02:19:34.401 --> 02:19:36.800
a lot of what you've done is you've kind of,
you know,

2422
02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:39.980
live these experiences so that the things that you learned could be shared with

2423
02:19:39.981 --> 02:19:43.640
other people.
Uh,
and it's,
you know,

2424
02:19:43.670 --> 02:19:46.370
just go out and do awesome shit.

2425
02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:51.300
Get your hands dirty,
dirty,

2426
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:54.470
rough drafts are not a clean business.

2427
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:57.950
Absolutely not.

2428
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:04.400
Thank you so much for taking the time.
And it was a pleasure.

2429
02:20:04.490 --> 02:20:08.240
So much fun.
So I know it's Super Fun and now that I know where you are,

2438
02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:43.140
I don't know if this is going to post,
but uh,

2439
02:20:43.141 --> 02:20:45.650
I post stuff about all this stuff I'm doing,

2441
02:20:48.951 --> 02:20:53.310
And then archer starts I think on the 24th of April and all the others,

2445
02:20:58.190 --> 02:21:03.190
I'm on Social Center for days and weeks and months and years and millennia to

2446
02:21:03.561 --> 02:21:03.831
come.

2447
02:21:03.831 --> 02:21:08.360
Hopefully cockroaches will be listening to this on a tiny units on the rest of

2448
02:21:08.361 --> 02:21:12.830
us are dead.
That's exactly right.
Cockroaches.

2449
02:21:12.890 --> 02:21:16.870
Remember us fondly and for you non cockroach is actually have cockroaches

2450
02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:17.211
listening.

2451
02:21:17.211 --> 02:21:21.290
You're welcome also to check out the show notes where I will provide links to

2452
02:21:21.291 --> 02:21:26.291
everything that we've talked about including access and you can find all of

2453
02:21:27.021 --> 02:21:31.610
those at tim.blog/podcast along with the show notes for every other episode and

2454
02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:33.320
I should thank you so much.

2455
02:21:33.350 --> 02:21:38.350
One more time for being so goddamn entertaining and inspiring at the same time.

2456
02:21:39.141 --> 02:21:43.930
It's a rear combo,
so really appreciate it.
Great to talk with you.
Thanks Tim.

2457
02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:48.050
Of course.
And to everybody out there on the interwebs,

2458
02:21:48.530 --> 02:21:53.360
uh,
be safe.
Maybe a more important,

2459
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:58.130
be aggressive.
Get out there if you've,
if you're dreaming of doing something,

2460
02:21:58.131 --> 02:21:59.960
creating something some day,

2461
02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:03.560
just get out a shitty first draft because guess what?

2462
02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:06.380
All the first drafts are really fucking awful.

2463
02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:11.240
It's very rare that someone just,
as I was alluding to,
Shit's out diamonds,

2464
02:22:11.390 --> 02:22:13.670
uh,
on a,
on a daily basis.
It's,

2465
02:22:13.730 --> 02:22:18.730
it starts with putting something out there into the world and uh,

2466
02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:22.610
hopefully at least it makes a market of one happy and that is you.

2467
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:26.070
So I will close there and

2468
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:30.480
<v 0>thanks to everybody for listening.
Hey guys,
this is Tim again.</v>

2469
02:22:30.481 --> 02:22:33.660
Just a few more things before you take off.
Number one,

2470
02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:38.820
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2471
02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:42.990
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

2472
02:22:42.991 --> 02:22:46.560
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

2473
02:22:46.561 --> 02:22:50.910
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

2474
02:22:50.911 --> 02:22:52.230
pondering over the week.

2475
02:22:52.410 --> 02:22:55.200
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2476
02:22:55.201 --> 02:22:58.650
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2477
02:22:58.651 --> 02:23:02.970
somehow dug up in the other world of the esoteric as I do.

2478
02:23:03.240 --> 02:23:08.240
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2479
02:23:08.911 --> 02:23:11.610
close friends.
For instance,
and it's very short.

2480
02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:16.680
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend,

2481
02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:18.930
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2482
02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:23.850
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

2483
02:23:23.851 --> 02:23:27.750

Matt Mullenweg now valued at more than a billion dollars,

2488
02:23:44.641 --> 02:23:47.250
have used legal zoom to help with their business needs.

2489
02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:49.730
Specifically in his case to form has company butts.

2490
02:23:50.250 --> 02:23:52.440
Legal Zoom isn't just for launching your business.

2491
02:23:52.460 --> 02:23:56.220
There are services include everything from helping you to manage changing tax

2492
02:23:56.221 --> 02:24:01.110
laws,
doing contract screening,
Ndas,
nondisclosure agreements,
important stuff,

2493
02:24:01.290 --> 02:24:05.970
handling lease agreements and assisting with really any other legal challenge,

2494
02:24:05.971 --> 02:24:10.200
hurdle inconvenienced that typically takes time and effort away from running

2495
02:24:10.201 --> 02:24:11.034
your business.

2496
02:24:11.250 --> 02:24:14.700
The best part is that you won't get charged by the hour because legal zoom isn't

2497
02:24:14.730 --> 02:24:15.371
a law firm,

2498
02:24:15.371 --> 02:24:20.371
so they won't be running the clock up and spinning circles just to raise your

2499
02:24:20.850 --> 02:24:22.140
bill.
Instead,

2500
02:24:22.141 --> 02:24:25.710
they just ask you to pay one low upfront price for whatever it is that you're

2501
02:24:25.711 --> 02:24:27.120
looking to get all the card style,

Tim,

2510
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:57.630
this episode is brought to you by teeter.

2511
02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:01.740
I am so thrilled to have connected with these guys because I've used teeter

2512
02:25:01.741 --> 02:25:03.810
products for many,
many years.

2513
02:25:03.811 --> 02:25:08.280
I've traveled around the country and the world with teeter products and I'm

2514
02:25:08.281 --> 02:25:13.281
sitting about 15 feet in my home from one of their inversion tables and we're

2515
02:25:14.281 --> 02:25:15.840
going to talk more about all of that.

2516
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:20.070
One of my rituals is hanging and I should say not really that it's a maintenance

2517
02:25:20.071 --> 02:25:23.860
and performance program.
I hang not just in the morning potentially,

2518
02:25:23.861 --> 02:25:26.920
but particularly after a day of bearing weight,

2519
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:29.530
whether that includes weight training in Jersey,

2520
02:25:29.531 --> 02:25:34.120
Greg Rec world record holder insists on this type of inversion therapy after

2521
02:25:34.121 --> 02:25:38.680
training or just wearing heavy backpack around a few minutes goes a long way

2522
02:25:39.070 --> 02:25:43.600
towards better sleep.
In my case,
less back pain,
neck pain,
leg pain.

2523
02:25:43.930 --> 02:25:45.730
It's not a panacea obviously,

2524
02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:49.610
but inversion therapy would use gravity and your own body weight,

2525
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:54.160
decompress the spine of the pressure on the discs and surrounding nerves seems

2526
02:25:54.161 --> 02:25:59.161
to help with a whole slew of conditions and just as a general maintenance

2527
02:25:59.381 --> 02:26:04.360
program,
it's one of my favorite things to do.
So what to say about that teeter?

2528
02:26:04.390 --> 02:26:08.680
Why teeter teeter is the best known name in inversion table since 1981 more than

2529
02:26:08.681 --> 02:26:11.800
3 million people have put their trust in teeter teeters.

2530
02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:16.120
Also the only inversion table brand that has been both safety certified by

2531
02:26:16.121 --> 02:26:19.780
underwriters laboratories as the UL for the people in that industry.

2532
02:26:19.781 --> 02:26:24.550
You will recognize it and register with the FDA as a class one medical device

2533
02:26:24.850 --> 02:26:29.110
and they're giving a very special offer just to you guys,
my listeners.

2534
02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:32.680
For a limited time you can get the teeter inversion table with bonus
accessories,

2535
02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:37.660
which I have a bunch of again in the room next to me and a free pair of gravity

2536
02:26:37.661 --> 02:26:41.140
boots so that you can invert at home or take the boots with you to the gym.

2537
02:26:41.141 --> 02:26:42.160
So these gravity boots,

2538
02:26:42.610 --> 02:26:47.610
I have three separate pairs of gravity boots bought with my own monies in three

2539
02:26:48.311 --> 02:26:50.170
different cities that I've had for a very,

2540
02:26:50.171 --> 02:26:52.480
very long time because I don't want to travel with them necessarily.

2541
02:26:52.570 --> 02:26:56.620
It looked kind of like ski boots but without the foot portion and they hook you

2542
02:26:56.621 --> 02:27:00.280
upside down so you can take them and really anywhere you want to go to get this

2543
02:27:00.281 --> 02:27:00.790
deal,

2544
02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:05.770
which is a savings of over $148 it's very specific.

2545
02:27:05.770 --> 02:27:10.770
So maybe it's 149 you have to go to twitter.com forward slash Tim,

what the hell is this thing he's talking about?

2553

I can't even envision it in my head.
