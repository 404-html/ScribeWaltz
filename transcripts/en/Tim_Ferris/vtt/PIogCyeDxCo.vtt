Hello Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Tim Ferriss.

2
00:00:02.831 --> 00:00:05.560
And welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.260
I'm gonna start off as I often do with a quote.

4
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.670
This is from one of my favorite writers of all time,
Kurt Vonnegut.

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.320
And it goes as follows,
quote,
here is a lesson in creative writing.

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.580
First rule,
do not use semi-colons.
They're transvestite.

7
00:00:21.581 --> 00:00:24.190
Hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing.

8
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.000
All they do is show that you've been to college.
And quote,

9
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.620
I have a habit of using dashes in the same way.
So I like to read this,

10
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:36.970
to remind me not to use that crutch.
Also pretty the adverb,
I overuse that.

11
00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:41.200
So in any case,
Kurt Vonnegut,
lots of lessons,
uh,
lots of amazing books.

12
00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:46.060
If you need one to start with,
go with cat's cradle.
Today's guest is Kevin Kelly.

13
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:49.390
Kevin Kelly is one of the most interesting human beings I've ever met.

14
00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:51.970
He's a dear friend.
And as for the bio,

15
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.920
Kevin Kelly is senior maverick at wired magazine,
which he co founded in 1993.

16
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.680
He also cofounded the all Species Foundation,

17
00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:03.550
a nonprofit aimed at cataloging and identifying every living species on earth.

18
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.550
And in all his spare time,
he writes bestselling books.

19
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.470
He cofounded the Rosetta project,

20
00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:12.250
which is building an archive of all documented human languages and he serves on

21
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:14.290
the board of the long now foundation,
uh,

22
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.820
which I've been honored to join as a speaker on one occasion as part of the long

23
00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:21.070
now foundation he's looking into,
among other things,

24
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.120
how to revive and restore endangered or extinct species,

25
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.770
including the woolly mammoth.
I'm not making this stuff up.
Kevin is amazing.

26
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:32.370
This is going to be a multipart episodes,

27
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:37.000
so there'd be a number of different podcasts episodes because we went quite
long.

28
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.260
This is part one.
I hope you enjoy it.
You can find all links,

33
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.750
and without further ado,
please enjoy and thank you for listening

34
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.630
<v 1>at this altitude.
I can flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.</v>

35
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.570
I'm a cybernetic organism living to show what method.

36
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.520
<v 0>Kevin,
thank you so much for being on the show.</v>

37
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.663
<v 2>It's my honor</v>

38
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.940
<v 0>and I am endlessly fascinated by all of the varied projects that you constantly</v>

39
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:35.550
have going on.
But that leads me to the first question,

40
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:39.390
which is when you meet someone who is not familiar with your background and they

41
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:42.360
ask you the age old,
what do you do?
Question,

42
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:45.540
how do you even begin to answer that?
What is your stock answer to that

43
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.000
<v 2>these days?
My stock answer is,</v>

44
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:53.001
is that I package ideas into books and magazines and websites,

45
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.020
and I make ideas interesting and pretty

46
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.550
<v 0>well,
I like to pretty,
that's cool.
We'll come back to the aesthetic aspect.</v>

47
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.110
I think that's a really neglected piece of the entire puzzle.
You do have,

48
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:09.180
of course,
a background.

49
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.560
A lot of people are familiar with your background with wired,

50
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:16.510
but perhaps you could give folks a bit of of background on yourself.

51
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.590
And is it true that you,
you dropped out of college after one year?

52
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.840
<v 2>Yeah,
I'm a college dropout and actually my one regret in life is that one year.</v>

53
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.150
Oh,
no kidding.
No kidding.
I wish I had even skip that,
but I,

54
00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:35.151
I do understand how college can be useful to people and I have my own children

55
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:39.280
have gone through,
but for me it was just not the right thing.

56
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.820
And I went to Asia instead and I like to tell myself that I gave my own self a

57
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.600
Phd in East Asian studies by traveling around and photographing very remote

58
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.630
remote parts of Asia at a time when it was in a transition from the ancient

59
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:02.680
world to the modern world.
And I did many other things as well.

60
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:07.681
And for me it was a very formative time because I did enough things that when I

61
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:11.680
finally got my first real job at the age of 35

62
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.140
<v 0>Oh wow.</v>

63
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.480
<v 2>I worked for a nonprofit at $10 an hour,
which was the whole earth catalog,</v>

64
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.930
which we had been in that kind of a lifelong dream.
If I said,

65
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:24.610
if I wouldn't have a job,
that's the job I want.

66
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.100
It took me a long time to kind of get it.

67
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.330
But in between that I did many things including starting businesses and selling

68
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:34.720
businesses and doing other kinds of things,

69
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.400
more adventures and I highly recommend it.
You know,

70
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.610
I got involved in starting wired and running wired for a while and,
and uh,

71
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:46.600
hired a lot of people who were coming right out of college.

72
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.440
There were interns and they would do the intern thing and then there were good

73
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:54.250
and we would hire them,
which meant that basically you don't have to 10 years,

74
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:57.070
whatever it was they were,
this was their first and only job.

75
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:59.950
And I kept telling them,
why are you here?

76
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.140
What are you doing?

77
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.800
You should be fooling around wasting time trying something crazy.

78
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:12.400
Why are you working a real job?
I don't understand it.
And I just really,

79
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:16.210
I really recommend slack.
I'm a big believer in,

80
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.630
in this thing of kind of doing something that's not productive,

81
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.470
you know,
practice or your Middle Ages Young,

82
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.520
want to be prolific and make and do things,

83
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:34.100
but you don't want to measure them in terms of productivity.
You,

84
00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:38.440
you want to measure them in terms of extreme performance.

85
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.680
Do you want to measure them in kind of,
um,
extreme satisfaction?

86
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.760
It's a time to kind of try stuff and,

87
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:48.130
and I think explore the extremes.
Exactly.

88
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:52.120
Explore the possibilities and there's so many possibilities and there's more

89
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:55.980
every day and you don't want,
it's called premature organization.
You,

90
00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:57.530
you really,

91
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.300
you really want to use this time to continue to do things.
And by the way,

92
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.690
premature optimization is a problem of success.

93
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.430
It's not just the problem with the young,

94
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:09.610
it's the problem of the successful more than even at the end.

95
00:06:09.611 --> 00:06:10.340
But we'll get to that.

96
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.730
<v 0>Yeah,
that's that.
That's a long answer.</v>

97
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.070
That might turn into a therapy session for me at this precise moment in time.

98
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:21.050
In fact.
Exactly.
But when you are exploring that slack,

99
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.960
I would imagine many people feel pressured,

100
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:26.360
whether it's internal pressure or societal,

101
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:30.320
familial pressure to get a real job to support themselves.

102
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:32.480
And there are a lot of the decisions are made out of fear.

103
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.510
They worry about being out on the streets or it's a nebulous terror anxiety.

104
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:41.510
How did you support yourself,
for instance,
while you were traveling through Asia?

105
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:42.980
When,
when,
when you left school,

106
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.390
<v 2>I totally understand this anxiety and fear and stuff,
but here's,</v>

107
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:48.021
here's the thing.

108
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:52.400
I think one of the many kind of life skills that you want to actually learn it

109
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:57.401
at a fairly young age is the skill of being like ultra thrifty,

110
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.870
minimal kind of this little whisper,

111
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.670
this traveling through time and the sense of learning how little you actually

112
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:09.410
need to live,
not just in kind of um,
survival mode but it kind of,
you know,

113
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:10.310
in a contented mode.

114
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.560
And I learned that pretty early by backpacking and doing other things and

115
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:18.620
especially in Asia was I could be very happy with very,

116
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:22.700
very little and you can go onto websites and stuff and look at sort of like the

117
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:27.290
minimum amount of stuff,
food say that you need to to live,
you know,

118
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:32.180
your basic protein and carbohydrates and vitamins and,
and how much you actually,

119
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.250
if you were bought them in bulk,
how much it would cost.

120
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.420
I mean you build your own house,
live in a shelter,
a tiny house,

121
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.350
you don't need very much.
And I think trying that out,
you know,

122
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:44.090
building your house on the pond,

123
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:49.091
like the row who's a hero of mine in high school is a not just a simple exercise

124
00:07:50.401 --> 00:07:55.010
is so profound exercise because it allows you to get over the anxiety even if

125
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:59.600
you aren't living like that,
you know that if the worst came to worst,

126
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.950
you could keep going at a very low rate and be content.

127
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.980
And so that gives you the sort of confidence to take a risk because you say,

128
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:11.150
what's the worst that can happen?
Well,

129
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:15.440
the worst has happened is that I'd have a backpack and a sleeping bag and that'd

130
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:20.160
be eating oatmeal and you know,
whatever.
You know,
and that'd be fine.
Yeah.

131
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.450
And I think if you do that once or twice,

132
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.190
you don't necessarily have to live like that,
but,

133
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:30.080
but knowing that you can be content is tremendously empowering.

134
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.080
That's what I did.
That's basically what I did.
It was,
you know,

135
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:37.910
living in Asia where the people around me had less than I did and they were

136
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:40.610
pretty content.
We realized,
oh my gosh,

137
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.190
I don't really need very much to be happy.

138
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.750
<v 0>And did you save up money beforehand with odd jobs or did you do odd jobs while</v>

139
00:08:48.751 --> 00:08:50.310
on the road?
A bit of both.

140
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.230
<v 2>I did odd jobs before I left.</v>

141
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.560
I was traveling in Asia at a time when the price differential was so great that

142
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.550
it actually made sense for me to fly back on a charter flight to the u s and

143
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:10.920
work for four or five months.
And I worked basically odd jobs.

144
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:15.060
I worked from working in a warehouse,
packaging,
uh,

145
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.780
athletic shoes,
working in a kind of technical sense of,
uh,

146
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.020
it's a really just hard to describe what it was.
It was kind of a,

147
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:27.050
in a photography related job where we reducing printed circuit boards down to

148
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:32.070
little sizes to be shipped off to be printed and driving cars to whatever else I

149
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:34.044
could find.

150
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.030
And that at that time made more money I could live off of.

151
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:43.560
I could live a probably two years from those couple months of work.

152
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.950
So I didn't really work while I was traveling until I got to Iran in the late

153
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.850
seventies and there there was a very high paying job,

154
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:58.851
which was teaching English to the Iranian pilots who worked for the shop,

155
00:09:59.091 --> 00:10:01.830
but I had sworn there was never going to teach English,

156
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:06.831
so I actually got a job in Bella Hah helicopter who was teaching English is to

157
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:08.761
the pilots,

158
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:13.500
but my job was running a little newsletter for the American community there and

159
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:17.670
I worked there until I was thrown out by the coup.
That was another story.

160
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.570
<v 0>Just a couple of comments.
So number one,</v>

161
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:26.130
for those people listening who are saying to themselves already perhaps creating

162
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:28.020
reasons why they can't do what you did.

163
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:31.280
Now do you do different economic climate or whatnot?

164
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.230
It is entirely possible to replicate what you did.

165
00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:36.420
You just have to choose your locations wisely for that,

166
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:37.410
for the type of differential.

167
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.390
And I should also just mention the people that part of the reason that I'm so

168
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:43.980
attracted to stoic philosophy,

169
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:48.981
whether that be Seneca or Marcus Aurelius is exactly because of the practice of

170
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:52.680
poverty,
not because you want to be poor,

171
00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:56.310
but so that you recognize not only that you can subsist,

172
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:58.770
but then you can potentially be content or,

173
00:10:58.771 --> 00:11:02.370
or even in some cases be more content with a bare minimum.

174
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.000
So for people who were more interested in that,

175
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.140
I highly recommend a lot of the stoic writings and you can search for those on

176
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:08.690
my blog and elsewhere.
But

177
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.870
<v 2>let me just add to that.</v>

178
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.070
There's actually a new age version of that that was sort of popular in a

179
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.310
generation ago.
And that search term there is a volunteer simplicity,

180
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.830
volunteer simplicity,
right?

181
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:24.150
And so the idea is poverty is terrible when it's mandatory,

182
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:27.930
when you have no choice.
But in volunteer version of that is very,
very powerful.

183
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.830
And I think attaching names sometimes to things,
it makes it more legitimate.

184
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.390
But imagine yourself practicing voluntary simplicity.

185
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:39.570
And that I think is part of that stoic philosophy,

186
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:41.660
but there was a whole kind of a movement allowed the,

187
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.130
it'd be dropouts were kind of practicing a similar thing and there was,
you know,

188
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:51.250
a whole best practices that resolved around that you can make up your own.

189
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:54.250
But I think it's to me an skill,

190
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:59.251
that life skill that people should choir and when you go backpacking and stuff

191
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:00.850
like that,
that's part of it.

192
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:05.500
That's the beginnings of trying to understand what it is that you need to live

193
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:09.640
as a,
you know,
as a being and you can fill that out in any way you want,

194
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.290
but that's a good way to experiment.

195
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.150
<v 0>Now you have become a,</v>

196
00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:17.750
certainly a worldclass package or a of ideas,

197
00:12:17.751 --> 00:12:20.810
but also at synthesizing and expressing these ideas.

198
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.550
I love your writing if I have consumed vast quantities of it.
In fact,

199
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:30.800
I'm here right now on on long island where I grew up and I used to sneak into my

200
00:12:30.801 --> 00:12:35.330
parents' shed to read old additions of the whole earth catalog for inspiration.

201
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.780
It was,
it was the,
I suppose,
the equivalent of my internet at the time.

202
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.820
And from that all the way to 1000 true fans,
which of course,
you know,

203
00:12:43.821 --> 00:12:46.700
I sort of shout from the rooftops for people to read.

204
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:51.590
How did you develop that skill of writing and communicating?

205
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.570
A lot of people associate that with schooling,

206
00:12:53.571 --> 00:12:56.810
but it doesn't appear to be the source for you.

207
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.520
<v 2>Yeah,
so in our school,</v>

208
00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:02.490
I would call myself a very late bloomer.
I,

209
00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:05.460
I don't recall myself having a lot of ideas.

210
00:13:05.461 --> 00:13:08.400
There were a lot of other people and kids in my high school that I was very

211
00:13:08.401 --> 00:13:13.401
impressed with because they seem to know what they thought and we're very glib

212
00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:16.140
and articulate and I,
and I,
and I wasn't,

213
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.240
I was a little bit more visual on that sense.

214
00:13:18.241 --> 00:13:22.920
I was trying to decide whether to go to art school or to MIT because I was

215
00:13:22.921 --> 00:13:27.330
really interested in science.
So I set off to Asia as a photographer.

216
00:13:27.331 --> 00:13:30.780
So it was basically no words at all.
It was just images.

217
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:36.470
And as I was traveling and seeing these amazing things,

218
00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:40.080
I mean,
again,
I want to emphasize that this was sort of a,
for me,

219
00:13:40.081 --> 00:13:44.640
I grew up in New Jersey.
I had never left New Jersey.
We never took vacations.

220
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:50.060
It's hard to describe how parochial New Jersey was back in the 1960s I never ate

221
00:13:51.811 --> 00:13:54.780
Chinese food and never had,
I mean,
I never saw a Chinese.

222
00:13:54.781 --> 00:13:57.000
It was like it was a different world.

223
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.660
And then I was thrown into Asia and it was like,
oh my gosh,

224
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:01.890
everything I knew was wrong.

225
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.160
And so that education was extremely,

226
00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:11.700
extremely powerful.
And I think that that,

227
00:14:11.701 --> 00:14:14.160
that gave me something to say.

228
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.840
And I started writing letters home and I tried to describe what I was seeing.

229
00:14:18.841 --> 00:14:23.841
And so I had a reason to try to communicate and that was the beginning of it.

230
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.270
But even then,
I don't think I really had much to say.

231
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:32.450
It wasn't really until the internet came along and I had a chance to go onto one

232
00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:40.260
of the first online communities in the early eighties and for some reason

233
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.500
<v 0>early eighties that is,
that is definitely,</v>

234
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.860
<v 2>yeah,
it was,
yeah,
in 1981 and so this were private,</v>

235
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.070
that wasn't the kind of wide open there and these were experiment.
In fact,

236
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:57.071
it was a New Jersey Institute of Technology in Rutgers to had this experimental

237
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:01.040
online community that I got invited on the night.

238
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:02.990
We can talk about how that happened,
but that was,
it was this,

239
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.640
this luck and a friend and I found that there was something about the direct

240
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.050
attempt to just communicate with someone else in real time,
you know,

241
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:16.820
just to sending them a message.
It's something that crystallized my thinking.

242
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.110
So what it turned out,

243
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.620
<v 0>how did it crystallize your thinking?
Just nuts interrupt,</v>

244
00:15:20.621 --> 00:15:22.150
but was it the immediate feedback loop?

245
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.730
<v 2>It was the idea that they have,</v>

246
00:15:24.731 --> 00:15:29.710
since teachers have since done lots of studies where they had kids write an

247
00:15:29.711 --> 00:15:33.380
essay on something,
an assignment,
and then they would also be in,

248
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.980
started to write some email to a friend or something,

249
00:15:35.981 --> 00:15:40.460
and then they would grade both of the compositions and they would find that

250
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:45.340
inevitably the email that the kids were writing was much better writing.

251
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.960
Because when you're trying to write a composition,
there's all these,
you know,

252
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.350
we have all these attitudes or expectations or there's,

253
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.090
there's this kind of a writerly sense.
There's there,

254
00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.850
there's all this other garbage and luggage and baggage on top of that,

255
00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.770
but when we're just trying to send an email,
we're just,

256
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.500
we're directly trying to communicate something and we're not fooling around.

257
00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:09.280
We're not trying to be,
make it make literary,
literary all.

258
00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:10.390
They would just direct stuff.

259
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.890
And so the writing there was always much more directed concrete because that's

260
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.081
the,

261
00:16:14.081 --> 00:16:16.960
that's the usual thing that happens when you're trying to write as you're not

262
00:16:16.961 --> 00:16:19.390
concrete enough,
but when your emails,
I call concrete.

263
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.920
And so it was getting out of the whole kind of writerly stuff and just pure

264
00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:28.750
concrete communication that really made it for me.
And what I discovered,

265
00:16:28.751 --> 00:16:33.520
which is what many writers discover,
is that I write in order to think.

266
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.260
It was like,
I think I have an idea,
but when I begin to write it,

267
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.030
I realized I have no idea.

268
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.930
And I don't actually know what I think until I tried to write it.

269
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.310
So writing is a way for me to define out what I think it's sort of,

270
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.560
it's like I don't have any idea if that's true,

271
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.920
but when I write I get the ideas and that was the revelation.

272
00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.670
And so by being forced to communicate online and there was none of this

273
00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:03.220
expectation,
it was just like,
okay,
this is ranting email.
I can do that.

274
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.440
I don't have to write an essay,
I don't want to write something nice.

275
00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:08.980
I'm just going to write,
you know,
140 characters.
I can do that.

276
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.610
But while I was doing that,
I had an idea that it didn't have before.

277
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.470
And so it was like,
oh my gosh,
this is a idea generation machine.

278
00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:20.260
It's by writing.
It's not that I have these ideas,
I'm going to write them down.

279
00:17:20.261 --> 00:17:21.820
I don't know.
I don't even have them until I,
right.

280
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.740
<v 0>I'm so glad you brought that up because I was just recently,</v>

281
00:17:24.741 --> 00:17:26.270
a few things related to that.

282
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:31.250
I was reading an interview with Kurt Vonnegut who's one of my favorite authors

283
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.120
for people who aren't familiar checkout cat's cradle perhaps as a starting
point.

284
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.370
Hilarious guy and he at various points in his career taught writing to make ends

285
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:43.700
meet and he would number one,
not look for good writers.

286
00:17:43.701 --> 00:17:47.670
He would look for people who are passionate about specific things.
So that's,

287
00:17:47.671 --> 00:17:50.250
that's something I want to reiterate to people who don't feel writerly.

288
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:54.150
Is that right?
Go out and have the experiences and find the subjects,

289
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.180
the things that excite you.
And as long as you're true to your voice,

290
00:17:57.181 --> 00:17:59.010
which is related to the email point.

291
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.270
I throughout my first two drafts of that say a third of the four hour work week

292
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:08.271
because they were either too pompous and Ivy League sounding odd to way,

293
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:11.100
way,
way too much.

294
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.550
I mean a horrible or to slapstick because I felt like I had to go to the other

295
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:19.200
extreme and then I sat down and I wrote as if I were composing an email to a

296
00:18:19.201 --> 00:18:23.400
friend after two glasses of wine and that's how I found my voice,
so to speak.

297
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.970
As a side note,
why,
and I think this might be related,

298
00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:30.180
but why did you promise yourself not to teach English?

299
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.060
I'm so curious because that's a,
that can be very lucrative.

300
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:35.400
It's a readily available.
When you were traveling,

301
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:37.680
why did you commit to yourself not to teach English?

302
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.220
<v 2>Yeah,
it's a good question because there was lots of opportunities all around the</v>

303
00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:42.960
world.
And by the way,

304
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.850
I recommend it as a way for people to travel cheaply if you went to support

305
00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:52.170
yourself because it is a very desirable skill we call it for the moment.

306
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.540
I think the reason why was I felt that I didn't feel like I was a very good

307
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:01.890
teacher and I also felt that it was maybe a little easy,

308
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.240
but I think the main reason was that I was having trouble imagining myself

309
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.700
enjoying it,
you know?

310
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.600
And I just felt that I would rather try to find something else.
Now,

311
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:18.030
I think I did one time in Taiwan,
which as you know,

312
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:22.410
has a whole cram school system.
I think a friend,

313
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:27.390
a substitute for a friend once,
and I think that may be confirmed

314
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.170
that while it was there were sort of like,
you know,

315
00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:33.390
all I have to do is this talk.

316
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.320
I mean there's really not much skill involved at all.
It was fun,

317
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:39.210
but I do feel like I was,
I don't know,

318
00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:42.930
I didn't feel like I was maybe adding value or something.

319
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:46.140
So I came away thinking,
you know,
I guess I could do this for money,

320
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:50.100
but I'm not going to be happy.
I think it was just a personality thing.

321
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:54.810
I don't think of myself as a teacher.
I don't do many workshops or classes.

322
00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:00.390
So I think a different person might thoroughly enjoy it and I know they do and

323
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:03.870
they have a great time doing it.
For me it was just not for me.

324
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.570
No big deal.
I think this is an important thing is,
is that,
you know,

325
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:14.340
it takes a long time to kind of figure out what you're good for and part of

326
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:18.780
where I'm at right now and where I got eventually was really trying to spend

327
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:23.520
time on doing things that only I can do and even when I can do something well,

328
00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:26.340
but someone else could do it,
I would try and let that go.

329
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:29.700
That that's a discipline that I'm still working on,

330
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.960
which is not just things that I'm good at,
the things that only I'm good at.

331
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.310
So that was something I was sort of trying to start early on,
which is like,

332
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:41.970
you know,
a lot of other people can do this and they're happy doing it.

333
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:48.050
So I want to go somewhere where it requires of me to do and then I'll be happier

334
00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:50.464
and they'll be happier.

335
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.010
<v 0>I am currently having,
and I seem to have these periodically,</v>

336
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.410
a crisis of meaning phase,

337
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.060
and I'm wrestling with this exact issue,

338
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.350
trying to figure out what to abandon,
what to say no to,

339
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.380
to refine my focus so I can really focus on the intersection of my unique

340
00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:15.760
capability or capabilities,
whatever that is,
and a need of some type.

341
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.310
How did you figure that out?

342
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.530
And maybe we could approach it from a different direction.

343
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.560
What do you feel is your skillset or your,

344
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.710
your unique skill and how did you figure that out?

345
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.311
<v 2>Well,</v>

346
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:31.240
let me tell you the story of how this realization actually came to me in a kind

347
00:21:31.241 --> 00:21:35.200
of a very concrete way was while I was editing wired magazine.

348
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:38.750
And so part of what wired magazine is about is,

349
00:21:38.751 --> 00:21:43.150
is that we would come up with ideas and make assignments to writers.
Now,

350
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:46.450
some of the articles in wired would come from the writers themselves.

351
00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:49.470
They would approach us to say,
I have an idea,
but a lot of the,

352
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.300
the articles would be assigned from editors.

353
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:56.200
We'd have editorial meetings where we kind of imagine this great article and

354
00:21:56.201 --> 00:22:00.430
then we'd go and try and find someone to,
to write it.
And um,
in,

355
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:05.200
in that conversation of trying to persuade writers to write an idea that I had,

356
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.660
they would go through a kind of a very typical sequence where,
you know,

357
00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:12.370
I would have this great idea,
this is a great idea.

358
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.570
And then I would try to persuade one writer,
two or three writers and they just,

359
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.450
they didn't think it was a very good idea.
They didn't like it,

360
00:22:19.451 --> 00:22:22.930
they didn't want to do or whatever it was.
And then I'd kind of forget about it,

361
00:22:22.931 --> 00:22:26.040
but then like,
you know,
six months later would come back and say,
oh,

362
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.270
that was such a great idea.
I really think we should do that.

363
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:32.680
And then I would go again for another round of trying to persuade people and

364
00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:35.520
then I get no takers and then,
okay,
oh,
I forgot about that.

365
00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.850
Must have been a bad idea.
But then like six months later or a year later,

366
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.250
my cut backing know that's still a great idea.
Nobody has done that.

367
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.460
And then I would realize,
oh my gosh,
I need to do that.

368
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:52.060
You know,
was like,
I'm the only one who can see this.
I've tried to give it away.

369
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.970
I have tried really hard to give it away.
I've tried to kill it.

370
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.720
It just keeps on coming back,
coming back.
And it's like,
okay,

371
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.390
then I would do it and there'll be one of my best pieces.

372
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.760
And so it was this idea of like,
so,

373
00:23:03.761 --> 00:23:08.110
so I became really an important proponent of trying to give things away first.

374
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.230
Tell everybody what you're doing.
Basically,

375
00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:15.940
you try to give these ideas away and people were happy cause they love great

376
00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:20.140
ideas and you're,
hey,
do it.
It's a great idea.
You should do it.
And so,
um,

377
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.530
I try to give everything away first and then I tried to kill everything.

378
00:23:23.531 --> 00:23:24.610
It's like,
no,
that's a bad idea.

379
00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.440
And then it's the ones that keep coming back that I can't kill and they can't

380
00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:31.510
give it away.
They think,
hmm,

381
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.650
maybe that's the one I'm supposed to do because no one else is going to do it.

382
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.870
I mean,
I've been,
I mean,
actively trying to get,

383
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.160
and then of course if someone else is doing it,
you know,
you,

384
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.120
you should see someone else competing or trying to do it.
It's like,
oh yeah,

385
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:46.820
you go ahead do it.
I'm not going to race against you.
Yeah,
that's crazy.

386
00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:51.730
Because there's two of us,
you know,
you do it.
Um,
so that,

387
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.960
that generosity is actually part of this vetting process.

388
00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:01.130
Exactly.
And so that's when I kind of realized it,

389
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:04.310
but that doesn't answer the question of well how do you find out what it is?

390
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:08.160
And all I can say is,
you know,
and I don't want to be flip,

391
00:24:08.161 --> 00:24:10.490
but all I can say is this going to take all your life to figure that out.

392
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.460
That is fact.
Here's what,
here's what it is.

393
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:18.560
Figuring out is what your life is about.
That's what life is for.

394
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.850
Life is to figure it out.
And then every part of your life,

395
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.320
every day is actually does attempt to figure this out.

396
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:29.750
And you'll have different answers as you go along.

397
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.370
And sometimes there may be directions in that,
but that's basically what it is.

398
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.640
And you were very transparent about confessing this,

399
00:24:37.641 --> 00:24:42.410
but I have to tell you that even from hanging around a lot of very accomplished

400
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:46.070
people,
a lot of successful people that we would be on the covers of magazines,

401
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.510
they also go through exactly the same questioning.
I mean,

402
00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:53.990
no matter how big of $1 billion company and they have the,

403
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.890
they come up to the same thing.
Well you know what's,
what's my role in all this?

404
00:24:57.891 --> 00:25:01.850
Why am I here?
What am I useful?
What am I doing that nobody else can?
And it's a,

405
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.710
it's a continuous,
in fact,
as we'll come back to being successful,

406
00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:11.660
makes it even more difficult.
Why is that?
Because of the,

407
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.340
what I call the Creator's dilemma,

408
00:25:13.341 --> 00:25:17.480
which is very much the same thing as the innovator's dilemma,

409
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.850
which is that there's a true dilemma.
In fact,

410
00:25:20.851 --> 00:25:25.220
it in the sense that there's no right answer.
But the question is,
is sort of,

411
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:30.370
is it better to optimize your strengths or to invest into the unknown,

412
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:36.281
into places where you're weak and any places you haven't explored?

413
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:41.040
Yeah.
Any accountant and a business will tell you that it did.
Absolutely.

414
00:25:41.041 --> 00:25:44.490
It makes more sense to take your dollar cause you'll get,

415
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:49.780
you'll get a higher return by investing into what you're good at already.

416
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.820
Whatever it is is the pursuit of excellence.

417
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:56.440
This is the Tom Peters and the whole entire movement,
which is you move up hill.

418
00:25:56.441 --> 00:25:59.690
You,
you keep optimizing what you know.

419
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:04.990
And that by far is the sanest the most reasonable,

420
00:26:05.901 --> 00:26:08.000
the,
the,
the smartest thing to do.

421
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.920
But when you have a very fast changing landscape like we live in right now,

422
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:18.800
um,
you get stuck on a local Optima.
You get,
you get stuck.

423
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.630
And the problem is,
is that the only way you can get to a higher,

424
00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.080
more fit place is you actually have to go down.

425
00:26:27.081 --> 00:26:31.490
You have to have to head into a place where you are less optimal.

426
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:35.990
You have no expertise.
There's very low margins,
there's low profits.

427
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.200
You look foolish.
There'll be failures.

428
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.340
And if you've been following a line of success,

429
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:48.780
that is very,
very difficult to do.
It's very difficult for an organization.

430
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:52.470
It's almost literally almost impossible for an organization who's been
excellent,

431
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:55.440
successful to do it really is.
So,

432
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.020
<v 0>which presents a lot of opportunity for,</v>

433
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.440
<v 2>that's why the startups,
the reason why startups start,</v>

434
00:27:03.441 --> 00:27:08.420
it's because they're operating in an environment that no same B corporation

435
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:12.320
would want to be in.
It's it's,
it's a market is low margins,
low profitability,

436
00:27:12.321 --> 00:27:16.810
unproven,
high failure.
I mean it's like who was operated?

437
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.820
Nobody there.
Only reason why I started up software is they have no choice,

438
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:24.540
<v 0>right?
Yeah.
It's the,
the gift of few options,
right?</v>

439
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.100
<v 2>Exactly.
So,
so,
so in terms of success binding,</v>

440
00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:33.330
I think you have to be unsuccessful.
Who is successful,
wants to be unsuccessful.

441
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:38.370
It's very,
very hard to,
to let go of that success.

442
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.050
And so that's one of the things that works against someone really continuing
the,

443
00:27:43.051 --> 00:27:45.690
on this life journey of finding out what they're really good at.
Because,

444
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.440
because here's the thing is that successful companies and successful people

445
00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:52.140
generally try to solve problems with money.

446
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.620
You buy solutions and we all know that money doesn't,

447
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.620
is not the full answer for innovation.
You know,

448
00:27:58.621 --> 00:28:00.600
basically if you could purchase innovations,

449
00:28:00.601 --> 00:28:03.590
all the big companies were just purchased them.
Okay.
It's,

450
00:28:03.591 --> 00:28:07.170
it's the fact that these innovations often have to be found out without money

451
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.300
through other means.
Again,

452
00:28:09.301 --> 00:28:12.630
that's the event is to the startup and it's a disadvantage to the successful

453
00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:16.110
companies because they got money and they just want to buy solutions,

454
00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:19.200
but you mostly solutions you can't buy.

455
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:24.201
You have to kind of engineer in this very difficult environment of low margins,

456
00:28:24.361 --> 00:28:28.470
low success,
low profits that no one really wants to be in,

457
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:30.540
but startups are forced to be.

458
00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:35.180
<v 0>That's also an advantage I would think for beginners are novices compared to</v>

459
00:28:35.181 --> 00:28:38.240
your experts.
They have less vested identity,

460
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:42.230
less inertia to have to reverse.

461
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.910
<v 2>And that goes back to my suggestion,</v>

462
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.460
the meaning of why slack and fooling around when you're young is so important

463
00:28:48.461 --> 00:28:53.461
because a lot of these innovations and things were found not trying to solve a

464
00:28:55.811 --> 00:28:58.030
problem that can be monetized.
Yeah.

465
00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.010
It's in exploring this area without money.
I mean money is so overrated.

466
00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:03.880
It really.

467
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.890
<v 0>Could you elaborate on that?</v>

468
00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:08.040
Cause I feel like this is a sermon I need to receive on some level.

469
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.330
<v 2>There's several things to say about it.
One is,
you know,</v>

470
00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.060
obviously if you're struggling to pay bills and mortgages and stuff,

471
00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.470
there's a certain amount that's needed,
but,

472
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:21.220
but here's the thing is that accumulating enough money to do things is really a

473
00:29:21.221 --> 00:29:23.830
byproduct of other things.
It's a kind of a,

474
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.880
a lubricant in a certain sense rather than a,
you know,

475
00:29:27.881 --> 00:29:32.050
a goal and great wealth or extreme wealth is definitely overrated.

476
00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:37.450
I've had meals with a dozen billionaires and they're no different.

477
00:29:37.451 --> 00:29:39.430
I mean their lives,
lifestyles are no different.

478
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.550
There are billions is you don't to have $1 billion.
I mean put it that way,

479
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.380
you really don't.
You can't.

480
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.130
There's nothing that you can really do with it that you can't do with a lot of

481
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:49.840
less money.
It was a set that aside,

482
00:29:49.841 --> 00:29:54.841
but even just wealth itself in this world where there is more and more

483
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:56.674
abundance,

484
00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:02.220
even the money for say middleclass is less significant in a certain sense in the

485
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:07.570
sense that maybe there's status which is really not needed,

486
00:30:07.571 --> 00:30:09.640
but the things that you want to do,

487
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:12.700
the things that will make you contend to things that will satisfy you,

488
00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:17.701
the things that will bring you meaning can usually got better than having money.

489
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.990
I mean if you have a lot of time or a lot of money is always better to have a

490
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:24.370
lot of time to do something.

491
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.300
And so if you have a choice between having a lot of friends or a lot of money,

492
00:30:28.301 --> 00:30:29.950
you definitely want to have a lot of friends.

493
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:35.580
And so I think there's a way and even in which the technological progress that

494
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:38.950
we're having is actually diminishing the role of money.

495
00:30:38.951 --> 00:30:43.600
And I wanted to be clear that I'm talking about money beyond the amount that you

496
00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:47.530
need to survive.
But even that reflects back what we were saying earlier,

497
00:30:47.531 --> 00:30:51.160
which is probably less than you think it is that you can to survive.

498
00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.500
And so in a certain sense,

499
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.230
most people see money as a means to get these other things,

500
00:30:56.231 --> 00:31:01.231
but there are other routes to these other things that are deeper and more

501
00:31:03.431 --> 00:31:07.210
constant and more durable and more powerful.

502
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:11.920
So money is a sort of very small one dimensional thing that if you kind of focus

503
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:15.790
on that,
it kind of comes and goes.
And if you,

504
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.830
whatever it is that you're trying to attain,

505
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.920
you go to it more directly through other means.

506
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:26.430
You'll probably wind up with a more powerful experience or whatever it is that

507
00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:31.030
you're after.
And it will be deeper,

508
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:34.630
more renewable than coming at it with money.
And so,
you know,

509
00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.890
travel is one of the great examples is,
which is,
you know,
many,

510
00:31:38.891 --> 00:31:42.550
many people who are working very hard trying to save their money to retire some

511
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.170
day to travel.
Well,

512
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.770
I decided to flip it around and travel when I was really young,

513
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.950
when I had zero money.
And you know,

514
00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:55.880
I had experiences that basically even $1 billion couldn't have bought a
building.

515
00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.500
And it's not an uncommon sight.
And let me tell you,

516
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.850
for young kind of travelers who had very little money to be hanging out doing

517
00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:04.271
something,

518
00:32:04.271 --> 00:32:08.800
and then there will be some very wealthy people on there one week organized tour

519
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:13.450
looking at these young travelers,
this saying,
I wish you,
I wish I had more time.

520
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.630
<v 0>Yeah,
you see it,
you see it every,
well,</v>

521
00:32:15.631 --> 00:32:17.650
I see it almost every time I go traveling and it,

522
00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:21.720
and it reminds me of conversations I've had with Rolf Potts and also his book

523
00:32:21.721 --> 00:32:24.630
vagabonding,
which I just absolutely love.
And it was,

524
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:29.640
it was that book and Walden that I took with me traveling when I had my own two

525
00:32:29.641 --> 00:32:29.980
years.

526
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.980
So a walkabout and he points out in the beginning of vagabonding that many

527
00:32:35.731 --> 00:32:40.731
people subscribe to the belief along the of Charlie Sheen's in the movie Wall

528
00:32:41.211 --> 00:32:44.180
Street [inaudible] when he's asked to what he's going to do when he makes his

529
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:48.380
millions and he says,
I'm going to get a motorcycle and ride across China.

530
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:51.530
And Ralph of course points out that you could,

531
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:56.710
you could clean toilets in the u s and save enough money to ride a motorcycle

532
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.210
across time.
And uh,
the,
the,
uh,

533
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.910
let me ask you,
this is,
this is maybe tangentially related,

534
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:08.750
but you mentioned earlier that you know,
you're your Middle Age,
uh,

535
00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:10.790
your middle ages,
the middle ages maybe sounds odd,

536
00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:13.490
but in your middle age that's when you optimize.

537
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.520
And I find that horrifying on some level because I am so tired.

538
00:33:18.741 --> 00:33:21.830
I just turned 37 last week and I'm,

539
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:27.010
I'm really tired of certain types of optimizing and the incremental slogging of

540
00:33:28.911 --> 00:33:33.890
making trains run slightly more efficiently on time.
Even though,
like you said,

541
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.780
from a strictly financial standpoint,

542
00:33:35.781 --> 00:33:38.390
the advice that I would receive for many people and have received when I've

543
00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:43.391
asked for advice is here are one or two core areas you should focus on to

544
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.590
optimize for income.

545
00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.850
And on the flip side I'm tempted to approach a kind of,

546
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:55.200
not scorched earth but burned bridges approach where I somehow use creative

547
00:33:56.001 --> 00:34:01.001
destruction to force me into another direction to have these new experiences

548
00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:04.640
that I crave so much and you just,
for people who aren't aware,
I want to give,

549
00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.690
I remember going to the first ever quantified self meetup.
You're,

550
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.890
you're part of the long now foundation.

551
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.980
You've experimented in so many different arenas and have looked so far into the

552
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:19.040
future and thought on such grand a scale,
you know,
I aspire to do more of that.

553
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.110
What would be your advice to someone,

554
00:34:21.111 --> 00:34:23.600
and I know I have dozens of friends in the same position,

555
00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:27.740
they're saying in early or mid thirties in my particular peer group and they

556
00:34:27.741 --> 00:34:29.090
want to explore,

557
00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:34.091
but they're feeling pressured to optimize this thing that they've suddenly found

558
00:34:35.121 --> 00:34:37.660
their footing with whatever it is.
Then maybe they're a venture capitalist,

559
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:38.540
maybe they're in a startup,

560
00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:43.510
they feel they should start a new startup and they want to step out of that slip

561
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.590
stream.
What would be your advice to those people?

562
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.461
<v 2>First of all,</v>

563
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:51.290
I have to commend your honesty for this and I will repeat that,
that,

564
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.470
um,
it is very,
very difficult to do.
I mean,

565
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.650
I think that realization is,
you know,

566
00:34:57.651 --> 00:35:00.620
comes to people in middle age and they realize,
oh my gosh,
you know,

567
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.843
I'm kind of on a,

568
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.700
there's a little bit of a routine here and I'm not really happy with that.

569
00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:08.600
I think that kind of,
you know,
scorched earth to kind of like,
you know,
just,

570
00:35:08.601 --> 00:35:12.020
we'll just set fire to it and we'll walk away.
I actually have,

571
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.550
I think we probably have a mutual friend.

572
00:35:13.551 --> 00:35:17.410
I won't use his name because I don't know how,
how,
um,
how public this is.
But,

573
00:35:17.411 --> 00:35:22.411
but one of the solutions was the most radical one I've ever heard force himself

574
00:35:23.301 --> 00:35:25.130
was that he gave up US citizenship.

575
00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.520
<v 0>Oh Wow.
That'll do it.</v>

576
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:31.790
<v 2>It was like,
he was like saying,
I just feel so,
you know,
and,
and I was like,</v>

577
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.710
oh my gosh,
that's so radical.

578
00:35:33.711 --> 00:35:35.720
And he was telling me about what is involved in that.

579
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.970
And it wasn't for tax purposes because actually before you can do it,

580
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:43.790
the u s actually requires that you square up on all taxes.
Right.
It was like,

581
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:48.060
but that was so radical and I don't recommend that.

582
00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:53.460
I mean he's,
he's doing fine,
but I'm just saying that's necessary.

583
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:57.510
But I think the advice is Bobby taking a page from yourself.

584
00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.920
I don't think it's necessary to,
uh,
I,

585
00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.370
I think you can experiment your way through this.
I mean,

586
00:36:02.371 --> 00:36:04.320
you can do this incrementally.
You can,

587
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:09.350
you can take small steps and do something and then evaluated test how I was

588
00:36:09.571 --> 00:36:11.630
going,
whether you're getting what you want out of it,

589
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:16.470
whether it's working and then you continue in that direction and that's sort of

590
00:36:16.471 --> 00:36:18.150
the pattern of people who kind of,

591
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.630
you have second careers or reinvent themselves.

592
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:26.630
You hear that a lot and you can do that in a disciplined Tim Ferriss way.

593
00:36:27.061 --> 00:36:32.061
I don't think that it requires you to kind of walk out and leave a burning pile

594
00:36:32.311 --> 00:36:35.280
behind.
I think it's something that you're going to,

595
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.920
I'm a big believer in doing things deliberately.

596
00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:42.921
And I think that you begin by looking at those areas that you get satisfaction

597
00:36:44.221 --> 00:36:44.491
out of.

598
00:36:44.491 --> 00:36:48.600
And those areas where I often find that people kind of retreat back to kind of

599
00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:51.130
the things that they did as kids and really,
really missing,

600
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.920
whether it's art or other things.

601
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.570
And the truth is that you're not really going to be able to escape all the other

602
00:36:57.571 --> 00:36:58.440
things you have going.

603
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.350
And that's good thing because I think that is part of you and part of what you

604
00:37:01.351 --> 00:37:05.340
do well.
So you'll probably just,
you know,
bend in a certain direction.

605
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.460
And I think the one bit of advice is that you can't,
you know,

606
00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:10.290
it's not gonna happen overnight.
It's going to be,

607
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.080
it took you 37 years to get where you are.

608
00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:16.230
It may take you another 30 years to get where you want to go.

609
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:21.270
And I don't think you should feel impatient.
Maybe that's the word I'm saying is,

610
00:37:21.271 --> 00:37:22.104
is that,
uh,

611
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.760
I don't think you should imagine that you'll have another hat on with a new

612
00:37:26.761 --> 00:37:28.560
label,
you know,
next year

613
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:33.560
<v 0>just to maybe redirect that,
and this may or may not be accurate,</v>

614
00:37:33.561 --> 00:37:36.650
but in the process of researching for this conversation,

615
00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.810
which is sort of an odd exercises,

616
00:37:38.811 --> 00:37:41.330
isn't in and of itself given how much time we've spent together.

617
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.900
But I came across in Wikipedia mention of your experience in Jerusalem and

618
00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.970
deciding to live as though you only had six months left.

619
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.770
And I want to touch on that.

620
00:37:54.771 --> 00:37:59.660
But one of the questions that came to my mind when I turned 37 last week is if I

621
00:37:59.661 --> 00:38:04.370
knew I were going to die at age 40 what would I do to have the greatest impact

622
00:38:04.371 --> 00:38:06.240
on the greatest number of people?
And so the,

623
00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:11.250
I find that constraint helpful and I worry that if I aim it not being impatient

624
00:38:12.561 --> 00:38:13.394
in that way,

625
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:18.490
that I won't because I could get hit by a bus that I won't do what I'm capable

626
00:38:18.921 --> 00:38:22.280
of doing.
Maybe you could talk about,
and I had no idea,

627
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:26.240
I'm not sure if you would self describe yourself as a devout Christian,

628
00:38:26.241 --> 00:38:27.890
but that's,
that's certainly written here.

629
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:32.000
Maybe you could talk a little bit about that experience.

630
00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.760
<v 2>Yeah.
So yeah,</v>

631
00:38:33.761 --> 00:38:38.230
one thing I would of course warn people is that not everything on Wikipedia is

632
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:41.990
correct.
No,
that's why I'm bringing it up.
But it is,

633
00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.010
it's true that I got this assignment in Jerusalem,
which by the way,

634
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:46.540
if you want to hear the full version of it,

635
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.090
listen to one of the very first this American lives,

636
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.880
which I IRA glass.

637
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.650
And I told the story for the very first time and it's a story about how I got

638
00:38:56.651 --> 00:39:00.460
this assignment to live as if I was going to die in six months,

639
00:39:00.461 --> 00:39:02.170
even though I was like perfectly healthy.

640
00:39:02.171 --> 00:39:04.690
And I knew that there was a very improbable,

641
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:09.040
but I decided to take the assignment seriously.
And that's,
that's what I did.

642
00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:13.030
And my answer kind of surprised me because I thought that I would kind of have

643
00:39:13.031 --> 00:39:17.410
this sort of mad,
high risk fling,
you know,
uh,
do all these things.

644
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:21.250
But actually what I wanted to do was to visit my brothers and sisters,

645
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.630
go back to my parents,
help out with them.
My mom was not well at a time,

646
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:30.250
but that lasted for three months before I decided I need to do something big.

647
00:39:30.251 --> 00:39:34.420
So I actually rode my bicycle across the u s from San Francisco to New York

648
00:39:34.421 --> 00:39:37.360
where I was going to New Jersey where I was going to basically die.

649
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.480
And I kept a journal of that.

650
00:39:40.481 --> 00:39:45.220
And that question was something that I keep asking myself.

651
00:39:45.221 --> 00:39:50.140
Now I actually have a countdown clock that Matt Groening,

652
00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:54.190
Futurama was inspired and they did a little episode on the future arm are about.

653
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:59.220
And what I did was I took the actuarial tables for the estimated age of my death

654
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.840
for someone born when I was born.

655
00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:05.280
And I work back the number of days and I have,

656
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:09.280
I have that showing on my computer how many days?

657
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.200
And I tell you nothing,

658
00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:15.370
constantly traits your time,

659
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.710
like knowing how many days you have left.
No,

660
00:40:17.711 --> 00:40:22.210
of course I'm likely again to live more than that.

661
00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:27.040
I mean good health,
etc. But nonetheless,
there was something that really,

662
00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:27.461
you know,

663
00:40:27.461 --> 00:40:32.080
I have 6,000 something days is not very many days to do all the things I want to

664
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:32.830
do.

665
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:37.830
And so I think your exercise is really fantastic and commendable and there's two

666
00:40:38.051 --> 00:40:40.180
questions.
What do you,
what would you do if at six months living,

667
00:40:40.181 --> 00:40:41.890
what would you do if he hit $1 billion?

668
00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:47.160
And interestingly is the convergence of those two questions because it turns out

669
00:40:49.271 --> 00:40:52.930
that you probably don't need $1 billion to do whatever it is you're going to do

670
00:40:52.931 --> 00:40:56.230
in six months.
Right?
And so I think you're asking the right question.
And,

671
00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:00.670
and the way I answer it is you want to keep asking yourself that question every,

672
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:04.800
every six months and really try to answer it.
And I tried to,
you know,

673
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.590
do that on a kind of a day by day basis.

674
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:13.591
I learned something from my friend Stewart brand who organized his remaining

675
00:41:13.961 --> 00:41:16.870
days around five year increments.
He says,

676
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:20.790
any great idea that's significant,
that's worth doing for him?
Well,

677
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:24.190
it lasts about five years from the time he thinks of it til the time we stopped

678
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:28.750
thinking about it.
And if you think of it in terms of five year projects,

679
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.950
you can count those off on,
you know,
a couple of hands for even if you're young.

680
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.690
And so the sense of mortality of,

681
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.200
of understanding that it's not just old people who don't have very many,

682
00:41:39.201 --> 00:41:41.360
you know,
you're,
you're 20 years old,

683
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:44.660
you don't have that many five year projects to do.

684
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.660
And so I think it is,

685
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:52.340
that's maybe part of the philosophy of thinking about our time and whether you,

686
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:57.341
even if you believe in the extension of life longevity living to 120 you still

687
00:41:58.941 --> 00:42:02.230
have to think in these terms of what are you gonna do for you?
Cause you're new.

688
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:06.140
You don't know if you'll live on 120 what are you going to do if you have a year

689
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.010
and what would you do with $1 billion?
And what's the intersection of those two?

690
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:16.550
