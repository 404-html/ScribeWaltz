00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.050
Book about Barry Bonds in the balco steroid scandal.
Hit store shelves today.

2
00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:08.250
It is already number 24 on amazon.com bestseller list.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.610
That's actually down one notch.
It was 23 earlier this morning,

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.640
game of shadows by two San Francisco Chronicle.

5
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:19.410
Reporters claims that bonds use steroids for at least five seasons beginning in

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:20.760
1998 now,

7
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:25.320
bonds denies using any banned substances and he has never tested positive for

8
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:30.321
any but one man says what is written in that book could have a huge impact on

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.450
other people,
especially impressionable young athletes.

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.770
Timothy Ferris owns a sports training and nutritional supplement company based

11
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:41.160
in San Jose.
He joins me this morning to talk about some of the concerns.

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.340
Good morning and thanks for coming.
Oh,
it's my pleasure.
Thanks for having me.

13
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.880
One of your concerns that this book might in your estimation,

14
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:52.650
double steroid use among,
uh,
young American athletes.
Uh,
that's exactly right.

15
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.790
There's a precedent of a downstream trickle effect when you have books of this

16
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:00.360
type,
particularly one is promoted as a drug by drug,

17
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:04.200
day by day account of what some people are calling the best hitter in history.

18
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.450
Uh,
in the late nineties,
there was a bodybuilder named Andreas Mune,
sir,

19
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.630
who died from an overdose of various anabolic products and a weekly German

20
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:18.180
magazine named Der Spiegel,
published all of it,

21
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:21.330
a full account with his exact dosages and when you used them,

22
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.740
and despite the fact that he died using this munes or cocktail as it became

23
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.740
known,
uh,
it was duplicated among athletes.

24
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.550
And that was with a relatively unknown German publication.

25
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.990
But this is in prime time now and I feel that,
uh,

26
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.970
very impressionable athletes could be led to use more,

27
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:42.140
not less steroids as a result of this bone away.

28
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.200
Kind of like what we see with some a movie critics.
Even if it's bad press,

29
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.520
any press creates more buzz and more people go to check it out.
No,

30
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:52.140
that's exactly right.
And a,

31
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.490
I actually have had the opportunity to read the book.
Uh,

32
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.000
and,
uh,
it's not as sensational as the excerpts,

33
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.180
but the way that the book has been positioned in the excerpts,
uh,

34
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:06.180
the sensational benefits of growth hormone,

35
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.210
steroids and other anabolic products far outweighs the,
uh,

36
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.710
the cautionary notes that are included.
So now,
as we mentioned,
you know,

37
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.450
you on a sports supplement company,

38
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:18.270
what do you tell your clients that they want to boost their performance?

39
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:22.170
What's your advice to them?
I work with my athletes primarily in a,

40
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:26.520
in a training and nutritional capacity,
uh,
at the highest level of sports.
Uh,

41
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.150
particularly in sports,
it depend on power and speed.
So track and field,
uh,
the,

42
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.190
the top athletes are almost without exception,
using a,

43
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.510
an entire laundry list of drugs.
Uh,
in my particular case,

44
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:43.050
athletes will come to me when they want to get off of those drugs,
uh,

45
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.120
and still maintain their competitive edge.

46
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.120
And that's how I assist them using hydration,
nutrition,

47
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:51.150
or botanicals in place of illegal advanced substances.

48
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.450
So now you're saying that most athletes are using,
when you say they use drugs,

49
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:58.790
are they illegal drugs or illegal drugs?
Uh,
they're using both.
It's,

50
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.820
it's that they're using purely a prescription or illegal medications.

51
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:06.910
They're using everything that they can get their hands on that will help them,

52
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.350
ranging from legal supplements to imported illegal schedule,

53
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:13.230
three drugs,
which,
uh,

54
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.440
anabolic steroids would be classified as in the same category as opium,
uh,

55
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.440
and with the same punishment.
Let's talk a little bit about that.

56
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:24.550
Some of the younger athletes say high school athletes and irrespective of the

57
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:28.240
book or not just the publicity,
the buzz around steroids these days,

58
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.970
as much attention as it gets in the media,

59
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.690
do you think that has any kind of an effect on them?
Do they see this and say,

60
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.110
I'm staying away or do they see this and get curious and go towards it in your

61
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:40.630
opinion?
I think they get curious,
uh,

62
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.960
particularly when they read excerpts that claim,
uh,
for example,

63
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:48.510
that growth hormone improves hand,
eye coordination,
perception,
speed,
et cetera.

64
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.160
Uh,
I'm not saying that the drugs don't have those effects,

65
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:55.900
but I think that education is the solution here.
A drug testing,
uh,

66
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.610
using drug testing to solve drugs in sports is like using a breathalyzer to

67
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:02.080
solve drunk driving.
It just doesn't work.

68
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:04.000
You need to educate these younger athletes.

69
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.910
And in the case of high school athletes in particular,

70
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.060
if you simply say don't do drugs,
uh,

71
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.300
it's not going to have the compelling effect that you wanted to.

72
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:17.170
You need to make it clear that given their hormonal profile at that age,

73
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.370
using those drugs really has no benefit.
And the downsides are tremendous.

74
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:24.520
The risks are tremendous.
When you're that age and your growth plates haven't,
uh,

75
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.480
haven't stopped developing.
For example,
would you say that,
that,

76
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:28.720
that follows through again,

77
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:31.270
let's say now that you're a professional athlete where you're,

78
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.290
you're growing has more or less come complete,
do the steroids,

79
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.980
are bad substances still have a negative effect in your opinion?
Uh,

80
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.030
they can have a negative effect,
a certain drugs more than others.
Uh,

81
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:46.300
what I think is important for people to understand is that when people say

82
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:50.380
steroids,
that's in fact a very broad class of drug.
Uh,

83
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.560
so if you were to say by analogy stimulant,

84
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.000
that would range from a cup of coffee to cocaine.
Uh,

85
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.600
many of these steroids have legitimate medical applications and low,

86
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.270
uh,
doctor supervised settings.
Um,
but when you're abusing them,

87
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.630
uh,
in an athletic setting using super physiological doses,

88
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:15.250
they can have very serious side effects ranging from prostate enlargement,
uh,

89
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.340
to,
to cardiac problems.
Um,

90
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.400
but I'm not going to deny the performance benefits,

91
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.120
that's what they're designed for.
But there are side effects and risks involved.

92
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.190
And if I could add one more thing,

93
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:30.610
I would say that besides the physical side effects,
uh,

94
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.630
people should be very aware of the legal side effects.
Most athletes,

95
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:38.060
young athletes included,
uh,
see the f the,

96
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.590
the drugs freely available around them and assume that means the penalties

97
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.550
aren't very severe.

98
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.240
But you can go to jail for a very long time simply by possessing these drugs,

99
00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:50.320
which are very good Timothy Ferriss.
Thanks for your insight this morning.

100
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.020
I know it's a topic that people are going to be talking about for a long time.

101
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.100
It's my pleasure.
Thank you.
