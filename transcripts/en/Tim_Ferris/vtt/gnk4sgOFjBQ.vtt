1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.790
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:07.791
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.530
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.380
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.</v>

5
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.180
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way,
set it and forget it.

6
00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:36.530
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

7
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:37.280
investors.

8
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.000
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

9
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.000
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

10
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.380
some of my very good friends,

11
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:48.560
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

12
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.650
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

13
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.940
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

14
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:57.920
pay pennies on the dollar for them,

15
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.640
and this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

16
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:04.400
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

17
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.560
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

18
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:12.800
assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for

19
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:16.610
free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their

20
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:20.510
advice,
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

21
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:22.430
you can set it and forget it and here's why.

22
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.720
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

23
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:31.190
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't great investing

24
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.810
is a marathon,
not a sprint,

25
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.500
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax

26
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:38.630
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

27
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.130
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

28
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:46.820
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

29
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:49.430
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

30
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.630
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

31
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:55.130
impossible right off the bat,

32
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.650
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

33
00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:02.651
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

34
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:07.010
free.
If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

35
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.140
that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.
Now,

36
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:13.770
normally when I have a sponsor on this show,

37
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:17.330
it's because I use them and recommend them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

38
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.640
I don't use wealth front yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

39
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.870
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

40
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.560
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

41
00:02:29.561 --> 00:02:32.380
So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast,

42
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.460
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

43
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:40.330
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

44
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.450
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

45
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.960
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

46
00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:50.830
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account.

47
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.860
But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

48
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.640
Take two minutes,
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash.

49
00:02:57.641 --> 00:03:01.180
Tim It's fast.
It's,
there's no downside that I can think of.

50
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.000
So check it out guys.
This is one of the hottest,

51
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.870
most innovative companies coming out of Silicon Valley and they're killing it.

52
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.900
They've become massively popular.
Just take a look,

53
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.790
see what portfolio they would create for you,

54
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.080
and you can use that information however you want.

55
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.943
Tim

56
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.490
this episode is brought to you by me undies.
If I'm not going commando,
I'm in me.

57
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:24.961
Andy's,

58
00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:29.010
I have been testing these underwear for three to four months now pretty much

59
00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:34.011
every day and in fact throughout bunch of my other underwear this morning and on

60
00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:39.150
the road in the house,
they are extremely comfortable.
They look good,
feel good.

61
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.200
They are made of micro model two times softer than cotton and scientifically

62
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:46.920
tested using the [inaudible] method.
Sounds very fancy.
Of course,

63
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.820
and I get a lot of compliments from ladies for these.
You don't get diaper butt,

64
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.940
you don't get the tired elastic band.
They look great.

65
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.720
And they have underwear for both men and women.

66
00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:01.390
Check out [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim and you can see everything that

67
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:04.560
I've been wearing.
They're ridiculous.
The sublime,
everything in between,

68
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.170
including my favorite,
which is called out.

69
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.680
And I would be remiss if I didn't mention their lounge pants.

70
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.940
This is a new thing.

71
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.030
And I had been wearing their lounge pants when I record podcast.

72
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.510
I've been wearing them out and about when I'm walking the dog meeting people for

73
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:22.360
coffee.
And they are extremely comfortable though.

74
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.680
They're made from the same material as the underwear.
But some of them,

75
00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:26.281
like the blue ones,

76
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:31.281
I have have pockets so you can walk about without seeming like you're off of

77
00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:35.130
your meds and completely crazy.
So that is awesome.

78
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.740
And if you're not happy with the first pair you try on,

79
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:39.060
I assume that refers to the underwear,

80
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.880
they'll refund you completely and you can keep the pair you tried on for free.

81
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.110
But if you're that kind of person,

82
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.780
you should be ashamed because that's disgusting.
Uh,

83
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.700
[inaudible] dot com four slash Tim,
check it out.

84
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.673
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.610
<v 2>Derek,
welcome to the show.
Thank you.</v>

86
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.470
I am so excited to have you on.
This has been in the works for for many months

87
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.400
now.
Of course the timing is such,

88
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:08.110
and I'm going to read a bio and a short intro for you for folks in a second.

89
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.973
But,
uh,

90
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.550
we're going to come back to the subject of fasting because I'm eight days into a

91
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.570
10 day fast.

92
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.800
And I was astonished to hear when we were chatting a day or two ago that you

93
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:20.410
have done something very similar,
if not the same.

94
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.610
So before we get to that though,
for everybody listening,
uh,
Derek Sivers,

95
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.470
one of my favorite humans,
so excited to have him on the phone.
And a,

96
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:32.080
here is a sketch of his background.

97
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:35.800
Originally a professional musician and circus clown.
Derek Sivers,

98
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.760
you should say hi to him at Sivers on the Twitter.

99
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.880
That is Siv.

100
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.460
E R s created CD baby in 1998 became the largest seller of independent music

101
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:49.840
online with 100 million in sales for 150,000 musicians in 2008,

102
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:51.940
Derek sold CD baby for 22 million,

103
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.820
giving the proceeds to a charitable trust for music education.

104
00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.390
He is and has been a frequent on the Ted Conference circuit with more than 5

105
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.340
million views of his talks.

106
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.480
And since 2011 he has published 24 books including anything you want,

107
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.110
which shot to number one on all of its Amazon categories.

108
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.820
It is also one of the few business books which I think categorically are

109
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.850
generally terrible that I've not only read multiple times but listened to uh,

110
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.980
multiple times of the last of which was in Sweden about a month and a half ago

111
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:29.630
before deciding to take my startup vacation effectively my retirement from

112
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.600
startup investing.
So Derek,

113
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.170
thank you for putting out such good work first before we even jump into it.

114
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.440
Thanks.
Good to find that.
Well,
you know,

115
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.270
officially talk to you off the record,
which is kind of funny sometimes because,

116
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.660
uh,
every now and then people ask me about like,
Hey,

117
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:50.390
do you know what Tim's investing in,
you know about this?
And I think,
you know,

118
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.910
every time you and I talk we just,
we talk about women.

119
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.610
So here we are having an official conversation finally.
No,
we are,

120
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.930
and I should also underscore for people,
number one,

121
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.910
I'm eight days into fasting.
So if I sound like an idiot,

122
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:05.870
I'm going to blame it on that.

123
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:10.871
But second is that I consider you a reality check for me.

124
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.850
And we first met,

125
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.880
I want to say it was that a music and tech or tech and music event in 2007

126
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:22.700
perhaps 2000.
Yep.
And uh,

127
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.690
I was familiar with some of your work.
You had read the four hour workweek.

128
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.550
And the,

129
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.020
the prompt for me to call you oftentimes is,
is number one.

130
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.140
If I just need a sanity check where for instance,

131
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.770
if people around me seem to be asking the question,

132
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.410
how should you best grow your company?

133
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.090
And then there's an ABC multiple choice list.

134
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.950
I don't necessarily go to you to get a d in an e.
I go to you because you,

135
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.830
you will say,
well,
why do you want to grow your company in the first place?

136
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.230
Ask the wrong question.
And secondly,

137
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.920
because you're very good at simplifying and breaking things down.
And I recall,

138
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.590
and I might be getting low the location wrong,

139
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:10.250
but I seem to place this in time square,

140
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.460
sitting on the bleachers talking about,

141
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.810
I think it was sequel and databases and I was saying that I was extremely

142
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:21.320
uncomfortable.
It felt out of my depth when talking to engineers and you're like,

143
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.970
oh,
it's not that hard.
And you sat down and on a single page,

144
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.080
a piece of paper sketched out databases and sequel and how it worked.

145
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.400
And I just admire the,
not only capability,

146
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:35.600
which is not that common,

147
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:39.680
but the willingness to simplify something where I think we live in a world where

148
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.970
many people complicate to profit,
right?
If what you do is,

149
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.540
if what you do is simple,
then you feel like you're dispensable,

150
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.790
if that makes sense.
And,
uh,

151
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.860
but I want to stop talking and ask you because I'm not sure I actually ever

152
00:08:54.861 --> 00:08:55.860
heard the full story

153
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.570
<v 3>of originally a professional musician and circus clown and water.</v>

154
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.790
What is the circus cloud story?
Okay.

155
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:08.150
There's actually a good lesson inside the story is that I was 18 years old and

156
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.840
all I wanted in my whole life was to be a professional musician.
I mean,

157
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.310
ideally a rockstar.
Yeah.
But if I was just making my living doing music,

158
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:21.060
that was the goal.
So I'm 18 years old,
I'm living in Boston,

159
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:25.590
I'm going to Berklee College of music and I'm in this band,
uh,

160
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:30.100
where the bass player one day in rehearsal says,
hey man,
um,

161
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:35.210
my agent just offered me a Gig that's like $75 to play at a pig show in Vermont.

162
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.440
He rolls his eyes and he's like,
I'm not going to do it.
Do you want the Gig?

163
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.750
I'm like,
fuck yeah,
a paying gig.
Oh my God.
Yes.
So,

164
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.730
uh,
I took the Gig to go up to Burlington,
Vermont and I think it was like a,

165
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:56.430
you know,
$58 round trip bus ticket.
And I get to this pig show in Vermont.

166
00:09:56.431 --> 00:10:00.270
I strapped my acoustic guitar and then I walk around a pig show playing music

167
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.030
and uh,
did that for like three hours,

168
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:08.031
got on the bus home and the next day the booking agent called me up and said,

169
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:11.280
uh,
hey.
So well,
yeah,
you did a really good job at the big show.

170
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:12.480
We got good reports there.

171
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:17.010
I'm wondering if you can come play at an art opening in western Massachusetts a,

172
00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:20.700
I'll pay you 75 bucks again.
I said,
yeah,
sure.
So same thing.
I took the,
you know,

173
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:23.250
like a $60 bus out to western Massachusetts,

174
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.230
got 75 bucks for playing at an art opening and the agent was there and he was

175
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:31.400
impressed.
And so he said,
Hey,
look,
I've got this circus,
uh,

176
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.840
and the previous musician just quit.

177
00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:36.360
So we really need somebody new and I really like what you're doing.

178
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.210
So there's a about three gigs a week,
I can pay you 75 bucks a Gig.
Uh,

179
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.600
they're usually Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday.
Uh,
do you want the Gig?
I said,

180
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.340
hell yeah,
I'm a professional musician.
Now,
this is amazing.
So,

181
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.680
so I said yes to everything which is going to come up later.

182
00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:55.830
You know what the hell yeah or no thing that I think it's really smart to switch

183
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:59.300
strategies.
But when you're earlier in your career,
I think the best strategies,

184
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.910
you just say yes to everything,
every piddly little Gig,

185
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:04.830
you just never know what are the lottery tickets.

186
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:09.831
So this one ended up being a real lottery ticket for me because as soon as I

187
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.580
joined the circus again,
I'm 18.
I had no stage experience.

188
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.000
And uh,
with after a few gigs they said,
hey,

189
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:22.740
so the previous musician used to go out and open the show with this big theme

190
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:25.680
song and get everybody up and dancing.
Could you do that?
And I said,
yeah,
sure.

191
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.750
And another Gig or two later they said,
hey,

192
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:30.750
the previous musician used to close the show also with that theme song.

193
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:31.950
Could you do that?
I said,
yeah,
sure.

194
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.340
And then it was the previous musician used to go out in between every act and

195
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:38.610
like,
you know,

196
00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:41.790
get the audience to applaud and thank them and introduce the next act.

197
00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:44.670
Do you think you could do that?
I said,
yeah,
sure.

198
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.640
And I was really bad at it at first,
but I got good.

199
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:51.930
Eventually I became like the ringleader mc of this whole circus and I was 18

200
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:56.470
years old.
So if you were to go to the circus,
it would have looked like my show.

201
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.990
And I did that for 10 years.

202
00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:03.070
From the age of 18 to 28 I did over a thousand shows and eventually by the way,

203
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.500
cut paid more than 75 bucks.

204
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.610
Eventually I was getting like 300 bucks a show and it became my full time living

205
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:14.140
and I even bought a house with the money I made playing with the circuits.

206
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:16.030
And then that led to all kinds of other things.

207
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.060
So just so many huge opportunities in 10 years of stage experience came from

208
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:26.980
that one piddly little pig show.
And I said yesterday,
the civil thing.

209
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.080
Um,
so yeah,

210
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:33.130
the only reason I stopped doing the circus is when CD baby started taking over

211
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:35.710
my life and I had to start turning down circus gigs.
But yeah,

212
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:37.090
that was my life for 10 years.

213
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:42.160
What did you learn that made you better?
What were the,

214
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.120
the lessons learned that made the biggest difference in your performance as this

215
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:51.610
mc?
Good question.
It was,

216
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.400
or the biggest mistakes that you made early on that you corrected?

217
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.830
Either one's fine.
All right.
Um,

218
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.480
it's kind of the same answers that at first I was too self conscious because I

219
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:04.840
thought it was about me.

220
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:10.020
Like I was going up on stage thinking that the audience was somehow judging me.

221
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.840
Derek silver is like as if I mattered,
you know,

222
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.040
so I would get self conscious what they thought of me.

223
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.391
And eventually,

224
00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:24.200
and I think it took maybe like 10 or 20 gigs with the,

225
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:29.260
the,
the circus was run by a husband and wife team.
And uh,

226
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.080
Tarleton was the name of the wife that,
um,

227
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.290
she was the one really kind of out on the gigs and leading the circus.

228
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.680
The husband was more of the booking agent and she's the one that like single

229
00:13:41.721 --> 00:13:44.800
handedly gave me my confidence that I have today.

230
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:47.980
Like sometimes when people ask me,
why am I so confident?

231
00:13:47.981 --> 00:13:50.920
It's like that's because of Tarleton.
That's a longer story we get into.

232
00:13:50.921 --> 00:13:54.820
But anyway,
Tarleton is the one that she just kept pushing me from backstage.

233
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:58.900
It's like,
come on,
you're,
you're up there acting like David Letterman.
Like don't,

234
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.110
don't do this whole kind of a high,
yeah,
I'm so cool.

235
00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:05.230
Alright everybody here is the next act.

236
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:08.320
Like I think I was trying to be cool because I thought that people were judging

237
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:12.460
me.
Right?
And she said,
these people came here for a show.

238
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:14.680
Go give them what they came here for.

239
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.180
And so one time I decided to go out there and just be over the top.
Ridiculous.

240
00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:21.550
I went on stage and I said,
ladies and gentlemen,

241
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:23.450
what you're about to see is one of the most amazing,
you get to get a,

242
00:14:23.451 --> 00:14:25.480
we have an elephant that is going to be coming from backstage.

243
00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:29.380
And I did this whole like thing and the fast talking voice and a real like

244
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.390
pizzazz to it and the audience loved it.
And I came backstage and she said,

245
00:14:34.391 --> 00:14:37.840
there you go.
That's what people come to the circus for.

246
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.040
So now that I've been on stage,
you know,

247
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:47.130
thousands of times I that's this really sunk in that you get on stage to give

248
00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:51.320
the audience what they came there for.
Or even things like this,

249
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:55.370
this interview we're doing,
this isn't necessarily for you or me,

250
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:58.190
we could just hang up the phone and talk.
We don't need to,

251
00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.650
but we're doing this for the listeners.

252
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:05.000
So we're going to give them something that's useful to them.
This isn't about me.

253
00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:09.440
It isn't about you.
This is about them.
So that was the biggest lesson learned.

254
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:12.620
Luckily I learned that early on when I was 18,
19 and yeah,

255
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:17.480
so I know he could come back to it,
but I don't want to forget since I have low,

256
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.020
low glucose brain,
which I think I just made Japanese accidentally.

257
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.630
But uh,

258
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:27.470
so how did she give you your confidence or if you prefer to answer it a

259
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:28.304
different way?

260
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.300
Because I get this question a lot from fans on Twitter for instance,
you know,

261
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:33.470
how did you get so confident?

262
00:15:33.471 --> 00:15:37.910
And there are things I can point to from athletic training with specific

263
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:40.010
wrestling coaches and so on.
But if,

264
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.960
if what did that woman do that that helped make you more to help make you more

265
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:45.380
confident?

266
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:50.000
Or if you were trying to coach somebody who's going to get up and give their

267
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:52.910
first ted talk,
what would you say to them?

268
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:56.180
And I don't know if the answers are similar,
completely different answers.

269
00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:58.220
So we'll just do the confidence one.
I can,

270
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:02.720
I can give Ted talk advice later if you want.
Is that in my case?

271
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:03.703
Um,

272
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.060
you gotta understand Tarleton was hot.

273
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:13.450
I was 18 and she was 33 and even the first time I ever saw her,

274
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.220
it,
I told you that she was the,
the booking agent's wife.

275
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.330
So when I took that bus out to western Massachusetts the first time I'm sitting

276
00:16:20.331 --> 00:16:24.320
in the Worcester mass bus station,
it's nasty.
It's the,
you know,

277
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:29.170
the dregs of the earth with fluids dripping.
And uh,
it,

278
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.200
it's gross.

279
00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:35.000
And I'm sitting there waiting for somebody to pick me up and then like the door

280
00:16:35.001 --> 00:16:36.260
opens to the bus station.

281
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:39.020
And it's like that scene in the movie with the backlit woman and you know,

282
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:43.630
the fan blowing her hair and the dream weaver,
you know,

283
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.770
is that moment,
this gorgeous woman walks in the bus station.
I'm like,
oh,

284
00:16:48.771 --> 00:16:53.090
is that,
and she walks towards me and she says,
Derrick.
And I was like,

285
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.340
so that was Tarleton.
So it's important to know that Charleston is hot.

286
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:03.400
She still is.
And so,
you know,
I was 18 and,
and uh,

287
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.610
I was dating girls in Boston and uh,

288
00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.710
of course just everybody broke my heart and this one girl from Texas just dumped

289
00:17:12.711 --> 00:17:13.880
me and I would sad.

290
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:18.530
And at that point Tarleton and I had been traveling together on the circus for a

291
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:22.400
year or so.
So she knew me very well.
And,
uh,

292
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.490
when I told her about the,
you know,
the girl from Texas that dumped me,

293
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:27.950
she just said,
Derrick,
like you don't understand.

294
00:17:27.951 --> 00:17:32.150
Like I've met a lot of guys in my life,
a lot of guys,
she said,

295
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.270
you are one of like the smartest was brilliant.

296
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:38.930
Like consider it like you've got a future,
you've got your shit together.

297
00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:42.530
You're like,
if some woman doesn't see that,
that's her problem.
Okay.

298
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.650
So the first like a hundred times she said this,

299
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:49.800
I just thought she was just being nice,
you know?
I was like,
no,
you,

300
00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:50.940
but I'm still sad.

301
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:55.050
And I think it took about a year where she just kept telling me this and kept

302
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:58.950
telling me this.
And after about a year,
it kind of sunk in.

303
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.670
Like I just noticed that I had kind of internalized this like,
yeah,
sorry,

304
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.160
and you can't see me right now,
but I'm just like,
you know,
changed my posture.

305
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:08.520
I'm like,
yeah,
I'm pretty fucking awesome.
I'm cool.
I'm like,

306
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.410
I really internalized that.

307
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:14.400
So I just carried that with me ever since.
You know,

308
00:18:14.401 --> 00:18:19.401
sometimes there's this beautiful Kurt Vonnegut quote that's a,

309
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.070
just a throwaway line in the middle of one of his books that says,

310
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.670
you are whatever you pretend to be such a good line.

311
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.400
And I took that to heart that I just thought,
you know,

312
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:33.030
I'd also been reading Tony Robbins and stuff by then.
Actually she,
Oh God,

313
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:33.481
Tarleton.

314
00:18:33.481 --> 00:18:37.560
Is that the same woman that she's the one that told me to read Tony Robbins

315
00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:41.010
awaken the giant within when I was 19 and that changed my life.
So yeah,

316
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.380
she's one of like the big three influences on my life.

317
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.620
That's probably exact same age that I read the exact same book.

318
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:51.540
Just as a side note,
that is the good time to read it,
those formative years.

319
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.800
So,
um,
yeah,
I,

320
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.120
I think the you are whatever you pretend to be.

321
00:18:57.121 --> 00:19:00.600
I think I just realized somewhere in there that you can just choose to be

322
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:05.240
confident.
Um,
she helped kind of start it for me,
but then I,

323
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.880
I kept it up myself even when everything is going terribly and I have no reason

324
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.280
to be confident.
I just decide to be,

325
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:16.830
it seems like most of my friends who are,

326
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.840
what most people would consider successful in various respects can trace their

327
00:19:21.841 --> 00:19:26.841
confidence back to either or both end a specific woman and a space and a

328
00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:35.340
specific coach or mentor of some type.
It's all,

329
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:40.310
it almost always comes down to one or both of those.
Oh Damn.
You know,

330
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.260
I've never told you about Kimo Williams.

331
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.420
It's a great name and I want to learn more.
No,

332
00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:48.300
I don't know anything about this is so up your alley.

333
00:19:48.301 --> 00:19:50.610
I can't believe I've never told you this.
Okay,
thanks.

334
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.790
[inaudible] you prompted me with that because you're right,

335
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.290
it was a gorgeous woman,

336
00:19:55.350 --> 00:20:00.350
Tarleton and it was a music teacher Kimo Williams that he but see,

337
00:20:02.011 --> 00:20:05.400
he changed my life a year or two before I met her.
Okay.
So imagine this,

338
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.260
I'm 17 years old now.

339
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.430
I'm living in suburban Chicago and I decided to go to Berklee College of music

340
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.840
because I want to be a famous musician.

341
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:17.340
And just like two or three months before I'm supposed to go,

342
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:18.660
uh,

343
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.530
I see an ad in the local Chicago Tribune for music type setting.

344
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.340
And I'm wondering like,
how much sheet music I'm going to have to be writing?

345
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.070
So I call up this classified ad in the paper and I say,

346
00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:32.190
can I ask you some questions about music typesetting?
And he said,
sure.

347
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:33.330
Well why do you want to know?
And I said,

348
00:20:33.331 --> 00:20:36.930
because I'm about to go off to Berkeley College of music in a couple months.

349
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.980
And he said,
oh,
really?
He said,
I used to teach at Berkeley College of music.

350
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:45.780
I said,
you did,
um,
do you think you can give me some tips?
And he said,
yeah,

351
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.200
um,
here's my address.
Come to my studio at 9:00 AM Thursday morning.

352
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.410
See you then.
Uh,
so,

353
00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:56.650
and he lived like way downtown Chicago in an area I've never been to.

354
00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:02.040
And I'm going to do a little foreshadowing of the story perfect right now

355
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.580
because,
uh,
when I got married years later,
uh,

356
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.330
to the woman I met when I was sitting in Times Square with you,
uh,

357
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.860
he was one of only three people I invited to the wedding.
Uh,

358
00:21:13.861 --> 00:21:17.650
it was Tarleton from the circus.
Kimo Williams,

359
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:20.680
my music teacher and my first girlfriend can be all,

360
00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.540
those are my only three guests to my wedding.

361
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:27.400
And Kimo Williams told the story to my family.
He said,
you know,

362
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.500
I tell people all the time,
I get all these kids that want,
you know,

363
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.690
want to be famous.
And I said,
Yep,
show up at my studio at 9:00 AM.
And he said,

364
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:39.040
nobody ever does.
Nobody has their shit together to show up when I tell them too.

365
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.180
And he said,

366
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.510
so I'd honestly forgotten that there was this kid that called from a classified

367
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:48.320
ad
that was his way of saying no,
no,
no,
was not.

368
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.040
No,
it was just his hurdle.
He was like,
yeah,
all right kid.
Sure.

369
00:21:51.041 --> 00:21:55.990
Here's a seven foot hurdle to you do.
Exactly.
So,
uh,
he said,
so,

370
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:56.410
you know,

371
00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.490
my doorbell rings some Thursday morning at 8:59 AM and I opened the door and

372
00:22:00.491 --> 00:22:03.920
there was some long haired teenagers sitting there and you know,

373
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:08.890
so now flipping back to a first person point of view is,

374
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.940
uh,
yeah.

375
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.940
Kimo Williams is this a large black man from Hawaii that was a musician that

376
00:22:16.331 --> 00:22:19.180
attended Berklee school of music and then stayed there to teach for awhile.

377
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:24.510
And so what he taught me in for lessons got me to graduate Berklee College of

378
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:31.000
music in half the time it would take.
And here was his thing.
He said,

379
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.690
the reason I wanted you to like study with me for a bit,
he said,

380
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:38.500
I know you only have like eight weeks before you go to school.
He said,

381
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.910
I think you can graduate Berklee School of music in two years instead of four.

382
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.900
Um,
he said,
the standard pace is for chumps.

383
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.820
I should get a tee shirt made that Tim Ferriss' stuff right then was like,

384
00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:55.960
I can't believe we hadn't talked about this before,

385
00:22:55.961 --> 00:23:00.550
that he's the one at the age of like 17,
18 got me into this mentality.

386
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.860
He said were the standard pace is for chumps.

387
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.160
That's the school has to organize it's curricula around the lowest common

388
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:13.450
denominator so that almost nobody is left out.

389
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.690
So they have to slow down so that everybody can catch up.
But he said,

390
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:17.560
you're smarter than that,

391
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.490
or anybody can be smarter than that if they want to be so you can go as fast as

392
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:25.330
you want.
And here's how,
uh,
and so he sat me down at the piano.
He said,
okay,

393
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.240
what do you know about music theory?
I said,
well,
I don't know.
Let's find out.

394
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.330
And He,
you know,
he just asked me a few of these music questions like,
okay,
what,

395
00:23:31.331 --> 00:23:34.120
how does it make your skill boat to dot,
right?
Okay,
show me the try.

396
00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:35.850
Don't do you know what to try?
Tone is okay.
Planning.

397
00:23:35.851 --> 00:23:40.660
He tried tone in the c major scale.
I'm like,
AH,
okay.
Bnf he said,
okay,
now,
uh,

398
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.740
how can you take that and what other chord can you make from BNF?
He said,
okay,

399
00:23:44.741 --> 00:23:47.450
that's called the substitute court.
Now what does the resolution we were like,

400
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.700
and he would just like,
don't,
don't,
don't it,
this kind of plays.

401
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:51.380
He was doing all this music theory stuff with me.

402
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:54.620
It was so intense and I was like,
I had all this adrenaline,
like a video game.

403
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:58.070
I was like,
this is amazing.
Okay,
keep going.
Is it okay that yes it does.

404
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.840
And that was like a two hour lesson that went at that kind of pace.

405
00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:04.850
And then he'd dumped a bunch of homework on me.
He said,
okay,

406
00:24:04.851 --> 00:24:07.880
now go home tonight and take this big book of jazz standards.

407
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.930
Find me all the two five substitutions or a two five closures.

408
00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:15.320
Now substitute chords for that and then come back next Thursday and we'll do

409
00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:20.210
this again.
So we did that for like four Thursdays in a row.
And sure enough,

410
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:22.010
what he taught me in four,

411
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.760
two hour sessions was basically like two years of Berkeley College of music.

412
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:30.850
He compressed it into four lessons.
Wow.

413
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.980
So that when I showed up to my first day of Berkeley,

414
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.520
I tested out of the first few years

415
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.560
just thanks to him.
And then he even taught me his strategy.

416
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.500
It just offhand mentioned,
he said,
you know,

417
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.170
I think they might still have a rule in place where,
uh,

418
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.010
those other required courses,
you know,
that you have to take to graduate.
He said,

419
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.600
I think you could pretty much just buy the books for those and then contact the

420
00:24:56.601 --> 00:25:00.740
department head and just take the final exam to get credit.
So I did that too.

421
00:25:00.741 --> 00:25:04.160
So I,
uh,
when I got there,
all those required classes,
like,
you know,

422
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:08.330
a Bach counterpoint classes,
I wasn't so interested in it.

423
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.870
So I bought the book,
did all the homework approach to the department head,
said,

424
00:25:11.871 --> 00:25:15.050
can I take the final exam for this?
And he said,
looked at me weird and said,
okay,

425
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.470
took the final exam and got credit without ever having to attend the class.

426
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.980
And uh,
yeah,
that's how I graduated Berklee College of music in two years.

427
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.150
That's incredible.
What a gift.
I mean,
did he,
did he ever,

428
00:25:26.151 --> 00:25:30.860
aside from just showing up,
which is of course half the battle,

429
00:25:30.861 --> 00:25:32.270
if not more than half the battle,

430
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.620
did he ever explain to you why he adopted you in that way?

431
00:25:36.621 --> 00:25:39.590
Were you the first person for student he'd done that for or is this something

432
00:25:39.591 --> 00:25:42.980
he'd done before?
I think he,
yeah,

433
00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:47.150
he's definitely done it before and since.
So as far as I know,
last time we spoke,

434
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:52.280
spoke,
he's still teaching at Columbia College in downtown Chicago in the music

435
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.143
department.

436
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.960
So I think he's done this for many people since he's just an amazing guy that is

437
00:25:56.961 --> 00:25:58.850
just a great teacher,
a very strict teacher.

438
00:25:58.851 --> 00:26:03.530
He calls everybody to a really high standard,
you know,
that kind of,
that whole,

439
00:26:03.531 --> 00:26:05.750
like if he said show up at my studio at 9:00 AM,

440
00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:08.870
if I would have rang the doorbell at nine 10,
he would have said,
hmm,

441
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:11.780
guess you're not serious.
And he probably would have turned me away,
you know?
Uh,

442
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.470
so he,
he does that with his students and um,
yeah,

443
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.650
so he's done that for many people before and since I think.

444
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.680
What would he say to you if you recall when you did something incorrectly?

445
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.520
How did he provide feedback?

446
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.473
<v 0>Hm,</v>

447
00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.880
<v 3>well I think,
think for specific things.</v>

448
00:26:33.881 --> 00:26:37.840
He just Kinda give me that raised eyebrow look like,
Oh really?

449
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.470
You think that that is that I said,
but you know what,
here's,

450
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:47.360
it's kind of the,
to your question is he would question things.
Um,

451
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.230
kind of like you were talking about,
you know,

452
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.520
calling me when wondering if people are asking the right question.

453
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:57.450
So when I first Kahn,
that very first phone call,
right?
I said,

454
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.230
I'm going to go to Berklee College of Music in eight weeks.
And he said,
really?

455
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.280
Why do you want to go to Berkeley?
And I said,
well,
because I want to be famous,

456
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:09.810
successful singer,
songwriter,
performer.
He said,
hmm.
He said,

457
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:14.130
well,
four years and $100,000 in tuition.

458
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.370
It's a lot of money to learn to read or write a verse and a chorus

459
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:22.470
like that kind of thing.
Like,
Oh really?
Is that,

460
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.770
is that really the reason you're doing this?
Like just constantly questioning.

461
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:30.500
<v 2>That's,
that's so incredibly,
especially at that age.
I mean,</v>

462
00:27:30.501 --> 00:27:33.770
what an incredible molting that he provided.

463
00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.850
<v 3>And ever since then,
I mean,
you know,</v>

464
00:27:36.851 --> 00:27:39.040
you and I have often the same approach to life.

465
00:27:39.041 --> 00:27:42.670
Like looking for the looking for the shortcuts are just kind of more like

466
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.490
looking at the way that most people do things and saying like,
you know,
that's,

467
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.140
you don't have to do it that way.
That's very inefficient.
You could just do this.

468
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.980
So he just gave me that approach to life.
It's great.

469
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:57.230
<v 2>And unrelated note,
uh,
could you talk about,
and we've,</v>

470
00:27:57.231 --> 00:27:58.490
we've talked about this a bit,

471
00:27:58.491 --> 00:28:03.491
but I never tire of it relaxing for the same result because I think this is such

472
00:28:04.341 --> 00:28:06.740
a huge,
uh,

473
00:28:06.741 --> 00:28:10.020
observation that it's,

474
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.940
it's incredibly important for type a personalities are,
or at least for me,

475
00:28:13.941 --> 00:28:17.750
because I have a tendency to almost want to burn the candle at both ends to

476
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:22.160
prove to myself that I'm putting forth the maximum effort.
I'm not,

477
00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.540
I'm leaving as little as possible to chance with certain,

478
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.650
with certain things,
you know,
and uh,
but tell,

479
00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.000
tell everybody about the,
the bike about the bicycle experience.

480
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.570
<v 3>Yeah.
This was kind of profound.
Um,</v>

481
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.860
now granted I didn't learn this until later,
but yeah,
I had been very,
very,

482
00:28:41.861 --> 00:28:46.710
very type a my whole life even before I met Kimo Williams,

483
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.980
you know what I mean?
Age of 14.

484
00:28:47.981 --> 00:28:52.780
It's just my friends called me the robot because they would never see me sleep

485
00:28:52.781 --> 00:28:55.060
or eat or relax or hang out.

486
00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.720
I just was like so focused on being the best musician I could be that I would

487
00:28:58.721 --> 00:29:02.120
just practice every waking minute.
Um,

488
00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.030
if I'd be grudgingly go to a party,
you know,

489
00:29:04.031 --> 00:29:07.960
I bring my guitar with me and I'd be sitting in the corner practicing my scales

490
00:29:07.961 --> 00:29:11.980
and Arpeggios while everybody was hanging out,
getting high,
you know.
So,
um,

491
00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:13.361
so yeah,

492
00:29:13.361 --> 00:29:17.410
I've always been very type A and so a friend of mine got me into cycling when I

493
00:29:17.411 --> 00:29:21.220
was living in La and I lived right on the beach in Santa Monica where there's

494
00:29:21.221 --> 00:29:25.120
this great bike path in the sand that goes for,

495
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:30.100
I think it's 25 miles in the sand.
Uh,
25th,
no,

496
00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:32.650
hold on,
something like that.
The exact number doesn't matter.

497
00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:37.890
But what I would do is I would go on to the bike path and I would get like head

498
00:29:38.501 --> 00:29:40.330
down and push it as hard as I could.

499
00:29:40.331 --> 00:29:45.100
I would go all the way to one end of the bike path and back and then back home.

500
00:29:45.101 --> 00:29:48.610
And I'd set my little timer when doing this huffing and puffing red face,

501
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.960
red face huffing it.
But like,
just pushing it as hard as I can,
every single,

502
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:57.940
you know,
thrust of the leg.
And,
uh,
of course,
you know,

503
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:01.360
that may be quite fun if somebody was in my way on the bike path.

504
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:05.170
I'm sure you're like,
God,
that guy's got places to go.
So,

505
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.370
but I noticed it was always 43 minutes.
I mean,
you know,
if you know Santa Monica,

506
00:30:09.371 --> 00:30:13.870
California,
you know,
the weather is about exactly the same all year round.
So,
um,

507
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.640
unless it was a surprisingly windy day,

508
00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:20.641
it was always 43 minutes is what it took me to go as fast as I could for that on

509
00:30:21.461 --> 00:30:22.294
that bike path.

510
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.720
But I noticed that over time I was starting to feel less psyched about going out

511
00:30:30.401 --> 00:30:33.580
on the bike path because just mentally when I would think of it,

512
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:38.460
it would feel like pain and hard work.
It sounds like pain and hard work.

513
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.520
Yeah.
I mean it was,
but you know,
it,
I guess at first that was okay.

514
00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:45.490
And after a while it just felt like,
ah,
I don't know,
riding the bike.

515
00:30:45.491 --> 00:30:50.040
Why don't I just hang out?
Um,
so then I said,
you know,
that's no,

516
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.220
that's not cool for me to start to associate negative stuff with going on the

517
00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:56.300
bike ride.
Why don't I just chill for one,

518
00:30:56.301 --> 00:30:59.500
it's like I'm just going to go on the same bike ride but just,
you know,

519
00:30:59.501 --> 00:31:01.800
I'm not going to be a complete,
it was snail and,

520
00:31:01.801 --> 00:31:05.920
but I'll go with like half of my normal pace.
So yeah,

521
00:31:05.921 --> 00:31:09.430
I got on my bike and it was just pleasant.
I just went on the same bike ride,

522
00:31:09.431 --> 00:31:12.280
but I was more like a standing up and I just noticed that I was,

523
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.670
I was looking around more and,
and I looked out in the ocean.

524
00:31:15.671 --> 00:31:18.970
I noticed there that day there were these dolphins jumping in the ocean and,

525
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:24.400
and I went down to Marina del to my turnaround point and um,
oh no,

526
00:31:24.401 --> 00:31:29.170
actually it was when the,
the breakers at Marina del Rey,
there was a penguin

527
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.960
<v 2>flying above me.
I was like,
no way.
Looked up.
I was like,
Hey,
I'm paying.</v>

528
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.260
And he shit in my mouth.

529
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.140
Was it a penguin or a Pelican?
Oh,
sorry.
Pelican.

530
00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:46.930
We just penguin above my head.
I was like,

531
00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.580
what did you take before your ride?

532
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:52.880
So you see it a Pelican [inaudible] Pelican shit in your mouth.
What was it?

533
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.010
That's incredible accuracy.

534
00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:58.560
Was that from like how far away was it a you like 20 feet up?
Wow.

535
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.410
<v 3>I Dunno if he was accurate or I was,
you know.
Yeah</v>

536
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:04.660
<v 2>it is.</v>

537
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.340
<v 3>I had such a nice time.
It was just purely pleasant.
There was no red face,</v>

538
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:11.710
there was no huffing and puffing.
I was just cycling.

539
00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.360
It was nice and when I got back to my usual stopping place,

540
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:21.930
I looked at my watch and it said 45 minutes and I was like,

541
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:23.860
no way.

542
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:29.050
How the hell could that have been 45 minutes as compared to my usual 43 it's

543
00:32:29.051 --> 00:32:30.340
like there's no way.
But yeah,

544
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:35.370
it was right 45 minutes and that was like a profound lesson that I think changed

545
00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:43.081
the way I've approached my life ever since is because I realized that I guess

546
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:47.720
you know what percentage of that huffing and puffing then we could do the math

547
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:48.181
and whatever.

548
00:32:48.181 --> 00:32:52.430
I would a 93 point something present of my huffing and puffing and all that red

549
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:57.020
face and all that stress was only for an extra two minutes.

550
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.820
It was basically for nothing.
I mean,
you know,

551
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.580
of course we're not talking about me competing in something where the huffing

552
00:33:01.581 --> 00:33:04.430
and puffing might've been worth it.
But for life,

553
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:09.790
I think of all of this optimization and getting the maximum dollar out of

554
00:33:09.981 --> 00:33:13.010
everything in the maximum amount of every second to the maximum amount of every

555
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:16.660
minute.
And I think I just take this approach now of going like,
oh,

556
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.620
or you could just take the lesson,

557
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:22.250
take most of that lesson and apply it and be effective and be happy,

558
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.440
but you don't need to stress about any of this stuff.

559
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.640
And so honestly that's been my approach ever since I do things,

560
00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:30.860
but I stopped it before anything gets stressful.

561
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:36.070
<v 2>Is there any particular way that you remind yourself of that given a lifetime of</v>

562
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:41.720
hard charging a fee I would fund.

563
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:46.820
I do find that I sometimes lose track of that type of truth,

564
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:51.821
which I think is a truth in almost every aspect of the endeavors that I partake

565
00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:53.534
in,
at least.

566
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.990
Are there any particular ways that you remind yourself of that or keep it

567
00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.010
present for you?

568
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:01.390
<v 3>I think it's just noticing the pain.</v>

569
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:06.550
I luckily I live in a world where there's more psychic pain than physical pain.

570
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:11.170
Right?
So you have to notice the psychic pain that you're feeling,

571
00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:12.183
um,

572
00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:16.480
of whether it's doing things you don't want to be doing and feeling the pain and

573
00:34:16.481 --> 00:34:19.840
regret of that or the frustration.
Just when you notice this internal,

574
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.170
that always,
that's my cue that I treat that like physical pain of like,

575
00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:30.280
what am I doing,
what I need to stop doing that thing that hurts.
What is that?

576
00:34:30.281 --> 00:34:35.281
And it usually means that I'm just pushing too hard or doing things that I don't

577
00:34:36.161 --> 00:34:40.110
really want to be doing because I was asking the wrong questions and uh,

578
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.600
following the wrong.
Yeah.
Following the wrong path,
the wrong outcome.

579
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.800
<v 2>No.
Rewinding the clock a little bit.
Uh,</v>

580
00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.760
1998.
How did CD baby come to be?

581
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.910
<v 3>Yeah.
Um,
it was,</v>

582
00:34:56.570 --> 00:35:01.160
I was really just selling my own CD on my band's website.

583
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:01.701
I was just,

584
00:35:01.701 --> 00:35:06.701
I had a band called hit me and I had this CD that was being played on radio

585
00:35:08.691 --> 00:35:09.920
stations across the country.

586
00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:13.400
I think I was on 350 college radio stations across America,

587
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.880
but the only way to buy it was to mail a check or money order to my address.

588
00:35:20.391 --> 00:35:20.601
You know,

589
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:25.601
this is before the average person could get any ecommerce online because there

590
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:29.600
was no paypal.
I guess I could have put it up on Ebay or something.
Right,

591
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:33.770
but that was like the only way you could sell your CD online as an independent

592
00:35:33.771 --> 00:35:36.560
musician.
There was just nobody anywhere that would sell it for you.

593
00:35:36.561 --> 00:35:38.760
There were a big online record stores at the time.

594
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:42.570
There was a music boulevard.com and CD now.com.

595
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:44.280
I think Amazon bought them both,

596
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:49.850
but the only way to get into their system was to go through the major labels,

597
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:53.940
basically to get a major label record deal and then be in the major label

598
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:55.260
distribution system.

599
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:59.760
And then you would appear on CD now.com right.

600
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.300
So I thought,
okay,
this is,

601
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.730
this is just a horrible convoluted thing.

602
00:36:05.731 --> 00:36:08.520
Like it should be dead simple to just put your stuff online,

603
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.310
have a buy now button and ship it to the person that buys it.

604
00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.170
It shouldn't need to be that complicated.

605
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:17.040
So I did the research and I did the work and I went and got myself a credit card

606
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:19.770
merchant account,
which is like $1,000 in setup fees.

607
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.800
They actually had to send an inspector out to my location to make sure I was a

608
00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:26.010
valid business.
I think I even had to incorporate to make them happy.

609
00:36:26.011 --> 00:36:30.930
I set up a separate bank account,
uh,
did all of this red tape,
a lot of paperwork,

610
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.120
thousand dollars instead of fees.
Uh,

611
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.200
but after three months I had a credit card merchant account and then I had to

612
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:40.860
figure out how to make a buy now button on my website.
And that was also hard,

613
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:41.341
you know,
it was,

614
00:36:41.341 --> 00:36:46.341
I had to buy a book on Cgi bin Perl Scripts and copy the example from the book

615
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.610
on how to make a buy now button.
And,
but after three months of hard work,

616
00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:55.320
I did it like my band's website had a buy now button that was like,

617
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.120
wow,
look at that.

618
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.340
And so my friends in the New York City music scene,

619
00:37:02.341 --> 00:37:06.320
like my fellow musicians,
uh,
said,
whoa dude.
Like,

620
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.650
do you think you could sell my CD through that thing?
I said,

621
00:37:10.651 --> 00:37:14.520
you mean on my band's website?
They said,
yeah,
if you don't mind.
I said,
yeah,
sure,

622
00:37:14.521 --> 00:37:18.110
why not?
So it was like a favor to my friend Marco.
Um,

623
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.520
actually here's a little tidbit of information.
Marco,

624
00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:23.490
who I just knew as a musician,
Marco [inaudible].

625
00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.800
I knew him as a cool musician in New York City.

626
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:28.740
He was technically the guy that gave me the idea for CD baby.

627
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.930
Later I found out that he's the son of the prime minister of Finland.
Uh,

628
00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.660
and it was like all in the news and I had no idea,
but Marco,
thank you.

629
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:41.940
He's the one that asked me if I could sell his CD,
uh,
through my band's website.

630
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.360
And so I did.
And then,
you know,
I started getting calls like,
hey man,

631
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:48.930
my friend Marco said,
or you could sell my CD through your website.
Said,
yeah,

632
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:52.230
no problem.
Friend of Marco's as a friend of mine and it just,

633
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:57.150
it grew by request and yeah,

634
00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:00.900
which is,
which kind of led me to the belief that,
you know,

635
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.860
when people ask me how to,
how do I grow my business,
I've got this business idea.

636
00:38:04.861 --> 00:38:06.990
Basically I'm trying to push it onto the world.

637
00:38:06.991 --> 00:38:10.350
How do I push my idea into the world?
I have no idea.

638
00:38:10.351 --> 00:38:15.351
I have no advice for those people because I've only ever worked on like the pull

639
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:20.220
method where people ask me to do things for them.
And I say yes.

640
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:25.250
So CD baby just happened because all of my musician friends or asking me to sell

641
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:31.731
their CD on my band's website and then I just eventually there were so many that

642
00:38:31.921 --> 00:38:34.590
I just took them off of my band's site and put them onto their own site.

643
00:38:34.591 --> 00:38:35.680
And that was CD baby.com.

644
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.060
<v 2>Of your projects that have done well,</v>

645
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:45.370
what percentage have come from scratching your own itch?
Allah CD baby,

646
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:46.573
uh,
have,

647
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:51.520
are any of the projects that have gained traction projects that you've thought

648
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.900
of sending to a market that didn't include you?

649
00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.290
<v 3>Actually,
after that first one,
I mean,
yes,</v>

650
00:39:01.291 --> 00:39:04.590
I built a thing to sell my own CD,
but um,

651
00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:07.560
actually all of them were scratching other people's itches.

652
00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:14.400
I don't want to get to a,
I don't want to picture that.
Um,
so,
uh,

653
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.220
like for example,
um,
shortly after that,
um,

654
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:23.290
I already had a UPC barcode thing.
The way it used to work with that.
Um,

655
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.650
to get a barcode on your album,
you had to pay like,
I don't know,

656
00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:31.740
$400 to the Universal Code Council in order to get a six digit prefix,

657
00:39:31.741 --> 00:39:34.980
which then let you assign the next five digits,

658
00:39:34.981 --> 00:39:39.330
which meant 100,000 products underneath your barcode.
Um,

659
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:40.920
product id or something like that.

660
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:45.210
So a lot of musicians in the independent music world wanted to have a UPC

661
00:39:45.211 --> 00:39:49.050
barcode for their album that would let them sell it in physical retail stores.

662
00:39:49.051 --> 00:39:51.840
And a lot of physical retail stores wouldn't let you sell something unless it

663
00:39:51.841 --> 00:39:52.830
had a UPC barcode.

664
00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:57.690
But they didn't want to all have to pay the $400 to get a company account.

665
00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:02.730
But I already had a company account and so I just let a lot of musicians know,

666
00:40:02.731 --> 00:40:05.880
like,
if you ever need a barcode,
let me know.
I can get one for you.

667
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.950
So enough people started taking me up on this that I decided to charge 20 bucks

668
00:40:10.951 --> 00:40:14.730
for it because it would take me some time to assign them an id and then generate

669
00:40:14.731 --> 00:40:18.510
the eps or tiff graphic file to be included in their album artwork.

670
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:21.780
And eventually I automated it.
Point is um,

671
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:27.030
100,000 barcodes were assigned at $20 each.

672
00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.380
That's what I charged for the service.

673
00:40:28.381 --> 00:40:33.120
It was like $2 million I made for this $400 set up fee for getting a universal

674
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:37.410
code council account.
So you could say that I was scratching my itch,

675
00:40:37.411 --> 00:40:41.570
but really that it was more,
I think of it as the co op business model,

676
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.550
<v 2>let's freeze.
It was responding to demand instead of trying to create demand.</v>

677
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.640
Is that yes.

678
00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.060
<v 3>I've never tried to create demand.
I've never done that.
I don't know how.</v>

679
00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:54.260
I've only basic Li answered the calls for help.
Right.

680
00:40:54.261 --> 00:40:57.830
And it's usually using this,
what I call the Co op business model,

681
00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:02.240
which is I've already got something other people could use it.

682
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.530
I'm happy to share it.

683
00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:08.090
I'll just charge a little something to help pay for my time and resources so

684
00:41:08.091 --> 00:41:10.490
that we can all share this resource that I've already got.

685
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:13.460
<v 2>So I love,
this is a,</v>

686
00:41:13.461 --> 00:41:17.860
I think a great example of spotting something small,

687
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.830
perhaps looking at a situation that many,

688
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:25.480
many other people had been presented with and spotting something interesting in

689
00:41:25.481 --> 00:41:26.980
this case,
an opportunity.

690
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.880
And I want to highlight one other example,

691
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:35.090
which is an email that you wrote and I'm going to,

692
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:39.890
I'm going to just read a little bit here.
So this is,
uh,

693
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.560
this is from some of your writing.
When you make a business,

694
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.510
you're making a little world where you control the laws.

695
00:41:44.511 --> 00:41:47.510
It doesn't matter how things are done everywhere else and your little world,

696
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.950
you can make it like it should be.

697
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.960
And I know you're better at reading this stuff,

698
00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:53.610
but I'm just going to just because I have it right in front of me.
Uh,

699
00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.040
when I first built CD baby,

700
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:58.370
every order had an automated email that let the customer know when the CD was

701
00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:01.130
actually shipped.
And of course,
this is Tim speaking.
Now.
Uh,

702
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.520
everyone's seen these.
They tend to be very plain Jane,
very generic,
very boring.

703
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:06.020
At first it was just the normal.

704
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:08.090
This is back to your writing your orders ship today.

705
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:10.190
Please let us know if it doesn't arrive.
Thank you for your business.

706
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.390
A few months later,

707
00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:15.200
I felt it was very incongruent with my mission to help people smile.

708
00:42:15.201 --> 00:42:18.290
I knew I could do better,
so I took 20 minutes and wrote this goofy little thing.

709
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.360
This is the email that would go out to folks.

710
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.250
Your CD has been gently taken from our CD baby shelves with sterilized

711
00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:28.190
contamination,
free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.

712
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:32.270
A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure it was the

713
00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:34.190
best possible condition.
Before mailing.

714
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:38.120
Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as

715
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:41.210
he put your CD into the finest gold line box that money can buy.

716
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:45.140
We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole Party marched down

717
00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:48.890
the street to the post office where the entire town of Portland waved bon voyage

718
00:42:48.891 --> 00:42:53.090
to your package on its way.
To you in our private CD baby jet on this day,
Friday,

719
00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:57.290
June 6th.
I hope that you had a wonderful time shopping at CD baby.
We sure did.

720
00:42:57.291 --> 00:43:00.500
Your pictures on our wall as customer of the year,
we're all exhausted,

721
00:43:00.501 --> 00:43:03.950
but can't wait for you to come back to CD baby dot cop two exclamation points.

722
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.370
Uh,
so

723
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:12.480
<v 3>that 20 minutes,
what happened after you put that together?
Okay,</v>

724
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:18.350
well people would get it and reply back like who ever replies back to an

725
00:43:20.671 --> 00:43:23.050
automated shipping email,
right?
Um,

726
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:27.270
whoever replies back to Amazon saying,
wow guys,
thank you so much.

727
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.800
But the fact that this little quirky email had so much personality for one,

728
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:34.350
it let them know like there's real people here.

729
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:39.240
And so customers will often reply back saying,
you guys are hilarious.

730
00:43:39.241 --> 00:43:42.390
That was the weirdest thing ever.
That's awesome.
But more importantly,

731
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.200
people started sharing it.
They would forward it to,
to all of their friends.

732
00:43:46.201 --> 00:43:47.670
Like you guys have to see this.

733
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:52.020
And people who had blogs would post it on their blogs,
even just their lean,

734
00:43:52.021 --> 00:43:55.540
a little blog spot or wordpress or whatever blog.
Um,

735
00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:59.310
so now if you take any of those sentences from that email and you put it into

736
00:43:59.311 --> 00:44:02.040
quotation marks and a search for it on Google,

737
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:06.240
you'll find literally thousands of blogs have pasted my,

738
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:08.520
a confirmation email onto their blogs.

739
00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:14.210
And I think about this when a young entrepreneurs ask me like,

740
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.760
how can I get traction from it?
My idea,
how can I get,

741
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.980
how can I get word of mouth and buzz happening?

742
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:24.370
I think you can read business books and,
and,
um,

743
00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:26.310
try to do these very serious,
you know,

744
00:44:26.311 --> 00:44:28.620
furrowed brow analytical approaches to this.

745
00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:33.360
Or sometimes it's just these cute little colorful things that you do that set

746
00:44:33.361 --> 00:44:36.420
you apart from the rest that make you remarkable.

747
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.920
Make people remark on you about you.
So yeah,

748
00:44:40.921 --> 00:44:45.060
I think thousands of people heard about CD baby because of that one little silly

749
00:44:45.061 --> 00:44:45.894
email.

750
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:50.730
<v 2>And I think it a comparable might be Zappos for instance,</v>

751
00:44:50.731 --> 00:44:54.300
and their customer service.
And what was the anecdote that got spread around?

752
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:57.360
The anecdote was you could call up Zappos for anything,

753
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:00.600
even if it was unrelated to the product,
you could call them up and say,
yes,

754
00:45:00.601 --> 00:45:01.440
I'm looking at the website,

755
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:04.650
but I'd actually really like a pizza delivered to my house and they would figure

756
00:45:04.651 --> 00:45:08.820
out how to do it.
And on the serious analytical side,
you say,
oh my God,

757
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:12.450
that's such a waste of human and capital resources.

758
00:45:12.451 --> 00:45:14.820
And can you imagine if everybody called to order pizza,

759
00:45:14.821 --> 00:45:18.060
which of course the scale is never going to happen ever.

760
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:22.260
And uh,
they got,
so,
I mean,

761
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:27.030
probably millions of dollars of free publicity just by making that.

762
00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:31.470
Okay.
And like how long did that take?
Not long at all.

763
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:32.583
Uh,

764
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:33.900
<v 3>plus you know what,
man,
it's,
it's,</v>

765
00:45:33.901 --> 00:45:35.430
I don't mean to sound like new agey or whatever,

766
00:45:35.431 --> 00:45:38.790
but it's the right thing to do for the world.
Right?
It's like,

767
00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.780
just put aside the numbers for a bit.
It's the right thing to do.
It's cool.

768
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:46.380
It makes people happier.
It makes the people working.
They're happier,

769
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.230
which makes them more into the whole feeling of what they're doing.

770
00:45:49.231 --> 00:45:53.580
There's so much more to a business than just the money.
Yeah.

771
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:57.450
<v 2>So,
so tell me about,
I remember reading about this,</v>

772
00:45:57.451 --> 00:45:59.820
but I think we might've talked about it at one point,

773
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:04.680
which was when people would call CD baby trying to offer you financing.

774
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.570
How did those go?

775
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.370
<v 3>Well,
you remember I started CD baby like the end of [inaudible] 97 beginning of</v>

776
00:46:13.371 --> 00:46:16.400
[inaudible] 98 so it was the first.com boom.

777
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:20.540
And so much money was flying around and everybody was trying to push

778
00:46:20.541 --> 00:46:24.920
money@everyonewhohada.com on their domain name or had anything going on.

779
00:46:24.921 --> 00:46:28.550
So of course me with an actual like profitable running business,

780
00:46:28.551 --> 00:46:32.720
that was really the only game in town by the way.
Like back when I started it,

781
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:36.290
if you were a musician that wanted to sell your music online,

782
00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.020
there was a guy named Derek in New York that could do it for you.

783
00:46:39.021 --> 00:46:42.720
And that was it.
There were no other businesses that will do it.
They,

784
00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.720
some showed up like a year or two later.

785
00:46:44.721 --> 00:46:49.010
But at first I had no competition at all.
I was it.
So yeah,

786
00:46:49.011 --> 00:46:54.011
it's tons of money was a shoved my direction and I entertained the first few

787
00:46:55.491 --> 00:46:59.600
calls and they said,
you know,
we want to invest in your company so well,

788
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.780
why?
They said so you can grow it faster.
I said,

789
00:47:02.781 --> 00:47:05.810
but I don't want to grow it faster.
I said,
well,
you know,

790
00:47:05.811 --> 00:47:09.840
don't you want to scale or get your get more resources?
I said,
no,
I,

791
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:13.910
I have all the resources I need.
Like I'm good.
Like I was profitable,
you know,

792
00:47:13.911 --> 00:47:18.911
since the first month in business because my startup costs were a $495 is what

793
00:47:19.491 --> 00:47:22.340
it costs me to start the business and get it running.

794
00:47:22.341 --> 00:47:25.130
It took me six days to build the site and get it up and running.

795
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:29.500
And it was profitable in the second month of business when I sold over a $4 of

796
00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:33.970
cds that second month in business that was profitable ever since.
And uh,

797
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.550
I just didn't need the money.
And so yeah,

798
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:41.580
people kept offering and they would waive these big dreams in my face thinking

799
00:47:42.671 --> 00:47:45.940
it was going to distract them or entice me.
But it just didn't,
and I remember,

800
00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:50.960
Oh I doubt you remember mp3.com was a big deal in like 1999 through 2002 or so.

801
00:47:54.011 --> 00:47:58.180
They were like the big daddy of independent streaming music online and
downloads.

802
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.320
And so they had all,
I think,
yeah,
they had an IPO,

803
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:06.820
they were public and mp3.com was interested in buying CD baby.

804
00:48:06.821 --> 00:48:10.480
And they asked what my price would be and I said,
just not interested in selling.

805
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.920
And they said,
come on,
everybody's got their price.
I said,
no,

806
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:19.030
I'm not interested.
I'm having fun.
They said,
come on,
even billions of dollars.

807
00:48:19.031 --> 00:48:23.130
And I said,
what are you Carl Sagan?
No,
I don't want to sell.
Um,

808
00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:26.260
there's just nothing in it for me.
I'm enjoying what I'm doing.

809
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:29.110
I don't need the money.
So after that point,
like after the first year or two,

810
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.540
I just taught my customer service people.

811
00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:36.160
Like if you get any calls from investors or I,
um,

812
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.740
whatever VC firms or any of that,
please just tell them no.
Like,

813
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:40.960
don't even send them my way.
I'm just,
we're just not interested.

814
00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:45.990
<v 2>So,
yeah,
that lasted for 10 years.
And how did you,
uh,</v>

815
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.520
how did you develop that relationship with money?

816
00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.640
Is that something from your parents?
Is that,

817
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:55.530
and I'm going to ask a very personal question.

818
00:48:55.531 --> 00:48:59.520
I'll send sudden you can feel free to not answer it,
but why did your family,

819
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:04.050
why did,
why were none of your family members at your wedding?
Oh,
sorry.

820
00:49:04.051 --> 00:49:08.950
They were too,
oh,
sorry.
When I say Nice to free guess I meant,
yeah.
Okay.

821
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:12.120
All right.
All right.
No,
no,
no.
Now that I've checked that,
okay,

822
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:15.000
this is what was in the back of my mind.

823
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:21.790
How did you develop this relationship with money where you would say no like

824
00:49:22.561 --> 00:49:25.050
that for 10 years?
Because that's not what most people would do

825
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:31.240
<v 3>because I had enough at,
because I absolutely,
you know what,
it's,</v>

826
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:36.270
it's a bit of a trick reason because in the early days I still considered CD

827
00:49:37.221 --> 00:49:42.221
baby to be a bit of a distraction because you remember I was making my living as

828
00:49:42.471 --> 00:49:46.040
a professional musician,
which was my original goal and dream.

829
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:50.570
So I was living my dream like I was,
I was touring,

830
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.920
playing on people's records,
producing people's records.
Um,

831
00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:58.070
I played about 500 colleges in the northeast.

832
00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.190
I was making good money as a professional musician.

833
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.380
Like that's what I really wanted to do.

834
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:07.790
And this little CD baby thing was just like a favor I was doing to my,

835
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:12.440
for my friends to kind of give back to the community.
Right?
So as it grew,

836
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:17.060
well I didn't want it to,
to grow,
um,
because yeah,

837
00:50:17.061 --> 00:50:21.500
it was taking me away from my music,
which is my real love.
It's making the music,

838
00:50:21.501 --> 00:50:23.420
not selling other people's music.

839
00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:28.720
So there was this moment when I kind of realized I think I've created a

840
00:50:29.361 --> 00:50:30.194
business.

841
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:34.640
Oh well I might as well make it something awesome.

842
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:36.070
Meaning,
um,

843
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:41.150
I want to make it like a utopian dream come true from a musician's point of
view.

844
00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:42.920
And I spent a night brainstorming,

845
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:47.780
like what would a real like dream come true from a physician's point of view

846
00:50:47.781 --> 00:50:51.740
look like?
And I don't know if this will make sense to your listeners,

847
00:50:51.741 --> 00:50:55.550
but let's just find out is did that it was going against everything.

848
00:50:55.910 --> 00:51:00.140
That was the unfortunate way that the music distribution world worked at the

849
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:04.370
time.
So it's like number one,
I want to be paid every week.
Number two,

850
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:08.180
I want to know the full name and address of everybody that buys my music.
Um,

851
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:09.590
number three,

852
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:13.460
you'll never kick me out for not selling enough because that was a big problem

853
00:51:13.461 --> 00:51:16.610
in the traditional music distribution world as you were given a window of time.

854
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:18.630
Kind of like,
like physical books are still are,

855
00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.330
you have to prove yourself in a window of time.

856
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.240
They'll put you into the bookstore.
If it doesn't sell well,
you're,

857
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:25.700
you're yanked out to make room on the shelf for other stuff.

858
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.110
And then number four,

859
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:32.080
no paid placement because it never felt fair that,
uh,

860
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:36.280
people could come in and buy up the front page to get a unequal footing.
Right?

861
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:40.520
So that was like my utopian ideal for how this would work.

862
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:44.630
The reason I'm telling you this is that to set the tone that like I wasn't

863
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:49.460
trying to make money,
I already had enough money that I had made,

864
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:53.360
you know,
gigging and touring and all that stuff.
I already had money.

865
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:57.080
So this was a thing I was doing to give back to the community to create

866
00:51:57.081 --> 00:52:00.950
something that needed to exist kind of artistically,

867
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.340
or just almost like a community service kind of thing.
So,

868
00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:08.360
so that was the original DNA of this thing.
And you know,

869
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.680
from what we know about DNA,
it helps decide how,
what things grow into.
Right?

870
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:13.910
So this was the DNA.

871
00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:18.650
So then as it grew and then it became really profitable and I was making,

872
00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:23.510
I don't know,
$100,000 a month doing this thing,
and I had all my bills paid off.

873
00:52:23.511 --> 00:52:25.670
There was nothing I wanted to buy.

874
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:30.910
So if somebody from California contacted me saying they wanted to give me lots

875
00:52:31.071 --> 00:52:34.370
of money to take a big chunk of my business and help turn it,
you know,
big,
big,

876
00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:37.610
big,
we think you could do an IPO.
Uh,

877
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:42.230
I would just sneer like,
uh,
no,
that sounds awful.

878
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:44.240
I don't want that life.
I'm,

879
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.440
I'm enjoying being fully in control here and doing things for the right reasons.

880
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:51.350
Doing things for my musician friends to make them happy,

881
00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:55.970
make the customers happy,
make the musicians happy,
like all good.
Um,

882
00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:00.020
what was the business model in the very beginning?
Um,

883
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:04.400
it was only two numbers actually.
There's,
there's a cute story.
Most of us,

884
00:53:04.401 --> 00:53:04.581
you know,

885
00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:09.581
when we start charging money for the first time for our services or our goods,

886
00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.670
we don't know what to charge.
Right?
So for Marco,

887
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.710
my first friend that asked me to do this,

888
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.910
and maybe the next 10 or 15 friends that came after I was charging nothing,

889
00:53:19.911 --> 00:53:23.720
I was just doing this as a free favor.
This was my community service.

890
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.470
And I,
once I realized like total strangers who were sending me their music,

891
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.590
that's not all right.
I bet her charge something,
but I don't know what to charge.

892
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:35.220
So I was living in Woodstock,
New York at the time and there was a cute,

893
00:53:35.221 --> 00:53:39.390
tiny little record store in town that sold consignment cds.

894
00:53:39.391 --> 00:53:41.310
On the counter of local musicians.

895
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:45.380
So I walked in there one day and I said,
hey,
um,

896
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:49.470
how does it work if I want to sell my CD here?
And she said,
well,

897
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.600
you set the selling price,
whatever you want,

898
00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:56.310
we just keep a flat $4 per CD sold and then just come by every week and we'll

899
00:53:56.311 --> 00:54:00.090
pay you.
So I went home to my new website that night and I wrote,

900
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.280
you set your selling price it whatever you want.

901
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:05.820
We just keep a flat $4 per CD sold and we'll pay you every week.

902
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:11.390
And then I realized that it took about 45 minutes of time for me to set up a new

903
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:16.080
album into the system because I had to lay the album art on the scanner and

904
00:54:16.081 --> 00:54:18.850
Photoshop it and crop it and then fix the musicians,

905
00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:22.320
have spelling mistakes in their own bio and all that kind of stuff.
Uh,

906
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:25.050
that took about 45 minutes of work per album.

907
00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:29.430
So it shows you what I was valuing my time at those days that I thought 45

908
00:54:29.431 --> 00:54:31.500
minutes of my time,
that's worth about 25 bucks.

909
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:36.930
So I'll charge a $25 set up fee to sign up for this thing.

910
00:54:36.931 --> 00:54:40.800
And then at the last minute I thought,
wait a second.
In my mind,

911
00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:46.070
25 and 35 they hold that they're in the same like brain cell in my head,

912
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:49.650
25 and 35 those numbers don't feel very different when it comes to cost.

913
00:54:49.651 --> 00:54:52.470
You know like $10 is different and $50 is different,

914
00:54:52.471 --> 00:54:56.430
but 25 35 that occupies the same space in the mind.
So you know what?

915
00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:01.620
I'm going to make it 35 that will let me give anyone a discount anytime they
ask.

916
00:55:01.621 --> 00:55:04.800
You know,
even if somebody's on the phone and upset,
I'll say,
you know what,

917
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:06.000
let me give you a discount.

918
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:10.200
So I added in that little buffer so I could give people a discount,

919
00:55:10.201 --> 00:55:14.340
which they love.
So yeah,
$35 set up fee,
$4 per CD sold,

920
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:19.410
and the Tim for the next 10 years,
that was it.
That was my entire business model,

921
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:23.610
which was generated in five minutes by walking down to the local record store

922
00:55:23.611 --> 00:55:24.444
and asking what they do.

923
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:30.110
I love that story and simplicity because I think there is an infatuation of

924
00:55:30.601 --> 00:55:31.560
fetishizing,

925
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:36.590
of pivoting in the tech startup world that has infected many other types of

926
00:55:39.121 --> 00:55:41.640
entrepreneurship where people think like,
Oh,
if we're not pivoting,

927
00:55:41.641 --> 00:55:42.720
I'm not doing something correctly.

928
00:55:42.721 --> 00:55:46.140
I should change my business model in my entire customer base every two months

929
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:50.280
and I don't view that as a virtue.
Yes,

930
00:55:50.281 --> 00:55:52.500
there are times to change if something isn't working,

931
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:57.950
but if you don't take the time upfront to think about that and then you're

932
00:55:58.231 --> 00:56:03.231
constantly chasing the latest sort of fad or whatever appears on the cover of a

933
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:07.920
tech crunch or ink magazine or something like that.
It's a,

934
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:10.540
it's a recipe for failure for most people.

935
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.560
I mean there's a huge survivorship bias.
I'm just going to rant for a second.

936
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:17.340
There's a huge survivorship bias that I think is important to realize if you're

937
00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:20.190
hoping to become an entrepreneur or are an entrepreneur.

938
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:23.980
If you're only reading the cover stories,
you're only getting

939
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:29.080
<v 2>the happy success stories.
And you know,
for that reason also I think it's,</v>

940
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:34.100
it's dangerous to idolize people who bet the farm and just happened to pull it

941
00:56:34.121 --> 00:56:37.420
off because those are the people who are going to be written about much like if

942
00:56:37.421 --> 00:56:40.180
you open a Barron's and you look at all of these mutual funds with these

943
00:56:40.181 --> 00:56:41.260
spectacular records,

944
00:56:41.261 --> 00:56:45.400
well maybe they just got lucky and all the other ones can't afford to buy ads

945
00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:48.730
because they're no longer in existence.
And um,
so I think it's,

946
00:56:48.731 --> 00:56:52.570
it's very similar that the,
uh,
the,

947
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:57.630
the one of the essays that you're best known for is a hell yeah or no.

948
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:03.600
And this has been extremely important for me to consistently reread a or

949
00:57:06.521 --> 00:57:10.510
listened to.
How did it come about?
And then what is the,

950
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:12.010
what is the gist of that?

951
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:19.380
<v 3>There was a music conference in Australia that I had told my friend I would go</v>

952
00:57:23.411 --> 00:57:24.610
with her to.

953
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.820
It wasn't even like the conference themselves were really expecting me.

954
00:57:27.821 --> 00:57:32.110
It was my,
my friend Arielle Hyatt is one of the best publicist I know.

955
00:57:32.111 --> 00:57:36.550
And She was speaking at that conference and asked if I would come with her as

956
00:57:36.551 --> 00:57:41.080
like a Co presenter in her mentor session or something.

957
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:45.390
So I had said yes like six months before.
Yeah,
sure.

958
00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:49.210
Australia living in New York City and like,
yeah,
sure.
Um,

959
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.600
and then once it came close and it was like time to book the ticket,
I was like,

960
00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:57.790
Eh,
I don't really want to go to Australia right now.

961
00:57:57.791 --> 00:58:02.680
I'm busy with other stuff.
And it was actually my friend amber,

962
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:05.260
Rue Barth,
who's a brilliant musician.

963
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:10.440
I was on the phone with her and kind of lamenting about this and she's the one

964
00:58:10.751 --> 00:58:14.950
that pointed out,
she said,
it sounds like you know from where you're at,

965
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.290
you're decision is not between yes and no.

966
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:21.640
You need to figure out whether you're feeling like,
fuck yeah or no.

967
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.820
And I said,
yeah,
that's,
that's really what it comes down to,
right?

968
00:58:24.821 --> 00:58:29.821
Because the idea is if you're feeling anything less than like,

969
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:35.740
Oh hell yeah,
I would love to do that.
Oh my God,
that would be amazing.

970
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:41.190
If you're feeling anything less than that than just say no because most of us

971
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:47.250
say yes to too much stuff and then we let these little mediocre things fill our

972
00:58:47.861 --> 00:58:48.694
lives.

973
00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:53.380
And so the problem is when that occasional big,

974
00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:56.050
oh my God,
hell yeah,
thing comes along.

975
00:58:56.051 --> 00:59:00.190
You don't have enough time to to give it the attention that you should because

976
00:59:00.191 --> 00:59:03.580
you've said yes to too much other little halfass kind of stuff.
Right.

977
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.540
So once I started applying this,
uh,

978
00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:11.710
my life just opened up because it just meant I just said no,
no,
no,
no,

979
00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.740
no to almost everything.

980
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:19.080
But then when the occasional thing came up that I was really lucky,

981
00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:20.650
know what that would be awesome.

982
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:25.880
Then suddenly I had all the time in the world and you know,
people say this,

983
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.520
I'm sure you know,
every time people contact you,

984
00:59:28.521 --> 00:59:31.460
every time people come tacked me,
they say,
you know,
look,

985
00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:35.240
I know you must be incredibly busy.
And I always think like,
no,

986
00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:39.770
I'm not because because I'm in control of my time,
I'm on top of it.

987
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:44.420
Busy to me seems to imply like out of control,

988
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:48.080
you know like,
Oh my God,
I'm so busy,
I don't have any time for this shit.

989
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:52.380
To me that sounds like a person who's got no control of their life.
Yeah,
no,

990
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:56.360
no control and unclear priorities.
Yes.

991
00:59:57.430 --> 01:00:02.430
So you asked how it's applying in my life that still just on the little tiny day

992
01:00:02.481 --> 01:00:07.070
to day level,
even personal things,
God,
even even people you need to even,

993
01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:09.380
you know,
I'm a,
as I'm dating,

994
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:15.100
you have to do the hell yeah or no approach or people ask you to go to events or

995
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:20.090
caught even,
you know,
even people asking to do a phone call or anything.
I think,

996
01:00:20.091 --> 01:00:23.510
you know,
am I really excited about that?
And you know,

997
01:00:23.511 --> 01:00:24.800
almost every time the answer is no.

998
01:00:24.801 --> 01:00:29.120
So I say no to almost everything and then occasionally something will come up.

999
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:32.090
Even a little surprise will be dropped in my lap.

1000
01:00:32.091 --> 01:00:35.900
Like this thing that happened just a two months ago called the the now,
now,

1001
01:00:35.901 --> 01:00:38.420
now project,
which we don't even really need to talk about.

1002
01:00:38.421 --> 01:00:40.010
The details don't matter so much,

1003
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:44.240
but it was just something that popped up that seemed really interesting and

1004
01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:48.260
people really wanted.
And luckily because I say no to almost everything,

1005
01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.910
I had the time in my life to make it flourish.
So for the last like six weeks,

1006
01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.140
all I did full time,

1007
01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:57.230
like 12 hours a day with suddenly work on this brand new thing that showed up

1008
01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:59.650
because I could,
you know,
so that's to me the,

1009
01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:04.700
the lovely a result of taking the hell yeah or no approach to life.

1010
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:09.290
Where can people learn more and check out the no,
no,
no project.

1011
01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:12.840
And also I should note in advance that for,
for folks listening,
um,

1012
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:17.900
we will also include links to anything we've mentioned in the show notes,

1013
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:22.010
which will be@fourhourworkweek.com forward slash Derek all spelled out.

1014
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.990
Uh,
but where can people find more about no,
no,
no,

1015
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:32.420
it's um,
if you go to now,
now,
now.com,
you'll find more about that.

1016
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:36.740
It was just in short,
I noticed that everybody has,
uh,

1017
01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:41.390
an about page on their site and people have a contact page on their site.

1018
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:44.930
But usually whenever I'm looking at somebody's personal site,
even yours,

1019
01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:48.980
w a big thing I often wonder is like,
I wonder what he's up to right now.

1020
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:53.750
Like working on kind of stuff and Twitter and Facebook don't answer that.

1021
01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:58.400
You know,
you can see somebody's stream of stuff,
but it just kind of says like,

1022
01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.650
okay,
here's what I had for dinner last night.
You know,

1023
01:02:00.651 --> 01:02:04.310
here's something in the news I'm mad about,
or here's a cute thing I'm sharing,

1024
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:07.040
but it doesn't really tell me like,
how are you,
you know,

1025
01:02:07.041 --> 01:02:09.870
like if you and I haven't talked to her a year,
like,
what's up?
How you doing?

1026
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:11.930
How you doing,
what you're working on.
So to me,

1027
01:02:11.931 --> 01:02:15.710
the whole idea of a now page on your site,
it's just a general,
like,

1028
01:02:15.711 --> 01:02:20.610
here's what's up with me now.
So,
uh,
I just had one of those on my site.
Uh,

1029
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:25.620
I had a now page and then,
uh,
a guy named Gregory Brown saw it,
liked it.

1030
01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:30.360
He put one on his site and all I did was just retweet him when he told me and I

1031
01:02:30.361 --> 01:02:32.430
said,
cool,
I wish everybody had a now page.

1032
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.820
And like within a few hours there are eight more people had a now page and then

1033
01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:36.430
within a month

1034
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:41.380
<v 2>the 550 people had a now page on their website.
So I just put together now,
now,</v>

1035
01:02:41.381 --> 01:02:42.214
now.com.

1036
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:46.660
It's just like kind of a cute collection of people who have a now page on their

1037
01:02:46.661 --> 01:02:50.740
website.
Yeah.
Anyway,
but you know what I mean?

1038
01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.750
The point is the details don't matter.

1039
01:02:52.751 --> 01:02:56.350
But like I'm so glad I had the time to do that.

1040
01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.830
And it was only because I say no to almost everything that I was able to just

1041
01:02:59.831 --> 01:03:03.160
throw myself into this project and build this new thing on,
uh,
on,
uh,

1042
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:04.420
women catch the momentum.

1043
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:09.070
So I am reading a section of this,

1044
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:13.570
this blog posts that I wrote about you and you're the best email you ever wrote

1045
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:16.930
with the,
the Japanese boxing specialist and so on.

1046
01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:21.760
And one of the paragraphs that I put here for those people interested,

1047
01:03:21.761 --> 01:03:24.530
it's just the most successful email I ever wrote,
but a,

1048
01:03:24.531 --> 01:03:29.380
it's everywhere online and it reads stranger still at its largest.

1049
01:03:29.381 --> 01:03:32.770
Derek spent roughly four hours on CD baby every six months.

1050
01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:35.110
He had systematized everything to run without them.

1051
01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:38.860
And feel free to correct that if it,

1052
01:03:38.861 --> 01:03:42.460
if it needs to be corrected,
but what,

1053
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.350
assuming that's roughly true,

1054
01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:49.800
what were some of the most important decisions or realizations that made that

1055
01:03:50.441 --> 01:03:51.274
possible?

1056
01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.470
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

1057
01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:59.110
I love the timing for when I read four hour work week because it was actually

1058
01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:04.280
just after I had done this like complete delegation of everything.

1059
01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:05.403
Um,

1060
01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:10.900
that it was feeling the pain from everything having to go through me all right.

1061
01:04:13.371 --> 01:04:17.570
Like it was,
it was my business,
right?
100%,
no investors,
no nothing.
It was me.

1062
01:04:17.571 --> 01:04:22.160
And so I hired people to help me.
It was all me,
me,
me.
So four years into it,

1063
01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:26.600
it was growing.
It was really taking off.
I had 20 employees,

1064
01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:30.890
but still almost everything went through me and it made my day kind of miserable

1065
01:04:30.891 --> 01:04:32.210
because I'm a

1066
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:35.060
<v 2>real like introverted focused kind of person.</v>

1067
01:04:35.061 --> 01:04:38.360
I love to just sit down for 12 hours and do one thing without distraction.

1068
01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:43.220
You're an I n t j a Myers Briggs.
Yep.
Are you I'm a hundred percent IMTJ.
Yup.

1069
01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:46.280
Yup.
Um,
it's so

1070
01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:52.290
<v 3>I hated going to the office and being distracted every five minutes with my</v>

1071
01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:54.790
employees asking me questions.

1072
01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.530
So that's what I just felt such pain about this.
Like,
hey that,

1073
01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:04.860
that I really literally meant I booked a flight to [inaudible] I believe and I

1074
01:05:06.251 --> 01:05:11.251
was going to move to quiet and not give my employees my phone number and

1075
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.470
literally move.
I don't mean like take a vacation.

1076
01:05:14.471 --> 01:05:16.630
I mean like I am now going to be running,
see,

1077
01:05:16.631 --> 01:05:19.780
or I'm to be the owner of CD baby on a little island in Hawaiian.

1078
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:22.870
You guys just figure out your own damn problems cause I was just,

1079
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:25.840
I was just having so much psychic pain about this.

1080
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:30.870
But then luckily with lovely coincidence that night that I booked the flight to

1081
01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:33.340
Hawaii,
um,

1082
01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:38.820
I watched the movie vanilla sky and in Vanilla Sky Tom Cruise,

1083
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:41.440
it's like the owner of this big publishing company,

1084
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:45.400
but he gets all caught up with these crazy women and um,

1085
01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:50.730
gets too overwhelmed with his life and focusing on his own happiness and our,

1086
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:54.520
or unhappiness and all that.
And pretty soon his,

1087
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:59.260
his company has just wrestled away from him.
And I thought,
oh,

1088
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.920
I don't want that to happen.
Like,
I don't want to just plug my ears closed.

1089
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:06.790
My eyes are runaway and have my company taken away from me.

1090
01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.460
Um,
I need to give this,

1091
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:12.040
I need to deal with my problems instead of running from them.

1092
01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:17.790
So I canceled the trip to Hawaii and went into work the next day and decided to

1093
01:06:19.451 --> 01:06:23.560
fix this thing.
So then the next time somebody asks me a question,

1094
01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:28.180
I'd gathered everybody around.
I said,
okay,
everybody.
Tracy just asked me,

1095
01:06:28.181 --> 01:06:31.630
you know,
um,
Derek,
what do we do when a guy on the phone says he wants a refund?

1096
01:06:31.631 --> 01:06:35.170
You know,
I said,
okay,
everybody stop working.
Everybody gather round.
Okay,

1097
01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.160
Tracy asked what we do.
If somebody wants a refund,
here's,

1098
01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:42.160
here's not only what we do,
but here's why.
Here's my philosophy.

1099
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:44.530
Whenever anybody wants a refund,
mom,
all,
we should always give it to them.

1100
01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.730
And I would just explain not just the what to do,
but the why.

1101
01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:52.780
It was constantly communicating the philosophy.
Um,

1102
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.800
to get to the core of it.

1103
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:56.530
And I think you mentioned this in back and four hour work week,

1104
01:06:56.830 --> 01:07:00.370
there's almost nothing that really has to be you.

1105
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.400
Like you can almost get kind of AI and figure out how your brain works,

1106
01:07:07.031 --> 01:07:12.031
how your decision making process works and just teach it to other people so that

1107
01:07:13.301 --> 01:07:15.670
other people can do it.
And um,
yeah,

1108
01:07:15.671 --> 01:07:18.850
that's what I did for every single thing that ever came my way.

1109
01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.880
I would gather everybody around,
explain the philosophy behind it,

1110
01:07:21.881 --> 01:07:25.480
why we do things this way,
why I'm about to say what I'm about to say.

1111
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:27.100
And now here's what I think we should do.

1112
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.900
Do you understand why now please write it down.

1113
01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:32.980
But it was also important that I taught it to multiple people,
not just one,

1114
01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:34.270
and had them write it down.

1115
01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:39.010
And then the cool thing is I wasn't doing the hiring anymore,
the company,

1116
01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:40.960
I had taught other people how to do the hiring.

1117
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:45.340
So soon my employees were doing the hiring and then they were teaching new

1118
01:07:45.341 --> 01:07:49.180
people how to do this thing from the book.
And Yeah,
so by,

1119
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:50.523
let's see.

1120
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.800
So that really started four years into the company who was six months of

1121
01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:56.920
difficult work to really make myself unnecessary.

1122
01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:01.360
But then my girlfriend at the time decided to go to film school in La,

1123
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.470
so decided to follow her down there.
So I moved down to La to be with her,

1124
01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.490
which was a nice symbolic way to let the company know like you're on your own.

1125
01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:12.030
I'm still the owner.
And in fact,
so there,

1126
01:08:12.031 --> 01:08:16.460
there's one little caveat to the thing where you said that I was working on a CD

1127
01:08:16.461 --> 01:08:20.180
baby for four hours a year or whatever you said.
Yeah,
four,
I'm sorry,

1128
01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:24.860
six months is that,
that's how much time I spent doing this stuff.

1129
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:28.340
I didn't want to be doing right.
The monotony,

1130
01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:33.020
the bureaucracy stuff that I had reduced down to almost nothing like a few

1131
01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:33.853
minutes a week,

1132
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.760
but what I was doing from 7:00 AM to midnight every single day was programming

1133
01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:41.870
like the future of CD baby.
Uh,
and that's just the stuff that I loved doing.

1134
01:08:41.871 --> 01:08:46.010
So it was just,
it was about making my life the way I wanted it to be.

1135
01:08:46.011 --> 01:08:50.600
Working on the stuff that I wanted to be working on and not doing the stuff I

1136
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:51.310
didn't,

1137
01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:55.210
<v 2>which I'm glad you brought that up because I want to clarify something that is a</v>

1138
01:08:55.211 --> 01:08:59.940
common misconception related understandably to the title of the four hour work

1139
01:08:59.941 --> 01:09:01.990
week and at the end there's,
I is the,

1140
01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:06.280
it's like the single largest blessing and curse that is going to follow me for

1141
01:09:06.281 --> 01:09:10.540
the rest of my life,
but it's a catchy title.
Yes.
I tested it on Google ad words.

1142
01:09:10.541 --> 01:09:13.150
Yes.
Had a great conversion rate.

1143
01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:16.600
That's why it's that instead of something stupid like lifestyle hustling or the

1144
01:09:16.601 --> 01:09:17.920
chameleon blah,
blah,
blah.

1145
01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:20.740
I had a bunch of terrible titles that one performed best,

1146
01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:23.590
but the objective is not to be idle.

1147
01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:27.520
The objective is to control this non renewable resource called time so that you

1148
01:09:27.521 --> 01:09:31.990
can allocate it to the things you most want to be doing.
So I don't have,

1149
01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:33.340
in other words,
a trouble with heart.

1150
01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:37.630
I don't have a problem with hard work as long as it is applied to the right

1151
01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:41.560
things that are determined with some degree of self awareness and forethought or

1152
01:09:41.561 --> 01:09:46.310
planning.
Uh,
so that's,
that's sort of PSA.
Not for you Derek.
Cause you,

1153
01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.760
I read the book but for,

1154
01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:52.770
but for every like Dick who stands up at a public Q and a and goes routes him,

1155
01:09:53.201 --> 01:09:55.960
I just wanted to ask,
do you look for it?
I was a week

1156
01:09:57.790 --> 01:10:01.630
and this one I'm like turn into one of the fantastic four and punch him in the

1157
01:10:01.631 --> 01:10:05.820
neck from 300 feet away.
But for everyone who is,
it is,
um,

1158
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:08.650
maybe inclined to stand up and ask that question.
There's the answer.

1159
01:10:08.651 --> 01:10:12.460
Read the book.
Um,
and uh,
I,
I bumped into somebody recently.

1160
01:10:12.461 --> 01:10:14.230
You mentioned this book with the,

1161
01:10:14.231 --> 01:10:18.100
I guess frequently asked questions and he was like,
you should just make,

1162
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:21.220
cause I told them,
I was like,
you know,
I try to be really patient.

1163
01:10:21.221 --> 01:10:23.890
I try to spend a lot of time answering people's questions when they have them.

1164
01:10:23.891 --> 01:10:28.210
But it's so clear that most people asking questions have not read the fucking

1165
01:10:28.211 --> 01:10:32.590
book.
And there'll be like,
can I eat bananas on the slow Carb Diet?
You know,

1166
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:37.720
can I key in La after chocolate concert on this low carb diet?
And I'm just like,

1167
01:10:37.721 --> 01:10:42.070
fuck,
if you have to ask,
the answer is no,
and you clearly didn't read it.

1168
01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:46.840
And he's like,
you should just make a,
you should just have tee shirts that say,

1169
01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:51.370
what was it?
R T F m yeah.
Read the fucking read the fucking manual.

1170
01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.090
But a alas Allah called.
Cut that,
that scree a little short.

1171
01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:02.710
The book itself.
I want to get a dig into some specifics with this,

1172
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:05.380
this manual,
uh,
this rule book.

1173
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:07.870
When you had multiple people write it down,

1174
01:11:07.871 --> 01:11:12.871
how did you then put together a resource that could be shared with new hires?

1175
01:11:12.911 --> 01:11:13.744
And on,

1176
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:16.210
<v 3>actually I think we,
we'd put it on a,
um,</v>

1177
01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.770
put it on a wiki inside,

1178
01:11:19.771 --> 01:11:24.771
but honestly most of it was just word of mouth kind of legend inside.

1179
01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:29.100
Like they were a few internal stories,
kind of like the,

1180
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:34.230
the Zappos pizza story you just told.
The one I always heard was um,
Nordstrom's,

1181
01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:35.200
uh,

1182
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.200
that there's some legend about guy buys a shirt from Sears and it gets like

1183
01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:44.670
burnt up in a fire and he goes to Nordstrom's to return it and they give him his

1184
01:11:44.671 --> 01:11:47.900
money back.
Like they have like such a liberal return policy to,

1185
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:51.150
they'll even let you return burnt stuff from another store.

1186
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.320
And so a legend like that will travel down and it,

1187
01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:58.080
it carries the philosophy inside of it.

1188
01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:03.110
So it's almost like us little story like that can replace 20 pages of an

1189
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.810
employee handbook.
Totally agree.
Yeah.
It's an aphorism or it's a store.

1190
01:12:08.811 --> 01:12:11.340
Yeah,
exactly.
Um,
fable.

1191
01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:15.270
So there were quite a few of those inside CD baby,

1192
01:12:15.271 --> 01:12:19.470
especially for the early people would see the decisions that I had made and the

1193
01:12:19.471 --> 01:12:23.340
people that I had given all their money back in case anything went wrong or just

1194
01:12:23.341 --> 01:12:27.390
you just talking to me in the conversations and getting my philosophies and the

1195
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:29.460
early employees at CD baby really got it.

1196
01:12:29.461 --> 01:12:32.070
And then they would spread it to the new people

1197
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.193
<v 2>all knee.</v>

1198
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:39.840
If we flip from book writing to book reading,

1199
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:43.530
uh,
you have a page on your site,

1200
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.710
sivers.org forward slash book.
I'll link to it in the show notes.

1201
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.340
I think it's book,
correct me if the URL is it,

1202
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:51.810
you have notes on more than 200 bucks.

1203
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:54.870
You appear to be a voracious reader.

1204
01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:59.490
How do you select the books you read and how do you read them?

1205
01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:00.933
Okay.

1206
01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:05.410
<v 3>I select,
I really,
I let,
um,</v>

1207
01:13:07.210 --> 01:13:12.210
usually large numbers of people decide meaning like lots and lots of five star

1208
01:13:12.911 --> 01:13:15.000
reviews on Amazon,
right?
Um,

1209
01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:21.250
occasionally somebody that I really respect and that knows me will tell me,

1210
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:25.750
you need to read this book.
And even if it's had no reviews on Amazon,

1211
01:13:25.751 --> 01:13:26.740
I'll just trust them.

1212
01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.680
But for the most part I tend to go for things that I've seen,

1213
01:13:29.681 --> 01:13:33.310
lots of rave reviews.
Then I browse through the description on Amazon,

1214
01:13:33.311 --> 01:13:36.050
then I look at the review,
actually read the reviews people have said,

1215
01:13:36.051 --> 01:13:38.530
and it really sounds like something,
okay,

1216
01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.560
this sounds worth my time because I don't read fast and I don't,

1217
01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:45.520
I don't try to read fast.
I like to sit and ponder as I'm reading.

1218
01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:50.410
So when I'm committing to a book,
yeah,
that's,
that's 20 or 30 hours often.
Um,

1219
01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:54.700
so I don't take it lightly.
So yeah,
I tend to go with lots of Amazon reviews,

1220
01:13:54.701 --> 01:13:59.590
but then I also give up quickly.
So if like chapter three,
if by chapter three,

1221
01:13:59.591 --> 01:14:03.250
I'm not really into it,
I just ditch it and you don't even see those on my side.

1222
01:14:03.251 --> 01:14:06.940
So I've ditched almost as many as you see there.
Um,

1223
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:10.150
and I just don't write them up.
I just delete them on the kindle and move on.
So,

1224
01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:14.800
but here's interesting thing is,
okay,
there's a couple of doing things.

1225
01:14:14.801 --> 01:14:15.910
So years ago,

1226
01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:20.080
actually it was around 2007 when I first read four hour workweek,

1227
01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:21.070
I was living in London.

1228
01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:24.250
Even though CD baby you would still like up and running back in Portland,
Oregon.

1229
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:26.650
A just cause I want to do experience the world.

1230
01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:30.700
I was living in London at the time and I actually,
you know,
it's funny,

1231
01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:32.230
I don't know if I ever told you this cute story.

1232
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:37.231
It was my friend Arielle Hyatt who I mentioned earlier that told me about you

1233
01:14:37.481 --> 01:14:41.500
and the four hour work week,
but she told me a little fable about you.

1234
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.840
So I can't remember if I ever confirmed this with you.

1235
01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.970
She we'll find out right now.

1236
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:53.680
I think at the time she was going to some kind of like mastermind seminar by one

1237
01:14:53.681 --> 01:14:57.920
of those like how to be a millionaire kind of guys.
And apparently,
uh,

1238
01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:01.270
you know like five or six of those how to be a millionaire kind of guys held

1239
01:15:01.271 --> 01:15:04.180
some big mastermind thing in Hawaii or something.

1240
01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.490
And you were supposed to be there and you didn't show.

1241
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:12.040
And I think like Robert Kiyosaki and people like that were there and you were

1242
01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:12.821
supposed to be there,

1243
01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:17.350
but you didn't show up until the third day where you showed up like covered in

1244
01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:20.950
mud because you had just on a whim decided to try sleeping in a tree or

1245
01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:25.450
something like that.
The legend goes and uh,

1246
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:28.420
she told me about the four hour workweek and,

1247
01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:31.330
but basically like in this context of his guy,
Tim,

1248
01:15:31.331 --> 01:15:33.310
that doesn't give a fuck about convention.

1249
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:38.200
And it totally sounds like you're kinda guy that a is doing things the way that

1250
01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:40.660
you do it cause you don't give a fuck about convention either and you should

1251
01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:42.490
read his book.
So that was like,
yeah,

1252
01:15:42.491 --> 01:15:44.680
I think it wasn't even available in England at the time.

1253
01:15:44.681 --> 01:15:47.650
I had to go actually I think the first time I got four hour work week with

1254
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:51.340
something like illegal pdf download of it off of bit torrent.

1255
01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:56.900
<v 2>That's how it happens a lot.
I'd say that's,
that story I believe is true.</v>

1256
01:15:56.930 --> 01:16:00.240
So I remember this particular,
uh,

1257
01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:05.260
this particular event in Hawaii around the time that the book came out,

1258
01:16:05.841 --> 01:16:09.980
or maybe a year afterwards within the year following publication.

1259
01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:15.010
And I remember going to Hawaii and realizing that I wanted to explore Hawaii as

1260
01:16:16.551 --> 01:16:18.200
opposed to sitting in the conference room.

1261
01:16:18.670 --> 01:16:23.670
So I rented a car and ended up finding a bed and breakfast where this house was

1262
01:16:27.051 --> 01:16:30.860
built in the trees.
This is still totally issue and uh,

1263
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:34.670
but it wasn't available or it wasn't on the market.

1264
01:16:34.671 --> 01:16:38.690
And the caretaker ended up being this very attractive woman.

1265
01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:40.460
And I said,
well,

1266
01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:45.290
is there anything that I can do because to be able to sleep in this tree house,

1267
01:16:45.291 --> 01:16:49.370
because I'm really obsessed with this idea and it looks like Jurassic Park here

1268
01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:52.490
with these sort of prehistoric looking plants,
I'll even,

1269
01:16:52.491 --> 01:16:56.630
and she had some like dig a ditch that needed to be dug or something.

1270
01:16:56.630 --> 01:17:00.020
And so I did that and did all this manual labor.

1271
01:17:00.021 --> 01:17:03.720
Then I ended up being able to stay in the,
in the tree house.
And I think that,
uh,

1272
01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:06.830
it was on the Hana,
I want to say the Hana highway,
if I'm getting that right,

1273
01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:11.450
just spectacular.
I think it was in,
and so I did show up to the event late,

1274
01:17:11.451 --> 01:17:16.451
like a tank top and these absurdly now even to be embarrassing like European

1275
01:17:16.611 --> 01:17:21.080
short shorts,
I don't know why.
And uh,
yeah,
that's,
that's a true story.

1276
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:26.030
So it is true and so can for can the confirmed,
uh,
it's so funny.

1277
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:30.260
Uh,
I forget what tangent we are on.
Oh,
we were talking about,

1278
01:17:30.261 --> 01:17:32.360
we were talking about uh,
how you read books.

1279
01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:36.530
<v 3>Ah,
okay.
So right around that time I,</v>

1280
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:40.730
I had been reading books for agency for years and people often ask about like

1281
01:17:40.731 --> 01:17:42.980
mentorship and did you have any mentors?
And I say,
well,

1282
01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:47.270
don't books are my mentor.
It's like books guide almost everything I do.

1283
01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.590
Like the stuff I've learned from books totally guides my life.
Um,

1284
01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:57.190
so I realized though that I would love a book while reading it and maybe it

1285
01:17:58.461 --> 01:18:01.400
would still echo with me for a few weeks after.
But you know,

1286
01:18:01.401 --> 01:18:04.670
two years later I couldn't even remember if I had read it or not.

1287
01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:08.210
And I thought that's really a shame.
Like I remember at the time,

1288
01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:11.150
that book meant a lot to me.
Why is it now two years later,

1289
01:18:11.151 --> 01:18:13.310
I've forgotten everything.
I said,
no,
no,
no,
that's not good.

1290
01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:17.450
So what I started doing in 2007 is every book I read,

1291
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:22.850
I would keep a pen in hand and I would underline my favorite sentences.
Um,

1292
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.430
circle my favorite paragraphs,
write notes in the margins.

1293
01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:27.260
And then after I was done reading the book,

1294
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:31.190
I would put aside like two hours to open up a blank text file and type out

1295
01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.680
everything into a plain text file

1296
01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:39.650
so that I could,
knowing that plain text files are about the most permanent,

1297
01:18:39.651 --> 01:18:42.290
long last date format there can be.
They will work on everything.

1298
01:18:42.291 --> 01:18:45.800
You can read them on phones or new devices we haven't even thought of yet.

1299
01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.830
We'll always be able to read plain text files.

1300
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:53.090
So I started doing this for every book I read and then I would review my notes

1301
01:18:53.091 --> 01:18:56.870
later.
So every time I'm say just eating breakfast or something for 10 minutes,

1302
01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:02.040
I'll pull up one of the notes from a previous book I read and just kind of re

1303
01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.520
review it.
Sometimes kind of stop,
take a sentence.

1304
01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:05.960
That means a lot to me right now.

1305
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:09.410
Open up my diary and write about that for a while.
Like really internalize.

1306
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:14.570
Basically I wanted to memorize every lesson I had learned in every one of these

1307
01:19:14.571 --> 01:19:17.360
books.
So that's what I started doing.

1308
01:19:17.361 --> 01:19:20.750
I even started putting them into the space repetition systems and that didn't

1309
01:19:20.751 --> 01:19:24.500
really work out too well because I wasn't sure how to formulate that knowledge

1310
01:19:24.501 --> 01:19:27.230
into a Q and a flashcard to kind of format you're using stuff,

1311
01:19:27.231 --> 01:19:31.220
super memo or something like that.
Exactly.
Aki.
So,
um,

1312
01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:36.320
<v 2>uncased I'd know for people means rote memorization and Japanese.
Oh really?</v>

1313
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:39.080
A and k.
I.
M sorry to interrupt.

1314
01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:40.163
<v 3>So,</v>

1315
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:45.750
so it wasn't until say 2010 that I realized that I just had all of these lovely

1316
01:19:45.751 --> 01:19:50.700
book notes hidden on my hard drive just for my eyes only.
And I thought,

1317
01:19:50.701 --> 01:19:53.580
you know,
why don't I just put them on my website?

1318
01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:55.590
If the publishers tell me to take them down,
I will.

1319
01:19:55.591 --> 01:19:57.570
But maybe it's of use to people.
So yeah,

1320
01:19:57.571 --> 01:20:02.571
sivers.org/book what you're seeing is all of my detailed book notes I've taken

1321
01:20:02.971 --> 01:20:04.440
since 2007.

1322
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:08.970
<v 2>If you were to,
this may be a very difficult question to answer,</v>

1323
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.240
but to suggest five to start with,

1324
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.770
um,
or so,
I mean,
I'm just throwing out a random number,

1325
01:20:16.771 --> 01:20:21.630
but if you were to suggest some books to start with@sivers.org forward slash
book

1326
01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:26.250
and this is,
by the way,
this is not a set up for my own book.
This is

1327
01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:33.360
God.
Wouldn't that be TV
first?
The four hour workweek second.

1328
01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:35.870
See rule number one?
No.

1329
01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:38.460
So,

1330
01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:43.390
<v 3>uh,
the,
I've actually already answered the question for you because,</v>

1331
01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.330
uh,
once I posted them on my site,

1332
01:20:46.331 --> 01:20:50.460
I realized I should give them like a one to 10 rating because I knew this is
the,

1333
01:20:50.461 --> 01:20:52.570
the next question people are going to ask is,
well,

1334
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:55.420
which ones would you recommend?
So,
uh,

1335
01:20:55.421 --> 01:20:59.200
I give every book of one to 10 rating and it's when you go to sivers.org/book,

1336
01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:02.950
it's already sorted for you with my top recommendations up top.

1337
01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:07.600
And I think it's,
you know what,
I hadn't told you this either.
Um,

1338
01:21:08.770 --> 01:21:11.230
back in 2008 or nine,

1339
01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:15.490
you and I were sitting down the hill from your house,
that local coffee shop.

1340
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.920
And we were talking about the Charlie monger book,
um,
that,
uh,

1341
01:21:20.921 --> 01:21:22.090
that,
that big thick black

1342
01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:27.900
<v 2>oh,
seeking wisdom seeking wisdom from monger to Darwin or maybe the other way</v>

1343
01:21:27.901 --> 01:21:31.620
around by Peter beveling.
That's it.
Yes.
Yeah.
And,
um,

1344
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:34.770
so that's a,
that's a fascinating book.
Well,

1345
01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:38.580
I'm glad to have turned you on to Oh yes.
I appreciate it.
So,
uh,

1346
01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:41.040
so after turning you onto that book,

1347
01:21:41.041 --> 01:21:44.370
I remember we were talking about like the books that changed our life and you

1348
01:21:44.371 --> 01:21:47.970
told me,
I think,
was it the magic of thinking big?
Yeah,
that's right.

1349
01:21:47.971 --> 01:21:48.810
Dave David Schwartz.

1350
01:21:48.811 --> 01:21:53.610
I have it face out on my shelf in my living room so that I can see it

1351
01:21:53.611 --> 01:21:54.444
constantly.

1352
01:21:54.570 --> 01:21:55.200
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1353
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.220
So when you told me that the magic of thinking big made such a big difference to

1354
01:21:59.221 --> 01:21:59.910
you,

1355
01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:04.410
I think like the next week I picked it up and I read it and it did nothing for

1356
01:22:04.411 --> 01:22:05.244
me.

1357
01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.260
<v 2>I still say,
you know,
and as to catch you at the right time.
Exactly.</v>

1358
01:22:08.261 --> 01:22:11.410
And so that's why,
and it's also one of those books,
just,
sorry,

1359
01:22:11.411 --> 01:22:12.161
I'm getting defensive,

1360
01:22:12.161 --> 01:22:17.161
but it's one of those books that I read in around 2000 maybe a year or two after

1361
01:22:17.681 --> 01:22:21.100
college when I was in a Shitty,
you know,

1362
01:22:21.101 --> 01:22:24.910
a hundred plus hour a week job where I'm sleeping under my desk and sitting in

1363
01:22:24.911 --> 01:22:28.840
the fire exit because that's the only place they can,
they can fit me.
But yeah,

1364
01:22:28.841 --> 01:22:30.430
it has to find you at the right place at the right time.

1365
01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.613
<v 3>Exactly.</v>

1366
01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:36.650
And so there've been people that I tell about how Tony Robbins awaken the giant

1367
01:22:37.111 --> 01:22:40.390
within totally changed my life and I give it to friends and they go like,
Nah,
no,

1368
01:22:40.391 --> 01:22:43.200
no,
no.
It did nothing for me.
So it,
you're right,

1369
01:22:43.201 --> 01:22:48.090
it does matter when you read a book.
Um,
even I noticed on a specific subject,

1370
01:22:48.150 --> 01:22:52.140
I read and loved stumbling on happiness loved that book.

1371
01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:56.790
And so I read like two or three more books on the subject of the study of

1372
01:22:56.791 --> 01:22:59.670
happiness.
And by the time it got to the third one,

1373
01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:02.910
I forget what it's called right now,

1374
01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:05.520
maybe happiness project or something like that,
whatever.

1375
01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:09.250
The third one I read was,
I remember flipping through the book quickly,
like,
yeah,

1376
01:23:09.251 --> 01:23:11.380
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
I know,
I know.
I know.
I got it.

1377
01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:16.180
And so I gave it a really bad rating on my website and somebody emailed me later

1378
01:23:16.181 --> 01:23:19.360
going,
hey,
that book changed my life.
I can't believe you get it.

1379
01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:23.470
Gave it a two out of 10 rating.
And I looked again at my notes and I thought,

1380
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:25.120
you know,
it's actually probably a really good book.

1381
01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:29.170
I just read it at the wrong time because I had just read two other books on that

1382
01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.870
subject and so yeah,
exactly.
Just in a different order.

1383
01:23:31.871 --> 01:23:34.990
It might've been a 10 exactly.
If I would've read that one before,

1384
01:23:34.991 --> 01:23:37.300
stumbling on happiness,
which I gave a 10 to,
you know,

1385
01:23:37.301 --> 01:23:39.700
then I would have given that one a 10 and stumbling on happiness might've been

1386
01:23:39.701 --> 01:23:42.650
like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I know this stuff already.
Stumbling on happiness is a,
is a,

1387
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:43.900
is a great book.

1388
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I think that it's for those people who are familiar with the term that I use in

1389
01:23:49.661 --> 01:23:53.290
the four hour workweek,
the deferred life plan,
so a,
in other words,

1390
01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:58.380
sort of saving and working in order to retire at some point in the future,

1391
01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:02.410
maybe 10 20 years down the road,

1392
01:24:02.411 --> 01:24:07.411
30 perhaps to redeem all of that toil for some reward like sailing around the

1393
01:24:08.441 --> 01:24:13.000
world in a sailboat,
a stumbling,
I always forget,

1394
01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:15.070
is it something on or upon happiness?

1395
01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.870
Stumbling on half stumbling on happiness by Daniel Gilbert.
Is that right?
Yeah.

1396
01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:24.370
Uh,
is a great reality check for that type of,

1397
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:28.560
I think extremely risky prone to failure.
Uh,

1398
01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:32.560
deferred life planning.
Yeah.
So I've got to tell you,

1399
01:24:32.561 --> 01:24:34.150
so we haven't really talked about this yet,

1400
01:24:34.151 --> 01:24:37.900
but this is so up your alley or your listeners Aliya for the people who were

1401
01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:41.080
into books will appreciate this.

1402
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.320
So a lot of my friends,
actually,

1403
01:24:44.321 --> 01:24:48.160
I don't think any of my friends are as into reading as I am.
Okay.
A couple are,

1404
01:24:48.161 --> 01:24:52.540
but most aren't.
And so whenever I tell them about some amazing book I've read,

1405
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:57.730
the,
the Gist I get from my friends,
it's like,
well just tell me what to do.

1406
01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:02.860
Right?
So like give me the index card.
Yeah.
Like they don't want to read the book.

1407
01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:07.090
And so my friend Jeff is a smart guy.
I mean he's,
he's a lawyer,
he's smart,

1408
01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:09.940
but he just looks at me with these tired eyes and he just says like,

1409
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:14.050
I'm not gonna read the book dude.
Like,
just,
you can stop pushing it on me.

1410
01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:16.600
I just never going to happen.
He said,
just tell me what to do.
He said,

1411
01:25:16.601 --> 01:25:20.710
I trust you.
I like you.
You know me.
So tell me what to do.

1412
01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.860
And I realized that if you trust the source,

1413
01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:26.860
you don't need the arguments that,
so,

1414
01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:31.630
so much of a book is arguing it's point,
but often you don't need the argument.

1415
01:25:31.631 --> 01:25:34.150
If you trust the source,
you can just get the point.

1416
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:36.770
So after reading,

1417
01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:40.540
taking detailed notes on 220 books on my site,

1418
01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:46.320
I realized that distilling wisdom into directives is so valuable,

1419
01:25:48.671 --> 01:25:50.770
but it's so rarely done.
In fact,

1420
01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:55.771
the only time I can think of that was done was a Michael Pollan with his three

1421
01:25:56.501 --> 01:26:00.670
books in a row about food,
each one getting shorter and shorter.

1422
01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:05.570
Um,
I think the,
the first one was,
uh,
was it like omnivores?

1423
01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:08.470
<v 2>I'm a horse dilemma,
which was big.</v>

1424
01:26:08.471 --> 01:26:11.830
So I know that you're the kind of guy that would,
it's a great book,
but also,

1425
01:26:11.831 --> 01:26:15.130
I mean,
they're like 70 pages on the,

1426
01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.990
on corn production in the US.
And most people just drop out.
Uh,
even I even,

1427
01:26:19.991 --> 01:26:21.910
I was like,
God,
my eyes are glazing over here,

1428
01:26:21.911 --> 01:26:26.320
but I know there's some good stuff coming so I'll,
I'll slug through it.
But yes,

1429
01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.120
very great book,
but a very big book.

1430
01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:33.490
<v 3>And then he did one a year later that basically took the best of the stuff from</v>

1431
01:26:33.491 --> 01:26:38.260
Omnivore's dilemma and made it into a shorter kind of more,
uh,
pop market.

1432
01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:41.260
Two to 300 page book,
I believe.
I forget the name of that one.

1433
01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:46.210
And had been in defense of food maybe it sounds right.
Yes.
Thank you.
Um,

1434
01:26:46.630 --> 01:26:47.470
so even that one,

1435
01:26:47.471 --> 01:26:50.260
I remember somebody telling me I should read it and me looking at it going like,

1436
01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:54.350
ah,
I don't know if I really want us to read 300 pages about food.
Um,

1437
01:26:54.490 --> 01:26:59.380
but then a year later he put out it any little book called food rules.

1438
01:26:59.710 --> 01:27:01.960
I think that's what it's called.
And it's like,

1439
01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:06.130
you basically can read the whole thing while just standing in the bookstore.

1440
01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:06.880
It's,

1441
01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.880
he took the energy and the effort to compress everything he's learned into very

1442
01:27:13.331 --> 01:27:16.450
succinct directives.
Uh,
and that's what is going,
you know,

1443
01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:21.010
sentences that tell you what to do,
do this,
do that or don't do that.

1444
01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:26.140
Uh,
if,
if your grandmother wouldn't recognize it as food,
don't eat it.

1445
01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.180
Uh,
and his tagline for that book,
the popular phrase was eat food,

1446
01:27:32.230 --> 01:27:34.820
mostly plants,
not too much.
Right.

1447
01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:40.440
And I so admired that I got inspired by the effort it takes to distill the blah,

1448
01:27:42.311 --> 01:27:43.031
blah,
blah,
blah,

1449
01:27:43.031 --> 01:27:47.710
blah down into the specific sentences for the people that just aren't going to

1450
01:27:47.711 --> 01:27:49.540
read that 900 page book,
right?

1451
01:27:49.541 --> 01:27:53.170
Like probably all of that same information is in the 900 page book,

1452
01:27:53.171 --> 01:27:58.120
but we just have to realistically admit that most people will never read the 900

1453
01:27:58.121 --> 01:27:58.954
page book.

1454
01:27:59.050 --> 01:28:04.050
So as I'm reading these 300 page books and 220 of them,

1455
01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.000
very often there'll be some like brilliant,
amazing,

1456
01:28:07.001 --> 01:28:09.970
important point on like page 290.

1457
01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:14.920
And I feel a little sad that almost nobody's going to read that.

1458
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:18.940
Like I wished that these little tiny points were extracted like without all of

1459
01:28:18.941 --> 01:28:23.200
the surrounding argument.
So especially,
okay.
I'll admit,

1460
01:28:23.201 --> 01:28:28.000
this was also sparked by the idea of,
uh,
when I had a kid and I thought like,

1461
01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:33.220
I might not be alive when he's my age or even when he's 19,

1462
01:28:33.250 --> 01:28:34.840
I might die before he gets older.

1463
01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:40.380
How could I compress everything I've learned and that I think he should know

1464
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:45.550
into a real succinct format that he will definitely read.

1465
01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:48.520
And then I of course,
then I thought,
and,
and you know,
other people will read too.

1466
01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:52.570
So I got under this idea of the do this project,

1467
01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:57.610
which is,
um,
instead of talking around the subject,

1468
01:28:58.030 --> 01:29:02.760
just giving directives saying,
do this,
do,
don't do this,
don't do that.

1469
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:06.750
Which is kind of funny because it feels very presumptuous,
right?

1470
01:29:06.751 --> 01:29:11.130
Like who am I to tell others what to do?
But then I think,
well,

1471
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.590
who am I not too right.
It's useful.

1472
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:16.890
So get over myself kind of like you asked about like,

1473
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:19.980
you know me on stage when I was 18.
What was the biggest lesson learned?

1474
01:29:19.981 --> 01:29:23.530
Like this isn't about me.
People aren't here about neither.

1475
01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:26.520
They're here for their own gain.
Even,
you know that,
oh,

1476
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:30.060
you asked about my advice to Ted speakers.
That's my main advice to Ted speakers.

1477
01:29:30.061 --> 01:29:33.420
It's like people aren't here to see you and your life story.

1478
01:29:33.421 --> 01:29:36.030
People come to Ted or watch ted videos to learn something.

1479
01:29:36.031 --> 01:29:41.031
So just speak only about what is surprising and skip everything else.

1480
01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:46.290
Um,
what anyway,
if people could talk,
if we could start with one of your talks,

1481
01:29:46.291 --> 01:29:48.750
I know I'm interrupting for a second,
but which,
which,

1482
01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:50.790
which talk would you suggest as a starter?

1483
01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:55.020
My favorite one is the one,

1484
01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:59.520
I think on the Ted site it is called weird or just different,

1485
01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:03.600
I call it the Japanese addressing system.
That's my fault.

1486
01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:08.520
And I actually know what that means.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well it can be so confusing,

1487
01:30:08.521 --> 01:30:12.810
but yeah,
until somebody explains it to you and then you realize like,

1488
01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:16.290
oh,
it's just a different way of thinking.
And,

1489
01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:18.720
and here I'll just give you a little teaser.
The,
the,
the,

1490
01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.550
the talk is only three minutes long.

1491
01:30:20.551 --> 01:30:23.220
So you go to ted.com and search for Derek Sivers and that's tall,

1492
01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:26.010
called weird or just different.
But the little teaser is,

1493
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:30.930
is it blew my mind when I found out that in Japan they don't,

1494
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:35.760
the reason the streets don't have names is because they think of the streets as

1495
01:30:35.761 --> 01:30:40.761
the empty unnamed spaces because the blocks are the things that have names,

1496
01:30:40.861 --> 01:30:44.850
the box or the piece of land with houses on them.
That's what's important.

1497
01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:48.690
Whereas in America and most of the world,
if,
if you say,

1498
01:30:48.691 --> 01:30:52.070
what is the name of that block?
People will look at you weird,
like bold.

1499
01:30:52.230 --> 01:30:56.340
This is oak street,
this is third avenue.
W what do you mean?
And they said,

1500
01:30:56.341 --> 01:30:58.950
well what does that block called?
And said that that doesn't have a name.

1501
01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:02.370
We don't name our blocks,
we name our streets.
The blocks are just the,

1502
01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:06.870
the unnamed spaces in between named streets.
So in Japan it's the opposite.

1503
01:31:07.290 --> 01:31:11.430
The streets are the empty unnamed spaces in between named a blogs.

1504
01:31:11.610 --> 01:31:15.960
So I realized that how many things in life actually work just as well,

1505
01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:19.920
the complete opposite way.
We're used to thinking of them both ways are correct.

1506
01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:24.840
So anyway,
that's the idea.
But the direct,
we were talking about directives.

1507
01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:28.740
Yes.
And the advice you give Ted speakers is just how I took us off track.

1508
01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:33.060
All right,
so go ahead.
No,
no,
no.
I was going to ask,

1509
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.850
and I'm not trying to cut this short,
I'm just so I don't forget to ask,

1510
01:31:35.851 --> 01:31:40.851
where can people find the directives only in this podcast?

1511
01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:45.810
I know it's true.
I haven't done anything with it publicly.
I,

1512
01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:50.760
at first I thought I was going to make this into a big keynote speech I was

1513
01:31:50.761 --> 01:31:53.850
doing at a conference of the world domination summit conference in Portland.

1514
01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:57.940
I spent four months of full time work from like 7:00 AM to midnight for,

1515
01:31:57.941 --> 01:32:00.700
for you know,
seven days a week for four months in a row.

1516
01:32:00.970 --> 01:32:04.960
Just re reading all 220 book notes,

1517
01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:06.170
extracting a,

1518
01:32:06.190 --> 01:32:11.080
or trying to turn all of this advice or this knowledge,
this wisdom,

1519
01:32:11.081 --> 01:32:15.580
trying to turn it into directives because a lot of it almost never is in the

1520
01:32:15.581 --> 01:32:19.030
directive format already.
People talk around a subject,

1521
01:32:19.031 --> 01:32:21.310
they talk about findings and research,

1522
01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:26.800
but it takes some real effort to kind of like the,
um,
the old philosophers.

1523
01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:31.030
Um,
the,
was that you've read the,

1524
01:32:31.050 --> 01:32:34.300
the stoicism book,
uh,
the guide to the good life.
Yes.

1525
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:37.480
I have that up on my living room wall as well.

1526
01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:42.850
So in that book he says,
right in the intro,
he said,

1527
01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:47.880
if you ask a modern person who calls himself a philosopher,

1528
01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:52.510
uh,
what should I do with my life?
He said,
get ready.
You know,

1529
01:32:52.511 --> 01:32:55.390
sit down and get comfortable because they will tell you.
Well,

1530
01:32:55.391 --> 01:32:58.570
it depends what you mean by what,
and it depends what you mean by do.

1531
01:32:58.571 --> 01:33:01.960
And really it depends what you mean by life or really maybe it depends on what

1532
01:33:01.961 --> 01:33:03.520
you mean by my life.
You know,

1533
01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:08.290
he said people are talking around the issue so much these days,

1534
01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:11.770
but he said back in 600 BC,
if you would've asked one of these philosophers,

1535
01:33:11.771 --> 01:33:13.120
what should I do with my life?

1536
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:17.020
They would sit down and tell you exactly what to do with your life.
Do this,

1537
01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:20.550
don't do that,
pursue this.
Don't pursue that.
Uh,

1538
01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:24.000
so I was really inspired by that intro to,
so the idea was,

1539
01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:29.020
now how can I go back through all of these amazing books I've read and compress

1540
01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:33.340
all of this wisdom into specific directives.

1541
01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:38.370
So it took me four months of work to come up with the following like 18

1542
01:33:40.241 --> 01:33:43.090
sentences.
Do you want to hear them?
I do want to hear them.
I'm excited.

1543
01:33:43.091 --> 01:33:44.350
I'm super excited about this.

1544
01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:50.340
So this was going to be a 35 minute long keynote speech and it turned out to be

1545
01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:56.950
a horrible 35 minute long talk,
but it's entertaining for about three minutes.

1546
01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:01.090
So here's,
here's the three minute version.
Okay.

1547
01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.680
First I had fun categorizing them.
Uh,

1548
01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:08.680
so this is the category called how to be useful to others.

1549
01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:13.330
Ready?
I'm ready.
Number one,
get famous.

1550
01:34:14.110 --> 01:34:17.680
Do everything in public and for the public.
The more people you reach,

1551
01:34:17.681 --> 01:34:21.850
the more useful you are.
The opposite is hiding,
which is of no use to anyone,

1552
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:25.390
how to be useful to others.
Number two,
get rich.

1553
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:29.170
Money is neutral proof that you're adding value to people's lives.

1554
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:32.140
So by getting rich,
you're being useful as a side effect.

1555
01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:36.010
Once rich spend the money in ways that are even more useful to others,

1556
01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:40.240
then getting rich is double useful.
How to be useful to others.

1557
01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:45.040
Share strong opinions.
Strong opinions are very useful to others.

1558
01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:48.610
Those who were undecided or ambivalent can just adopt your stance,

1559
01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:53.080
but those who disagree can solidify their stance by arguing against yours.

1560
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:56.710
So even if you invent an opinion for the sole sake of argument,

1561
01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.260
boldly searing a strong opinion is very useful to others.

1562
01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:04.160
How to be useful to others.
Be Expensive.

1563
01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:08.960
People given a placebo pill were twice as likely to have their pain disappear

1564
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:11.030
when told that that pill was expensive,

1565
01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:15.530
people who paid more for tickets were more likely to attend the performance.

1566
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:20.600
So people who spend more for a product or service value it more and get more use

1567
01:35:20.601 --> 01:35:23.810
out of it.
So be expensive.
That's it.

1568
01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:29.840
Okay.
This is,
this is good stuff.
So that's how to be useful to others.

1569
01:35:29.841 --> 01:35:32.240
That's just one category.
I've got a few more if you want to hear them later.

1570
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:37.730
Yeah.
Well,
let's,
what,
what is your favorite of the remaining categories?

1571
01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.340
Well,
maybe we could do one more.
Okay,
good.

1572
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:43.250
If you imagine that I've got a few more that are done in that format.

1573
01:35:43.251 --> 01:35:46.070
Like I've got,
uh,
this is very stoicism.

1574
01:35:46.071 --> 01:35:49.940
Like I've got a whole category called how to thrive in an unknowable future

1575
01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.600
that's like prepare for the worst,
expect disaster,
own as little as possible.

1576
01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:56.210
Choose opportunity,
not loyalty.
She goes,
the plan.
Let's,

1577
01:35:56.211 --> 01:36:00.020
let's do that one is since,
I mean,
you know,
I'm a sucker for stoicism.
All right.

1578
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:03.740
Uh,
let's,
let's,
let's,
let's talk about that one.
Okay.

1579
01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:06.170
So how to thrive in an unknowable future.

1580
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:10.700
Prepare for the worst since you have no idea what the future may bring.

1581
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:12.980
Be Open to the best and the worst,

1582
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:17.300
but the best case scenario doesn't need your preparation or your attention.

1583
01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:21.200
Some mentally and financially.
Just prepare for the worst case instead.

1584
01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:25.370
And like insurance,
don't obsess on it.
Just prepare and then carry on.

1585
01:36:25.371 --> 01:36:29.510
Appreciating the good times.
How to thrive in an unknowable future.

1586
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:34.160
Expect disaster.
If you ever watched a VH one behind the music,

1587
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:38.090
you know that like every single success story had that moment where the narrator

1588
01:36:38.091 --> 01:36:42.540
would come in and say,
and then things took a turn for the worse.
Right?

1589
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:46.520
So fully expect that disaster to come to you at any time.

1590
01:36:46.521 --> 01:36:50.690
You have to completely assume that it is going to happen and make your plans

1591
01:36:50.691 --> 01:36:54.170
accordingly.
Not just money,
but health and family and freedom.

1592
01:36:54.171 --> 01:36:59.171
You have to expect it to all disappear besides you appreciate things more when

1593
01:36:59.241 --> 01:37:02.900
you know this may be your last time seeing them.
Um,

1594
01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:04.850
how to thrive in an unknowable future,

1595
01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:09.470
own as little as possible depend on even less.
The less you own,

1596
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.240
the less you're affected by disaster.

1597
01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:15.770
How to thrive in an unknowable future is choose opportunity,
not loyalty.

1598
01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:21.140
Have no loyalty to location corporation or your last public statements.

1599
01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.510
Be An absolute opportunist.

1600
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:26.660
Doing whatever is best for the future in the current situation.

1601
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:28.400
Unbound by the past,

1602
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:32.360
have loyalty for only your most important human relationships.

1603
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:37.670
How to thrive in an unknowable future.
Choose the plan with the most options.

1604
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:41.480
The best plan is the one that lets you change your plans.
For example,

1605
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:45.230
renting a house is actually buying the option to move at any time without losing

1606
01:37:45.231 --> 01:37:50.000
money in a changing market.
And lastly,
how to thrive in an unknowable future.

1607
01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:53.090
Avoid planning for maximum options.

1608
01:37:53.091 --> 01:37:57.720
Don't plan at all since you have no idea how the situation or your mood may

1609
01:37:57.721 --> 01:38:01.620
change in the future.
Wait until the last moment to make each decision.

1610
01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:03.850
<v 2>Which,</v>

1611
01:38:03.850 --> 01:38:08.850
which of these have you most concretely implemented in your life from this?

1612
01:38:10.391 --> 01:38:11.410
From this category?

1613
01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:17.720
<v 3>Oh God.
Um,
I really internalize this category.</v>

1614
01:38:17.721 --> 01:38:21.680
It's the whole way I see the world.
Like if you look inside my head,

1615
01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:26.890
you'd think I was a little nuts and just that I,

1616
01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:29.690
I'm just always expecting everything disappear even as I'm like,

1617
01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:32.690
I step outside and living in New Zealand now and I step outside,

1618
01:38:32.691 --> 01:38:35.420
it's just gorgeous surrounded by nature's blue skies and I,

1619
01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:39.380
I just inhale and I think like,
Yep,
this is all going to disappear.

1620
01:38:40.570 --> 01:38:43.340
It's all going to go to shit.
Polish is going to wreck this all.

1621
01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:47.660
But I don't think that in like a awful doom and gloom way,
you can tell.
I'm not,

1622
01:38:47.661 --> 01:38:48.800
you know,
er,

1623
01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.280
but it's just part of my appreciation for everything now and every person I know

1624
01:38:54.831 --> 01:38:55.790
and even just my health,

1625
01:38:55.791 --> 01:38:59.180
even just God when I like stand up in the morning and I'm like,
you know,
I just,

1626
01:38:59.210 --> 01:39:03.590
I wake up full of energy I think.
Yep.
In another couple of decades.

1627
01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:08.600
That's not going to happen anymore.
I really appreciate this.
So,
um,

1628
01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.760
yeah,
it's more of just a deep mindset.

1629
01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.430
<v 2>It's a practical,</v>

1630
01:39:12.490 --> 01:39:17.490
I give a short five minute talk on a called practical pessimism.

1631
01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:20.920
I think it was.
Yeah.
Stoicism as a productivity system.

1632
01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:23.260
I talked about this because I think it's so important that

1633
01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:28.990
not to be brainwashed into looking at everything with rose colored glasses

1634
01:39:28.991 --> 01:39:32.440
because it is not always a constructive exercise.
Uh,
in fact,

1635
01:39:32.441 --> 01:39:35.920
it can very much be the opposite.
And I,

1636
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:40.110
the reason,
one of the primary reasons that I'm fasting right now,
I mean,

1637
01:39:40.111 --> 01:39:44.410
I'm eight days into a target of 10.
I'm getting a little little woozy today,

1638
01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:48.820
but all things mostly manageable is,
uh,
and I'm also,

1639
01:39:48.821 --> 01:39:53.380
this is what I haven't mentioned to you also unshaven also wearing the same,

1640
01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:58.120
mostly the same clothing pants,
jacket,
et Cetera,
all week long.

1641
01:39:58.210 --> 01:40:02.680
And the reason for that is actually a in,
in your,

1642
01:40:03.010 --> 01:40:06.880
what you just said reminded me a lot of Marcus Aurelius Meditations,
uh,

1643
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:10.330
which were the emperor of Rome's wartime journal.

1644
01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:14.200
Never in tended for publication,
but it would always start with like,

1645
01:40:14.201 --> 01:40:16.960
today you are going to meet rude,
ungrateful,

1646
01:40:17.170 --> 01:40:21.550
arrogant people and the,
this is how you're going to contend with it.

1647
01:40:21.610 --> 01:40:25.930
And it was,
it seems very depressing until you realize that he was setting a,

1648
01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:31.350
creating a mindset that could deal with those worst case scenarios if they

1649
01:40:31.691 --> 01:40:36.190
presented themselves.
And similarly,
you know,
Seneca is very controversial,
stoic,

1650
01:40:36.191 --> 01:40:40.090
but nonetheless,
my,
my favorite to read,
uh,
and I have a huge,

1651
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:43.390
like 30 hours of audio coming out related to Seneca shortly.

1652
01:40:43.391 --> 01:40:45.400
But one of his,

1653
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:50.430
one of my favorite passages from Seneca is one that reads,

1654
01:40:52.121 --> 01:40:54.430
and I'm going to master this,
but it's paraphrased,

1655
01:40:56.110 --> 01:41:00.580
set aside some time each month where you,

1656
01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:02.000
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1657
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.920
<v 2>Subsist on the scanners to fair,
the cheap,
the roughest of dress,
et Cetera,</v>

1658
01:41:06.921 --> 01:41:09.410
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Asking yourself all the while,

1659
01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.390
is this the condition I so feared?

1660
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:16.700
And so not only are you mentally preparing yourself by visualizing the worst

1661
01:41:16.701 --> 01:41:18.710
case scenario,
you're actually practicing,

1662
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:23.600
you're rehearsing poverty or lack of variation,

1663
01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:25.280
or in my case,
no food.

1664
01:41:25.410 --> 01:41:29.030
I've done this before with say rice and beans for five days,
and you're like,

1665
01:41:29.031 --> 01:41:34.010
okay,
it costs me $2 a day or less to eat and I feel fucking fine.

1666
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:37.100
And in fact,
not having the paradox of choice,

1667
01:41:37.101 --> 01:41:40.190
having to go to the Thai restaurant and pick from 150 items that all have the

1668
01:41:40.191 --> 01:41:45.191
same six fucking ingredients that's been really relaxing and so on and so forth.

1669
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:49.730
Uh,
so that's maybe a slight digression,
but,
um,

1670
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:54.790
I've always appreciated that about how you have designed your life,

1671
01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:59.450
uh,
on the books.
So I want to,
I want to give,
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

1672
01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:01.860
<v 3>I see it.
Before we close out this subject,</v>

1673
01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:05.940
I have to just give you the one little like punchline ending to these directives

1674
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:11.400
because there were some that didn't fit into this,
do this format,
do that.

1675
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:14.820
And I didn't want to start making lists of what not to do because I liked the

1676
01:42:14.821 --> 01:42:19.050
idea that every single sentence should be actionable.
Right?
And so don't do this.

1677
01:42:19.051 --> 01:42:23.040
Don't do that.
Didn't feel actionable enough to me.
So I had fun kind of like,

1678
01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:24.750
you know,
our mutual hero,

1679
01:42:24.751 --> 01:42:29.751
Charlie monger had a speech once that I think he gave at USC about like how to

1680
01:42:30.331 --> 01:42:31.260
be a failure.

1681
01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:36.700
And it was so I made a category that was called how to stop being rich and

1682
01:42:37.411 --> 01:42:39.690
happy.
So this is like after you're rich and happy,

1683
01:42:39.691 --> 01:42:43.290
how to stop being rich and happy.
And I thought you'd appreciate this first one.

1684
01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.350
Prioritize lifestyle design.

1685
01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:52.830
You've made it so it's all about you now.
Make your dreams come true.

1686
01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:56.160
Shape your surroundings to please your every desire.

1687
01:42:56.340 --> 01:43:01.020
Make your immediate gratification.
The most important thing,
uh,

1688
01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:04.740
how to stop being rich and happy.
Chase that comparison moment.

1689
01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:09.930
You have the old thing,
you want the new thing.
Yes.
Do it be happy for a week.

1690
01:43:10.170 --> 01:43:14.010
Ignore the fact that happiness comes only from the moment of comparison between

1691
01:43:14.011 --> 01:43:14.844
the old and new.

1692
01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:17.500
Once you've had your new thing for a week and it becomes your new normal,

1693
01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.620
then just go seek happiness from another new thing.
Yeah.
You get the idea.

1694
01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:24.890
<v 2>No,
I do.
And I agree with the first point.
I mean,</v>

1695
01:43:24.891 --> 01:43:29.540
people might think that I wouldn't,
but they're doing a lot of reading and uh,

1696
01:43:29.541 --> 01:43:34.310
your practice with meditation and so on.
But if you read,
say Tara Brock or,
uh,

1697
01:43:34.311 --> 01:43:37.730
which has,
she is a fantastic book called radical acceptance,

1698
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:42.980
which I highly recommend to people who are type A in particular,
but,
uh,

1699
01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:46.130
most suffering,
Angie,
Tony Robbins would say this to my,

1700
01:43:46.131 --> 01:43:49.760
I attended my first live event
a few weeks ago,

1701
01:43:49.761 --> 01:43:53.360
which was very fascinating and lot of fun.
But,
uh,

1702
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:57.900
the most suffering comes from a focus on me on the self.

1703
01:43:58.610 --> 01:44:03.110
And as soon as you get,
I received a piece of advice a few,

1704
01:44:03.610 --> 01:44:05.210
maybe five years ago from someone they said,

1705
01:44:05.211 --> 01:44:09.350
if you're having trouble making yourself happy,
just make someone else happy.

1706
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:12.050
And it sounds so cliched,

1707
01:44:12.051 --> 01:44:16.520
but it's actually really pragmatic and it makes me think of this something

1708
01:44:16.521 --> 01:44:21.190
simple that I've been doing that,
uh,
Gabrielle Reece,
Gabby Reese,

1709
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:25.250
who was on this podcast with Laird Hamilton,
uh,

1710
01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:30.320
both very famous athletes and they're married and she said,
go first.

1711
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:33.620
And all she meant by that was during your day.
Be First.

1712
01:44:33.670 --> 01:44:37.170
Like if be the first to look at someone and smile and be the first to look,

1713
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:41.150
to walk up to when you walk up to the Barista,
ask them how they're doing,

1714
01:44:41.151 --> 01:44:42.830
be the first to initiate that.

1715
01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:47.540
And it's such a simple way to put a smile on people's faces.
Not always,

1716
01:44:47.541 --> 01:44:51.060
but a good portion of the time.
And that can change your own state.
Uh,

1717
01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:54.740
two things on,
on books.
I'll just,
because you're sharing your methods,

1718
01:44:54.741 --> 01:44:59.330
I'll share a couple that I've enjoyed.
One is on Amazon.

1719
01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:05.200
I will look at the four star most for if it has a sufficient critical mass of

1720
01:45:07.041 --> 01:45:11.810
say five stars to be worth looking into.
If that's how I'm I'm filtering,

1721
01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:17.140
then I will look at the most helpful critical reviews that are,

1722
01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:23.690
that are four and three star.
Uh,
in addition to that,
I will go to,

1723
01:45:23.691 --> 01:45:28.100
I think it's just kindle.amazon.com and I will read the public highlights.

1724
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:29.900
So I'll take,
uh,

1725
01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:33.230
maybe five minutes to look at the most critical three and four star reviews

1726
01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:33.841
because the,

1727
01:45:33.841 --> 01:45:38.730
the five star and the one star and two star tend to be worthless in a way.
Yes.

1728
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:41.660
They're so one sided.
Yeah.
Uh,
so look at the,

1729
01:45:41.661 --> 01:45:44.720
the three and four star most helpful critical reviews.

1730
01:45:45.110 --> 01:45:50.110
And then I will look at the kindle highlights and that is in effect seeing the

1731
01:45:51.081 --> 01:45:53.990
movie trailer.
It's like if you don't like the highlights from the movie trailer,

1732
01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:58.460
you're definitely not going to like the full feature film,

1733
01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:03.410
especially when it takes 30 hours instead of one and a half.
And,
uh,

1734
01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:08.980
the reason I started using a kindle was specifically so that I could export my

1735
01:46:09.021 --> 01:46:13.580
notes yes.
As text files.
Yeah.
And,

1736
01:46:13.670 --> 01:46:16.700
uh,
the,
so that's,

1737
01:46:16.701 --> 01:46:21.560
that's one of the ways that I filter books these days.
Um,
but the,

1738
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:27.260
the,
uh,
the question that I always ask that I'd like to ask you and,
uh,

1739
01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.300
I think we might have to do around two sometime because we'll can probably going

1740
01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:34.190
to have to hop off and,
uh,
uh,
maybe 10 minutes or so,
but what,

1741
01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:37.160
there's so many questions I want to ask you.
Uh,

1742
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:42.290
what is the book you've given most as a gift Geek in Japan,

1743
01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:47.810
in Japan,
Geek in Japan by Hector Garcia?
Because I'm,

1744
01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.640
I'm fascinated with the mindset

1745
01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.010
<v 3>of a place,
right?
Like,</v>

1746
01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:56.750
I would love to really understand the philosophy of Brazil,
India,
China,

1747
01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:59.670
Finland,
France,
Japan,
Thailand.
Like to me,

1748
01:46:59.671 --> 01:47:04.671
each place it seems to have its own cultural norms in how it approaches time or

1749
01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:11.340
longterm versus short term thinking or what's precious sent should be protected

1750
01:47:11.341 --> 01:47:14.130
or human interactions,
relationships,
dealing with obstacles,

1751
01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:19.470
conformity versus rebellion.
Uh,
or just,
you know,
how it approaches,
uh,

1752
01:47:19.530 --> 01:47:21.120
people who are unfortunate.

1753
01:47:21.570 --> 01:47:26.100
So we think of philosophies like existentialism,
Stoicism,

1754
01:47:26.101 --> 01:47:30.620
Nihilism.
But I'd love to study Brazil,
Ism,
Japan,
Ism,

1755
01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.330
tie ism,
you know,
I really do think of each country's culture is kind of like a,

1756
01:47:35.570 --> 01:47:40.490
uh,
working modern applied philosophy.
Oh,
totally,
totally.
Yeah.

1757
01:47:40.610 --> 01:47:40.980
Yeah.

1758
01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:44.700
So Geek in Japan is written by the Spanish guy who's been living in Japan for 10

1759
01:47:44.701 --> 01:47:48.810
years.
And while most of the book is kind of like,
hey,
check out this,

1760
01:47:48.811 --> 01:47:49.644
look at that.

1761
01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:55.220
It has a section in the middle that I think explains the Japanese mindset better

1762
01:47:55.231 --> 01:47:56.730
than anything I'd heard before.

1763
01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.700
And I had spent months in Japan over the last 20 years.

1764
01:47:59.701 --> 01:48:02.910
I've gone there five or six times and I used to play guitar for a Japanese pop

1765
01:48:02.911 --> 01:48:04.140
star and toured the country.

1766
01:48:04.410 --> 01:48:08.880
But Somehow Geek in Japan made me understand Japan more.

1767
01:48:09.090 --> 01:48:11.190
So I give that to everyone who's going to Japan.

1768
01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:14.520
But actually an even better book I've found since then and describing the

1769
01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:18.000
mindset of a country is called AU contraire.

1770
01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:22.920
Figuring out the French,
it's so deep.
It explains the mindset so well,

1771
01:48:22.921 --> 01:48:26.700
I wish there was a book like this about every country I highly recommended.

1772
01:48:26.701 --> 01:48:28.230
So you listeners out there,

1773
01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:32.670
if you know of any other books like this that like explain the mindset of a

1774
01:48:32.671 --> 01:48:35.040
country,
please email me to let me know

1775
01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:39.060
<v 2>there is a book and I'm going to rely on the readers as well.</v>

1776
01:48:39.061 --> 01:48:41.760
What is your email address if you want to give it out?
Yeah,

1777
01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:45.610
Derek sivers.org and uh,

1778
01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:48.240
in the comments guys.
So this,

1779
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:50.310
all the show notes and everything links to these books will

1780
01:48:50.311 --> 01:48:53.880
be@fourhourworkweek.com forward slash Derek.
Uh,

1781
01:48:54.210 --> 01:48:58.590
but there is a book out there,
I want to say Enrico something as the author,

1782
01:48:58.591 --> 01:49:01.050
but an Italian,
I'm pretty sure it was an Italian,

1783
01:49:02.730 --> 01:49:04.830
effectively writes geek in America,

1784
01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:09.270
but from the standpoint of Italian traveling through the u s including the

1785
01:49:09.271 --> 01:49:13.750
heartland.
Nice.
Uh,
so that's,
that's one.
Cool.
Uh,

1786
01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:20.930
what's $100 or less purchase has most positively impacted your life in the last

1787
01:49:21.661 --> 01:49:22.740
six months or recently?

1788
01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:24.301
<v 3>Well,</v>

1789
01:49:24.301 --> 01:49:28.230
I'm such a minimalist that I always avoid letting any new possession into my

1790
01:49:28.231 --> 01:49:29.064
life.
Right.

1791
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:34.430
But I took my three year old kid to a cafe one morning that had a huge box of

1792
01:49:35.191 --> 01:49:39.030
toys,
like little figurines and color cars and dolls and monsters.

1793
01:49:39.031 --> 01:49:42.960
And he was just in the zone for like two or three hours,

1794
01:49:42.961 --> 01:49:47.920
completely engrossed in all these toys.
So I was like,
yeah,
okay.
Can't,
you know,

1795
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:50.500
push my minimalist and on on him.
He needs toys.

1796
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:54.820
So that night I went on to Ebay and I found someone selling a huge box of old

1797
01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:58.390
use toys just like that,
you know,
figurines and cars and stuff.

1798
01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:03.420
20 bucks and a endless hours of entertainment since best $20 I've spent on a

1799
01:50:03.861 --> 01:50:06.370
lawn.
That's awesome.
Uh,

1800
01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:12.550
do you have a favorite documentary or movie?
No.
Um,

1801
01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:16.210
I really don't watch hardly anything.
Um,

1802
01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:21.550
I don't,
I mean relative to the norm,
right?
I mean,
I watch movies,

1803
01:50:21.551 --> 01:50:22.990
but more kind of for the artistry,

1804
01:50:22.991 --> 01:50:25.750
the cinematography and I listened to music of course,
but like,

1805
01:50:26.170 --> 01:50:31.060
I don't watch ted talks or documentaries or TV shows.
I also,

1806
01:50:31.061 --> 01:50:35.680
I don't even read blogs or articles and I don't listen to podcasts.
In fact,

1807
01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:38.770
I listened to my very first podcast two weeks ago.

1808
01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:40.360
That was the one with you and Tony Robbins.

1809
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:44.530
That was like the first time I've ever listened to a podcast because I just have

1810
01:50:44.531 --> 01:50:47.800
this lovely optimized life.
Or I just wake up and I write,
write,
write,
write,

1811
01:50:47.801 --> 01:50:52.720
write,
all day long.
I have no commute.
I,
I,
I'm never really driving anywhere.

1812
01:50:52.721 --> 01:50:55.990
So I don't have any downtime like that.
And if I'm outside,

1813
01:50:55.991 --> 01:50:59.200
I want to hear the birds and the trees,
you know?
And if I'm working out,

1814
01:50:59.201 --> 01:51:03.070
I'll either crank up the hip hop or sometimes just enjoy the total silence

1815
01:51:03.071 --> 01:51:06.250
except for the hardcore sound of the clanking metal plates,
you know?

1816
01:51:06.250 --> 01:51:11.250
So I really just prefer books as my medium of learning an input of information

1817
01:51:11.871 --> 01:51:13.210
and take.
What do you listen to?

1818
01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:17.860
What are you listening to now or recently for working out what music?

1819
01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.290
Huh?
I've started realizing that,

1820
01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:24.160
I don't know my American history of hip hop,

1821
01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:27.880
that I've always been loosely aware of it,
but I recently saw the

1822
01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:33.280
Chris rock movie top five and the running punch line in that movie.
He's like,

1823
01:51:33.281 --> 01:51:36.850
he's going around like what are your top five and people kind of name their top

1824
01:51:36.851 --> 01:51:40.570
five hip hop artists are the ones that they feel are like the most important and

1825
01:51:40.571 --> 01:51:43.690
there were some in there I'll realize like,
well I don't,
I've actually,

1826
01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:45.130
I know who these people are.

1827
01:51:45.131 --> 01:51:48.970
Of course we've all heard of Krs one and rock him and,
but I was like,
wait,

1828
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:50.620
I don't think I actually know their music well.

1829
01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:55.360
So I've started giving myself an education in the history of hip hop and so

1830
01:51:55.361 --> 01:51:57.130
lately I've been listening to nothing but hip hop.

1831
01:51:57.131 --> 01:51:58.630
Going back to the very beginning,

1832
01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:02.650
the wild style movie and the kind of early stuff and giving myself the

1833
01:52:02.651 --> 01:52:06.130
chronological history of hip hop.
It's been fun.
Any favorites so far?

1834
01:52:06.190 --> 01:52:09.510
I would say if you'd Eric B and Rakim our way up at the top for me,

1835
01:52:09.970 --> 01:52:13.570
especially once I understood the context.
When you hear the before and after,

1836
01:52:13.571 --> 01:52:17.290
like right now you can take rock him for example.
Uh,

1837
01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:20.650
I mean you can take them for granted the way that now if you listen to Jimi

1838
01:52:20.650 --> 01:52:20.651
Hendrix,

1839
01:52:20.651 --> 01:52:24.340
you can take what he was doing for granted because people have expanded on that.

1840
01:52:24.341 --> 01:52:29.230
But if you think of like where what people were doing with guitars before Jimi

1841
01:52:29.230 --> 01:52:32.170
Hendrix and after it was just mind blowing.

1842
01:52:32.171 --> 01:52:35.040
And so I think Rakim is like that for hip hop,
that it's,

1843
01:52:35.070 --> 01:52:38.440
he listened to what was going on before him and then he came along.

1844
01:52:38.441 --> 01:52:40.270
It was just such a,
um,

1845
01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:45.600
such a whole new approach to change everybody's since if you have one billboard

1846
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:48.680
<v 2>anywhere with anything on it,
what would it say?</v>

1847
01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:52.013
<v 3>Well,</v>

1848
01:52:52.290 --> 01:52:56.430
my real answer if I was taking that literally is that I would remove all the

1849
01:52:56.431 --> 01:53:00.030
billboards in the world and ensure that they were never replaced,
you know,
like,

1850
01:53:00.190 --> 01:53:04.230
have you ever driven through India?
You know?
Yeah.
It's so sad.

1851
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:08.580
I haven't driven,
it was on my way to the Calcutta er where I spent a week.

1852
01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:12.570
I was gone briefly looking at the windows,
you know,

1853
01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:14.880
even in these small towns and Carola,

1854
01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:18.870
like there's almost no space that is left without advertising.

1855
01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:23.880
So I really admire those places.
Like I think Vermont and a South Paulo,

1856
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:26.820
Brazil,
that ban,
uh,
billboards.

1857
01:53:26.821 --> 01:53:29.490
But I know that that wasn't really what you were asking.
So,

1858
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:32.370
so my better answer is,
um,

1859
01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:38.120
I think I would make a billboard that would say it won't make you happy and I

1860
01:53:38.401 --> 01:53:42.330
would place it outside any big shopping mall or a car dealer.

1861
01:53:43.710 --> 01:53:45.060
So ideally,
actually I think,
you know,

1862
01:53:45.061 --> 01:53:50.061
it'd be a fun project is to buy and train thousands of parrots to say it won't

1863
01:53:50.911 --> 01:53:52.980
make you happy.
It won't make you happy.

1864
01:53:53.310 --> 01:53:56.280
And then you let them loose in the shopping malls and super stores around the

1865
01:53:56.281 --> 01:54:00.990
world.
That's my life mission.
Anybody again,
anybody with me?
Let's do it.
Yeah.

1866
01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:06.820
<v 2>Yeah.
We'll make you happy.
Uh,
very stoic,
very stoic.</v>

1867
01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:11.050
Uh,
which does not mean you can't have joy in your life,

1868
01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:14.550
but it's think stumbling on happiness is,

1869
01:54:14.570 --> 01:54:16.360
is a great one for people to Peruse.

1870
01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:20.680
Do you have notes on stumbling on happiness on that's on there.
All right,
great.

1871
01:54:21.010 --> 01:54:21.880
So we will link to that.

1872
01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:23.440
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1873
01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:25.420
<v 2>Okay.
Last effectively last question.</v>

1874
01:54:25.421 --> 01:54:29.090
I'll give you one or two more and then I think we might have to sometime soon

1875
01:54:29.091 --> 01:54:31.030
and talk about around too if people are interested.

1876
01:54:31.031 --> 01:54:34.000
So if you'd like to hear more with Derrick,
please let me know.

1877
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:37.660
At t Ferris on the Twitter,
t,
f e R R,

1878
01:54:37.661 --> 01:54:40.000
I s s Niga lupins at sippers as well.

1879
01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:44.150
What advice would you give your 30 year old self and,

1880
01:54:44.290 --> 01:54:48.310
and place us if you would for where you were at 30 and what you were doing?

1881
01:54:49.090 --> 01:54:52.640
<v 3>Hmm.
At 30?
Well,
let's see.
I had just,</v>

1882
01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:56.240
I just started CD baby at 30,
but I think,
uh,

1883
01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:01.340
I think the biggest advice I would give to my younger self or more like

1884
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:04.130
knowledge learned,
like,
Hey,
younger self,

1885
01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.160
you should know this now is that women like sex know that until I was 40.

1886
01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:12.440
I think I didn't get that.
I think through,
you know,

1887
01:55:12.441 --> 01:55:16.730
like teenage movies or whatever,
we're kind of taught the opposite.
That's like,

1888
01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:19.490
you know,
men always want sex and women don't,

1889
01:55:19.491 --> 01:55:21.530
I don't know why the media portrays it like that,

1890
01:55:21.531 --> 01:55:24.050
but later I found out that's not true.
But I think the,

1891
01:55:24.051 --> 01:55:29.051
the more interesting answer is that my advice to my 30 year old self would be,

1892
01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:33.890
um,
don't be a donkey.
And so does that mean,

1893
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:35.150
well,

1894
01:55:35.150 --> 01:55:39.320
I meet a lot of 30 year olds that are trying to pursue many different directions

1895
01:55:39.321 --> 01:55:43.520
at once but not making progress in any right.
And then,
or,

1896
01:55:43.521 --> 01:55:46.860
or they get frustrated that the world wants them to pick one thing because they

1897
01:55:46.861 --> 01:55:49.050
want to do them all.
And I get a lot of this frustration like,

1898
01:55:49.051 --> 01:55:52.680
but I want to do this and that and this and that.
Why do I have to choose?

1899
01:55:52.681 --> 01:55:53.970
I don't know what to choose.

1900
01:55:54.510 --> 01:55:57.720
But the problem is if you're thinking short term,

1901
01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:02.760
then you're acting as if you don't do them all this week that they won't happen.

1902
01:56:03.330 --> 01:56:08.330
But I think the solution is to think longterm to realize that you can do one of

1903
01:56:08.941 --> 01:56:13.020
these things for a few years and then do another one for a few years.

1904
01:56:13.021 --> 01:56:13.854
And then another.

1905
01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:18.510
So what I mean about don't be a donkey is you've probably heard the fable about

1906
01:56:18.710 --> 01:56:20.190
think its burdens donkey,

1907
01:56:20.850 --> 01:56:25.850
who it's a fable about a donkey that is standing halfway in between a pile of

1908
01:56:26.431 --> 01:56:31.431
hay and a bucket of water and he just keeps looking left to the hay or right to

1909
01:56:32.041 --> 01:56:35.670
the water trying to decide,
hey,
or water,

1910
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:38.730
hay or water.
He's unable to decide.

1911
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.730
So he eventually falls over and dies of both hunger and thirst.

1912
01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:47.190
So the point is that a donkey can't think of the future.
If he did,

1913
01:56:47.191 --> 01:56:50.880
he'd clearly realized that he could just go first to drink the water and then go

1914
01:56:50.881 --> 01:56:51.714
eat the hay.

1915
01:56:52.350 --> 01:56:56.160
So my advice to my 30 year old self is don't be a donkey.

1916
01:56:56.550 --> 01:57:00.090
That you can do everything you want to do.

1917
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:05.280
You just need foresight and patients,
right?
So say like for somebody listening,

1918
01:57:05.281 --> 01:57:10.050
if you're 30 years old now and say you have like five different things you want

1919
01:57:10.051 --> 01:57:11.610
to pursue,
right?

1920
01:57:11.611 --> 01:57:15.480
Well then you can do each one of those for 10 years and you'll have them all

1921
01:57:15.481 --> 01:57:19.780
done by the time you're 80,
you're probably going to live to be 80.
So it's,

1922
01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:21.450
it's ridiculous too.

1923
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:24.810
I mean it sounds ridiculous to plan to the age of 80 when you're 30.
Right.

1924
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:27.360
But it's a fact that is probably coming,

1925
01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:29.310
so you might as well take advantage of it.

1926
01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:34.790
It's like use the future then that way you can fully focus on one direction at a

1927
01:57:34.801 --> 01:57:37.350
time without feeling,
you know,

1928
01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:41.910
conflicted or distracted because you know that you'll get to the others in the

1929
01:57:41.911 --> 01:57:42.744
future.

1930
01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:47.700
<v 2>And I think you could also just to build on that,
I agree.
I think most people,</v>

1931
01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:52.740
and this is not something I've thought up on my own,
but underestimate,

1932
01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:55.500
they overestimate what they can achieve in a day or a week.

1933
01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:57.360
So they've 20 items on their to do list,

1934
01:57:57.361 --> 01:58:01.620
but they underestimate what they could achieve in a year or even two years.

1935
01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:04.830
And yet you're the way that you're,
for instance,

1936
01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:09.510
if you look at a lot of what I've done,
much of which ended up being,

1937
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:14.850
uh,
a result of accidental discoveries,
but you're the,
the book career.

1938
01:58:15.210 --> 01:58:17.880
But then you had the angel investing started around 2007,

1939
01:58:17.881 --> 01:58:22.881
2008 and I treated that as a two year self self imposed MBA and it was like,

1940
01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:23.700
okay,

1941
01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:27.540
I want to try this and really focus on it for two years and I'm not going to

1942
01:58:27.541 --> 01:58:30.090
expect to have any financial return,

1943
01:58:30.091 --> 01:58:33.810
but just as an Mba I'm going to sink this amount of cost into it.
Uh,

1944
01:58:33.811 --> 01:58:34.750
which was identical,

1945
01:58:34.751 --> 01:58:39.751
the Stanford Graduate School of business at the time and assume that the network

1946
01:58:39.781 --> 01:58:44.050
and relationships and lessons I would learn to be worth that two years.

1947
01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:48.520
And just viewing them as to your experiments.

1948
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:51.910
Uh,
which I did with the TV also,

1949
01:58:51.911 --> 01:58:54.280
which did not turn out as ideally as I would've liked.

1950
01:58:54.281 --> 01:58:57.940
Although I though very proud of,
you know,
the Tim Ferriss experiment podcast.

1951
01:58:57.941 --> 01:59:00.550
Same thing,
right?
It wasn't a three year commitment,

1952
01:59:00.551 --> 01:59:04.510
but it was also not a one day or one week commitment.
It was like,
okay,

1953
01:59:04.511 --> 01:59:07.060
I'm going to do this for at least six episodes.

1954
01:59:07.061 --> 01:59:11.770
Maybe it takes me six months and then I'll correct course at that point.
But uh,

1955
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:13.223
yeah,
you do.

1956
01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:17.890
I think a lot of 30 year olds feel pressured or younger or older for that matter

1957
01:59:17.891 --> 01:59:20.770
to pursue many,

1958
01:59:20.771 --> 01:59:25.771
many things in parallel when if you were just a tweak that slightly and make

1959
01:59:26.951 --> 01:59:28.900
them cereal,
the results would be much better.

1960
01:59:29.170 --> 01:59:33.760
<v 3>Yeah,
that's a really hard lesson to learn.
We can even say it right now,
but uh,</v>

1961
01:59:33.770 --> 01:59:36.570
it's,
it's really tough.
I even find that now.
Yeah.

1962
01:59:37.380 --> 01:59:39.450
<v 2>Yeah.
It's a constant challenge.
Uh,</v>

1963
01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:42.450
the five minute journal I find very helpful.

1964
01:59:42.451 --> 01:59:45.340
I've mentioned this before to people,
but so I won't Belabor the point,
but um,

1965
01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:48.240
people can check that out if they want it to go or the pomodoro technique also

1966
01:59:48.241 --> 01:59:51.270
really helpful.
Uh,
okay.

1967
01:59:51.271 --> 01:59:55.950
We are going to wrap this first conversation up for,

1968
01:59:56.370 --> 01:59:57.450
for our dear public,

1969
01:59:57.480 --> 02:00:02.480
but do you have any asks or requests of my audience before we close up?

1970
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:07.610
<v 3>Not really.
I mean,
honestly,
the main reason I do interviews like this,</v>

1971
02:00:07.611 --> 02:00:09.530
like public ones instead of you and I just,
you know,

1972
02:00:09.710 --> 02:00:11.660
sitting on the phone and shooting the shit is that,

1973
02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:14.750
is that I really like the people that I meet through them,

1974
02:00:14.751 --> 02:00:18.410
like the kind of people that would listen to hours into this conversation or my

1975
02:00:18.411 --> 02:00:23.030
kind of people.
So I usually just tell people,
just email me.
Um,
Derek sivers.org.

1976
02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:25.650
I read them,
I kind of enjoy putting aside a little time each day to,

1977
02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:28.450
to read emails and I answer every single one.
Um,

1978
02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:32.000
because I said hell yeah or no to the rest of my life,
so I've got time to do it.

1979
02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:33.830
So yeah,
that's it.

1980
02:00:33.831 --> 02:00:36.080
Just feel free to email me if you have any questions or anything.

1981
02:00:36.110 --> 02:00:36.943
We're just to say hi.

1982
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.730
<v 2>Awesome.
And uh,
for those people who do not want to wait for round two,
uh,</v>

1983
02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:46.120
Derek,
you're hilarious.
I put out a tweet recently,
which was,

1984
02:00:46.121 --> 02:00:50.390
what should I ask?
What would you like me to ask at Sivers?
Uh,

1985
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:52.900
I'm going to be interviewing him soon and

1986
02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:59.350
I couldn't ask any of them because you went online and basically answered all of

1987
02:00:59.351 --> 02:01:01.720
them on Twitter.

1988
02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:04.390
So if you search at t Ferris,

1989
02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:09.930
two r's to us as an at silver as you will see,
or you could just look at,
um,

1990
02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:13.290
at my tweet and the various responses and then Derek's responses,

1991
02:01:13.291 --> 02:01:16.200
it's still almost all of them.
Uh,
you can get a,
um,

1992
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:19.730
an encore performance and uh,

1993
02:01:19.770 --> 02:01:22.120
and it just had the chance I had the feeling we probably weren't going to get to

1994
02:01:22.121 --> 02:01:25.630
all of those questions so you know better to answer them with a tiny punch line.

1995
02:01:25.690 --> 02:01:30.220
Oh yeah,
yeah.
No,
no.
Fantastic.
Well,

1996
02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:34.630
Derek,
as always,
so much fun to jam,

1997
02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:39.660
we need to spend more time in person soon and thanks so much for taking the

1998
02:01:40.221 --> 02:01:43.550
time.
Of course.
Thanks.
All right.
And everybody listening,

1999
02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:46.660
thank you all for listening.
We're done.

2000
02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:50.990
Redundancy of department redundancy and uh,
he,

2001
02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:53.250
the show notes as always.
Uh,

2004
02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:02.053
Derek.

2005
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:10.840
<v 1>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

2006
02:02:11.170 --> 02:02:13.810
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2007
02:02:14.110 --> 02:02:17.110
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2008
02:02:17.111 --> 02:02:21.250
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

2009
02:02:21.251 --> 02:02:24.570
little morsel of fun before the weekend and five bullet Fridays,

2010
02:02:24.571 --> 02:02:29.140
a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

2011
02:02:29.141 --> 02:02:30.460
pondering over the week.

2012
02:02:30.670 --> 02:02:33.430
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2013
02:02:33.431 --> 02:02:36.880
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2014
02:02:36.881 --> 02:02:41.200
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

2015
02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:46.500
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2016
02:02:47.170 --> 02:02:49.870
close friends,
for instance.
And it's very short.

2017
02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:54.940
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

2018
02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.160
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2019
02:02:57.430 --> 02:03:02.380
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour workweek.com all spelled out

2022
02:03:10.590 --> 02:03:11.710
<v 0>[inaudible] this episode</v>

2023
02:03:11.710 --> 02:03:15.970
<v 1>is brought to you by me undies.
If I'm not going commando,
I'm in the Andes.</v>

2024
02:03:15.971 --> 02:03:19.360
I have been testing these underwear for three to four months now,

2025
02:03:19.570 --> 02:03:21.580
pretty much every day and in fact,

2026
02:03:21.581 --> 02:03:26.020
throughout bunch of my other underwear this morning and on the road in the

2027
02:03:26.021 --> 02:03:30.190
house,
they are extremely comfortable.
They look good,
feel good.

2028
02:03:30.460 --> 02:03:32.110
They are made of micro modal,

2029
02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:35.170
two times softer than cotton and scientifically tested using the call.

2030
02:03:35.171 --> 02:03:37.930
Bottom method sounds very fancy of course,

2031
02:03:38.260 --> 02:03:41.830
and I get a lot of compliments from ladies for these.
You don't get diaper butt,

2032
02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:43.720
you don't get the tired elastic band.

2033
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:48.730
They look great and they have underwear for both men and women.

2034
02:03:48.731 --> 02:03:52.390
Check out [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim and you can see everything that

2035
02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:55.570
I've been wearing.
They're ridiculous.
The sublime,
everything in between,

2036
02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:58.180
including my favorite,
which is called out.

2037
02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:01.690
And I would be remiss if I didn't mention their lounge pants.

2038
02:04:01.690 --> 02:04:05.440
This is a new thing and I've been wearing their lounge pants when I record

2039
02:04:05.441 --> 02:04:06.250
podcast.

2040
02:04:06.250 --> 02:04:09.520
I've been wearing them out and about when I'm walking the dog meeting people for

2041
02:04:09.521 --> 02:04:13.390
coffee and they are extremely comfortable.

2042
02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:16.690
They're made from the same material as the underwear,
but some of them,

2043
02:04:16.691 --> 02:04:17.291
like the blue ones,

2044
02:04:17.291 --> 02:04:22.291
I have have pockets so you can walk about without seeming like you're off of

2045
02:04:22.631 --> 02:04:26.110
your meds and completely crazy.
So that is awesome.

2046
02:04:26.290 --> 02:04:28.750
And if you're not happy with the first pair you try on,

2047
02:04:28.751 --> 02:04:30.040
I assume that first of the underwear,

2048
02:04:30.250 --> 02:04:32.890
they'll refund you completely and you can keep the pair you tried on for free.

2049
02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:34.120
But if you're that kind of person,

2050
02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:36.790
you should be ashamed because that's disgusting.
Uh,

2051
02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:39.690
[inaudible] dot com slash Tim check it out.

2052
02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:45.300
This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.

2053
02:04:45.690 --> 02:04:50.070
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way.
Set it and forget it.

2054
02:04:50.071 --> 02:04:54.450
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

2055
02:04:54.451 --> 02:04:55.200
investors.

2056
02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:58.920
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

2057
02:04:58.921 --> 02:05:01.890
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

2058
02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:03.270
some of my very good friends,

2059
02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:06.480
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

2060
02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:09.540
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

2061
02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:13.380
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy,

2062
02:05:13.381 --> 02:05:15.810
but only pay pennies on the dollar for them,

2063
02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:19.560
and this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

2064
02:05:19.561 --> 02:05:22.290
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

2065
02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:27.450
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

2066
02:05:27.451 --> 02:05:28.201
assessment quiz,

2067
02:05:28.201 --> 02:05:32.100
which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the

2068
02:05:32.101 --> 02:05:35.040
portfolio they'd put you in.
And if you just want to take their advice,

2069
02:05:35.250 --> 02:05:38.430
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

2070
02:05:38.431 --> 02:05:40.290
you can set it and forget it.
Here's why.

2071
02:05:40.650 --> 02:05:44.640
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

2072
02:05:44.641 --> 02:05:48.030
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't.

2073
02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:50.700
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

2074
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:54.390
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax

2075
02:05:54.391 --> 02:05:56.550
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

2076
02:05:56.700 --> 02:06:01.020
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

2077
02:06:01.021 --> 02:06:04.740
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

2078
02:06:04.741 --> 02:06:07.350
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

2079
02:06:07.351 --> 02:06:11.520
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

2080
02:06:11.521 --> 02:06:13.080
impossible right off the bat,

2081
02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:15.570
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

2082
02:06:15.571 --> 02:06:20.571
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

2083
02:06:21.211 --> 02:06:23.250
free.
If you use my link,

2084
02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:27.600
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that is less than $5 a month to invest a

2085
02:06:27.601 --> 02:06:31.680
$30,000 account for instance.
Now,
normally when I have a sponsor on this show,

2086
02:06:31.681 --> 02:06:35.220
it's because I use them and recommend them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

2087
02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:39.510
I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

2088
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:43.770
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of SCC regulations,

2089
02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:47.460
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

2090
02:06:47.461 --> 02:06:50.250
So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast,

2091
02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:54.390
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

2092
02:06:54.391 --> 02:06:58.230
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

2093
02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:01.320
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

2094
02:07:01.530 --> 02:07:04.860
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

2095
02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:08.730
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account.

2096
02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:11.760
But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

2097
