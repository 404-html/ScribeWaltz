WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.703
Okay.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.790
<v 0>Here we are Super Training Gym,</v>

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.830
Mark Smelly Bell and we are going to take a little tour showing them around the

4
00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:14.870
place,
show them around the gym.
Thanks for having us.

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.670
This is one of my favorite gems.

6
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.410
I am excited to look at all the toys that you have here.
Also,
first off,

7
00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:25.310
what on earth are these things?
Yeah.
This guy right here is called the triad.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.340
Everything we have in the gym is a unique,

9
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:30.570
everything we have in the gym is a little different.
Uh,

10
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.220
we like to use thick fat handles on stuff to increase.

11
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:37.820
Our grip is a power lifting gym and we need to have a good strong grip.

12
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:42.440
So this guy here has got different grips on it.
You can do overhead work with it.

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.350
You can even just do a farmer's walk with it,

14
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.780
just walk with it and it's going to really test your grip a lot.

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.890
The bringing up here,

16
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.850
you kind of overhead press it was kind of Nice about it is with the weight

17
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:56.220
distribution being back in here,
it's kind of a little bit like a kettle bell.

18
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:59.300
It's pushing the elbow inward a little bit.
And as you press it up,

19
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.910
you've got to kind of press it up the same way you would press a kettle bell,

20
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.070
the waves just to distribute it a little differently.

21
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:06.890
So this gives you that much variance.

22
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.630
Everything we have and here's just a little bit different and yeah,
of course,

23
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.180
probably not going to see this and her local curves,
gym dumbbells up to one 50.

24
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.840
And what some add this.
This is also something I haven't really seen before.

25
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:25.550
And yet you have a few of these around the gym.
What is the purpose of this?
Uh,

26
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.690
just to,
uh,
create kind of an unstable surface.
Uh,

27
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:33.320
whenever you have some instability it's going to fire some different muscles.

28
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:35.420
And so we,
uh,
use stuff like this,

29
00:01:35.421 --> 00:01:39.260
we also use a bamboo bar where we'll hook some bands around the bark and kind of

30
00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:40.094
show you that too,

31
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.430
but it will create some instability and it's making all the little muscles fire.

32
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.580
And,
uh,
if we continue our tour here,

33
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.630
you have the old school hammer strength and use that for some of the

34
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:53.030
bodybuilding,
right?
It's of course,
I remember going to a,

35
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.730
what was the name of the gym?
I think it was strong island.

36
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:59.990
Jim with Kenny licenser when back in the day he had hammer strength machines

37
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:04.110
everywhere.
All purple.
That's a long story.
It was great.
Yeah.
Why?
Yeah.

38
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.880
Uh,
of course you have slingshots,

39
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.750
you have a lot of slingshots slingshots and he shares.

40
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.130
Can you show how that fits on the human body?

41
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.050
I can if I have one large enough for myself here.
Oh yeah.

42
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:22.460
This one will work.
So sling shot my product that I invented years ago.

43
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:26.780
It's got two patents on it.
It's a supportive upper body devices.
Very simple.

44
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:29.310
You just slide it up over your arms,
feels like,

45
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.650
does it fit your arms like Garrett,
but mine.

46
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.990
Slide it up over the arms and then once you're in there,

47
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.910
you're ready for some pushups.
Bench press dips.

48
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.050
So the slingshot actually kind of works as what I like to call double muscle.

49
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.210
And what I mean by that is,
as the product begins to stretch and lengthen,

50
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.350
so are your muscles,

51
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:57.770
your muscles are stretching and laughing as you're bringing the weights down.

52
00:02:57.771 --> 00:02:59.590
When you're in the east centric portion,
the lift,

53
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.240
as you move on to the concentric portion of the lift,

54
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.340
you're getting some of the elastic properties of the slingshot is helping guide

55
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:10.240
your muscles back into kind of a contracted position as you head back towards

56
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:12.610
the top,
helps take pressure off your shoulders,

57
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.780
how take pressure off your elbows allows you to handle more weight for more reps

58
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:21.100
and sets in your workout.
And what are just as context,
what are some of your,

59
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.120
what are your best competition lifts in powerlifting?
So,
uh,

60
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:29.650
years ago I competed in,
in um,
geared powerlifting wearing,
you know,

61
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.510
squat suits and stuff like that and a bench shirts.
I did 854 pound bench press,

62
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.910
380 squat and a 766 pound deadlift.
And here at the gym,

63
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.140
obviously you have everything you would need for bench press,

64
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.380
everything you need for deadlifts,
everything you need for squat.
Uh,

65
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.530
the training split I guess is very similar to a different west side.

66
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.680
Who says some of it,
some of it is a little bit west,

67
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.560
west side ish in the fact that we like to change things up quite a bit here.
Um,

68
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.290
but we also follow a little bit of a periodization principle as well.
We're,

69
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.150
we'll just simply use a little bit more weight from one week to the next.
And uh,

70
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.050
but you have one primary,
uh,
what,
what is,
what is your,

71
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.700
what is your,

72
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.020
your current schedule look like on a weekly basis in terms of primary lift and

73
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.660
on a weekly basis,
we have Tuesday,
Thursday,

74
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.320
Saturday are kind of the main training days,
Sundays,
like an assistance day,

75
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.190
basically getting in whatever it is that you,
uh,
may have missed during the week.

76
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.960
Tuesday is dead lifting and then any exercise that will help bring up the

77
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.920
deadlift.
It could be an ab movement,
it could be a movement for the glutes,

78
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.750
it could be movements for the hamstrings.

79
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:43.480
Whatever you feel is going to bring up your deadlift,
even grip work.

80
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.330
Thursday is all bench pressing.
And then it's going to be the main movement.

81
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.070
It's going to be some form of a bench press.

82
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.520
And then all the movements after that are all things that are going to help

83
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.540
improve the bench press.
So that could,
that could be a wide range of things.

84
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:03.541
You got some tricep movements and he sorta tricep extension any further pressing

85
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:06.970
would help even overhead pressing and help the actual bench press itself.

86
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.330
And then obviously thickening of the back and making your back bigger and making

87
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:14.350
your back stronger can help a lot as well because your back is what we're lying

88
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:19.270
on and we lie on the bench,
the shelf,
it's the stabilizer to everything and uh,

89
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.020
and then squat.
And then Saturday is our squat day.
Um,

90
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.160
and then again all the assistants exercises to everything.
After that,

91
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:27.994
it's going to be all,

92
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.360
all movements that are going to help increase the strength of the squat.

93
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.141
And again,

94
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:35.230
Sunday is kind of anything that you missed where the week or anything you want

95
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:39.550
to Polish up.
Maybe you have a lagging muscle group,
maybe you conditioning sucks.

96
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:43.090
So you might go outside,
push the prowler,
push a sled or something like that.

97
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.700
V The vomit.
Rocket Prowler.
So let's,
let's keep moving here.
Other,

98
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.370
these bench presses are a lot wider and a lot thicker.
Everything in this gym is,

99
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:56.260
is specialized field is barbell.
Couldn't fill that bar.

100
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.010
Cool.
Very rough.
It's,
it's like a cheese grater.
Grater.

101
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.880
Yeah.
What's,
I mean what type of a test of these myths?
The wife,

102
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:12.620
he loves that you're,
you're gentle caressing hands.
Gross.
What's,
uh,

103
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.480
what type of bench is this?
What does the manufacturer,

104
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.060
yeah,
this,
this uh,
particular bench came from uh,

105
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.990
elite fts.com and they make a wider,
uh,

106
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.990
bench so that way your shoulders aren't off the bench.

107
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.100
And then also the pad is very thick so you can really sink into it and drive

108
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:35.090
into it.
A lot of times a bench press becomes very unsafe when you're,

109
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.530
if you press off of a board rather than like a nice thick pad because your,

110
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:44.510
your Scapula is moving and sliding and gliding around in the shoulder socket as

111
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:48.260
you're pressing and you're going to need a nice soft pad two to help be able to

112
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:51.350
pick up the phone.
And these are four bands.
Yep.
That's the hook.

113
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:54.250
Some bands in there.
You take the band and you put it up here and you're,

114
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.910
you're good to go on that.
What is this for?
What is,
what does this hold?

115
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.680
Oh,
that's for a,
that's a safety safety support,
which I got it.

116
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.750
You see how much we care about that?
We don't have it in there.

117
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.400
So that would be the equivalent of like a power rack pole that would prevent it

118
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:12.890
from dropping under the chest.
Correct.
Got It.
Yeah.

119
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.740
The bench down at the end has one you can see.
Oh,
right,
right,
right.

120
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.080
I got it.
So if you get stuck in your weakest range of motion,

121
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.730
you can pop it up onto this.
Yeah,

122
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:25.370
you can just drop it right there and they're good to go hot it.
Got It.

123
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.260
What is this?
Oh,
uh,

124
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.750
you shouldn't ask the pitch shark.
Okay.
There's a lesson,

125
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.430
a Tim Ferriss.
He's going to learn.
Oh boy.

126
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.300
Don't ask questions unless you want to be put to work.

127
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.240
So we're going to move some of this stuff out of the way.
Okay.

128
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.760
And we're going to make Tim Ferriss squat.
All right.
Fuck it.

129
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.540
And do all this even when we don't even care how much weight's on there.
Yeah,

130
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.720
that's,
that's well,
I do care.
I don't know way.
There's,

131
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:55.730
there's some of that on there.
Hold on.
Keep it later.
Too much.
A little too much.

132
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.520
We don't want to blog his spine or his kneecap.
No,
that'd be,
that'd be terrible.

133
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.110
This one fleet would probably be good.
All right,

134
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.940
so just so we're clear,
I have no idea what this machine is.
This is a belt squat.

135
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.460
He's on like a pair of undies.
Giant pair of undies.
Step into it.
There you go.

136
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.370
The belt goes in the back there.
It's changed those in the front.

137
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.230
You're going to hook the hook onto here and my standing stand on there

138
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.630
when you sit here on,
on the furthest most portion here.
Yeah.

139
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:31.040
Wherever you feel like putting it.

140
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.180
When you stand up it's going to release from here and I'll go ahead and do some

141
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.430
squats.
Uh,

142
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.250
the advantage of this exercise is the weight's not on your back.

143
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.860
So upper body mobility and you can also move in and use this.

144
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.750
You can hang on there.
And that's actually the way I use it.
Quite odd is this.

145
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.640
Oh that's the catch.
Yeah.
This is to to finish.
Yup.
Um,

146
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.710
but there's a couple advantages going on here.

147
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.590
This is actually pulling you down towards the ground and for some people that

148
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:00.420
struggle with getting depth in the squat,

149
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.170
this piece of equipment can help solve a lot of problems because it's literally

150
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.650
pulling you down towards the ground.
Whereas a regular squat,

151
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:09.120
it's only kind of pushing you down towards,

152
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:12.820
you can see it being very helpful for working on mobility in the ankles to in a

153
00:09:12.821 --> 00:09:14.070
way mobility in the ankles.

154
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:16.350
It's going to build up a lot of strength around the kneecap,

155
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.440
which is what we need.
Hmm.

156
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.260
Let's try a couple of reps in [inaudible] five and around.

157
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.250
This can feel your quads.
This thing is absolutely devastating.

158
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.470
If tit hat Tim had longer time to spend here,
I just,

159
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.480
I would chain him to the rack and I just make him stay here all day.
All right.

160
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.480
All right.
That's good.
There we go.
Good.

161
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.140
There you go.
You're out of there.
It's a cool device.

162
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.870
Now his legs will be shaking the rest of the world.

163
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.320
Thank God I'm wearing pants or he'd see my legs trembling

164
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.480
Bambi out on the ice.
I just an old school lat pull down.

165
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:59.250
This actually a hunk of dinosaur equipment has been with super training gym from

166
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:03.030
the very beginning,
so it's something that I'll,
I'll probably always have.

167
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.600
So this,
I think it was what you're talking about earlier.
Oh,
hold on.

168
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.411
You get that one.

169
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:12.411
I'll get this one and then we'll jabs you run from the other side of that.

170
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:15.510
This is the,
this is the American glide here.
Just portion of the program,
right?

171
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.110
You go down that way and I'll run and we'll meet in the middle.
Ready?

172
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.010
I think I'm going to fail on the body weight punching above my weight class.

173
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.860
Yeah.
So this guy here is,
um,
this is a bamboo bar.
Uh,

174
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.320
basically it's made out of like a,
almost like a fiberglass type material band.

175
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:35.550
bill.com.
Okay.
EMACS,
emacs.
When we put this on the,

176
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:38.460
on the bench press and we booked some kettle bells to it,

177
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.380
it causes a very chaotic style of bench pressing.
The bar bends a lot.

178
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:46.000
So you'd have bands that are then attached to the Kettlebell.

179
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:50.700
We should hook it up.
Let's look it up.
That's not good.
It all right.

180
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:53.280
Here we go.
So we're going to take a band.
Yup.

181
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.880
And we're going to loop it through I kettlebell somewhere.
Yep.

182
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.580
Going to go like this.
Here we've got the band like Yay.
Okay.

183
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.480
And now we're just going to put it through a kettle bell.

184
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.630
Let's grab something juicy.
Huh?
Uh,

185
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.460
since he said I'm going to demonstrate.
Yup.
I'll go something light.

186
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.020
Now this will still be hard.
So you've got gotta.
Okay.
So

187
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.040
I'll kind of demo it one more time real quick so you can kind of see how it's

188
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:23.874
done.

189
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.220
And don't load that on there yet because the thing has no weight to it.
Yes,

190
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.030
I can have,

191
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:35.030
here's the band she traditional style exercise band on a folder and half Babu.

192
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.480
And then we're going to take this guy and we're going to put it right there.
Here

193
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.560
think I'm doing this right.
Yep.

194
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.220
And then need to put it on at the same time like this so you don't kill each

195
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:51.990
other.
Yep.
Okay.
Hold on a sec.

196
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.960
<v 2>Right here.
Yup.
Right there.
Yup.</v>

197
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.070
<v 0>And so you can see,
uh,
you know,</v>

198
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.940
you can see this already kind of hanging through here right now.

199
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.990
I loaded this thing up before with about 300 pounds or 50 pounds or so,

200
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.930
and it really starts to band and really starts to get pretty crazy.

201
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.360
<v 2>Do a little bit of this.</v>

202
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.100
<v 0>They should all die.
This,
uh,
you absolutely,</v>

203
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.260
positively,
always need a spotter for,
I don't,

204
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.740
don't think I'm going to be a much healthier,
but yeah.
Okay.
One,
two,
three up.

205
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.600
There we go.
All.
I got it so you can see the instability already.

206
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.820
With a newer lifter,
there'll be really shaking and trembling all over the place,

207
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.490
but you can see how the harder that you press it,

208
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.870
the more resistance that wants to give you a really starts to go all over it

209
00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:55.720
because they start,
there's more agitation of the kettlebells.
Yup.

210
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.480
And you really want to try to squeeze the kettle bell.

211
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.020
You want to try to have your legs stay tight,
like if your legs are loose,

212
00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.560
then everything else gets loosey Goosey and you start to shake a lot.

213
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.960
Do you want everything to be locked in?
Everything can be tight.

214
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.270
We'll find a good pressing motion that you can handle and you try to stay in

215
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:18.050
that groove.
We do this exercise,

216
00:13:18.051 --> 00:13:20.510
we'll do sets of 20 reps or so,

217
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.290
sometimes 30 reps depending on a workout.

218
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:27.680
This is something I do pretty much on a weekly basis.
I'll do this every,

219
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:31.070
every Sunday.
Every Thursday is my heavy lifting,

220
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.390
and then every Sunday is my lighter lifting where I'll do stuff like this.
Cool.

221
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.590
I'll try it.
I think I'll continue the tour.
All right.

222
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.950
Uh,
let's,
let's take a look at some of the,
the other equipment here.

223
00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:49.460
So this I think will be recognizable folks.
45 degree back.
Right now,

224
00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:52.370
this looks a lot wider than the platforms.

225
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.860
I would see it in a normal commercial gym.
Why is that?

226
00:13:54.861 --> 00:13:56.980
So that you can do wider stance?
Yeah,
exactly.

227
00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.320
You just go out wider and you can target different areas of your butt and your

228
00:14:00.321 --> 00:14:04.120
hamstrings.
Um,
we in here a lot of times with power lifting,

229
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.580
squat is done with a wider than shoulder width stance.

230
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:12.740
And so we're trying to get wider than shoulder width stance on ab movements,

231
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.270
on lower back movements,
on any other movement that we can find.
What does,

232
00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.830
so how would you squat?
What does the technique look like?

233
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.810
A generally for a competition lifts.

234
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.290
So before there was any power thing,

235
00:14:24.291 --> 00:14:26.390
gear before there's any suits or anything like that,

236
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.140
lifters started kind of recognizing,
well,
if I go out wide,

237
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:35.140
if you go out wide with me here,
we're going to squat together,
Tim Ferris.

238
00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.013
Alright.

239
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.430
And if you point your toes straight ahead and you begin to swat down,

240
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.940
you'll kind of feel your hips almost lock up right away.

241
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.910
And the wider that you go in the street are ahead that you go,

242
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.620
the more locked up you are.

243
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.810
So lifters from years ago recognize this and almost created so much internal

244
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:57.050
pressure or they needed 400 pounds,
500 pounds from them,

245
00:14:57.051 --> 00:14:58.130
they'll even break parallel.

246
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.930
So that's a little excessive going that wide and it may not be manageable.

247
00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:05.330
So when we bring the stance in a little bit,

248
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.300
but we're still getting some of that tension just outside of shoulder width,

249
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.470
just outside shoulder width.

250
00:15:09.471 --> 00:15:12.830
And we're also going to point the toes out at least a little bit because we want

251
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:16.670
the hips to have at least some freedom now that a barbell on my back without a

252
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:18.770
warmup,
it's hard for me to really move the way I should,

253
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.600
but all I'm trying to do,

254
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.350
I'm trying to bring my upper body through my lower body.

255
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.120
I don't need to push back like this.
I don't need to lean forward like this.

256
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.780
All I needed to have happened is my hips to move a lot.

257
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.700
My hips need to move downward.

258
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.410
Continue in one continuous motion for the entire time.
So my feet,

259
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.220
you want to get your feet connected to the ground.

260
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.830
You want to be grounded firmly into the ground.

261
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.650
These shoes are not ideal for this cause.
You can see I'm rolling out.

262
00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:52.370
Where do you want to flatter shoe,
but as I go to descend,

263
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.530
I'm opening up through the groin and shoving the knees forward and starting to

264
00:15:57.531 --> 00:16:01.490
kind of push my head and shoulders back a little bit and I'll come back up for

265
00:16:01.491 --> 00:16:04.220
me in warmups.
I'll stay in this range here.

266
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:08.810
I'm not concerned about setting some sort of world records for squat depth.

267
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.530
I worry about that as I warm up as I handle more weight.

268
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:15.140
But the squatch be very efficient.
All you're trying to do,

269
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.400
keep your stomach tight and have your hips move in one continuous motion

270
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.230
downward,
but you don't want to get here and go like this,
right?

271
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.060
Because then your hips in getting lower.

272
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.710
It's all one continuous motion we're trying to get through here.
Got It.

273
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.340
And you study that really struggle.
I can show you a quick tip.

274
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.940
This just works as a counterbalance.

275
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.570
He just saw where my range of motion was limited to the second ago.

276
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:47.410
So I'm here and I'm kind of getting stuck here.
Yep.
All right.

277
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.810
Take this guy here.
This is our counterbalance.

278
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.200
That's our kettle bell and we're going to go here and as we get here,

279
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:02.160
we can squat down lower because we have a counterbalance weight,
right?

280
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.490
That will allow us to get a little lower.

281
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:07.850
So that'll act as a stretch and he can do that.

282
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.690
You don't need a Kettlebell for it can use a 25 pound plate.
Yeah,

283
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.100
same 10 pound plate.

284
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.670
A lot of people noticed that I went to Albert Squat kettlebells.
Exactly.

285
00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:18.320
Doing a pistols and things like that.

286
00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:21.890
Also very helpful to have the kind of balance.
Uh,
what about these right here?

287
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.780
These are our items that uh,
you know,

288
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.030
aside from being useful for resting your coffee on this,
what is this?

289
00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:32.570
This guy hears the reverse hyper extension machine.

290
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.770
It's a way to train your lower back without loading it up with a barbell.

291
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.210
Um,

292
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:43.210
it's a great for restoration help to pump blood into lower back.

293
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.661
Um,

294
00:17:44.661 --> 00:17:49.661
and it's also going to gently stretch the spine with each motion that you and a,

295
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:52.050
so you're,
I'm not going to necessarily do this,

296
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:57.051
but the basic idea is you getting up like so looping in and then lifting the

297
00:17:58.441 --> 00:17:59.460
weight like sets,
right.

298
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:01.830
And you can see how much activation he's getting off his bike.

299
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.070
He's really flexing hard.
It's going to get your glutes,

300
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.040
your hamstrings and your lower back.
And like I said,

301
00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:11.760
it's going to gently stretch your spine for those of you as lower back injuries.

302
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:15.570
This is a great piece.
And uh,
it was this reasonably,

303
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.660
was it created or just popularized by,

304
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:22.690
by Louie Louie Simmons is the patent holder of the [inaudible] where we covered

305
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:26.670
this in the podcast we did together where routine,
it's an 800 pound bench press.

306
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.220
Thousand pounds squad.
Yeah.
Everyday occurrence.
Yeah.
And they,
they,

307
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.970
and they don't have a history of lower back issues in our gym.

308
00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:35.490
And that's a testament to this product here.
Very cool.

309
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:40.590
Sell solar as a Ghd glute ham developer.

310
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.600
Uh,
but you can also do sit ups off of it.
You can do,
uh,

311
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.890
a basically like a hamstring curl off,

312
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.880
similar to a hyper extension,

313
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:55.860
but the plane of your legs is level is that there is,
yeah.
Now,

314
00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.390
just pro tip for people who are thinking about doing an ab work on these.
Uh,

315
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.440
so you may have or may not have heard the term of Rhabdo rubbed on my license.

316
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:09.000
So if you suddenly decide as a weekend warrior,
I've never done crossfit before,

317
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:13.140
let me do a bunch of Ab hyper extension exercises on this.

318
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:15.900
You may end up in the hospital,
uh,

319
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.050
because your kidneys might not like the amount of muscular damage you do.

320
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.290
So take it slow folks.
Take it slow.
Yeah,
moving too fast,

321
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.140
moving too fast on any of the movements that are going to actually kind of

322
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:28.500
stretch you,
uh,
is,
is a dangerous proposition.

323
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.430
Take your time with the exercises that,
anything that's new that you ever try,

324
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.100
take your time with it.
Even the amount of weight that you're moving,

325
00:19:35.101 --> 00:19:37.650
amount of weight you're lifting.
Really tried to take your time with it.

326
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.570
You don't want to get hurt and this is a weighted sled.
Yeah,

327
00:19:42.571 --> 00:19:44.310
just a simple sled with a rope on it.

328
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.090
You can pick up the straps here and you can just take her for a stroll.

329
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:53.490
You just take it for a walk.
You can walk backwards with it.
If you walk,

330
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.120
I'll just walk with it a little bit just to show you,
you walk backwards with it,

331
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.370
it's going to work.
Your quads
walked backwards in your work,
your quads.

332
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.150
He walked forward with it and it's going to work.

333
00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:08.190
Your hamstrings and your button.
You can kind of going here,

334
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.290
very simple piece of equipment works your calves where it's your ankles works,

335
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.850
works your whole posterior chain.
You can also do rowing motions with it.

336
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.990
You can do explosive rowing motions with it too,
which is kind of Nice.

337
00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:28.890
You can kind of roll like this,
work your upper back where you can kind of go

338
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.430
whatever way,
whatever way you want.

339
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.660
You can turn the other way and bench press with it as well.
Um,

340
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:41.820
this is one of my favorite pieces of equipment.
Um,
I liked to do,

341
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:48.340
I used to very often but not as much anymore should get my big butt back out

342
00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:49.750
here to do more of this.
But uh,

343
00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:54.370
you should just set my clock for about a half an hour and I'd walk forward and

344
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:57.760
backwards with it and then I would throw it and then I would push it and I would

345
00:20:57.761 --> 00:21:00.940
just do it until the 30 minutes was up.
That's a decent period of time.

346
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:04.290
That's like ultra endurance or power lifters keep moving him.
Nothing.

347
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:09.100
If you had to choose between the weight sled or the Prowler,

348
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.520
which would you choose a wise and for people who are curious,
the prowler,

349
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.410
if you could imagine a couple of cars coming up to about here and you hold onto

350
00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:21.310
it and push it.
This guy here is a prowler right here,
triangular piece.

351
00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:23.230
So a couple of different variations of it,

352
00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:26.890
but you can hold on to this and push it around.

353
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.160
You're actually physically kind of pushing it with your hands.
If you were,

354
00:21:30.161 --> 00:21:32.770
if you had to choose one or the other,
which would you choose?

355
00:21:32.771 --> 00:21:36.970
And I like the sled a little bit better because a,
the sled is usually much,

356
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:40.360
much cheaper.
Um,
if you want to be real cheap about it.

357
00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:43.900
And my ability to even get somebody locally to make that for a very inexpensive

358
00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:48.850
price.
Um,
but I liked the,
the ability to do so many different things off.

359
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.780
Whereas with the prowler you're really just pushing it and that's Kinda all you

360
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:55.240
can do this.
You can push it,
you can bench with it,

361
00:21:55.241 --> 00:21:59.530
you can roll with it and walk forward or backwards with it.
Very cool.
All right.

362
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.480
Let's see what else we have said.
This is another one.

363
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.720
This is called the back of the pack.
It's a basically a good morning machine.

364
00:22:04.721 --> 00:22:07.840
This pad right here,
it goes on your lower,
it goes on your upper back,

365
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.600
got up near your neck and you,

366
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:15.120
you get in there and you kind of just do this motion here.
Um,

367
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.370
the difference between a weak person and a strong person is the lower back.

368
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.160
The stronger your lower back is a stronger that you become.

369
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.370
Let me ask a silly question.
What is the value of the good morning?

370
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:28.270
If you're already doing dead lifts and squats,

371
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.880
it's just a different range of motion.
Just a different option,

372
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:35.290
but you're 100% correct.
You could possibly be overdoing it and uh,

373
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.100
and maybe uh,
two to a detriment of,

374
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.280
of doing too much lower backwards if you're already squatting and dead lifting

375
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.550
him.
Where are they?

376
00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:46.230
Good morning comes in really handy is to replace something like the dead lift

377
00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:50.620
for a few weeks or to do a little bit of assistance work on occasion again in a

378
00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:52.240
little bit more reps,

379
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.450
a little bit more work with some lighter weights is also going to kind of

380
00:22:55.451 --> 00:22:59.020
stretch you differently because the Barbie on your backs and it puts you down

381
00:22:59.021 --> 00:23:02.410
where a lot differently than just holding the weights while you're effectively,

382
00:23:02.411 --> 00:23:06.010
I mean obviously technically there are a bunch of details that are important to

383
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:07.780
pay attention to for safety reasons,

384
00:23:07.781 --> 00:23:11.200
but you're effectively doing what you said not to do in the squat,
right?
Right.

385
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:15.220
You're doing it on purpose with control and technical objective.
Right.

386
00:23:15.221 --> 00:23:18.910
We'll also to,
uh,
the other great thing about a good morning,

387
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.720
if there is anything great about it and they hurt really bad,
they're brutal.

388
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.170
But the one thing that is great about it is it does get the weights out of your

389
00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:27.004
hands.
Yeah.

390
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.190
We have so much weight in our hands all the time that we end up with tons of

391
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:34.990
elbow issues,
tons of a tendonitis and problems through the forearms and elbows.

392
00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:38.340
So anytime you have an opportunity to not hold something right,

393
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.240
it's a good opportunity to take.
So that's,

394
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.110
that's actually a good segue over to this stuff over here.

395
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.790
So now what is this machine called?
We will,

396
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.610
you want to try to get too much in the way,
but what does this guy,

397
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.450
this guy right here is called a monolift.

398
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.670
I'll actually just demonstrate it for you with the second,

399
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.170
I can just hop underneath year.

400
00:23:55.430 --> 00:24:00.140
So the model lift is kind of great because all he has to do is stand up with the

401
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:03.890
weight.
He doesn't have to really even walk anywhere.
So as he stands up,

402
00:24:03.891 --> 00:24:07.700
we're going to release it right from here and he can do a squat right there.

403
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.320
He probably hasn't really used the model of the aspect of it.

404
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:15.920
You probably just using it as a squat rack and put it back in the rack again.

405
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.220
And so that's why he moved his feet around.

406
00:24:19.221 --> 00:24:22.310
But as we become used to the model lift a little bit more,

407
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.930
you can get yourself wedged in there just right.
And when you unrack the weights,

408
00:24:26.931 --> 00:24:30.560
there's no more walking with it.
Right.
Is this,
is this,

409
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.190
this looks like a bit like a safety squat bar,
but what,
what is this?

410
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:38.100
Because it also has,
that is a safety squad and safety squat bar.
Yeah.
The,
uh,

411
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:43.130
so the padding through here will allow to lift her to get getting completely

412
00:24:43.491 --> 00:24:45.620
different center of gravity.
Then they would have,

413
00:24:45.621 --> 00:24:48.440
if they were trying to hold a barbell on their back.
Um,

414
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:50.660
you're also taking a lot of tension,
hey,

415
00:24:50.661 --> 00:24:52.730
taken a lot of tension and stress off because you're listening.

416
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.720
They hear Bonk with the head.
Yeah.
Uh,

417
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.190
as opposed to correct.

418
00:24:58.191 --> 00:25:02.030
And so we've had lifters in here who have torn their tricep.

419
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.020
We've had lifters in here who have torn their biceps before and they could still

420
00:25:06.021 --> 00:25:09.230
lift with this piece of equipment that I had to worry about getting their arm

421
00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:12.880
and some weird,
precarious position to be able to do a swab.
And,
uh,

422
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.390
this right here is this,
that's the devil.
Oh,
because the depth low bar.

423
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:21.110
And is this for beds or is this for chains?
What does this for?
Yes,

424
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.500
it's for all of the above.
All the above.
You can put bands on there.
Um,

425
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.110
there's chains,
right?
Exactly.
You put whatever,

426
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:30.980
whatever you need in there.

427
00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.070
This piece of equipment is really nice for a good mornings.

428
00:25:34.071 --> 00:25:35.900
And we were talking about the good morning earlier.

429
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.150
We tried to do a good morning with a straight bar.

430
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:42.320
The bar has tendency to want to roll up your back with a bar that's bent or

431
00:25:42.321 --> 00:25:46.130
Cambridge,
like this one is already,
the bar will stay where,

432
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.000
where you want it to stay and it's easier to actually do a true good morning.

433
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.020
An a true good morning is when you take your shoulders and try to get them out

434
00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:57.120
past your toes what you're trying to do.
So with the straight bar,

435
00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.850
it's very hard to really be wedged in there.

436
00:25:58.851 --> 00:26:00.590
The right way to do the good morning,
the right way.

437
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.410
And he got some key low plates there and those are basically just for

438
00:26:03.411 --> 00:26:07.400
competition.
So because we compete,
we're competitive power lifters.

439
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.080
That's a one way for us to compete and utilize the stuff that we actually use in

440
00:26:12.081 --> 00:26:13.400
the event itself.

441
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:18.080
If we only train with bumper plates and we only trained with a regular metal,

442
00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:21.630
or you can see how thick this plate is here,
this bumper plate,

443
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.760
I think that is compared to that.
Right,
right.
A much,
much different feel.

444
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.570
That's 55 pounds as opposed to this being 45 pounds a train is,

445
00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:32.930
you'll compete them.
Right.
You want to get used to those pieces of equipment.

446
00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:36.350
So there's no surprises when you go into a power through me.
See,

447
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.580
you have a hex or a trap bar so you can step inside this and do all sorts of

448
00:26:40.581 --> 00:26:45.480
stuff.
Yep.
What about this guy that's Cambrin Bar?
What would you use this for?

449
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.750
Mainly for squats and good morning.
Uh,
sometimes people have used it.

450
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.510
Even for the old school.
Zirtual squat we put into the cooks your elbows.

451
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.200
Very brutal.

452
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.880
And what would the benefit of this be over the Duffalo Bar?

453
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.810
In what cases would this be there?
Not too much different from each other.
Got It.

454
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.760
Uh,
you probably wouldn't need to have both pieces.

455
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:09.990
You probably pick one over the other bottle of stuff.
We'll leave that there.

456
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.060
Well actually this is a,
this is smelling salt was smelling salts.
So,
um,

457
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.300
so you shake it up and it's got like some different stuff in it.

458
00:27:18.301 --> 00:27:20.820
But like this one,
well who knows?

459
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:23.460
It's just a white look at where are we?

460
00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:26.700
Let just get to have a white bottle with nothing on it.
There's no way,

461
00:27:26.701 --> 00:27:30.180
but there's no expiration date on it and an underpass.
Yeah,
exactly.

462
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.870
Some of the guys will make their own combinations and stuff in here and

463
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.750
sometimes you can even smell it through the bottle and then you know,

464
00:27:36.751 --> 00:27:38.220
you're really screwed when you open it up.

465
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:40.830
But this one's been sitting there for a while,
so I don't think it's that bad.

466
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.170
Yeah,
it's not that bad.
Normally if you even get close to it,

467
00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:48.270
you just get hit like a ton of bricks that basically,

468
00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:50.640
it's just a wake the hell up for your set that you're doing.

469
00:27:50.641 --> 00:27:53.190
It's almost like someone just came up and just smacked you in your face,

470
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.170
which some power lifters also have people do.
