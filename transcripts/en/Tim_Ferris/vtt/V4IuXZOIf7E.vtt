00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.550
I'm Tim Ferris,
best selling author and Human Guinea pig.

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.500
I'll show you how to make the impossible possible by bending the rules.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.570
I'll find the world's best teachers and push myself to the edge to deconstruct,

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.703
decode,

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.120
and demystify some of the world's toughest challenges in record time

6
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.380
if I can do it.
So can you,

7
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.490
one of the best ways to learn something fast as to set steaks.

8
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.630
I don't want you to give it up for Mister Tim Ferriss over there now.

9
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.700
So here it goes there you can feel the power rising up in your loins five days.

10
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.710
This is like the first time I looked at Chinese characters.
Zero experience,

11
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.860
you're in,
you're in trouble,
okay.
And the world's best teachers

12
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.320
is four or five days were really enough time.
I have my doubts.

13
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.920
Sometimes accelerated learning requires serious acceleration.

14
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.440
The course is designed to kill you.
So here it goes.

15
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.270
I'm 50% excited and 50% totally scared shitless.

16
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.190
Five days you got a favorite chair,
accelerator,
zero experience.

17
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.870
But I'm terrified of it.
I do not.

18
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:22.160
Claim would be a good driver and the world's best teachers.
Stop.

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.930
Mistake.
And you and your car are toast.
Yeah.

20
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.740
Stand by camera free.
I've never been to the Philippines.

21
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:37.590
I only speak one word of gallery in that is.
Thank you.
So laba.

22
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.700
So you're telling me you speak like a Filipino now with language learning

23
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.910
experts on my side,
I will find out just how much took all,

24
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:49.020
like I can cram in four days and this is the day of reckoning for Tim.

25
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.350
Are you ready
this week?
I'm throwing down.
