00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.080
Hello Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:03.780
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to the Tim Ferriss show.

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.880
This episode is an exciting one and I will start with a quote and the quote is

4
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:13.020
from Robert Frost.
It is freedom lies in being bold.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.130
If anything,
our guests,
this episode is about being bold.

6
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:21.480
His name is Peter Teal and he is a serial tech founder,

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.550
paypal,
Palentier,
billionaire investor and author of the new book zero to one.

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:28.140
I'll come back to all of those things,

9
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:30.780
but whether you want to be a better investor,

10
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:33.780
I've certainly modeled Peter and have him to thank,

11
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:37.440
I think for many of my best decisions in the world of investing a better

12
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:41.670
entrepreneur or simply a free thinker who wants to do great things,

13
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:44.970
create more value.
I highly recommend not only this interview,

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.890
but certainly that you read zero to one,

15
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:50.430
which is a collection of many of his teachings on differentiation,

16
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:54.900
value creation,
competition.
It is a treasure trove.
Now,

17
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.350
Peter,
who is Peter,
and if you're not familiar with him,

18
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.930
I'll give you a quick snapshot.
Uh,

19
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:05.400
he cofounded in 1998 paypal,
that was the beginning,

20
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:08.970
which was sold to Ebay in 2002 for one point $5 billion.

21
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.160
But more notable,

22
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.000
I think is the team that he helped to assemble.

23
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.080
And these individuals known now as the paypal mafia,

24
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.740
that's where they're referred to as went on to launch a raft of companies that

25
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:24.000
have become household names,

26
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:28.440
including at least seven now valued at more than $1 billion.
I mean,

27
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:31.080
literally almost every single person on the founding team,

28
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.790
if not every person has gone on to create multibillion dollar companies.

29
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.760
You have Tesla and space x co founded by Elon Musk,
linkedin of course,

30
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:42.350
Reid Hoffman,
Youtube,
Steve Chen,
Chad Hurley and [inaudible],

31
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.690
Yelp,
Jeremy Stoppelman,
Russell Simmons,
Yammer,

32
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.110
David Sacks and the data mining company.
Palentier which teal himself,
uh,

33
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.510
co founded in 2004.

34
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.280
He was also the first outside investor in Facebook and has invested in more than

35
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:58.740
100 startups.
He has done a lot.

36
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:02.430
He has learned a lot and perhaps most important,

37
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.810
he consistently questions,
assumptions and thinks differently.

38
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.810
So I don't want to delay this any further,

39
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:14.070
but I will say this interview was an experiment.
I was on sick leave,

40
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:15.630
so we did it asynchronously.

41
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.460
What you will hear is like masters who's a coauthor on zero to one reading the

42
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:24.270
questions,
Peter Answering them because I was unable to be there in person,

43
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:27.120
although I have met Peter on a few occasions before.

44
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.220
They're also written questions and answers and you can find those written

45
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:35.040
questions and answers on the blog.

46

And thank you so much for listening at this altitude.

52
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.520
I can run flat out for a half mile

53
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.430
<v 1>before my hands start shaking familial.
So you posted a question.
Now</v>

54
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.390
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue.

55
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.590
Hello,
this is a or

56
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.540
<v 2>teal.
I'm happy to be here on the Tim Ferriss show.
Thank you for having me.</v>

57
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.520
Since Tim is out,
uh,

58
00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:28.940
my coauthor Blake masters is the voice you who are asking questions that came

59
00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:31.340
from Tim and his audience.
Let's get started.

60
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.930
What do you believe that very few others do?
Well,
for starters,

61
00:03:35.931 --> 00:03:38.690
I think this is a much harder question to answer than it sounds.

62
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.140
I give a number of different answers in my,
in my book.

63
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.880
One high level answer is that I think our technology is far more important in

64
00:03:46.881 --> 00:03:50.210
our world and globalization even though we're in a world where people are very

65
00:03:50.211 --> 00:03:51.650
focused on globalization,

66
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.600
on copying things that work and much less on technology,
on doing new things.

67
00:03:56.601 --> 00:04:00.440
And I think and we need to shift that hierarchy around and we just see

68
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.700
technology as the main driver for progress in the 21st century.

69
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.790
A second answer that I,
uh,
that I come to,

70
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.800
I'm on the business side that I think is quite contrarian is that whereas most

71
00:04:13.161 --> 00:04:17.090
people believe that capitalism and competition are synonyms.

72
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.680
I think they're Antonyms,

73
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.400
a capitalist to someone who's in the business of accumulating capital.

74
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.900
In a world of perfect competition,
all the capital is competed away.

75
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.580
And so for example,
uh,

76
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.620
the restaurant industry in San Francisco is incredibly competitive but not very

77
00:04:33.831 --> 00:04:36.770
capitalistic because no one ever makes any money out it.

78
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.060
Whereas Google is a very capitalistic company,

79
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.540
which has made enormous profits for the last dozen years,

80
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.450
but has had no real competition ever since.

81
00:04:47.451 --> 00:04:52.370
It's definitively distanced itself from a Yahoo and Microsoft around 2002.

82
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.940
What do you wish you had known about business 20 years ago?

83
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.730
If you go back 2025 years?

84
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.840
I wish I would've known that there was no need to wait.
I went to college,

85
00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:06.640
I went to law school,
I worked in law and uh,
and banking the,

86
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:10.220
not for terribly long,
but not until I really started paypal.

87
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.540
Did I fully realize that you don't have to wait to start something.
So if you're,

88
00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:16.970
if you're planning to do something with your life,

89
00:05:16.971 --> 00:05:20.300
if you have a 10 year plan of how to get there,
uh,
you should ask,

90
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.310
why can't you do this in six months?

91
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.330
Sometimes you have to actually go through the 10 year complex,

92
00:05:26.331 --> 00:05:28.370
10 year trajectory,
but a,

93
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:32.300
it's at least worth asking with us a story you're telling yourself or whether

94
00:05:32.301 --> 00:05:37.070
that's the reality.
How important is failure in business?
Well,

95
00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:39.770
I think failure is a massively overrated.

96
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.900
Most businesses fail for more than one reason.
And so when a business fails,

97
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.010
you often don't learn anything at all because the failure was over determined.

98
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.290
You will think it paled for reason number one,

99
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.200
but it failed for reasons numbers one through five.

100
00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:57.890
And so the next business you start will fail for reason number and then for

101
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:59.150
three and so on.

102
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.080
And so I think people actually do not learn very much from failure.

103
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.060
And I think it ends up being quite damaging and demoralizing to people in the

104
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.080
long run.
My sense is that the death of every business is a tragedy.

105
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.220
It's not some sort of beautiful aesthetic,
uh,

106
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.820
where there's a lot of carnage.
But that's how progress happens.

107
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.430
And it's not some sort of educational imperative.

108
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.710
So I think failure is neither a Darwinian nor an educational imperative.

109
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.960
Failure is always simply a tragedy.
When you hear the word successful,

110
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.090
who's the first person you think of and why?
Mark Zuckerberg,
the y seems silly.

111
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:42.530
He's done tremendously well.
Or someone like Elon Musk,
um,

112
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.150
uh,

113
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.150
where we've had a serial entrepreneur has created multiple mega billion dollar

114
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:50.840
companies in the last,
in the last few decades.

115
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.380
What I think people like soccer Berg or a mosque or Jeff Bezos at Amazon have in

116
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:01.790
common is that they're relentless.
They don't stop every day.
They start over,

117
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.740
do more and get better at it.

118
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.910
People often ask whether Facebook was just a fluke in the right place at the

119
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:11.990
right time,
but I think the more you get to know a mark or founders like him,

120
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.820
the less plausible it becomes.

121
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.910
And that's in part because you can see how hard he works,

122
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.290
how much planning there was,

123
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.570
how much of a vision there was from the very beginning.

124
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.620
Where do you see bitcoin going or not going in the future?

125
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.930
Bitcoin is a kind of struggle with many of the same issues paypal encountered,

126
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.360
uh,
when we started in the late nineties,

127
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.600
we to try to create a new currency and we started by creating a new payment

128
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:40.730
system.
Paypal worked by a linking money,

129
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:44.420
an email and became very powerful on that,
on that score.

130
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.220
Although it never quite achieved,

131
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:49.430
it's a goal of creating a completely new currency.

132
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.530
I think bitcoin in some ways is the opposite configuration of paypal.

133
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.080
It has succeeded in creating a new currency,

134
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.260
but perhaps not yet a new payment system and so people are speculating in

135
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:03.890
Bitcoin as a store of value,

136
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.280
but they're not yet using bitcoin that extensively to transact for bitcoin to

137
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:10.310
really succeed.

138
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.900
I think it will have to be not just a currency and also a payment system.

139
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.980
What are the biggest tech trends that you see defining the future?

140
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.920
I don't like talking in terms of tech trends because I think once you have a

141
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:28.430
trend you have many people doing it and once you have many people doing

142
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:32.360
something,
you have lots of competition and little differentiation.

143
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.630
You generally never want to be part of a popular trend.

144
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:40.430
You do not want to be the fourth online pet food company in the late nineties

145
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.450
you did not want to be the 12th then panel solar,

146
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:48.230
a company in the last decade and you don't want to be the Nth company of any

147
00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:52.850
particular trends.
So I think trends are often things to uh,
to avoid.

148
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.230
What I prefer over trends is a sense of mission that you're working on a unique

149
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:00.660
problem that people are not solving elsewhere.

150
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.250
When Elon Musk started space x,
they set out the mission to go to Mars.

151
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:08.280
You may agree or disagree with that as a mission statement,

152
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.020
but it was a problem that was not going to be solved outside of space x and all

153
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:16.320
the people working there knew that and it motivated them tremendously.

154
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:20.670
So I think unique missions are much to be preferred over trends.

155
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.870
It is because every moment in technology happens only once.

156
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:29.871
It's always a unique constellation of technologies and people and uh,

157
00:09:30.851 --> 00:09:34.170
the world where,
where the time is right,

158
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.920
right now for a new kind of thing to come about.

159
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.550
Why do so many investors a spray and pray instead of focusing on just five to

160
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:46.440
seven companies in each fund like you to at founders fund?

161
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.290
And a second part of the question,
do you have any,

162
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:53.670
any rules that you follow or are tips for those who want to invest in early

163
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:55.350
stage venture?
It's more intelligently.

164
00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.950
I think people would say that they spray and pray because a of some sort of

165
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:04.860
portfolio theory,
some sort of diversification theory.

166
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:10.440
And if that's true,
that might work.
I don't actually believe that to be true.

167
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:11.120
I think the,

168
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.270
the real reason people as a spray and pray and they're investing is that they

169
00:10:15.271 --> 00:10:16.350
are lacking in any,

170
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:21.180
a conviction and a perhaps because they're too lazy to really spend the time to

171
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:24.510
try to figure out what companies are ultimately going to work.

172
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.230
One of the reasons I do not like,
uh,
um,

173
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.590
that sort of approach to investing is that I don't think it's good to treat

174
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.240
companies as lottery tickets.

175
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.860
I think it's terrible to treat the founders of companies as,
as lottery tickets.

176
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.020
And I think it's actually not just sort of a bad thing morally to treat
people's,

177
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.080
a lot of ticks.
I also think it's really bad as an investor,
as an investor,

178
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.980
you know,
once you say that there's a small probability of a big payoff,

179
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.570
small number times big number normally equals a small number.

180
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.240
And so once you were thinking in a lottery ticket terms,

181
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.260
you've already psyched yourself and to writing checks without thinking and

182
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:03.570
therefore losing money.
And,
and so I think the,

183
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.490
the anti lottery ticket approach is to try to be concentrated because that

184
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:12.900
forces you to have high levels of conviction before you write a check of any

185
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:15.420
size.
And then I think you'll do much better.

186
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.430
What problem do you face every day that nobody has solved yet?
We'll,
uh,

187
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.820
the problem that I remained the most passionate about is,
uh,

188
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.470
is pressed to make some real and continued progress in the fight against aging

189
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:31.800
and death.
This is not just about my face is a problem.
You know,

190
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:33.330
everybody on this planet faces,

191
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:37.950
we have about a hundred thousand people a day who die mostly from diseases

192
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:40.940
linked to old age.
Um,
and so I,

193
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.180
what I always find extraordinary is how little we were doing about this problem.

194
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.920
It seems that,
uh,
uh,

195
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.510
people are either in a mode of denial or acceptance,

196
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.800
which are in some ways opposite extremes,

197
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.000
but they both have the effect of stopping you from doing anything.

198
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.690
If you're in denial and say,
this is not a problem for you,
accepted and say,

199
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:05.200
there's nothing you can do about it.
Both of these are sort of passive modes.

200
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.020
And what I think we need is a much more active mode.

201
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.720
Instead of being in denial or acceptance.

202
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:13.750
I would like us to be spending a lot more time of fighting death.

203
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.190
There are people who say that death is natural and uh,
uh,

204
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.250
to which I think the response always has to be that there is nothing more

205
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:23.380
natural for us then to fight death.

206
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.120
What would you say to the 9.7 million unemployed people in America?

207
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.490
Let me give both a micro and a macro answer to this on a micro answer.

208
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:38.140
I think,
uh,
I don't think there's any sort of one size fits all approach.

209
00:12:38.141 --> 00:12:43.030
I think there are a very different kinds of facts and circumstances in which

210
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:45.910
people find themselves in.
And I think that a,

211
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.710
a reasonable approach would involve,
uh,
you know,
very careful.

212
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.210
We're looking at why people are there.

213
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:56.980
Are they in a longterm unemployed situation where they were working a rust belt

214
00:12:56.981 --> 00:13:01.981
factory with a job that no longer exists or are they a 20 something a college

215
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:07.741
student who studied a major that was a poorly advised and has mounted as a

216
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.420
accumulated a mountain of debt.
And so I think,

217
00:13:10.421 --> 00:13:14.290
I think we always have always wanna approach this was with far more granularity

218
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.160
and that there's no sort of one size fits all approach.

219
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.440
The macro answer though that I think is critical is that we need to find a way

220
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:27.610
for there to be just more growth in our overall economy.

221
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.750
If the U s economy was growing at a rate of 4% a year,

222
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.860
I think these problems would broadly get solved.

223
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.690
And the challenge has been that we've been having growth of one or 2% for the

224
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:45.660
last,
uh,
seven,
eight years and that sort of growth rate is not enough to,
um,

225
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.560
to overcome structural unemployment.

226
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.850
It's my view that a technology is the key driver for growth,

227
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:54.910
especially in a developed nation like the US.

228
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.950
And therefore anything we can do to accelerate technological progress and

229
00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:04.120
technological innovation will increase growth and ultimately will increase

230
00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:06.220
opportunities for people throughout our society.

231
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.410
How would you reply to someone who says that your position on college and Higher

232
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.580
Education is hypocritical?
I,

233
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:17.320
since you yourself went to Stanford for both undergraduate and law school.
Well,

234
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:21.190
you know,
I think some people will always find objections of one sort or another.

235
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.290
Had I not gone to Stanford law school,

236
00:14:23.291 --> 00:14:25.810
people would object and say that I had no idea what I was missing.

237
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.030
So I think they're,
they're likely to complain on in any event.
But I would say,

238
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:31.620
um,
my,

239
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.530
my views not hypocritical because I've never made the claim that there's a one

240
00:14:35.531 --> 00:14:39.040
size fits all.
So if I said that nobody should go to college,

241
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.230
that might be hypocritical.
But I,

242
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.420
what I have said is that not everybody should do the same thing.
And uh,

243
00:14:45.421 --> 00:14:50.050
and that there is something very odd about a society where the most talented

244
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:55.051
people all get tracked towards the same elite colleges where they end up

245
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:59.420
studying the same small number of subjects and going to the same small number of

246
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:00.080
careers.

247
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.160
And that's strikes me as sort of a lack of diversity in our thinking about the

248
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:05.780
kinds of things people should be doing.

249
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.490
That's very limiting for our society as well as for those students.

250
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.400
I certainly think I was guilty of very much of this myself.

251
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.290
If I look back on my Stanford undergraduate and law school years,

252
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.920
it's possible I would do it,
do it again.
But if I had to do something over,

253
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:26.270
I would think about it much harder.
I would ask questions,
why am I doing this?

254
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:30.290
Am I doing this just because I have good grades and test scores and because I

255
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:34.700
think it's prestigious or am I doing this because I'm extremely passionate about

256
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:38.510
practicing law?
And so I think there are good answers and they're bad answers.

257
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:41.120
And,
uh,
my sort of retrospective on my,

258
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.930
my early twenties is that I was a way too focused on the wrong answers at the

259
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:48.110
time.
You studied philosophy as an undergraduate.

260
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.100
What does philosophy have to do with business and how has your study of

261
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:55.340
philosophy helped you and your investing and career today?

262
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.060
I'm not sure how much the formal study of philosophy matters,

263
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.620
but I think the fundamental philosophical question is one that's important for

264
00:16:03.621 --> 00:16:04.610
all of us.
And it,

265
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.640
it's always this question of what do people agree merely by convention?

266
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.210
And what is the truth?

267
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.120
And this is always the fundamental distinction in a society is a,

268
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.650
there's a consensus of things that people believe to be true.

269
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.040
And maybe the conventions are right and maybe they're not.

270
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:26.630
And we never want to let a convention,
the shortcut for truth,

271
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.030
we always need to ask,
is this true?

272
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.550
And this is always where I get out with this indirect question.

273
00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:34.700
Tell me something that's true that very few people agree with you on.

274
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:39.860
Silicon Valley is a place that is a laden with a conventional thinking.

275
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:40.761
And uh,

276
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:45.320
and one of the reasons that it may afflict silicon valley even more than the

277
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:49.550
rest of,
uh,
of our society is that there are so few markers.
You know,

278
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.750
one of the things we're focused on,

279
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:55.220
silicon valley's the future and the future is,
uh,
not always a clear thing.

280
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.090
People can be uncertain about it and when they're uncertain about the future,

281
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.890
they will try to find shortcuts,

282
00:17:00.891 --> 00:17:03.830
involve looking at what other people say about the future.

283
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.740
And when everybody's simply is listening to everybody else.

284
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.190
That's the definition of,
of a bubble or of a,

285
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:13.370
of a mass psychosocial insanity.
And so I think this,

286
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.250
this question of trying to think for yourself,

287
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.180
trying to break through convention is,
is always important,

288
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.030
but perhaps even more in silicon valley than most places.

289
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.540
What do you think the future of education looks like?

290
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.640
I don't like the word education because it is such an extraordinary abstraction.

291
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.920
I'm very much in favor of learning.

292
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:39.330
I'm much more skeptical of credentialing or I'm the abstraction called

293
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:41.900
education.
And so there's,

294
00:17:41.901 --> 00:17:45.560
there are all these granular questions like what is it that you are learning?

295
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.220
Why are you learning it?
Are you going to college because a four year party?

296
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.750
Is it a consumption decision?

297
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.170
Is it an investment decision where you're investing in your future?

298
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:59.370
Is it insurance or is it a tournament where you're just beating other people?

299
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.270
And uh,

300
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.980
our elite universities really like studio 54 where it's like a exclusive

301
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:05.814
nightclub.

302
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.410
I think if we move beyond the education bubble that we're living in today,

303
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.880
the future will be one in which people can speak about these things more
clearly.

304
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.880
And we will talk about is it an investment decision,

305
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:22.440
is it a tournament is as a trade or vocational skill that you're developing?

306
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.760
I think engineering is the opposite of education because it is actually a

307
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:30.840
specific skill that people are learning and it's sort of engineering as a

308
00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:33.670
discipline cuts the most against,
uh,

309
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.950
the banality that we're always told that you're just learning how to learn or

310
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.840
you're not learning anything in particular.

311
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.970
You don't know why you're learning things.

312
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.140
Engineering sort of the anti-education and that sentence and I think,
uh,

313
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:50.700
is in some ways a paradigm for the way I think it will be more in the future.

314
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.480
I think we will have much less of a one size fits all approach.

315
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:59.870
I think the big tract institutions are delivering a less and less and charging

316
00:19:00.331 --> 00:19:04.020
more and more.
And so I think we are sort of at a point where we're,

317
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:07.710
things will look very different.
One of my friends have suggested that,
uh,

318
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.960
we are at a point education that's,
uh,
like the,
uh,

319
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.880
place where the Catholic Church was on the eve of the reformation had become

320
00:19:14.881 --> 00:19:19.620
sort of very corrupt institution.
It was charging more and more for indulgences.

321
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:22.920
People thought they could only get saved by going to the Catholic Church.

322
00:19:22.921 --> 00:19:27.921
Just like people today believe that salvation involves getting a college diploma

323
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.990
and if you don't get a college diploma that you're going to go to hell.

324
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.380
I think my answer is in some ways a like that of the reformers in the 16th

325
00:19:36.481 --> 00:19:40.710
century.
It is the same disturbing answer that,
um,

326
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.870
you're gonna have to figure out your salvation on your own.

327
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.570
What are your daily habits and routines?

328
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.920
I always feel I'm a terrible person answering that question,
uh,

329
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.440
since things are very unstructured on,
on many ways.

330
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.470
But I'd say one thing that I try to do every day is to,
um,

331
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.550
have a conversation with some of the smartest people I know and a continued to

332
00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:05.250
develop my thinking.
So I'm trying to learn new things.

333
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.030
I find that I learned them from other people.
And it's,
uh,

334
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.180
it's often people with whom I've had conversations for a long time.

335
00:20:12.181 --> 00:20:16.560
So it's not an MTV approach where you talk to a new smart person every day.

336
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.570
It's one where you have sustained conversations with a group of friends or

337
00:20:21.571 --> 00:20:25.050
people who've been working with for a long time and you come back to thinking

338
00:20:25.051 --> 00:20:28.320
about some of,
uh,
some of these questions.
And that's how,
that's how I find,

339
00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:32.010
I really,
uh,
continue to learn every day and expand my thinking about the world.

340
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.300
What one thing would you most like to change about yourself or improve on?

341
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.640
It's always hard to answer this since,
uh,

342
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.810
it sort of begs the question of why I haven't already improved on it.
But,
uh,

343
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.460
I would say that,
uh,
when I look back on a,
on my younger self,
I was,
uh,

344
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.830
I was insanely tracked,
insanely competitive.

345
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.690
And when you're very competitive,

346
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.290
you get good at the thing you're competing with people on.

347
00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.070
But it comes at the expense of losing out on many other things.

348
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.710
So if you're a competitive chess player,

349
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.850
you might get very good at chess but on neglect to develop other things because

350
00:21:06.851 --> 00:21:10.100
you're focused on beating your competitors rather than on,

351
00:21:10.101 --> 00:21:13.450
on doing something that's a important or valuable.

352
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.580
And so I become,

353
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:20.080
I think much more self aware over the years about the problematic nature of lot

354
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:23.590
of the competition and rivalries that we get caught up in.

355
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.630
And I would not pretend to have extricated myself from this altogether.

356
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.640
So I think every day it's something to reflect on and think about how do I

357
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.400
become less competitive in order that I can become more successful.

358
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.140
What did you want to achieve by writing zero to one?
We write a book like this.

359
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:43.750
You're trying to reach as broad an audience as possible.
There's,

360
00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:46.360
there's much that I've learned in the last 15 years is,
uh,

361
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.290
as both a entrepreneur and investor in the technology industry.

362
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.240
And I wanted to share some of these lessons,

363
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:56.020
not just at Stanford but also in Silicon Valley and,
uh,
with,

364
00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:57.130
with the wider world.

365
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:02.170
I think this question of technology is critical to our society and building a

366
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:04.150
better future in the 21st century.

367
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:09.510
And I think there's both sort of a alarmist and a hopeful part of this book.

368
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:14.560
The the alarmist part is that if we do not get our act together and innovate

369
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:18.130
more,
uh,
we will have a bleak and stagnant century ahead of us.

370
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.690
And on the other hand,

371
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.670
the positive side is that there's absolutely nothing about all the great ideas

372
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:25.870
have been found.

373
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.780
It's not the case that all the low hanging fruit has been picked.

374
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.980
There's a great deal of things that can be done that people can achieve.

375
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:37.660
There are many a great secrets left to be unlocked in the,
in the decades ahead.

376
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.950
And so,
uh,

377
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.780
so I think it is primarily a cultural question of what we need to do to get back

378
00:22:43.781 --> 00:22:44.614
to the future.

379
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:49.100
Most business books take a 30 page essay and expand into 300 pages of writing.

380
00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:51.340
And I tried to do the opposite with zero to one.

381
00:22:51.341 --> 00:22:56.341
I tried to take everything I've learned in the last 15 years and distill it into

382
00:22:56.471 --> 00:23:00.490
200 discipline pages so that you can read it in one afternoon.

383
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.540
Writing this book helped me organize an advanced my thinking tremendously,

384
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.760
and I hope it does the same for its readers.
