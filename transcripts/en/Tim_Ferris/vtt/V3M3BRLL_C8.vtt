1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.860
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.861 --> 00:00:06.100
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.980
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue over metal.

4
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.950
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by kettle and fire,</v>

5
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.180
which makes some of the best bone broth and certainly the most convenient that

6
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:34.890
I've ever found.
And I have a big stack of them on my kitchen counter.

7
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:35.311
Right now.

8
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:40.311
I have one container every morning and this first came highly recommended to me

9
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:43.620
by past podcast guests such as Amelia Boone,

10
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:47.010
who is a four time world champion in world's toughest mudder,
Spartan race,

11
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.740
etc. And Dr Dominic D'agostino,

12
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:52.950
the incredible hulk of scientific research should check him out too.

13
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.850
But there are few things that make kettle and fire special.
Number one,

14
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.190
they are the first shelf stable.
In other words,

15
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:02.970
never frozen bone broth that uses bones from 100% grass fed,

16
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.590
organically raised animals,
so you are what you eat,

17
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.510
ate,
if that makes sense.

18
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:12.540
So it's very important that you understand if you're consuming animal protein,

19
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.010
what they consumed.
They also use longer cook times,
20 plus hours,

20
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:20.070
which means more collagen and other nutrients.
For instance,

21
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.430
they contain 19 times more Collagen,

22
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.080
then one of their close competitors and an independent lab confirm this.

23
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.650
I'll leave the competitor's name out of it because I don't want to get sued.

24
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:34.980
But that's the case and it is not frozen.

25
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.830
So thanks to many millions of dollars of packaging equipment.

26
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.360
They're bone broth doesn't require freezing or shipping with dry ice.

27
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.021
So like I said,

28
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:46.920
it's just sitting on my kitchen counter in these boxes and then I can heat them

29
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:48.180
up.
They're basically ready to drink,

30
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.070
heat them up on the stove top or in a microwave and your ready to rock and roll.

31
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.360
And you also get a nice payload of Glucosomine glycine,
uh,

32
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:01.680
along with the Joelton and everything else that I mentioned.
So check it out.

33
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.260
I've been hugely pleased with this and like I said,

34
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.100
had been consuming it every morning it gives you about,

35
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.720
I want to say 20 grams of protein,

36
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:13.200
which is a nice little slow carb diet boost if that's what you're looking for
it.

37
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.220
And then I'll typically sip this out of a very large camping coffee mug is I do

38
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:23.970
some writing or journaling.
So are have it,
check it out.
It's delicious.

39
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.570
I favor the chicken but uh,

40
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.330
each to his own or her own.
So check it out.

Tim

43
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.040
this episode is brought to you by a cent protein,
the cleanest,

44
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.100
least process protein I've ever consumed and I have tried just about everything

45
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.870
since well before the four hour body.

46
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.530
I've started my day with 20 to 30 grams of protein.

47
00:02:58.531 --> 00:02:59.980
First thing that has been part

48
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.813
<v 2>of my routine,</v>

49
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.320
but I don't always have the time or necessarily the desire to cook an entire

50
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.910
meal.
So what to do.

51
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.830
Protein powders can be a fast way to get this protein need met,

52
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.060
but most products are full of crap.
They're bleached,
they have excess sugar,

53
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.960
terrible artificial sweeteners or just straightforward low grade,

54
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.130
low quality protein.

55
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.690
Ascent contains zero artificial ingredients and the parent company is actually a

56
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.330
cheese manufacturer,
so they produce their own native proteins.

57
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.610
It's,
it's really fascinating.

58
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:37.930
And I've looked at they're processing it takes or it took them about five years

59
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:38.764
to develop.

60
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.660
You can mix the protein in as little as four ounces without any clumps or issues

61
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:47.470
of mixability whatsoever and they nailed the taste.
They tested,
for instance,

62
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.880
for the chocolate version 282 different versions.

63
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:56.881
They put a lot of money and a lot of time into r and D for this particular

64
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:59.500
product and they have both way and my seller casing,

65
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:04.501
so if you want to say improve body composition and recovery overnight slow

66
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.710
release,
you can take the my seller casein or in my case whey protein.

67
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.580
I would take postworkout for instance,
or in the morning.
So check it out.

68
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.990
These guys were really fascinating.

69
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.700

Hello my little Mogwai.

78
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.640
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

79
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:56.020
it is my job to distill,
extract,
deconstruct the habits,

80
00:04:56.021 --> 00:05:00.340
routines and tactics of world class performers of all different types,

81
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:03.070
whether they are billionaires,
chess,
prodigies,

82
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.590
elite athletes or otherwise.

83
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.130
And in this case we have elite athlete,

84
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.310
Maria Sharapova and man.

85
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:15.730
Oh man did I have a lot of fun with this conversation.

86
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:20.731
We got deep into the tactics of training and mental performance,

87
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:24.250
mental toughness and much,
much more.

88
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:28.570
You can find her on Facebook Sharapova you can find her on Twitter and Instagram

89
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.230
at Maria Sharapova who is Maria Sharapova.

90
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:36.340
She is the winter of five Grand Slam titles and is an Olympic silver medalist.

91
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.170
She is only one of a handful of players to hold all four Grand Slam titles

92
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:45.760
including Wimbledon,
US Open,
Australian Open and Roland Garros.

93
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.380
She has held the world number one ranking for 21 weeks and has won 35 singles

94
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:51.730
titles in her career.

95
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.120
Forbes also named her the highest paid female athlete of all time in 2005

96
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.500
<v 1>she's now held that title for eight record,</v>

97
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.150
11 years or 12 years.
That is a long time.

98
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.650
Maria garners worldwide press coverage on an off the court with a social media

99
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:17.030
presence that includes 15.5 probably a lot more at this point.
Facebook fans,

100
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.280
more than 6.5 million Twitter followers,
2.7 million followers on Instagram.

101
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:26.210
She serves as an ambassador to many of the world's top luxury brands and a

102
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:29.960
number of fortune 500 companies including Porsche,
Nike,
Avion,
and head.

103
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.210
In 2007 she became a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development

104
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.260
Program.

105
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.410
It's you and DP and has made significant contributions to Trenoble related

106
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:40.880
projects in her native country.

107
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.300
In 2012 Sharapova flexed her entrepreneurial muscles and a debuted her eponymous

108
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.560
couture candy collection,
sugar Hova.
Most recently,

109
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.620
she is the author of a book titled Unstoppable My Life So far.

110
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.610
It describes her story in detail and was done in collaboration with an

111
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:08.060
incredible writer named Rich Cohen,
which we'll get into,

112
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.900
but a few things that we don't get into.
We don't talk about Meldonium,

113
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.690
we don't talk about the sponsors,

114
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:19.040
we don't talk about a handful of things that have been talked to death in the

115
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:19.610
media.

116
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.260
We dig into more of the specifics that you can use,

117
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.760
the specifics that will inspire you and also instruct you that you can apply.

118
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So that was the focus and I really hope you enjoy this as much as I did.

119
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:36.650
It was a blast and it inspired me,
in fact,

120
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.730
among other things to come to Florida where I am right now,

121
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.410
I have compression sleeve on my right arm.
Why?

122
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:47.150
Because I'm doing tennis camp.

123
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.180
I'm doing an intense immersive tennis program at the Human Performance Institute

124
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:58.670
with Jim Layer that's l o e h r and you should definitely check out the human

125
00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:02.960
performance institute with Jim Layer.
It's phenomenal.

126
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.170
And I've been playing my little heart out and tennis,

127
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.430
which I've always wanted to do my entire life for the last two days and have a

128
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.620
few more days to go.
But,
uh,

129
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.480
Maria really piqued my interest in this sport,
which I'd want it to do for so,

130
00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:20.240
so long and put off and I realized,
you know,

131
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:23.090
rather than doing Jujitsu and all these things that break my body,

132
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:27.950
the gentle art,
maybe I should try something like tennis,
golf,
not my speed.

133
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.340
I'd rather just go for a hike.
But tennis.
Yeah,

134
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:33.290
I like the sound of that and I like watching it.

135
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:38.291
So even if just to get a better appreciation of the sports that I can see the

136
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:42.410
nuances and details when watching tennis on TV,

137
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.350
tenish said Sean Connery.
All right,

138
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.520
I need to go have a drink and dinner in any case.
Without further ado,

139
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:53.990
please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with Maria Sharapova.

140
00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.440
<v 2>Maria,
welcome to the show.
Thank you.</v>

141
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:04.750
I am so thrilled that we were able to carve out time and I have so many

142
00:09:04.751 --> 00:09:08.370
questions.
I will start with a rather simple one.

143
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:10.020
I'm sitting here drinking tea,

144
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.600
I'm having it Charleston breakfast tea.

145
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:18.590
And I have heard that you also enjoy tea.
Is that true?

146
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:22.310
And if so,
what type of tea do you prefer?
What are your Goto teas?

147
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.540
<v 3>So I grew up in Russia where t it's a big part of our culture is drinking tea in</v>

148
00:09:30.161 --> 00:09:34.870
the afternoons with your grandparents.
So I drank black tea,
uh,

149
00:09:34.871 --> 00:09:38.740
Darjeeling type of tea that was made in the mountains.

150
00:09:38.741 --> 00:09:42.620
I'm in Siberia and I would have it with,
uh,

151
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.830
with raspberry jam that my grandmother would make.

152
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.360
<v 2>That sounds amazing.</v>

153
00:09:46.361 --> 00:09:49.350
So would you put the GM on a piece of toast and have it or no,

154
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.090
<v 3>I actually,
I put it in my tea</v>

155
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:57.310
<v 4>and I still do that and people look at me very strangely and suspiciously and I</v>

156
00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.613
get it.

157
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.250
<v 3>But I,
it just so many memories of my childhood and yeah,</v>

158
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:05.070
I do that instead of sugar,
which is pretty much the same thing but,

159
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.550
<v 2>but is a lot of messier.
It gives you permission and yeah.
You mentioned Siberia,</v>

160
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:15.630
which is where I want to go next.
You were born in Siberia is,
I understand it,

161
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.820
yes.
But your mother was pregnant with you while in Chernobyl.
Right.

162
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.900
So can you explain what happened exactly?

163
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.690
<v 3>My parents were from gold medal and it was a very small town,</v>

164
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.740
very close to where the Chernobyl reactor blew up.

165
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.510
And during that time,

166
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:38.511
just before my mother was pregnant with me in 1986 and they fled,

167
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.840
um,
there is not a lot of information about what happened during Chernobyl.
Um,

168
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.600
my grandparents were living in Siberia at the time from,

169
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.470
from my mom's side and they said,
you need to get out of there.

170
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.560
They were able to get more information about the disaster itself.

171
00:10:56.561 --> 00:11:00.530
Then my parents were able to get to being so close to,
um,

172
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.930
to the area and,
and they left and that's why I was born in Siberia.

173
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:10.170
<v 2>Your family fled to I guess Russia right after the explosion,</v>

174
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.310
but right.

175
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.810
You ended up and I guess a warmer place or at least depending on the season.

176
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.490
Yes,
much warm.
Right.

177
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.120
<v 4>We're about to,
my parents realized,
well,
this is not going to work out over here.</v>

178
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.980
<v 3>And,
um,
they moved to a resort town,</v>

179
00:11:26.981 --> 00:11:31.450
so ci where it just had the,
the Winter Olympics and,
um,

180
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.171
one of the,

181
00:11:32.171 --> 00:11:35.950
I mean I still consider it one of the most beautiful places to visit because you

182
00:11:35.951 --> 00:11:40.570
have the Black Sea and you have the palm trees in the summer and just an hour

183
00:11:40.571 --> 00:11:44.560
away you have these mountains where the Olympics were held and um,

184
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.070
some of the best king in the world.
And my dad's still skis there all the time.

185
00:11:48.071 --> 00:11:52.030
So yeah,
I definitely,
it's one of the most peaceful places as well.

186
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.140
<v 2>If I to Russia,
I've never visited Russia.
I've always wanted to.</v>

187
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.440
Are there one or two places that I absolutely must visit in your mind there?

188
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.280
Any particular things that I cannot miss?
I know it's a gigantic place.

189
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.870
<v 3>I would say skip Siberia</v>

190
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.360
is definitely not my Stussy or do over there,

191
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.550
but I think from a,
from a cultural standpoint,

192
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.640
I would definitely visit Saint Petersburg.
And,
um,

193
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.340
it is still a place that I've never been to,
if you can believe it or not.

194
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.050
And as much as I've traveled around the world.
But my mom goes almost every year.

195
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.940
Um,
a lot of my relatives are there and I just,
I have this enormous,

196
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.751
you know,

197
00:12:35.751 --> 00:12:40.751
respect for the culture and just the city and the people and the way they live.

198
00:12:40.791 --> 00:12:42.140
It's very different.
And you know,

199
00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:46.430
people always ask me as I was born in Russia and I spent the first seven years

200
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.900
of my life there and I've lived in night in the United States ever since then,

201
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.340
you know,
I've never really looked back into living in Russia,
but so much of,

202
00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:57.980
of my heart still remains there.
And then obviously my,

203
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.750
all of my grandparents and my cousins,
I'm all still live there.

204
00:13:02.751 --> 00:13:04.760
And so it's a very big part of my life.

205
00:13:04.761 --> 00:13:08.400
And when people ask me what I think about the country,
um,
you know,

206
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.640
as much as I want to have an opinion,

207
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:15.590
it is so large and it is so vast and there's so many opinions you can have about

208
00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:19.880
it.
And I really just want to let people experience it on their own and come to

209
00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:22.850
their own conclusions because I think that's one of the greatest things of

210
00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:23.800
travel,
um,

211
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.400
is to not have expectations and to get there and to experience,
um,

212
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.331
and you place.

213
00:13:29.331 --> 00:13:33.380
But Saint Petersburg is on my list and that's definitely a city that comes

214
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.400
highly recommended.

215
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.940
<v 2>Why have you not been there?
And I mean,
maybe it's something like the,</v>

216
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.490
me growing up in New York,

217
00:13:39.491 --> 00:13:43.330
I'd never ever visited the empire state building or the Statue of Liberty until

218
00:13:43.331 --> 00:13:47.860
a friend from Germany visited.
Is it like that or is there another reason?

219
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.010
<v 3>Um,
it's because of my schedule.
Um,
it's so,</v>

220
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.960
I mean I compete 10 months out of the year and it is a pretty much go to the

221
00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.770
same cities every year because the tournament's are all situated in those same

222
00:14:00.771 --> 00:14:03.170
cities.
When I have a holiday break,

223
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.800
which usually consists of a couple of weeks only in November,

224
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.760
I go somewhere warm.
I just escape,
you know,
I put my phone away,

225
00:14:10.761 --> 00:14:13.790
I put just everything on hold a little bit,
um,

226
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.840
and just let my body and my mind recover.
And it just never has been.

227
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.740
Never has come into,
um,
yeah,
into my schedule.

228
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.480
<v 2>We talked about few and of course there's,
there's California,
there's Florida,</v>

229
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:30.340
and then there's Sochi.
So going back to Sochi,

230
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.730
is that where you were first noticed?
Yes.

231
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.690
Can you tell the story of how you were first found as it were,

232
00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:40.700
as it relates to tennis?

233
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.080
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

234
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:47.080
so Sochi in the summer it was very much a happening place.

235
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.770
It was a scene and it was a lot of,
a lot of people were coming there,
vacations.

236
00:14:51.771 --> 00:14:54.080
We had a lot of little parks and um,

237
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.970
outdoor tennis courts and Ferris wheels and all these types of attractions.

238
00:14:58.971 --> 00:15:02.870
And my father,
who was not a great athlete,

239
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:07.160
but he played hockey and in school,
um,
he enjoyed playing tennis.

240
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:10.700
He was not very good at all.
Um,
did it for fun.

241
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:14.820
And when I was old enough to go with him and my mother had me when she was very

242
00:15:14.821 --> 00:15:18.700
young,
she was only 20 years old,
so she was still studying at the time.
So on,

243
00:15:18.701 --> 00:15:21.390
on weekdays when my father didn't have to work,

244
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.720
you would take me with him to the,

245
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.760
the local park and I would just follow along and we take the public bus to the

246
00:15:29.071 --> 00:15:33.960
courts and,
um,
and I just sit there and I'd watch him,
you know,
grind it out with,

247
00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.250
with a competitor of his.
And,
um,
and then I,

248
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.240
I'd see all these little kids playing on,

249
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:43.290
on the side and they were just hitting balls against the wall.
And,
um,

250
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.300
I didn't have,
I mean,
I,
I didn't have a racket of my own and,

251
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.280
and the one that I was able to get with so much bigger than than myself.

252
00:15:50.281 --> 00:15:52.710
So that didn't really work out.
But I,
I immediately,

253
00:15:52.711 --> 00:15:55.650
something like something drew me to it.
Something drew me to this,

254
00:15:55.651 --> 00:16:00.240
like repetitiveness of seeing these kids try to hit the ball against the strings

255
00:16:00.241 --> 00:16:04.560
of the racket and see it come back from the wall.
Um,
and it was very fascinating.

256
00:16:04.561 --> 00:16:08.610
It was like I had this immediate feeling of I want to be in front of those kids

257
00:16:08.611 --> 00:16:12.570
and I want to show them how it's done.
Yeah.
It was a very,

258
00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:14.460
even though I had no idea what I was doing.

259
00:16:14.461 --> 00:16:18.360
So I think that competitiveness kind of develop then where I was just sitting

260
00:16:18.361 --> 00:16:21.570
and board and watching my father play.
Um,

261
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.460
I just wanted to be out there.

262
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:29.170
<v 2>Was it a feeling that you could do it more correctly and just something that you</v>

263
00:16:30.671 --> 00:16:31.040
enjoy?

264
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.850
Who did that you felt intuitively or was it because you noticed flaws in their

265
00:16:35.851 --> 00:16:37.980
technique or things that they were missing?

266
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.220
I'm always curious about this because one of my closest friends,

267
00:16:41.221 --> 00:16:45.360
his name is Josh Waitzkin and the book and the movie searching for Bobby
Fischer,

268
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.920
uh,
we're based on him.

269
00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:49.470
He's thought of as a chess prodigy and he had this experience very,

270
00:16:49.471 --> 00:16:52.290
very early on with chess.
What did it,
I mean,

271
00:16:52.291 --> 00:16:55.140
of course might be difficult to recall what was going through your head at the

272
00:16:55.141 --> 00:16:58.120
time,
but can you elaborate at all?

273
00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.770
<v 3>I think from my perspective,</v>

274
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:05.600
when you're that young and when you don't know anything about that particular

275
00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:08.390
activity or that sport,
and it was tennis and that moment,

276
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.100
it was really this question of,
can I do that?

277
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.670
I see all these kids doing it.
Do I have the ability to be better than them?

278
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:21.350
And after observing for of so much of what my father was doing,

279
00:17:21.351 --> 00:17:23.810
just not on any professional level at all,

280
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:29.410
it just came to my mind that I wanted to do it and I wanted to do it better.

281
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.890
I think there's times in life where things come instinctually and,

282
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.770
and just grasp it and you notice it.

283
00:17:36.771 --> 00:17:41.060
And I think my father definitely noticed I could've kept sitting on that bench

284
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.160
and I just could have kept watching my father.

285
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:47.150
But there's something in me that was,
that said,
no,
I want to be out there.

286
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.670
I want to be playing and I want to be competing and I want to be learning.

287
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.650
And when I got myself out to that,

288
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:57.640
the wall where all the kids were hitting the ball against,
I remember a coach.
Um,

289
00:17:57.641 --> 00:18:01.820
there's one coach there.
Um,
and he all the locals were,

290
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.180
all the children were going to see him,
um,

291
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.650
on the parents wanted him to tell him that,

292
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.920
that they're going to be future stars.
Um,

293
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.860
they're going to be the next Pete Sampras or the next Andre Agassi.

294
00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.280
And he noticed me and only after a couple of weeks and when I was playing and he

295
00:18:20.541 --> 00:18:24.230
pulled my father's side and said that,
uh,
this girl can play tennis.

296
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.440
And after that I started taking lessons with him.

297
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.100
And a couple of years after that,
there was a,

298
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:36.260
an exhibition that Martina Navratilova was a part of and that was about five and

299
00:18:36.261 --> 00:18:40.190
a half years old at that time.
And it,
the exhibition was being held in Moscow.

300
00:18:40.191 --> 00:18:45.191
So my father and I went to Moscow and I was probably one out of 200 kids in that

301
00:18:45.231 --> 00:18:47.810
clinic that she was holding for these kids.

302
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.410
And after hitting a few balls,
I,

303
00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.340
I noticed that she had come up to my father and I don't quite know and what

304
00:18:55.341 --> 00:18:59.150
language they spoke because my father didn't speak any English and I'm pretty

305
00:18:59.151 --> 00:19:01.220
sure she didn't have much Russian.

306
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.980
But between the two and after she left,
um,

307
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.810
I spoke to my father and he said,
well,

308
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:13.760
the sludge and Martina Navratilova just came up to me and said that you're

309
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:14.594
talented.

310
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.460
And this was only after her watching me just hit a couple of balls in the midst

311
00:19:19.461 --> 00:19:23.390
of so many other kids.
And,
and that's,
you know,

312
00:19:23.391 --> 00:19:26.300
I look back at that and I,
cause I see so many kids now.

313
00:19:26.301 --> 00:19:28.850
I practiced at a country club and you know,

314
00:19:28.851 --> 00:19:32.570
there's all these just today I was practicing next to,
um,

315
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.090
two little girls are probably seven or eight years old.

316
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.830
I'm just enjoying the game on by themselves and kind of trying to hit the ball

317
00:19:39.831 --> 00:19:43.760
over the net.
And it's hard to envision that talent.

318
00:19:43.761 --> 00:19:44.930
It's hard to see it.

319
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:50.200
So for her to be able to see that when I was only five and a half years old,

320
00:19:50.201 --> 00:19:51.880
um,
it was pretty incredible.

321
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.830
<v 2>Do you have any idea,
have either of these,</v>

322
00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:01.660
either the first coach or Martina later told you what they saw?

323
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.460
Have you any idea what it was that they picked up on?

324
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.080
<v 3>I haven't spoken to Martina about it too much,</v>

325
00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:11.500
but the first coach that I had in Sochi and I just started playing hand,

326
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:14.320
fortunately passed away,
um,
a few years ago,

327
00:20:14.321 --> 00:20:19.321
but I definitely had this tenacity and I had this will have a focus at a young

328
00:20:21.191 --> 00:20:25.480
age and um,
and tennis is a very repetitive sports,
so you,

329
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.370
it's grinding,
it's just hitting the ball.
And when you're that young,

330
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.950
you're concentration and focus is,
is just all over the place.
You play with,

331
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.240
with the ball for a few minutes and then you want to play with a truck or you

332
00:20:40.241 --> 00:20:41.410
want to play with a doll.

333
00:20:41.411 --> 00:20:46.411
And the consistency in your mind is very limited.

334
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:51.550
Um,
at least that's what,
when I observe kids,
which is completely normal,

335
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:52.450
but I had this,

336
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:57.870
I had this fascination with being able to hit the ball and seeing somebody else

337
00:20:58.151 --> 00:21:01.700
had it back at me and trying to find a way.
Um,
and,

338
00:21:01.701 --> 00:21:05.530
and the racket that I first had was actually,
we had to cut the grip.

339
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:09.880
I like four or five inches because it was,
it was so much bigger than I was.

340
00:21:09.881 --> 00:21:12.160
And I could barely hold it and it was so heavy.

341
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.900
And so it's just this really funny scene of me trying to figure out how to,

342
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.410
cause when you're just given a ball and a racket and like,
well,

343
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:23.620
what do I do with this now?
Um,
so I just picked her myself.

344
00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:26.230
They're just trying to find a way to get the ball over the net.

345
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:30.820
And I had this determination of,
of doing it better and better every day.

346
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:33.250
And I,
and I stuck to it.
I,
it was never,

347
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:38.050
I don't remember one day where I didn't want to go down the steps of our

348
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:42.970
apartment and walk the 20 minutes uphill to get to the bus station and then have

349
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:46.780
to change buses to them at the next station.
There's never a day where I said,

350
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:50.890
you know what?
I don't,
I don't want to do it.
Um,
and I think there's,

351
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.670
you know,
that's not something that just,
that you have,

352
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.480
that you can really teach or that,
you know,
you could develop it.
Um,

353
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:02.350
but I think I just,
I really loved it and I carry that passion.

354
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.960
<v 2>This idea that you were able to hold constant in your mind,</v>

355
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.820
this fascination of tennis and practice consistently.

356
00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.090
What did your context for myself,

357
00:22:14.091 --> 00:22:17.660
what did your dad do for work and you mentioned your mother was studying.

358
00:22:17.661 --> 00:22:20.860
What was she studying?
If you could tell us a little bit about them.

359
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.820
<v 3>She was studying communications and business and I had a very interesting</v>

360
00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:30.070
childhood because my parents were both,

361
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.570
they're very young and they had no knowledge.
Um,
you know what to do.

362
00:22:34.571 --> 00:22:36.820
I was the first child,
I'm still the only child,

363
00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:41.821
but they were very careful of what the decisions that they made and where I was

364
00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:46.120
going to go and if I was going to go to kindergarten or how long they wanted me

365
00:22:46.121 --> 00:22:46.691
to be there.

366
00:22:46.691 --> 00:22:51.280
And I spent so many hours in the library with my mother while she was doing her

367
00:22:51.281 --> 00:22:55.000
homework or she was studying for an exam.

368
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.350
And then I'd go with my father when he will usually play tennis.
I'm my father.

369
00:22:59.351 --> 00:23:03.370
Worked in construction,
had a fairly normal job.

370
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:07.000
I would say we were an average family.
I'm getting support from,

371
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.880
from both of our grandparents,
from my mom's and my dad's side.
And you know,

372
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.480
we lived a very basic and you know,
at that time a very normal life.

373
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.950
<v 2>Did they expose you to a lot of other things besides tennis?</v>

374
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.160
Something's you had zero interest in and you had that kid like distraction or

375
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:32.580
Adhd,
like inability to focus or jumpy focus.

376
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.790
And then tennis was the one thing that you gravitated towards and really locked

377
00:23:35.791 --> 00:23:38.360
onto or where you like that with everything?

378
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.450
<v 3>Well,
it,
it happens so fast.</v>

379
00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:44.890
And because I had only started picking up the tennis track when I was four years

380
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.150
old at the age of six and a half,

381
00:23:47.151 --> 00:23:51.110
I was already on an I or a slot flight to America,

382
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.430
<v 4>so.
Right.</v>

383
00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.440
So you didn't have time to really test other things.

384
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:03.540
And I love the,
I love to play with dolls.
I love to play

385
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.350
<v 3>doctor.
I love to read.</v>

386
00:24:05.351 --> 00:24:09.100
My mother was very much into education and she's,
um,

387
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.950
she didn't want anything to do with tennis.

388
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:13.630
She didn't want anything to do with sports.

389
00:24:13.631 --> 00:24:18.210
She danced ballet a little bit and she was,

390
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:21.760
she brought a lot of the cultural,
um,
the educational,

391
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:26.260
the learning and the growing in your mind experiences to me.

392
00:24:26.261 --> 00:24:31.261
I mean she would read passages and the novels that I was way too young to

393
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.550
understand.
Um,

394
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.700
but she made me memorize a lot of those passages and something about that,

395
00:24:40.751 --> 00:24:43.600
that repetitiveness.
I never,
I never liked to do it,

396
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.100
but it was a sense of discipline that,

397
00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:49.450
that she taught me in a way that had nothing to do with sport.

398
00:24:49.451 --> 00:24:51.400
And I think that really,
I mean,

399
00:24:51.401 --> 00:24:56.401
I would spend an hour in the evening just memorizing these poems by Pushkin and

400
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.190
thinking to myself,
what am I ever going to use this?
And little do you know,

401
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.600
with years and especially now that I'm older,
you know,

402
00:25:07.601 --> 00:25:09.970
discipline doesn't always come so easy in it.

403
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.620
You have to build its foundations and you have to build the trust with the

404
00:25:14.621 --> 00:25:15.970
people that help you with it.

405
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.840
And I think her influence and her ability to,

406
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.940
to acknowledge that as a young mom was so inspirational and that that

407
00:25:24.941 --> 00:25:25.774
discipline,

408
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.280
it really comes into play as a tennis player because you have to have so much of

409
00:25:30.281 --> 00:25:34.300
it.
I mean their sacrifice and there's,
they're the long days,

410
00:25:34.301 --> 00:25:39.301
but the discipline that you have to carry on with whether it's a good day or bad

411
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.650
day,
um,
just beats everything else.

412
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:47.070
<v 2>So I got chills about 47 seconds ago because I'm looking at the time because I</v>

413
00:25:50.291 --> 00:25:54.840
found what I was digging for and it,
I wasn't looking for any particular answer,

414
00:25:54.841 --> 00:25:59.841
but I want to underscore a few things that you said for people who might be

415
00:26:00.271 --> 00:26:05.271
parents because of the 250 plus interviews that I've done for this podcast,

416
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.810
there are a couple of patterns that have emerged in people who've become really,

417
00:26:08.811 --> 00:26:12.330
really,
really good at something really early.
And ultimately you,

418
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:16.240
I really mastered anything even if at that age,
10,
15,
20.

419
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.510
So the first is that I've noticed,
and it's not for everyone,

420
00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:24.511
but their parents hawk to them at least part of the time about subject matter

421
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.530
above their heads,
so to speak,
or as adults.

422
00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.930
And number two is a lot of exposure to books.

423
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.800
Number three was what you brought up in.
This is what I got excited about,

424
00:26:36.801 --> 00:26:40.580
which is developing a tolerance for repetition.

425
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.770
And in some cases for that type of,
uh,

426
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:46.000
I'm not going to say boredom,

427
00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:51.030
but lack of a variety in some capacity because I think that that,

428
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:52.014
like you said,
your,

429
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.650
your training that so that it can then be applied to other things.

430
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:56.071
So you might say,

431
00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:59.370
why am I memorizing these poems is I'm never going to use these poems.

432
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:01.280
But at the same time,

433
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:06.290
you're developing the ability to at the thousands of hours that you're going to

434
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:08.360
put into hitting a ball against a wall.

435
00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:13.430
<v 3>Yes.
And it's the,
it's the persistence that you're building.
It's the will that,</v>

436
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.880
I mean,
I,
oh,
I believe in any job that we do,

437
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.660
any work that we have in front of us.
Um,

438
00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.380
there's a lot of moments that are,

439
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.310
that we look forward to are there projects that we love and that we want to be a

440
00:27:27.311 --> 00:27:30.640
part of.
But then there's the,
the tedious work.

441
00:27:30.641 --> 00:27:35.641
There's the things that the repetition as a tennis player where you have to just

442
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.280
where it's all numbers and where it's just a feeling that you get to a certain

443
00:27:39.281 --> 00:27:43.960
number and you just feel it and you let go and you don't think,
and that's time,

444
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.900
you know,
and that it's you,
you could say,
I don't want to do it.

445
00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.000
I want to stop.
I don't want you feeding me any more balls.
But that,

446
00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:56.350
that mental persistence,
um,
I do think you could,

447
00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:00.010
you can develop earlier.
I certainly was able to,
um,

448
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.400
with the help of my mother and,
and also,
I mean I,

449
00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.760
when you're young do,
and she was a very young parent and you know,

450
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:11.830
with the help of her mother and also culturally,

451
00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:16.750
I would say 30 years ago or 25 years ago,
it was very different.

452
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.650
And I felt like I was in her cocoon and I was,

453
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.500
I was grown up in her hands,

454
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.030
which also I think explains the bond that we have today and like the friendship

455
00:28:28.031 --> 00:28:29.980
that we were able to have from that.

456
00:28:29.981 --> 00:28:34.540
And I think that's one of the most important things in my life.
Um,
as I,

457
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.850
as I travel around the world today and I,

458
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.890
I eat a lot of young girls and boys,
um,
whether they play tennis or not,

459
00:28:41.891 --> 00:28:46.330
and I hear their stories and so much of their experiences,

460
00:28:46.331 --> 00:28:50.560
um,
is a very tough and rough childhood where they want to,

461
00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.660
they almost want to escape from,
from what what they knew as their family.

462
00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.240
And so sad.

463
00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:01.090
I'm personally because the experience that I had in my childhood and,

464
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.420
and it was not,
I'm not saying it was all butterflies and rainbows.

465
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.283
Um,

466
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:12.060
but as I look back at that experience and how they were handling that situation,

467
00:29:12.061 --> 00:29:15.270
how they were sacrificing so much for myself,

468
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.860
created this bond within my family that was very important.
Um,

469
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.300
and it's,
it's priceless.

470
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:25.080
And I know that those are not the people that we thought we were able to choose

471
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:27.840
in our life,
but they are the people that know us the best.
And,

472
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.770
and that relationship,
um,
can do so many wonders in your life

473
00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:36.780
<v 2>because I feel like your mom is such an important figure in relationship.</v>

474
00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:41.850
I notice that you've been reading memoirs written by women and feel free to

475
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:45.670
correct anything I get wrong,
but most notably love warrior by Glennon,

476
00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:48.010
Doyle Melton and Jeannette walls,

477
00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:51.610
the glass castle and you called them very strong,

478
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:55.960
tough emotional books and quote.
What did,
what did those two books mean to you?

479
00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:00.940
Why were they puff and emotional?
What did you take away from that?

480
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.500
<v 3>I'm very,
I get very inspired by women.</v>

481
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:09.270
I get very inspired by their,
their brain,

482
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.130
by their actions,
by their toughness.
Um,

483
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:18.590
I think in today's world and in today's working environment,

484
00:30:18.631 --> 00:30:22.150
and I faced this a lot in my sport where,
you know,

485
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:25.830
I could be going into a press conference six times in a week and I'm faced with

486
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:28.650
equality questions and,
um,
you know,

487
00:30:28.651 --> 00:30:32.520
you almost have your back against the wall so many times and you have to explain

488
00:30:32.521 --> 00:30:36.130
yourself and you feel that you've done it so many times.
And

489
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.650
<v 2>can you explain that just for a second in terms of explaining yourself for</v>

490
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.350
quality questions?
Would you tell us a little bit more about that?

491
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:47.420
<v 3>Yeah,
we,
I mean,
quality has been a big,
a big subject in women's tennis for,</v>

492
00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:52.250
for many,
many years.
And,
um,
Venus Williams and Serena,
myself,
um,

493
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:57.670
have done an incredible job of getting to where we are today with the helps of

494
00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.421
the pioneer.

495
00:30:58.421 --> 00:31:03.421
Billie Jean King was the reason why we would make such an incredible living from

496
00:31:03.881 --> 00:31:06.590
what we do.
And the one thing that we,
as,

497
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.730
as professional athletes have to realize is we're not just,

498
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.120
we're not only fighting to win a tennis match,

499
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:17.440
we're also fighting to be an example.
We're fighting for our voice.

500
00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:21.500
We're fighting to have a pedestal to create that pedestal and,

501
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:26.810
and to raise awareness of how incredible and how difficult and how each path is

502
00:31:26.921 --> 00:31:30.850
so unique and personal and how we're all able to come through it.

503
00:31:30.851 --> 00:31:32.830
How we are able to share our stories,

504
00:31:32.831 --> 00:31:37.270
who are able to inspire other people and not just the women,
it's the women and,

505
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.490
and men as well.
Um,
do we get enough credit for it?
I don't believe so.

506
00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:46.980
And when I say that,
that's what we have to explain.
I believe that that's,

507
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.150
that that's the feeling that I have at least.

508
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:53.530
And I don't feel that we have the amount of support that,

509
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.120
that we should be having.

510
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.180
<v 2>Yeah.
Okay.
Learned man,</v>

511
00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.810
I guess would be the easiest way to put it today.

512
00:32:02.811 --> 00:32:07.630
And asking him for advice or on a,
on a few things.
And he said that,
uh,

513
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.520
to help the greatest number of people become an example.
So,
in other words,

514
00:32:11.521 --> 00:32:15.550
you don't have to work hand in hand with each individual person,

515
00:32:15.551 --> 00:32:20.551
but if you have the visibility and exposure as you do to become an example of

516
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.280
potential,
I think that's extremely important.

517
00:32:24.281 --> 00:32:28.880
But it had very unusual beginnings,
all of this in many respects.
Right.

518
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:33.680
And you ended up at a very young age at the Nick Bullet,

519
00:32:33.681 --> 00:32:36.560
Teary Tennis Academy in the U S which is produced,

520
00:32:36.561 --> 00:32:39.740
you mentioned the Williams sisters,
Andre Agassi,
Becker.

521
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.540
<v 3>How did you end up there?
And,
uh,</v>

522
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.640
could you tell us a bit about the coaching methodology because that's always

523
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:52.280
what I'm just so endlessly fascinated by.

524
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.360
My father's point of view after that children's clinic that Martina Navratilova

525
00:32:58.701 --> 00:33:01.070
held was tennis is not,

526
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.960
it was not a big sport at that time in Russia.
We didn't have many champions.

527
00:33:05.961 --> 00:33:07.430
I'm coming out of the country,

528
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:12.310
I believe at the time it was Ucheni Kafelnikov and Anna Kournikova.
Um,

529
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.770
but other than that,
it was hockey.
It was figure skating.

530
00:33:15.771 --> 00:33:20.000
It was all the winter Olympic sports.
And I mean,
one,

531
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:22.160
it was very expensive to,

532
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.910
to find the right coaches to find the right facilities.

533
00:33:25.911 --> 00:33:27.320
Especially in the winter time.

534
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:32.890
So the only real option was America and my father started reading books and

535
00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:38.180
studying the game and he knew that he wasn't a tennis coach and he knew that he

536
00:33:38.181 --> 00:33:41.990
wasn't a great tennis player.
And the smart,

537
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.080
I would say one of the biggest gifts that my father gave me,

538
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:46.640
and it started from a very young age,

539
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:51.470
was that he realized that he wasn't the one that was going to be my main coach.

540
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.220
He wasn't the one that knew everything or believed to know everything.

541
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.900
He wanted to get the help from others.
And so he started doing research.

542
00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:03.770
And next thing I knew just before my seventh birthday,

543
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:06.860
I was on a flight to um,
to Miami,
Florida.

544
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.460
And from there we made this crazy bus journey four hours north to the voluntary

545
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:18.730
academy and Bradenton,
Florida,
which has,
as you just mentioned,
so many of the,

546
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:24.500
the stars,
um,
past and present and future.
At the moment,

547
00:34:24.501 --> 00:34:25.880
it's really a factory,

548
00:34:25.881 --> 00:34:28.730
this tennis factory that's grown into other sports as well.

549
00:34:28.731 --> 00:34:33.470
But at the time it was very tennis specific and Nicola Terry was someone that

550
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:38.040
came with a lot of experience and coaching experience and he has a person was a,

551
00:34:38.041 --> 00:34:42.170
a mentor to me more than anything.
Um,
with the guidance,

552
00:34:42.171 --> 00:34:46.620
with this experience of seeing so many people come in and out.
Um,

553
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:49.550
so many people come in wanting to be champions,
turned into,

554
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.960
turned into good some,

555
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:54.830
some people come in and they turn into great and some just turn into champions

556
00:34:54.831 --> 00:34:57.320
and,
and he's seen it all.
So,
you know,

557
00:34:57.321 --> 00:35:02.210
knocking at the door of Nick Bollettieri Academy and the dead of the night was

558
00:35:02.211 --> 00:35:05.390
probably one of the toughest moments in that journey.

559
00:35:05.391 --> 00:35:09.050
And it really began there and they told us there was a little too,

560
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:12.950
too late or a little too early to be knocking it an academy door.

561
00:35:12.951 --> 00:35:17.951
So they sent us to a hotel and we ended up coming back in the morning and they

562
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:23.141
put me in a group of kids with probably six or seven kids and instructor watched

563
00:35:23.351 --> 00:35:27.950
me hit a few balls and called over nick voluntary and said,
um,

564
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.230
you have to see this girl play.
And then,
um,

565
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:35.090
nick saw me play and that's kind of where it took off

566
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.220
place.
So special.

567
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.830
<v 2>And I ask,
because I always wonder,</v>

568
00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:43.680
I mean in the beginning there must've been something special in the sauce

569
00:35:43.681 --> 00:35:44.460
because there,

570
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.670
there comes a point where the best in the world gravitate to your center if

571
00:35:47.671 --> 00:35:49.200
you've produced a lot of champions.

572
00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:54.140
So then there's a question of is it created or is it,

573
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.890
uh,
sort of a selection bias,

574
00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:59.630
but what makes that place unique in terms of training,

575
00:35:59.631 --> 00:36:02.570
in terms of principles or,
or anything that makes it

576
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.540
<v 3>damn.
Yeah,
that's a great,
that's a great question because it's,</v>

577
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:09.680
I see it in two different ways and from a positive view,

578
00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:13.760
I saw it and I still see it as,
first of all,
it's,

579
00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.540
it's located in a place where there's nothing else to do.

580
00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.730
So you are,

581
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:24.320
you're going there to be committed to become a tennis player or another sport

582
00:36:24.321 --> 00:36:28.790
that you might be practicing over there.
Um,
do you have no distractions?

583
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.460
The second greatest thing about it is the amounts of,

584
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.850
of kids that were there that were older than I,

585
00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:39.170
it was against whom I was able to compete.

586
00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.080
And so every afternoon,
six days a week,

587
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:45.260
I would play matches against them and I would play sets.

588
00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.260
And it was the best learning experience because

589
00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:50.780
creating that,

590
00:36:50.781 --> 00:36:55.110
understanding what you do and who you are as a tennis player and,

591
00:36:55.111 --> 00:36:57.710
and those mechanics,
the basics,
the mind,

592
00:36:57.711 --> 00:37:02.150
the brain of setting up the next shot,
um,
before you even hit it,

593
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:07.550
that knowledge you get by playing.
And so I had this,
this opportunity.

594
00:37:07.551 --> 00:37:11.320
I'd play kid from China.
I play kid from Europe,
um,
that were,

595
00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:14.540
I was most likely I was one.
I was not most likely,

596
00:37:14.541 --> 00:37:17.690
it was one of the youngest ones at the academy.
I at one point,

597
00:37:17.691 --> 00:37:20.240
I wasn't even allowed to board there because I was so young.

598
00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:25.840
And so I had this incredible experience of coming in terms of competition,

599
00:37:26.361 --> 00:37:29.600
of seeing someone across the net that was two feet higher than I was,

600
00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.190
that was stronger than I was.

601
00:37:31.191 --> 00:37:34.340
And I had to figure out how to beat them if I wanted to,
you know,

602
00:37:34.341 --> 00:37:38.960
have my self esteem or be confident or be a better player.
And,

603
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:43.220
um,
and the other great thing was that nick himself,

604
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.240
he knew what to say and he knew when to say it.

605
00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:51.600
And I think you can be a great coach and I've,

606
00:37:51.601 --> 00:37:55.310
I've had many throughout my career,
but they're not very good business people.

607
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:56.143
And Nick,

608
00:37:56.510 --> 00:38:01.400
nick understood that you only need just a handful,

609
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:02.570
maybe a couple or,

610
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:07.760
or a few players that could really make the academy what it is.

611
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.910
And,
you know,

612
00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:14.960
I boarded with eight other girls for a long period of time and,

613
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.430
and they weren't excited to be there.
They knew that that wasn't their future.

614
00:38:19.431 --> 00:38:22.160
They sometimes didn't even know if that was their college future,

615
00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:27.680
but the money that was going into that academy based because of why they were

616
00:38:27.681 --> 00:38:30.100
there and practicing and competing,
um,

617
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:34.850
was the reason why nick Bolletieri was so,
so smart.

618
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:40.210
Um,
and when you needed him,
he was there.
I mean,
5:00 AM he's there on the courts.

619
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.910
He's the one that locks the place until this day.

620
00:38:42.911 --> 00:38:47.680
And that dedication and that love and passion for what you do.

621
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:51.610
I mean,
that's,
it's incredible.
I just saw him a few months ago.

622
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:53.670
I spent a few weeks,
their training,
um,

623
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.420
part of my comeback and he was out every single day.

624
00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.620
He'd come out for a few minutes,
he'd sit down next to me,
he'd,
you know,

625
00:39:02.621 --> 00:39:05.260
he'd speak to me like I was 10 years old again.
And,

626
00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.770
and he's the same nick as he was.
It's so rare.

627
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:12.480
It's really rare to see that.
And I go there for the same reasons.

628
00:39:12.481 --> 00:39:16.570
I go there because of the atmosphere,
because you see other athletes and,

629
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:21.630
and it doesn't matter if they're,
if they're in college,
if they're young,

630
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.530
if they're not going to make it just to be in the environment of everyone

631
00:39:25.531 --> 00:39:30.080
training with a purpose,
it makes you better,
it makes you,
um,

632
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.490
I love playing in front of,
you know,
little crowd would,

633
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:36.840
we'll kind of get around the court that I was practicing on and since I hadn't

634
00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:40.140
been in competition for a long period of time,
it was so great to just,

635
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.130
to have people huddle around the court and watch my every move.

636
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.800
And I felt that adrenaline again.
Um,

637
00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.740
because usually in between tournaments I like to practice where it's a little

638
00:39:49.741 --> 00:39:54.180
bit more private and will quiet and was at a tournament,
you know,
it's a zoo

639
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:59.330
<v 1>compared to being in a cage of a zoo where everyone's around doing</v>

640
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:05.690
this sort of no escape until someone just takes you out on a golf cart and,

641
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:07.270
and away you go.

642
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:11.110
<v 3>So,
um,
when I'm home,
whether it's in Florida or California,</v>

643
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.220
I just love the stillness and the quietness of just being on my own.

644
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.390
I don't have a court,
but I go to a country club that I practice on a corner or,

645
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.860
or I trained at a private court as well and just have your peace and quiet a

646
00:40:23.861 --> 00:40:25.660
little bit just to have your mind,

647
00:40:25.661 --> 00:40:29.770
only see your team and the members of your team and then do your work.
And we um,

648
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.130
but being there for that period of time was brought back.
So many memories.

649
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:38.630
<v 1>So a few things.
Number one,
nick,
I'm sorry,
I always mispronounce your name.</v>

650
00:40:38.631 --> 00:40:41.570
Anytime I try to say it.
I always,

651
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.420
I think part of my spirit wants to be Italian,

652
00:40:44.421 --> 00:40:47.130
so I try to really throw a spin on it and say what a theory.
But it's,

653
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.950
I always make that mistake.
Love that you said,
but he said he would love that.

654
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:55.160
Okay.
He goes to this little Italian restaurant every single,

655
00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.670
every single day of the week,
so he would absolutely fantastic.
All right,

656
00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.710
well then you're welcome nick.
Not I'm sorry.

657
00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.330
The next question is related to your experience.

658
00:41:05.331 --> 00:41:07.970
Early on you mentioned that you had these giants across the net.

659
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:12.750
Meanwhile you're this tiny kid holding this gigantic broadsword basically

660
00:41:12.751 --> 00:41:14.550
because it's so big compared to your body.

661
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.940
I've heard that you had some experienced being teased when you arrived in the u

662
00:41:21.301 --> 00:41:26.301
s and I'd love to hear you talk about that if to any particular examples come to

663
00:41:28.131 --> 00:41:31.210
mind and just talk about what effect it had on you.
Because w w what,

664
00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.430
what I have just been mesmerized

665
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.530
<v 2>might sound weird,
so don't take it as being creepy,</v>

666
00:41:36.531 --> 00:41:41.531
but like just just focused on when I watch you play and compete is just the

667
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:44.690
toughness.
And you mentioned the grinding and just the,

668
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:48.720
the toughness that I see as something that I'd like to explore.

669
00:41:48.721 --> 00:41:52.200
So could you talk about the,
the teasing when you got to the u s

670
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:56.930
<v 3>I very much felt like I was an outcast from the beginning.
And one of the,</v>

671
00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:01.080
the reasons was because I had arrived in America with my father and,

672
00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:05.670
and our story just didn't make sense to anyone.
So from the very beginning,

673
00:42:05.671 --> 00:42:10.080
everyone just assumed we were crazy,
which if I look at that now,
yes,

674
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:14.340
we were absolutely there.
This is my,
my parents decision was crazy.

675
00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:17.730
The fact that we come to America and you have the seven year old girl with a

676
00:42:17.731 --> 00:42:22.730
dream to become a tennis player,
that's never going to work out.
And,
and so I,
I,

677
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.900
I,
I sense that.
I felt that I felt that I was different.

678
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:31.901
I always felt like I was there on a different mission and because I was one of

679
00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:37.220
the youngest ones,
I never had the same interest as the other girls.

680
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:42.221
And I always knew that my interest and my passion was very different to theirs.

681
00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:46.760
And while I boarded at the academy,

682
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.530
I am over coming back,
um,
and you know,

683
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.780
from practice and my little locker would be open and,

684
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:58.840
and the only thing I had in that locker was this giant jar of a little animal

685
00:42:58.841 --> 00:42:59.674
crackers

686
00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:03.030
<v 4>and the fuel of champions,</v>

687
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:09.040
which by the Diet these days has changed tremendously.

688
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.760
I don't even know where to look when dot when you died is coming on next.

689
00:43:14.761 --> 00:43:19.761
But back then I just remembered that giant jar of animal crackers that I believe

690
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:24.290
<v 3>a friend from the academy gave me for my birthday.</v>

691
00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:26.150
And that's the only thing I had in that locker.

692
00:43:26.151 --> 00:43:28.160
And I didn't have many belongings.

693
00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:32.240
I didn't have a lot of outfits or skirts that the girls had.

694
00:43:32.241 --> 00:43:35.720
I didn't really have anyone to do my hair or braid my hair.
You know,

695
00:43:35.721 --> 00:43:40.490
my father would sit me down and I'm on a chair and just cut my bangs straight

696
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:44.450
across and they never look great.
Obviously you didn't know doing okay.

697
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.480
And so it was always a little off.

698
00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.030
I speak English in the beginning.
Um,

699
00:43:51.031 --> 00:43:55.410
I was learning through just speaking with all the other kids cause they,

700
00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:00.060
they talk so much,
you just pick it up and you learn.
And um,

701
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:05.510
it just made me feel very much alone.
It was,
um,

702
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.140
not that I didn't have it,

703
00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:12.330
it felt like I had a lot in common because we were all there to play tennis,

704
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.220
but it's a mission that I was on and I felt like I was,
was very different.

705
00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.173
Um,

706
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.300
and it wasn't that I had to be a champion or I didn't have to be a champion.

707
00:44:24.281 --> 00:44:28.360
It was that I was learning and I was growing to be a better tennis player.

708
00:44:28.361 --> 00:44:30.820
And I didn't know where that would take me,

709
00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:33.600
but knew that in order to get there,

710
00:44:33.601 --> 00:44:37.740
I had to wake up at 6:00 AM and I had to practice to the day and then I would

711
00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:42.570
take a 30 minute naps from 12 to 1230 and at 1:00 PM I'd be back playing matches

712
00:44:42.571 --> 00:44:44.940
and sets until four or five.

713
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:48.450
And then I have a little bit of homework and then I have to do it again.

714
00:44:48.451 --> 00:44:53.010
And so there was a lot of other interests that the girls had and then posters

715
00:44:53.011 --> 00:44:56.190
and glitter and pictures and David Hasselhoff,

716
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:01.470
Janet Jackson,
and,
and I had no clue.

717
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:06.390
None of those was at the time.
And so it was just a stranger.

718
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:10.890
I was sort of in my own little bubble from,
from a very young age.
Um,

719
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:16.320
and I,
I look back in those moments and I,
I've gotten that question a lot.
Like,

720
00:45:16.321 --> 00:45:18.430
how did you feel?
Did you feel lonely?
Um,

721
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.720
and one of the other things was that I didn't go to America with my mother

722
00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:22.890
because she didn't have a visa.

723
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:26.730
So I spent the first two years in America without seeing my mom at all.

724
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.870
And I,
I look back at that time and I,

725
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.590
there's nothing about it that it's sad.
Obviously.

726
00:45:34.591 --> 00:45:39.290
It was very sad to not have that,
that support and not have your,
your mother,
um,

727
00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.680
cut,
cut your bangs.

728
00:45:40.681 --> 00:45:45.060
And so instead of your father or him buy you shoes that are so ugly and you

729
00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:47.430
can't,
you don't,
you don't know how to tell him,

730
00:45:47.431 --> 00:45:50.100
but he doesn't have enough money to buy you a better pair,

731
00:45:50.101 --> 00:45:53.940
so you just keep your mouth shut.
Um,
it just,

732
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:57.690
it didn't feel,
it didn't feel like we were doing the wrong thing.

733
00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:02.810
I felt like I was on this path that I was meant to be on and I didn't feel

734
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:04.650
lonely.
I didn't feel sad.

735
00:46:04.651 --> 00:46:09.000
It was a lonely time because I look at that and of course I wasn't outcast.

736
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:14.570
But when you're on a mission to do something or be something and it's not so

737
00:46:15.991 --> 00:46:18.450
much about success,
I think it's just,
you know,

738
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:22.290
we always think of like having a vision and of course we have goals and we

739
00:46:22.291 --> 00:46:23.490
planted in our minds,

740
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:28.890
but I never remember one time when my father told me that I had to win Wimbledon

741
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.660
or that I had to win the US Open.

742
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.860
He never made me feel like if I didn't that the world would end.

743
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:38.820
And I always remember thinking that if this doesn't work out,

744
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:39.870
we would go to Russia.

745
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:44.190
And that's absolutely fine cause I felt like I had a completely normal childhood

746
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.610
when I was living there.
Did you feel any pressure

747
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.823
in the

748
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:58.990
recognition of what they were sacrificing for you to take a stab at tennis?

749
00:46:59.131 --> 00:47:02.340
Or was that just not a factor at all?
Whatever they did,

750
00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:05.070
they never made me feel like it was.

751
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:10.430
And I think that's one of the reasons why I never felt the pressure of having

752
00:47:11.101 --> 00:47:14.400
to,
when things are having to earn money,
I,

753
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:19.260
I knew that I didn't know how much money I could earn.
I,

754
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.980
I was never really interested in that.
I,

755
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.860
I didn't know anything that would come with being successful with being a

756
00:47:25.861 --> 00:47:29.290
successful tennis player.
And you never really do.

757
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:33.370
And I think that's one of the great things in life is that you,
you don't know.

758
00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:34.111
And that it's,

759
00:47:34.111 --> 00:47:37.870
it's an experience and it's for you to experience and for you to acknowledge and

760
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:41.350
for you to learn from it.
And whether you want to take it or not,
that's,

761
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:45.250
that's up to you.
It's in your own hands.
But the fact that they gave me this,

762
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.990
this opportunity to create a life for myself,
um,

763
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.170
is incredible.
And now when my father's,

764
00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:57.430
my father remained kind of the leader and the coach of,
um,

765
00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.700
of my tennis until I was 21 years old,

766
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.070
he traveled with me to every single tournament.

767
00:48:03.071 --> 00:48:07.720
And after I won my third Grand Slam was,
um,
very mutually.

768
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:09.640
Um,
he decided to stop and,

769
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.130
and now he's on a permanent vacation and he thinks he's training for the senior

770
00:48:15.131 --> 00:48:19.750
Olympics and he loves to ski and hike and do all those great things.

771
00:48:19.751 --> 00:48:21.700
And I,
and I'm so happy.

772
00:48:21.701 --> 00:48:26.470
And it makes me just incredibly grateful that I can support that.

773
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.460
And I that I can do that for my mom,
that I could do that for my dad,

774
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:34.090
that they for,
for my extended family.
And um,

775
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.460
and they're the reason why I'm able to do that

776
00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:44.530
rejection or that you don't believe in that word.

777
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:49.390
Is that true?
Well,
I don't,
I mean it's a very,

778
00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:54.950
it's a very tough word to believe in.
It's a very tough word to,

779
00:48:54.951 --> 00:48:58.420
except I think one of the reasons is,
is because I,

780
00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:03.690
I saw in many different scenarios where my father would say no because he would

781
00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:08.470
open up an opportunity to say yes.
And

782
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.800
so there are many situations,

783
00:49:14.801 --> 00:49:19.801
whether it was a coaching opportunity or whether it was receiving money from

784
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:21.040
agency,

785
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:26.730
he had this ability to say no to the things that seem like they made sense,

786
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:32.190
like the easy way out because he believed that later he'd have a better

787
00:49:32.891 --> 00:49:36.190
opportunity to say yes to bigger and greater things.

788
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:42.360
Shiny objects fall at the time.
I'm sure they didn't seem so smart.

789
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.300
Not Smart.
SMART,
right.

790
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:51.490
The short term shiny objects,
right.
So junction,
it wasn't,

791
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:56.050
um,
there was never a cause I always have,

792
00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:01.060
I mean I always was following and kind of next to my father and seeing the

793
00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:06.600
decisions that he would make a,
I was only a kid and even when I won,

794
00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:08.830
I won Wimbledon.
I was only 17 years old.

795
00:50:08.831 --> 00:50:12.770
You're still a kid and you're still following the guidance and you know,

796
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.540
I'd win a match following that and I'd call it or I'd want to turn them in and I

797
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.970
go shopping in a store and I would call my mom cause I something like quite

798
00:50:21.971 --> 00:50:24.790
pricey.
And I,
I didn't know if I could buy it.

799
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:29.290
Still asking permission even though I had earned that money,

800
00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:33.710
if I could purchase a piece of jewelry or shoes or whatever it was at the time

801
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:34.371
that I wanted.

802
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:39.371
So I was always watching and observing and they never rejection.

803
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:45.080
I mean you're of course when someone says no to you,
it's easy to say,

804
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:47.150
Oh yes I was,
I was rejected.

805
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:52.280
But if you can open up a different opportunity from that point of view,

806
00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.640
then you're turning a no into something that's,

807
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:58.250
that brought you to a better place.

808
00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:01.430
It sounds like you did that with your interactions with

809
00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:08.570
players who were boarding at Nick's tennis academy.

810
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:14.730
Yeah.
Do you consider yourself an introvert and extrovert?
The blend?

811
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.300
How do you think about that?

812
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:21.640
I think from a very young age because of sort of the process that I,

813
00:51:22.191 --> 00:51:23.710
that I went through,
um,

814
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:29.080
and the success that I earned from a young age and winning a major and a grand

815
00:51:31.131 --> 00:51:34.700
slam at such a young age.
And because it became so unexpected,

816
00:51:34.701 --> 00:51:37.810
I went from being someone that was,
you know,

817
00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:42.830
that someone that people scout it to being someone that everyone had analyzed

818
00:51:43.071 --> 00:51:46.130
and knew about and wanted to know more of.

819
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:50.900
And I created this.
Um,
no,
I,

820
00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:55.160
I definitely put on these horse blinders because if I had not,

821
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:58.390
my mind would have been everywhere and I,

822
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:03.400
I think it would have been so easy to be distracted and in those moments and

823
00:52:04.911 --> 00:52:09.640
situations and be pulled in different directions.
Which a Hudson,

824
00:52:09.641 --> 00:52:12.590
it's a slippery slope.
It's very dangerous.

825
00:52:12.591 --> 00:52:17.591
And as a young girl it could have been a disaster to say the least.

826
00:52:18.261 --> 00:52:21.380
And so I definitely remember,

827
00:52:21.381 --> 00:52:25.470
I remember the moment and it was just a few matches before I won level.

828
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:29.300
Then why are sitting down with my coach and all of a sudden they think it was

829
00:52:29.301 --> 00:52:34.220
before the semi finals of the tournament and all these tourists who had gotten

830
00:52:34.221 --> 00:52:37.280
credentials,
they seem like tourists.
I didn't know who they were.
Um,

831
00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:39.110
maybe they would have,
maybe they weren't,

832
00:52:39.111 --> 00:52:41.870
maybe they were important agents are sponsors,

833
00:52:41.871 --> 00:52:45.260
but at the time they just seem like tourists that are wanted a picture with me

834
00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:50.420
and,
and it really came overnight and that sense of,

835
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:53.420
wow,
everyone all of a sudden wants something.

836
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.640
Everyone wants something that you have.

837
00:52:55.641 --> 00:53:00.560
Everyone wants to be a part of your success.
I didn't like that feeling.
You know,

838
00:53:00.561 --> 00:53:03.830
I love the feeling of being in a position of,

839
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:08.090
of showcasing what I could do with my tennis racket.

840
00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:13.660
But that feeling of everyone wanting a piece of that and the feeling of your

841
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:19.670
opponents,
all of a sudden all of a sudden feeling like just by beating her,

842
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:22.790
they're not just winning a quarter final of a final and the match,

843
00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:28.020
but they're winning so much more.
Um,
it made me,

844
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:33.950
it made me feel like I needed to kind of put myself in a bubble to concentrate,

845
00:53:34.501 --> 00:53:37.770
to focus,
that it was going to be that much harder,
that much more difficult.

846
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:40.710
And I did.
And,
um,

847
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:43.560
I don't know if I could have done it another way.

848
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:45.230
<v 2>What were some of the,</v>

849
00:53:45.231 --> 00:53:50.231
or what are some of the best practices or decisions that have helped you with

850
00:53:52.041 --> 00:53:54.470
that?
Because for instance,
my friend Josh,

851
00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:58.560
I was mentioning earlier who became well known effectively overnight,

852
00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:03.250
particularly with the movie about his life,
uh,
for chess.

853
00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:05.530
He could no longer compete,
uh,

854
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.950
effectively after that because he would go to a chess tournament and there would

855
00:54:09.951 --> 00:54:14.470
be,
um,
I'm making up the age,
but he's something like 13 or 14,

856
00:54:14.471 --> 00:54:19.250
and all of a sudden there 20 girls who want attention and a bunch of reporters.

857
00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:23.630
And a,
he removed himself completely from the competitive scene.

858
00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:27.200
He's one of the most private people I know at this point.
So what,

859
00:54:27.201 --> 00:54:30.890
what helped you,
what kind of decisions or advice or practices?

860
00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:36.020
<v 3>I think it was surrounding myself with good minds and good people that had my</v>

861
00:54:37.351 --> 00:54:41.520
best interest.
And it's so easy to say those words,

862
00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:46.920
but I know how difficult it is to find those people and even harder now

863
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:51.800
nowadays.
And it was,
and I saw it in so many different examples of other,

864
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:57.130
of other tennis players and of their success and their paths after that.

865
00:54:57.361 --> 00:55:00.960
And the people that you all of a sudden associate yourself with.

866
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:06.350
I think as an individual it's very easy to be affected by the voices that are

867
00:55:06.601 --> 00:55:09.770
next to you because we listened to that and we,

868
00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:14.940
we process that information and all of a sudden we,

869
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.580
I wouldn't say we want to be like them,
but we,
we,

870
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:23.310
we interpret it and in our way.
But like when I read,
when I read a funny book,

871
00:55:23.311 --> 00:55:27.050
all of a sudden I feel like I'm a comedian or you know,
when I,

872
00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:31.860
I watched this and incredible,
um,
acting by someone,

873
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:35.790
it inspires me to,
um,
to be an actor.
You know,

874
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:39.420
it's like there's moments of this that that happens as an athlete you surround

875
00:55:39.421 --> 00:55:43.890
yourself with,
with people's opinions or choices or money and wealth.

876
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:48.280
And it's very,
it's such an easy distraction.
And,

877
00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.590
and I surrounded myself with good people and I,

878
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:55.740
the friends that I have today where my friends,

879
00:55:55.830 --> 00:56:00.600
when I was a young girl that my manager has managed me since I was 11 years old.

880
00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:05.970
And then my mom is still very much my best friend and another really good friend

881
00:56:05.971 --> 00:56:09.870
of mine I met when I was 11 years old as well.
So I have,
um,

882
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.180
I have this fondness of,

883
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:16.440
of developing those real connections with people.

884
00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:21.830
And I think it was so helpful for me as a young girl because I competed in front

885
00:56:22.141 --> 00:56:24.130
of thousands of,
and I still do.

886
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:29.160
And the walk to the tunnel and the walk to a press conference and the walk back

887
00:56:31.031 --> 00:56:31.864
in the hotel room.

888
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:37.230
It's a very lonely journey and that it's a difficult,

889
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:42.580
you know,
you're in your mind a lot and you're,
you're thinking a lot.

890
00:56:42.581 --> 00:56:47.350
So when you have,
when you have voices next to you that are the right voices,

891
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:51.730
um,
then it,
it's so helpful.
But I know how hard it is to find.

892
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:54.730
But I do believe that that is a big part of my success.

893
00:56:55.070 --> 00:56:58.800
<v 2>I have some public exposure and have found,</v>

894
00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:03.200
I've made it a lot of mistakes and found it really difficult to identify in some

895
00:57:03.201 --> 00:57:07.400
cases what ulterior motives are or if people start doing me tons of favors,

896
00:57:07.401 --> 00:57:11.160
I now realize there might be something coming six months later.

897
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.640
Uh,
so I'm very hesitant to accept favors,

898
00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:19.730
but I can't even imagine the level,

899
00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:21.180
<v 3>I mean I'm playing</v>

900
00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:25.980
<v 2>tee ball and you're in the major leagues in the world series when it comes to</v>

901
00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:30.640
how many people want a piece of you.
And how do you,

902
00:57:30.641 --> 00:57:31.420
for instance,

903
00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:36.390
assess someone if you say have coffee or lunch with them,

904
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:41.500
what do you look out for or look for me?

905
00:57:41.501 --> 00:57:45.160
And how do you decide whether it's someone you want to see a second time or talk

906
00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:49.180
to a second time?
Uh,
I,
if,
if anything comes to mind,

907
00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:50.840
and this is just passed by frankly,

908
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:55.110
<v 4>you've had a lot of practice,
you had a lot,</v>

909
00:57:55.130 --> 00:58:00.020
you've got a lot more practice than I was like,
whoa.
Automatic reply.

910
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:02.750
I was like,
oh my goodness,

911
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:09.620
I'm afraid I have 4,091 unread email in my inbox

912
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:12.873
to the wild.

913
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:17.080
<v 3>Do that.
I need to keep my inbox clean.
Then I feel like I have a mess in my head.</v>

914
00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.120
<v 4>All right,
well we'll talk about that next.
But in the meantime,</v>

915
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:23.660
um,
so

916
00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:27.030
<v 3>I think it's about,</v>

917
00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:32.070
I love meeting people and I love having conversation and I love being inspired

918
00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:37.490
and you can get so much out of a conversation or about from x by exposing

919
00:58:39.511 --> 00:58:44.220
yourself to being in an unfamiliar territory.
So with people.

920
00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:48.720
Um,
and I'll give you the big kind of an example that was,

921
00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.120
I felt like it was important because I'm very much,

922
00:58:51.121 --> 00:58:54.210
I'm always around the same people.
So I have my team,

923
00:58:54.211 --> 00:58:57.930
which is my coach and my fitness coach and my trainer.
And we travel.

924
00:58:57.931 --> 00:58:59.430
I see them more than my family.

925
00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:04.910
We travel probably 260 days out of the year together,

926
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:08.280
breakfast,
lunch,
dinners,
practice training.
Um,

927
00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:10.530
we know so much of each other.

928
00:59:10.531 --> 00:59:13.290
And then you have a manager and then you come home and then you have your

929
00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:14.040
friends.

930
00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:18.480
So I'm always surrounded by people that I know and that I trust and that I love,

931
00:59:18.481 --> 00:59:22.460
which is incredible.
But I always think that as a,

932
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:27.490
as a human being and from a perspective of the mind and growth and um,

933
00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:32.750
intellectually when you're put in a situation where you're unfamiliar with

934
00:59:32.751 --> 00:59:37.751
people and you're unfamiliar with their stories or who they are and you have to

935
00:59:38.811 --> 00:59:41.720
ask questions and to get that out,

936
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:45.230
it makes you a much more interesting person.

937
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:49.950
And so last year I put myself in this position,
um,

938
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.000
where I had all this time off and it was during the summer and I signed up for

939
00:59:56.691 --> 01:00:01.640
these two business courses in Boston at Harvard business school and I was one

940
01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:05.480
out of the 40 students,
I believe in each of these courses.

941
01:00:05.481 --> 01:00:06.980
And I stay on campus.

942
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:12.010
And these were individuals who were CEOs and CFOs of companies,

943
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:13.880
of airlines,

944
01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:18.140
of Microsoft have all these incredible brands.

945
01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.800
And I was by far the youngest and,

946
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:23.240
and um,

947
01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.710
probably the silliest and the least knowledgeable one in the room.

948
01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.300
But just by being with them,
just by sitting with them,

949
01:00:32.301 --> 01:00:35.390
just by sitting with them at dinner,
by asking them questions,

950
01:00:35.391 --> 01:00:38.060
by feeling a little bit uncomfortable.

951
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:43.460
I felt like at the end of those three weeks I grew and I grew and,

952
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:45.170
and it wasn't that,

953
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:48.650
I mean there were definitely things that I learned that I'm applying and that I

954
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:50.450
wanted to apply in my business.

955
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.130
But the biggest thing I got out of it was that I grew as a person.
I,

956
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.270
I became familiar and an in a very unfamiliar territory.

957
01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:04.520
I still keep in touch with people in those,
in,
in the classes.

958
01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:08.170
Um,
we have completely different lives.
Um,

959
01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.710
their CEO's of companies,
they have,
you know,
three or four kids.

960
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:13.820
Um,
you know,

961
01:01:13.821 --> 01:01:17.840
they travel all over the place and here I am a 30 year old athlete,

962
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:22.730
but there's so much respect in that room because we're all trying to learn and

963
01:01:22.731 --> 01:01:25.430
to grow.
And so when I,
when you asked me like,

964
01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:29.570
who are the people that you want to meet with or speak to or have a coffee with,

965
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:34.580
I always think of that and the people that I choose to be with or the people

966
01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:35.810
that I want to learn from.

967
01:01:35.811 --> 01:01:39.920
And then I want to have a conversation with and not just about what they bought

968
01:01:39.921 --> 01:01:43.250
at the flea market or you know,
what they're gonna,
how they're,

969
01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:47.030
how they like their coffee.
But it's about the world and it's about education.

970
01:01:47.031 --> 01:01:50.690
It's about people.
And,
and it's not about right or wrong,

971
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:54.890
I don't always have conversation because I want to know what makes someone

972
01:01:54.891 --> 01:01:57.590
perfect and not,
I like to hear opinions.

973
01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:02.570
And I got out of that experience in Boston and I know I felt like I grew,

974
01:02:02.571 --> 01:02:05.940
I felt like I stepped up and I got out of my comfort zone and,

975
01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.600
and I followed up with them and,
um,

976
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:12.710
and we still keep in touch about business and um,
projects and things like that.

977
01:02:12.711 --> 01:02:16.940
So it was a very interesting experience personally for me.

978
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.190
Answer and what I think

979
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:23.100
<v 1>is healthy for me to hear,
my frankly,</v>

980
01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:25.520
is that I frame the question

981
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:31.700
by focusing on what to cut out.
How do you avoid this?

982
01:02:31.701 --> 01:02:33.440
How do you find red flags for that?

983
01:02:33.441 --> 01:02:37.760
What do you look for slash slash ulterior motive?
Fill in the blank.

984
01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:42.850
And somebody said to me two days ago that that is a very male way of approaching

985
01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.770
trying to solve problems to find the cancer and cut it out to remove it,

986
01:02:46.771 --> 01:02:51.210
to cut it off.
And the way you answered the question was,

987
01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.720
you didn't explicitly say this,

988
01:02:52.721 --> 01:02:56.330
but like here's how I choose who to spend time with not,

989
01:02:56.331 --> 01:02:57.950
here's how I decide who to it.

990
01:02:58.110 --> 01:02:59.350
<v 3>Avoid means.</v>

991
01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:04.160
Does that come with guarantees that you're not going to be disappointed at the

992
01:03:04.161 --> 01:03:08.510
end of it?
You're going to want something from you that you weren't expecting,

993
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:11.960
right?
But you do in order to to have,

994
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:15.290
you have to put yourself in a position to find out and right.

995
01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:18.440
And what's the worst thing that,
what's the worst thing that can happen from it?

996
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:21.620
You don't reply or you don't answer,
you don't get back to them.
Okay.

997
01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:24.020
<v 1>Right,
right.
It's an acceptable,</v>

998
01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.400
acceptable cost of tax to pay the,

999
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.250
so the reframing that you just did,
this is,

1000
01:03:31.251 --> 01:03:35.370
this is for me right now in my life at least the really important stuff.
And I,

1001
01:03:35.371 --> 01:03:39.890
I suspect this is true for a lot of folks and I'd love to switch gears a little

1002
01:03:39.891 --> 01:03:43.520
bit and just ask you about self talk.

1003
01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.610
So what you are saying to yourself,

1004
01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:50.640
and I'll choose something very specific when you are in a competitive situation,

1005
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:53.150
if you look back at your,

1006
01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:58.650
you're competitive career up to this point when you've been down and then come

1007
01:03:59.011 --> 01:04:03.660
back to win versus when you've been down.
And then last,

1008
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.010
how does your self talk for,
can you think of any examples?

1009
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:12.810
Are there certain things that you repeat to yourself consistently when you come

1010
01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:17.811
back and win versus maybe things you forget to say or ways that you slip up when

1011
01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:22.040
you end up losing?
Is there any pattern to that or consistency

1012
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:22.790
<v 3>there?</v>

1013
01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:27.580
I wouldn't say there's a pattern because what's great about the sport that I

1014
01:04:27.581 --> 01:04:31.000
play in the situations that I'm in is that they're all very unique.

1015
01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:31.540
And that's what,

1016
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:36.400
that's what makes it so exciting to do this after so many years and after being

1017
01:04:36.401 --> 01:04:38.340
this child prodigy.
And,
um,

1018
01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:42.910
when I think of like the motivation that I'm able to have till this day and

1019
01:04:42.911 --> 01:04:46.870
until that,
that fire is burning,
I'll always keep playing.

1020
01:04:46.871 --> 01:04:51.090
But that's the unique part of it is that you,

1021
01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:55.540
every day is different.
Every match is different.
You might be confident,

1022
01:04:55.570 --> 01:04:58.420
you might be ready,
you might be healthy,

1023
01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:01.510
but you never know what's going to happen.
And,

1024
01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.370
and I'm someone that loves certainty.
I love certainty in my life and I love,

1025
01:05:06.371 --> 01:05:11.320
I do enjoy having a plan,
but that's not realistic,
you know?

1026
01:05:11.321 --> 01:05:13.780
And,
and there's so much uncertainty in what I do.

1027
01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:18.130
So I know that I can prepare my best.
I know that I prepare my body,

1028
01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:21.640
I can prepare my mind,
but in any situation that I'm in,

1029
01:05:21.641 --> 01:05:25.120
it's always different and you have to react to it differently.

1030
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:29.890
And it doesn't always,
it doesn't always go according to plan.

1031
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:32.050
And I don't always find myself being positive,

1032
01:05:32.051 --> 01:05:35.020
but something that I noticed that in my mind,

1033
01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.860
it was actually in the last match I played and it was a in a match where I got

1034
01:05:38.861 --> 01:05:41.110
injured at the end of it and how to actually,

1035
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:46.111
I was up in the third set in Rome and I came into the match being I'm being a

1036
01:05:47.561 --> 01:05:49.660
little bit upset.
I was down.
Um,

1037
01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:54.520
and just for other reasons and I,

1038
01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:57.400
I knew the frame,

1039
01:05:57.401 --> 01:06:01.350
the frame work that I had in my mind was that it was something along the,

1040
01:06:01.351 --> 01:06:06.070
the words of I can't,
I can't,
I can't,
I'm not able to,

1041
01:06:06.071 --> 01:06:09.580
I don't,
I don't feel well.
I'm not there.
My mind is not present.

1042
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:15.270
And the second that I changed that and I changed it to I will and I kept saying

1043
01:06:16.241 --> 01:06:20.140
to myself,
I will win the match and I will win the match.

1044
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:25.650
It was like the instance I remember being down a break point and the

1045
01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:32.410
automatically there was something in my body language or my mind,

1046
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.280
just the repetition of what I was saying to myself.
It just triggered my body.

1047
01:06:36.281 --> 01:06:39.160
I became more aggressive.
I stepped into the court,

1048
01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:43.160
I took her second serve and I hit a winner.
And from that point it just,
it,

1049
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:47.470
it changed.
In the end of the match.
I was up,
I believe it was two zero something.

1050
01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:52.420
I tore a muscle in my hip but,
and I have to had to give her the match.

1051
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:57.240
But I noticed this,
this crazy change,
which I,

1052
01:06:57.490 --> 01:07:00.940
I don't,
I don't really notice as much.
And um,

1053
01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:04.540
it was amazing that it just came,
this was a question that you just phrased,

1054
01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:09.040
but it was the last match that had played.
But it happens a lot.
I do.
I'm a very,

1055
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:12.700
so I take,
I do take my time in between and my service games,

1056
01:07:12.701 --> 01:07:16.360
I walked to the baseline.
I am moved my strings around a,

1057
01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:21.760
I do a little pep talk and it's very automatic.
I wouldn't say there's,

1058
01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:26.800
it's something crazy or something
like something that

1059
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:30.400
I think it's more,

1060
01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:36.090
it's more of like of putting my eyes onto my strings and and having this

1061
01:07:37.901 --> 01:07:42.880
repetition that it doesn't matter if I won the point or lost the point that I'm

1062
01:07:42.881 --> 01:07:45.250
just on this level,
that I'm on this path,

1063
01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:49.150
that I'm on this river that is going to get to where it's going.

1064
01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:51.400
No matter what rock is in the way,

1065
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:56.470
no matter what storm is on the way the water is ultimately going to go down the

1066
01:07:56.471 --> 01:07:59.500
river and that,

1067
01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.410
and maybe prep talk is not the right way.
I don't always,

1068
01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.540
I mean I do think that our mind is always working,

1069
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:07.960
always saying things and you're not always so conscious of it,

1070
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:13.380
but it's this routine that I have and I think it's kind of a safe place for me

1071
01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:17.780
because in a match it can be an hour match or it can be a three hour match
match.

1072
01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:21.920
And in tennis,
momentum changes so much,
just like in life,

1073
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:22.940
one second.

1074
01:08:22.941 --> 01:08:26.960
Everything is positive and you get bad news and you know someone is leaving the

1075
01:08:26.961 --> 01:08:30.530
company or someone's not going to work anymore or someone's not healthy or,

1076
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:34.430
and all of a sudden you go from a great day too.
Wow.

1077
01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.340
And it's just a way for me,

1078
01:08:37.341 --> 01:08:40.670
I see those strings and I see my fingers playing with those strings.
And,

1079
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:46.130
and I just said,
I think of being levelheaded and being not overly excited,

1080
01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:49.160
not down,
but being in this like medium frame of mind.

1081
01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:53.350
<v 1>I would love to dig into specifically,</v>

1082
01:08:53.351 --> 01:08:58.351
and this is related serving and you'll start to notice a theme here that uh,

1083
01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:06.440
this is also very self interested because I've never learned how to play tennis

1084
01:09:06.691 --> 01:09:11.290
despite the fact that I grew up out on long island surrounded by people on

1085
01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:14.170
tennis courts,
most of which I was not allowed on.
I would serve their coffee,

1086
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:19.300
but I'm going to my first tennis camp in the next few months to try to learn to

1087
01:09:19.301 --> 01:09:24.160
play tennis.
And uh,
what recommendations would you have?

1088
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:25.243
<v 3>Don't do it.</v>

1089
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.960
<v 4>No,
besides,
besides don't do it.</v>

1090
01:09:29.961 --> 01:09:30.990
Because I've already sort of

1091
01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:35.810
<v 1>jumped off the cliff and I'm trying to grow wings,
uh,</v>

1092
01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:41.190
for serving because I think you've hit up to 121 mile an hour serves,

1093
01:09:41.291 --> 01:09:45.040
which just makes my eyes,
it's been inside my skull.

1094
01:09:45.041 --> 01:09:48.030
I can't even imagine what that looks like.
Uh,

1095
01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:53.180
any tips for the people out there?
I'll depersonalize.
Not Tim,

1096
01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:57.170
but actually for Tim,
the people out there who would like to,

1097
01:09:57.490 --> 01:10:01.120
he better at serving.
Do you have any recommendations doozer do nuts?

1098
01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:02.523
<v 3>Um,</v>

1099
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.250
I mean the one thing that I noticed a lot with people that are just starting to

1100
01:10:06.251 --> 01:10:10.150
play tennis and it's not just about the syrup but it's an all all strokes is

1101
01:10:10.151 --> 01:10:14.500
that they take their eye off the ball in order to see the result or the,

1102
01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:16.570
where the ball is going.
Um,

1103
01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:20.170
which is a big mistake in the beginning,

1104
01:10:20.171 --> 01:10:24.610
especially because the more content I contact you have with the ball,

1105
01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.080
um,

1106
01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:30.760
the more the strings of your racket are going to be on the ball itself.

1107
01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:33.820
So seeing,
seeing the lines of the ball,

1108
01:10:33.821 --> 01:10:38.821
visualizing that will really help you kind of maintaining like when you lift

1109
01:10:38.951 --> 01:10:43.810
your arm up to to hit a serve.
Sometimes we want to bring it right back down,

1110
01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:47.080
um,
as we may contact.
So keeping that left arm up,

1111
01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:52.270
it's something that I focus on when,
when I make a few errors and yeah,

1112
01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:56.810
as a right hander or if it's a lefthander then keeping your right arm up.
Um,

1113
01:10:56.830 --> 01:11:01.160
yeah,
I would say those are the two,
two top things.
By the way,

1114
01:11:01.161 --> 01:11:04.820
I am the worst.
I'm the worst at coaching or

1115
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.350
<v 4>I don't believe it for a second.
Please do.
Please do.
Because</v>

1116
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:13.920
someone me the other day,

1117
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:19.290
<v 3>good advice thing,
I was like,
oh my goodness.
You're like,</v>

1118
01:11:19.291 --> 01:11:22.890
I've had enough tennis on one side.
I mean I'm sad.

1119
01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:24.420
Probably rather commentate.

1120
01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:31.120
<v 2>I think you just don't like talking about yourself.
I think I don't,
but you are.</v>

1121
01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:35.280
I think you probably are a very good coach.
If you're a good player,
you can be,

1122
01:11:35.281 --> 01:11:39.100
I think you get the right questions.
Maybe you get coach.
So I'm going to try.

1123
01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.510
Where do you think tennis players don't,

1124
01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:47.400
let's just say novice intermediate waste a lot of time,

1125
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:52.370
like where do they focus too much or spend too much time on and where should

1126
01:11:52.371 --> 01:11:53.330
they spend more time?

1127
01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:58.670
<v 3>I think may spend a lot of time on the outcome.
Hmm.</v>

1128
01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.160
I think that a lot,

1129
01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:07.940
a lot goes into the result was it in as it out,

1130
01:12:07.941 --> 01:12:12.941
as long as it in the net and it all of a sudden becomes your focus.

1131
01:12:13.081 --> 01:12:15.210
It becomes your focus point.

1132
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:20.000
That's why I mentioned like watching the ball as long as you can because it

1133
01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:25.010
takes your mind away from thinking if the ball is going to be in or out and

1134
01:12:25.771 --> 01:12:29.890
therefore it,
I always feel that your attitude and your,

1135
01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:32.100
your body language and I,

1136
01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:37.260
I've always thought that that's a very big part of of the game itself and how

1137
01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:38.094
you,

1138
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:43.220
how you're able to transfer this body language from a mistake into a winner that

1139
01:12:43.621 --> 01:12:48.040
you hit the next ball and a few balls and the,

1140
01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:52.740
sometimes it's all it takes because tennis is a matter of really millimeters.

1141
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.770
You could do the same thing and the ball just the,

1142
01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:57.480
the wind takes it and it's long.

1143
01:12:58.230 --> 01:13:00.480
And if you're playing in conditions where it's not windy,

1144
01:13:00.481 --> 01:13:03.090
you do the same exact thing and you have the same technique,

1145
01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:08.091
but it goes in and one day you're cursing at yourself and you're upset and the

1146
01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:12.300
next day you think you just won a grand slam.
So it's a very,

1147
01:13:12.301 --> 01:13:16.140
it's a very thin line there.
There's no doubt about it.
But I do,

1148
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:20.350
I think there's a lot of,
there's a lot of attitude that,
you know,

1149
01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:24.550
needs to calm down.
When I watch,
when I watch,
um,

1150
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:28.050
no one watched junior tournaments when I watched body language,

1151
01:13:28.051 --> 01:13:33.051
when I see facial expressions and looking over on the sides of the court.

1152
01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:38.780
And a lot of it is because tennis is so emotional and it's so in the moment and

1153
01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:43.320
every single point counts and you wanted to count.

1154
01:13:43.321 --> 01:13:48.210
And of course it shows how passionate you are about it,
but the attitude and,

1155
01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.140
um,
is a very important part of,
of being a tennis player

1156
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:58.020
<v 2>in addition to the attitude or layered on top of that.
Tonight,
I have promise.</v>

1157
01:13:58.021 --> 01:14:00.350
This will be my last question about technique.

1158
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.370
In the first month,
if you were,

1159
01:14:04.371 --> 01:14:08.590
if you were coaching your son or daughter in tennis in the,

1160
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:12.250
and let's just assume,
they said last thing I want to do is tennis.

1161
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.270
<v 1>And then at age 20,
they're like,
you know what,</v>

1162
01:14:14.271 --> 01:14:17.360
actually I want to do tennis just because,

1163
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:22.610
just because dealing with a little kid as a whole thing in and of itself,
but uh,

1164
01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:25.600
we could also depersonalize it and just say you're teaching someone you care

1165
01:14:25.601 --> 01:14:30.460
about,
right?
What would you make sure they get right in the first four weeks?

1166
01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.310
What would you really focus on?

1167
01:14:32.650 --> 01:14:35.950
<v 3>So I think the basic techniques,</v>

1168
01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:39.610
and even when you're young,
like that's,
that's the main thing,

1169
01:14:39.611 --> 01:14:43.150
those are your fundamentals.
So if you start,
if you start,
if you're,

1170
01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.630
if you need to go,
right and you're,

1171
01:14:44.631 --> 01:14:48.430
you're going to big Sur but you turn left from the beginning,
you're,
you're done.

1172
01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.680
And that's how I,

1173
01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:56.130
that's how I've always seen tennis is the mechanical mechanics are important and

1174
01:14:56.351 --> 01:14:57.520
they need to be easy.
Like,

1175
01:14:57.521 --> 01:15:02.260
sometimes I see strokes that are so complicated and that are so the backswing is

1176
01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:05.920
huge and the spins are crazy.
And I think it,

1177
01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.680
it definitely can be much more simple.

1178
01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.890
And it's not about power.

1179
01:15:11.891 --> 01:15:16.330
It's not about hitting a winner.
A lot of it is controlled power.
Like,
um,

1180
01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:20.080
I mean I play a very aggressive and powerful game,
um,

1181
01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:23.170
but when I play the best is when it's controlled power.

1182
01:15:23.171 --> 01:15:25.990
When I don't want it to be power.
But when my,

1183
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.180
when my strokes are simple,

1184
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:33.970
they're not complicated when I'm not trying to grow it as loud as I can,

1185
01:15:33.971 --> 01:15:38.230
even though I grew up very loud,
when it's really compact,
you know,
keeping your,

1186
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:43.270
keeping your elbow close to your body instead of having this huge loop.
Um,

1187
01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:47.440
and really zoning in on the ball.
I always,

1188
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:50.080
I always see people take their eyes off the ball.

1189
01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.410
<v 1>Well,
I hate to say it,
but I think your next book might be about,</v>

1190
01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:59.290
I
doubted.
So I'm not going to,

1191
01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:02.510
I'm not going to forget to mention it,
but I do want to mention it.

1192
01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.140
You have a new book and I have more questions.

1193
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.260
I won't keep your five hours as much as I want to,

1194
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:12.030
but you have a new book unstoppable,

1195
01:16:12.031 --> 01:16:15.080
which I am actually extremely,

1196
01:16:15.081 --> 01:16:19.510
extremely excited to read and I don't,
my f my listeners know,

1197
01:16:19.511 --> 01:16:24.260
I do not actually always say that.
Uh,
I'm very excited too.
Dig into it.

1198
01:16:24.261 --> 01:16:27.470
But can you tell us a little bit about it and then I will give one of many

1199
01:16:27.471 --> 01:16:30.650
reasons why I'm excited to check it out.

1200
01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:34.100
But could you tell us a why write a book?

1201
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:35.740
Because books,

1202
01:16:35.741 --> 01:16:40.741
books are a pain in the ass and I can speak from experience now that I've just

1203
01:16:41.621 --> 01:16:43.690
finished reading the audio version,
I know

1204
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:49.240
<v 3>completed.
I just took a deep breath and I said,
wow.
I said,
wow,</v>

1205
01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:52.750
I have so much respect for every book that's on that shelf.

1206
01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.610
<v 1>You're like,
I can't believe people do this for a loo.
Who would ever do that?</v>

1207
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.570
Well,

1208
01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:03.490
<v 3>you know what,
I,
about three years,
two,
two and a half years ago,</v>

1209
01:17:03.491 --> 01:17:05.830
I had a meeting with,
uh,

1210
01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:11.330
with an agent and I sat down and she,

1211
01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:12.560
she came into the meeting,

1212
01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:17.580
I'm talking to me about a potential memoir and it was so far,

1213
01:17:18.741 --> 01:17:23.300
it was just an idea that she had.
It was not really even a vision or a plan.

1214
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.040
It's just wanted to talk to me about it.

1215
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:29.210
She knew a little bit about my story about moving to America.

1216
01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:30.230
She didn't know everything.

1217
01:17:30.231 --> 01:17:33.260
And we had this conversation and I came into the meeting,

1218
01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.370
I'm actually just taking the meeting cause I want it to be nice.

1219
01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:43.610
And I never thought that I was ready to write a book and to,

1220
01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:48.440
to share so much of what I share in this book about them moving to America,

1221
01:17:48.441 --> 01:17:51.800
about facing my rivals,
about my personal life,

1222
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:56.830
about all the experiences that I've had and the 30 years that I've lived.

1223
01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:01.520
Um,
and I wrote a few paragraphs myself and she,

1224
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:06.920
yeah,
she was very,
it was interesting cause I left a meeting feeling like,

1225
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:09.560
wow,
I'm really going to write a book.
Aren't die.

1226
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:11.870
And it wasn't anything that she said.

1227
01:18:11.871 --> 01:18:15.470
It was just the conversation and her asking me about my story.

1228
01:18:15.471 --> 01:18:18.350
And as I started speaking about it,
she was,

1229
01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:23.270
her eyes lit up and she said it was incredible.

1230
01:18:23.271 --> 01:18:27.370
And I looked at her like,
Huh,
really?
Cause I,

1231
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:29.000
I don't know,
I always,

1232
01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:34.980
I think that everyone's story is special and everyone gets to where they are and

1233
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:36.950
their own certain unique ways.

1234
01:18:36.951 --> 01:18:41.951
And I know I just don't go about my life thinking that I know that it's very

1235
01:18:43.071 --> 01:18:46.280
different and that it's maybe one in a million and that we,

1236
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:50.060
my family took a chance,
but I don't walk around thinking,
Wow,
this is brilliant.

1237
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:55.100
And so I walked out of that meeting thinking,
wow,
I might,
I might be a writer,

1238
01:18:55.101 --> 01:18:59.210
I might write a book.
And so I wrote a few paragraphs myself and,

1239
01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:04.040
and just a few weeks time we got this offer with no questions asked,

1240
01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.880
no,
is this going to be gossip?
No.
Who's,

1241
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:10.070
who's going to be part of the story?
Um,

1242
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:15.130
I signed with Sarah Crichton at FSG and she wanted to hear my story.

1243
01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.580
And I don't know,
it just,
it,
it inspired me.

1244
01:19:19.581 --> 01:19:24.581
It made me feel like there was a lot of inspirational work that I could put on

1245
01:19:25.101 --> 01:19:27.740
paper for,
for people to read.

1246
01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.440
There was a writer that I had in mind whose name is rich Cohen,

1247
01:19:31.441 --> 01:19:32.640
who you're very familiar with.

1248
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:35.620
<v 1>You made such a great choice.</v>

1249
01:19:35.621 --> 01:19:38.470
That was one of the things I was going to bring up just for people who don't

1250
01:19:38.471 --> 01:19:42.820
know.
And I hate to interject,
but this is another thing that made me so excited.

1251
01:19:42.821 --> 01:19:43.590
So yeah,

1252
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:48.590
Rich's written just some incredible books and their wine tribes book was credit

1253
01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.610
and also,
I mean the fish that ate the will,
right.

1254
01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:57.270
A which a lot of people have heard of,
you know,
one of my,
uh,

1255
01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:01.040
actually two or three friends,
one of their favorite books of all time.

1256
01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:05.260
So I'll let you carry on.
But rich,
you made,
you made a great choice.

1257
01:20:05.770 --> 01:20:10.360
<v 3>When I read Jerry wine was book or somewhere on holiday during my off season in</v>

1258
01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:13.140
November,
probably I'd say seven years ago.

1259
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:18.530
I said to myself that if I ever write a book that Rich Cohen would help me do

1260
01:20:18.901 --> 01:20:23.580
it.
And when I made the decision to write this book,

1261
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.020
I had my agent,
um,

1262
01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:30.510
find out who rich going was,
where he lived,
what he did,

1263
01:20:30.511 --> 01:20:35.250
if he had time to do this.
I didn't even know if this was a possibility.

1264
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.300
So I let him,
and this was so fascinating because I,

1265
01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:45.050
I met with three writers and I met him at this swanky New York hotel and,

1266
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:53.400
and he walked in there just looking like he did not belong.

1267
01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:58.700
And I knew exactly that this was my guy.
That's my guy,
that's my guy.

1268
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:03.450
I knew that he,
he knew where he was going.
He took the train,

1269
01:21:03.451 --> 01:21:08.451
he had a shoulder bag on and he was just looking around.

1270
01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:11.880
He was simple.
And our conversation was very simple.

1271
01:21:11.881 --> 01:21:15.090
It wasn't anything over the top.
And I knew,

1272
01:21:15.091 --> 01:21:18.030
but I knew from just meeting with him for 30 minutes that he,

1273
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:23.280
he was a genius in his literature and that's where his genius has come out.

1274
01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:26.520
It's on paper.
And I got that sense from the beginning.

1275
01:21:26.521 --> 01:21:29.730
And another reason I chose to work with him was because I,

1276
01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:34.350
throughout my life I have,
I've been influenced by a lot of male figures.

1277
01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:39.220
So my father,
my coaches,
Nicola,
Teri,
Robert Landsdorp,
um,

1278
01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:43.500
my manager and I wanted,
I wanted a rich to sit down with these people.

1279
01:21:43.501 --> 01:21:47.760
I wanted him to spend time with these people to really get an understanding of

1280
01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:52.890
the characters that were part of my life,
that,
that made me who I am today.

1281
01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.790
And I knew,
and I thought of these people,

1282
01:21:55.791 --> 01:21:59.960
I thought of my father and I thought of the person that he would give the time

1283
01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:04.430
to,
that he would open up to,
that he would share with.

1284
01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:09.490
And that I think that was one of the biggest reasons that,

1285
01:22:09.621 --> 01:22:10.610
I mean,

1286
01:22:10.611 --> 01:22:15.611
he and my father spent turning over a week together just talking and talking

1287
01:22:15.981 --> 01:22:20.840
and,
and it wasn't even life life talking stories.

1288
01:22:20.841 --> 01:22:23.420
And then my father was able to tell stories that I,

1289
01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:28.550
that I read in the book and I'm,
I was like,
wow,
wow.

1290
01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:33.290
I was so young that I don't,
I don't remember it.
And yeah,

1291
01:22:33.291 --> 01:22:37.220
he was,
we spent so many weeks together.
Um,

1292
01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:41.960
I love the way that he worked.
I love,
love the questions that he would,

1293
01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:45.260
I just love the simplicity of him as a human being.

1294
01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:49.540
<v 2>I love the filter.
Also,
it wouldn't have even occurred to me,</v>

1295
01:22:49.541 --> 01:22:52.620
at least in this conversation if you hadn't mentioned it,

1296
01:22:52.621 --> 01:22:55.860
but the fact that it's not just who you like and who's writing you like,

1297
01:22:55.861 --> 01:22:57.510
but who other people will talk to.

1298
01:22:57.850 --> 01:23:01.900
<v 3>Because a big part of my story is the other people that influenced my life.</v>

1299
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:07.870
And because I started my life at a young age,
I started this,
you know,

1300
01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:11.620
this crazy move and this crazy profession and,

1301
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:16.950
and these people were so influential and they're very much a part of this.

1302
01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:19.210
Part of the reason that I'm here

1303
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:24.990
<v 1>subtitle in my life so far,
you've a lot of decades left.</v>

1304
01:23:25.190 --> 01:23:28.700
<v 4>Uh,
well,
you know,
I want to,</v>

1305
01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.560
<v 3>I wanted it to be called to be continued</v>

1306
01:23:33.150 --> 01:23:35.850
and I got shut down really fast.

1307
01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:42.610
<v 4>That's basically telling everyone to get a new book.
I was like,</v>

1308
01:23:43.570 --> 01:23:46.270
wait a second.
That's been my dream ever since.
So yeah,

1309
01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:48.070
<v 3>because when I would see um,</v>

1310
01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:52.640
memoirs written by or autobiographies written by young no to younger

1311
01:23:52.641 --> 01:23:54.380
individuals,
I would think to myself,

1312
01:23:54.381 --> 01:23:57.350
do they really think that their life is over and that this is all they have to

1313
01:23:57.351 --> 01:23:58.010
tell.

1314
01:23:58.010 --> 01:24:02.060
So of course when you say that you have a book come out a memoir when you're 30

1315
01:24:02.061 --> 01:24:03.710
years old and

1316
01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:08.480
<v 4>I was just so like I have this vision of,
of calling it to be continued,</v>

1317
01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.370
but they're like that you have to explain what's inside the pages and not what's

1318
01:24:13.371 --> 01:24:15.700
coming out next.
That's like,
no,

1319
01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:20.300
<v 1>well you could do
this my life so far.</v>

1320
01:24:20.301 --> 01:24:23.110
Then you write your coaching book that you promised me you'd right.

1321
01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:28.610
Then the third book can be unstoppable.
My life continues or it continues.

1322
01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:31.940
And so I think you could get a number of,
can you play with it?

1323
01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:35.260
I know you can play with it.
You can play with so many different types of,

1324
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:41.390
I'd love to ask some some micro questions just about routine and perhaps a

1325
01:24:41.881 --> 01:24:46.881
couple of other rapid fire questions that I'd like to ask before I get to that.

1326
01:24:47.371 --> 01:24:51.540
I know you've had,
you've had some shoulder issues in your life.
Uh,

1327
01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:56.550
I've had shoulder reconstructive shirts to surgery and improved sort of mobility

1328
01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:01.560
and recovered largely.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1329
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:05.160
I know now,
fortunately it's on my nondominant arm.

1330
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:09.990
What I was going to ask you,
you mentioned some of your heme,

1331
01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:15.000
the fitness coach and so on.
Right.
What have you found to help most?

1332
01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:20.020
Are there any particular exercises that have made you more resilient against

1333
01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:25.280
injury?
So for injury prevention,
what are some of the components of,

1334
01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:28.480
say,
your fitness program that you think have helped most?

1335
01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.510
<v 3>I liked that you used the word prevention because a lot of,</v>

1336
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:36.520
a lot of the makeup of an athlete is about prevention and it's,
you know,
we,

1337
01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:40.570
we do so much to try to prevent injuries and we don't always succeed,

1338
01:25:40.571 --> 01:25:45.571
but a big part of the little exercises and the tedious things and the repetition

1339
01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:47.950
is,
is that,

1340
01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:52.350
and I would say the biggest component of uh,

1341
01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:57.690
because I want their shoulder surgery is the consistency of keeping up with the

1342
01:25:58.001 --> 01:26:02.620
exercises.
You know,
there's a lot of exercise out there and they're all great,

1343
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.070
but it's very rare that you keep doing them.

1344
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:11.870
And I start every morning after my shoulder surgery,

1345
01:26:12.230 --> 01:26:17.020
before every practice.
I have a routine with a rubber band.
It's not that,

1346
01:26:17.021 --> 01:26:19.670
that's not a rare routine for a tennis player.
We all warm up.

1347
01:26:19.671 --> 01:26:24.440
We do about a 30 minute warm up before we even get to warm up on the core before

1348
01:26:24.441 --> 01:26:24.950
I matched.

1349
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:29.920
So there are a lot of little scapular exercises that you do,
um,

1350
01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.650
theraband,
right?
Yeah.

1351
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:38.770
And a lot of it is not even about the weight that you have or the resistance of

1352
01:26:40.371 --> 01:26:43.370
the theraband,
but it's the repetition that you do.

1353
01:26:43.371 --> 01:26:48.140
So the feeling that you have in the back of your scapula or um,

1354
01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:52.640
and the tendons of your shoulder is that it starts burning.

1355
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:58.130
That's when you really know that the little muscles in between the big ones are

1356
01:26:58.131 --> 01:27:01.880
firing and the,
the more consistent you are with that,

1357
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:07.250
the bigger chance of you getting healthy and also preventing something else to

1358
01:27:07.251 --> 01:27:12.170
happen because your body always compensates.
So if I have an injury,

1359
01:27:12.190 --> 01:27:15.680
um,
in on place,
you,
you're,

1360
01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:19.790
your body's like the brain is so smart that it starts using other parts of the

1361
01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:24.260
body and all of a sudden you feel it somewhere else.
So,
yeah.

1362
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:30.250
So the consistency of following through and really keeping at it is for me is

1363
01:27:31.491 --> 01:27:35.390
always the most challenging thing.
And I see people give up on it.

1364
01:27:38.850 --> 01:27:42.160
Are there any particular exercises that you wish you'd incorporated?

1365
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:46.820
So I grew very fast and that's something that I speak about in the book as well.

1366
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:51.500
Um,
because none of no one in my family is tall.
I'm the tallest one.

1367
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:57.010
And I talk about the struggles that I had as a teenager during that period of

1368
01:27:57.561 --> 01:28:01.190
time.
And in my father says it was,

1369
01:28:01.191 --> 01:28:05.090
I grew because I had the soil to grow and that I needed it for my sport and that

1370
01:28:05.091 --> 01:28:07.460
it was everyone's wish,
including mine,

1371
01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:11.330
that I would be taller so I could be served from a higher angle or that I could

1372
01:28:11.331 --> 01:28:14.900
be more powerful.
But with that comes,
you know,

1373
01:28:14.901 --> 01:28:18.710
you're a little bit less explosive,
you're not as mobile,
you know,
little differ.

1374
01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:22.250
And I think movement,
um,
you know,

1375
01:28:22.251 --> 01:28:26.060
in tennis you have so many movements that are just back and forth and changing

1376
01:28:26.061 --> 01:28:29.810
direction.
And so I work a lot on the joints.

1377
01:28:29.811 --> 01:28:31.960
I work a lot on balance,
um,

1378
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.110
balance of the core and then that balance on,
um,
on little,

1379
01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:39.870
on stabilizing platforms where I really work,

1380
01:28:39.871 --> 01:28:41.540
my ankles and my knees,

1381
01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:46.340
make sure those are all aligned and not wobbling too much when just gaining the

1382
01:28:46.341 --> 01:28:51.290
confidence.
Um,
and sometimes they seem like the most,
the simple exercises,

1383
01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:54.230
you know,
if you take a picture of them or a video of them and you,

1384
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:57.030
they're the ones that you don't want to post because it was someone that thinks

1385
01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:58.700
you're not doing anything.
You know what I mean?

1386
01:28:58.701 --> 01:29:01.680
Like they're not impressive looking.

1387
01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:06.830
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
You're not an Olympic weightlifting.
No.</v>

1388
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:10.820
<v 3>Not doing any RDL owls.
But the little things that are,</v>

1389
01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:15.740
that that take time and that looks so simple and that are boring are the ones

1390
01:29:15.741 --> 01:29:17.290
that really,
you know,

1391
01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:21.800
not only do you keep your focus but you keep your strength and the balance.

1392
01:29:21.801 --> 01:29:25.570
So yeah,
and I work,
I work on my core a lot cause I,

1393
01:29:26.150 --> 01:29:29.760
I do believe that that's,
you know,
it is the center of your body in a control.

1394
01:29:29.761 --> 01:29:33.780
So much of it puts the body together.
It's like the glue.

1395
01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:38.030
<v 1>If you could only choose one or two core exercises to do,
what would they be?</v>

1396
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:40.000
<v 3>Oh Wow.
Um,</v>

1397
01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:46.420
I love using the TRX band and did that yellow band and putting it up,

1398
01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:52.010
um,
hanging in and putting my feet in it.
And then doing a plank.

1399
01:29:53.210 --> 01:29:56.900
And then I'm sort of doing like bicycles while you're in a plank,

1400
01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.290
when your feet are in the TRX.
I like that.

1401
01:29:59.370 --> 01:30:02.000
<v 1>So you're crossing your mid line with your needs.
Yes.</v>

1402
01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:07.160
<v 3>So I mean that's a little bit on the advanced side,</v>

1403
01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:09.440
but I know that your audience can do it.

1404
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:13.720
<v 1>Yeah.
And you can also folks,
if you have really tough top of your feet,</v>

1405
01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.600
you can do that.
I actually have some rings there.

1406
01:30:16.601 --> 01:30:21.160
I'm looking at outside on my patio set up at sort of pushup height and you can

1407
01:30:21.161 --> 01:30:22.390
do something very,
very similar.

1408
01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:24.250
<v 3>Exactly.
Um,</v>

1409
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.430
and I do a lot on the physio ball and that's always simple.
Most gyms have it.
Um,

1410
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:34.200
even just the,
also known as a Swiss ball if people Swiss ball see ball.
Yes,

1411
01:30:34.210 --> 01:30:37.090
there are a lot of terms.
Um,
yeah,

1412
01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:41.710
I like doing all different types of planks were just floor planks and extending

1413
01:30:41.711 --> 01:30:44.960
your arms are extending your legs one at a time out.

1414
01:30:46.570 --> 01:30:50.650
So it's like an element of surprise and balance or it's not just static.

1415
01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:51.913
<v 1>Right.</v>

1416
01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:56.240
And for those of you who've heard my conversations with doctor Peter Tia,

1417
01:30:56.750 --> 01:31:01.750
he is a huge fan of doing a different plank motions on the physio ball.

1418
01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:05.660
And just to your point about unimpressive exercises.

1419
01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:11.500
So I have completely changed my lower body performance and just stability in the

1420
01:31:12.651 --> 01:31:15.680
last six months using slant boards,

1421
01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:20.600
which make you look like you're on the most unenjoyable drug imaginable.

1422
01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.010
Uh,

1423
01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:27.010
but it's this tiny tiny adjustment that I feel like has changed my entire lower

1424
01:31:29.441 --> 01:31:33.730
body by focusing on the feet.
Uh,
so here,

1425
01:31:33.731 --> 01:31:35.950
here now

1426
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:40.880
I have shoot,

1427
01:31:40.881 --> 01:31:45.881
I'm also looking at them right now I have a bottle of geranium essential oil.

1428
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.080
I know it's not a smooth segway,
but bear with me.
I have a bottle of training,

1429
01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:54.920
I have a geranium because it was recommended to me by someone named Nicholas

1430
01:31:56.330 --> 01:32:00.060
McCarthy who is a one or a one handed concert pianist

1431
01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:05.340
<v 2>who uses Geranium when he is writing and composing because he found it helped</v>

1432
01:32:05.341 --> 01:32:08.760
keep him alert without overstimulating.
I'm so,
he was relaxed and alert.

1433
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:10.303
<v 3>So at</v>

1434
01:32:10.630 --> 01:32:14.380
<v 2>at some point,
uh,
I saw a video view when you're 14,</v>

1435
01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:18.480
<v 3>a star in the making.
That's right.</v>

1436
01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:22.260
Candles and aroma therapy oils.

1437
01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.940
Are you still into that?
I am.

1438
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:28.370
See the room that I'm in right now,
I have

1439
01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:34.660
all these oils and all these candles and yeah,
I,

1440
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:39.950
well for me it's about like this feeling of being in your home environment and

1441
01:32:40.351 --> 01:32:43.860
comfort.
That's something that you don't get when you travel so much.

1442
01:32:43.861 --> 01:32:47.310
So when I do,
it's kind of my way of failing.

1443
01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:52.340
Like every morning I turn on my incense and my candles and I have my coffee and

1444
01:32:52.341 --> 01:32:54.600
it just,
the smell,
it's like the smell of being home.

1445
01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:56.530
<v 2>What's the Goto morning instance?</v>

1446
01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.990
<v 3>It's a Moroccan scent.</v>

1447
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:02.540
I don't exactly know what's in it,

1448
01:33:02.541 --> 01:33:05.660
but it smells like I'm in Morocco even though I've never been there.

1449
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:07.130
Another one that's on my list.

1450
01:33:07.190 --> 01:33:10.210
<v 2>Do you not bring those smells with you</v>

1451
01:33:10.710 --> 01:33:15.300
<v 3>when you travel?
I don't,
you know,
interestingly enough,
I,</v>

1452
01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:19.290
when I go on a trip,
like I know that that's my work.

1453
01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:21.600
I like,

1454
01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:26.600
I like leaving those things behind because it makes me feel that I'm going there

1455
01:33:28.831 --> 01:33:32.760
for a reason and I'm not going there to be comfortable.

1456
01:33:32.761 --> 01:33:35.280
I'm not going to be there in my environment.

1457
01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:40.820
I'm there to do my job and I will come back home and I'll have everything,

1458
01:33:42.541 --> 01:33:44.880
I'll have my friends and I'll be around my family.

1459
01:33:44.881 --> 01:33:48.660
But when I leave it's like there's so many times when I've left,

1460
01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:53.310
I've gone on a plane and it's the middle of the day and Manhattan beach and the

1461
01:33:53.311 --> 01:33:56.700
sun is shining and everyone's playing volleyball and,

1462
01:33:56.850 --> 01:34:00.600
and I look at that and I'm like,
it's hard.
It's definitely hard.
No,

1463
01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:04.500
my friends are out there and I want to be out there and I want to be enjoying

1464
01:34:04.501 --> 01:34:07.740
the sunset,
but I know what I'm going out there for.

1465
01:34:07.741 --> 01:34:10.530
I know that come a time when I have five days off,

1466
01:34:10.531 --> 01:34:14.880
I'll be able to take my friends on vacation and treat them to a beautiful time.

1467
01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.670
But now is my time to work.

1468
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:21.840
And so I like leaving those things behind because it makes me feel that there is

1469
01:34:21.841 --> 01:34:24.690
a PR,
there is a prize at the end of it.
There is something that I'm,

1470
01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:29.470
that makes my job different.
I don't know if that makes sense.

1471
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:33.990
<v 2>It makes perfect sense to me.</v>

1472
01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.070
And it actually relates to something that made me smile when I read it.

1473
01:34:38.071 --> 01:34:43.071
I was looking at a transcript of a conversation that you had and this requires a

1474
01:34:45.061 --> 01:34:48.610
little bit of context,
but I'll shorten it.
Uh,
I hate the word balance.

1475
01:34:48.611 --> 01:34:50.380
What is balance?
Because it's 50,
50,

1476
01:34:50.381 --> 01:34:52.780
that means you're only giving 50% to both things.

1477
01:34:52.781 --> 01:34:57.320
So I've always disliked the phrase work life balance because it implies blending

1478
01:34:57.321 --> 01:35:00.560
to me and I like to keep them very,
very separate.
All right.

1479
01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:04.280
Do you think that's something that has helped you more than hurt you or

1480
01:35:04.281 --> 01:35:07.980
challenged you in terms of relationships,
outcomes and everything else?
I mean,

1481
01:35:07.981 --> 01:35:11.270
do you think there'll be a point where you trade that or change your mind about

1482
01:35:11.271 --> 01:35:11.940
that?

1483
01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:15.870
<v 3>I definitely think that it's challenged me,</v>

1484
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:19.470
challenged the way that I think.
But I do,

1485
01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:23.940
I read the one thing a few years ago,

1486
01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:29.130
I carry guilt Keller and I really,

1487
01:35:29.131 --> 01:35:34.131
it kind of hit home for me when you saying that you,

1488
01:35:34.890 --> 01:35:36.090
when you wake up in the morning,

1489
01:35:36.091 --> 01:35:39.810
you put your focus on this one thing of what you want to accomplish during the

1490
01:35:39.810 --> 01:35:43.740
day,
which seems like a no brainer.
Right?
It seems like okay,
that's,

1491
01:35:43.741 --> 01:35:45.360
that's the way that everyone should do it.

1492
01:35:45.361 --> 01:35:49.800
But it's so much more complicated than that.
And for example,

1493
01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:52.700
when I leave for a trip and you know,

1494
01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:57.360
one of my good friends is getting married in August and I'm going to be either

1495
01:35:57.361 --> 01:36:00.060
in Cincinnati or Toronto competing at a tournament.

1496
01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:05.850
I know that I'm not there for my friend.
It's a big,
it's a big day,

1497
01:36:05.851 --> 01:36:07.500
it's a big event.
Um,

1498
01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:12.090
and yet I have this career in front of me that is taking priority.

1499
01:36:12.090 --> 01:36:15.900
And I could say,
you know,
if he'd give many examples of my personal life as well,

1500
01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:21.630
but those are choices.
Those are your choices.
And those are,
I think,

1501
01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:26.440
I don't think that there is a 50 50 balance.
I don't,

1502
01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:27.870
that hasn't worked for me.

1503
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:32.340
I've always felt that I've had to let something go or I sacrifice something.

1504
01:36:32.341 --> 01:36:37.341
If I'm just 50 50 I'm never 100% and I want to be 100% you know when I train,

1505
01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:42.300
when you train hours on end,
when you give so much of your,

1506
01:36:42.810 --> 01:36:47.160
of your body and your mind to this one profession and whether it's me playing

1507
01:36:47.161 --> 01:36:48.870
tennis,
whether it's something else,

1508
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:53.100
I don't want to come into one of the biggest moments in biggest stages of my

1509
01:36:53.101 --> 01:36:56.550
career and feel that I didn't do everything that I could

1510
01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:00.540
and,
and some,

1511
01:37:00.541 --> 01:37:03.780
I do think that some people are okay with that feeling,

1512
01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:08.940
but I am not and that's my choice and it all comes down to choice.

1513
01:37:08.970 --> 01:37:13.350
I think we all have them,
but as long as that were,
as long as I'm able to say,

1514
01:37:13.351 --> 01:37:15.420
and I do believe that it's for other people as well.

1515
01:37:15.421 --> 01:37:20.421
As long as we commit to that choice and not regret that choice or don't give up,

1516
01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:24.810
don't allow ourselves to regret that choice,
then that's when,

1517
01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:27.720
that's when it's the right formula for us.

1518
01:37:29.110 --> 01:37:31.540
<v 2>You have many,
many,</v>

1519
01:37:31.541 --> 01:37:35.740
many choices that are put in front of you and you have people to help.

1520
01:37:36.130 --> 01:37:39.730
But I would love to talk about choices in the morning.

1521
01:37:39.731 --> 01:37:42.580
So first thing in the morning has come up a number of times and I'm rather

1522
01:37:42.581 --> 01:37:47.560
obsessed with morning routines.
So you mentioned the incense,
Morocco,

1523
01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:51.900
you mentioned the t Darjeeling.
Uh,
when you wake up,

1524
01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:56.330
I'm do you eat breakfast right away?

1525
01:37:56.331 --> 01:38:00.140
What does the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like?
And what are,

1526
01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:03.240
what's the script?
What is the,

1527
01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.530
what does the algorithm for different all the time.
Okay.

1528
01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:12.090
What about Breck?
Is Breakfast consistent?
Do you have sort of the,
for instance,

1529
01:38:12.091 --> 01:38:15.180
for this week,
like what is your go to breakfast?

1530
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.000
<v 5>So I'm in training right now.</v>

1531
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:20.190
I'm getting ready to play all these hardcore tournaments.

1532
01:38:20.191 --> 01:38:24.450
And so for the last weeks I've been helion injury.
Now that that's,
um,

1533
01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:29.280
that's all good.
Um,
I'm back into the routine of just intense training every day.

1534
01:38:29.281 --> 01:38:33.450
And so,
you know,
I started a particular time in the morning.
Um,

1535
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:37.290
I like to wake up early.
I like to go to bed early.
So I wake up early.

1536
01:38:37.291 --> 01:38:41.940
I like to get about eight to nine hours of sleep.
Sleep has been a big part of,

1537
01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:46.890
I just feel like the makeup of how I feel,
um,
of the energy level that I have.

1538
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:49.560
Yeah.
I wake up at six 30,

1539
01:38:49.561 --> 01:38:53.910
I usually have to be ready by nine for practice.

1540
01:38:54.330 --> 01:38:58.040
So I use that time and kind of depends.
Like,
um,

1541
01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:02.370
right now I have a few,
I have a couple of businesses that I'm a part of.

1542
01:39:02.371 --> 01:39:06.750
So a lot of like the first hour,
hour and a half I spend,
um,

1543
01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.480
maybe on a conference call cause that's usually,
you know,

1544
01:39:09.481 --> 01:39:13.230
afternoon time in Europe.
So I'll do one of those.

1545
01:39:13.231 --> 01:39:17.910
I'll answer a few emails that's coming in from Europe,
have a candy brand.

1546
01:39:17.911 --> 01:39:21.750
So we have to make a lot of decisions on that on daily basis.

1547
01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:27.630
<v 2>Is it true
beyond this,</v>

1548
01:39:27.631 --> 01:39:31.650
but is it true that you can,
you were considering legally changing your name,

1549
01:39:32.110 --> 01:39:36.370
your last name for the 2013 USF for sure.

1550
01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:39.640
Good idea.
Genius idea,
genius idea.

1551
01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:45.360
<v 5>Proved to be very difficult,
but
you're taking,</v>

1552
01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.750
taking conference calls.
I do that work for the first hour,

1553
01:39:49.751 --> 01:39:53.690
hour and a half with a cup of coffee that I have to have in the morning.
Um,

1554
01:39:53.890 --> 01:39:54.940
lactose free milk.

1555
01:39:55.570 --> 01:39:57.250
<v 2>What type of lactose?
Free Milk.
Sorry.</v>

1556
01:39:57.450 --> 01:39:59.760
<v 5>Just straight on lactose free milk.</v>

1557
01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:03.700
<v 2>Oh,
I see.
So it's not all almond milk.
Coconut milk.
Lactose free.
Real milk.</v>

1558
01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:08.700
<v 5>Yeah.
Practice three.
Now for coffee.
I do Nespresso.</v>

1559
01:40:09.790 --> 01:40:14.780
Simple.
Got It.
And yeah,
I think it's all,

1560
01:40:14.781 --> 01:40:17.500
for me it's all about the phone.
It's,
I have to have like the right phone

1561
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:24.440
and then,
and then I usually,

1562
01:40:24.441 --> 01:40:29.210
when I'm getting ready,
I turn on a podcast and I listen,

1563
01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:30.980
kind of depends on the mood I'm in,

1564
01:40:30.981 --> 01:40:35.660
whether it's about health or I want to hear about someone's life or someone's

1565
01:40:35.661 --> 01:40:38.960
experiences.
Um,
I'll turn that on.

1566
01:40:38.961 --> 01:40:43.670
So by the time I get my stuff ready for the whole day of practices and kind of

1567
01:40:43.671 --> 01:40:47.840
brushing my teeth,
um,
I,
I listened to other people share.

1568
01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.100
<v 2>What are some of your favorite podcasts?</v>

1569
01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:54.580
<v 5>Hm.
Uh,
well,
a good friend of mine is Louis,
so I listened to his,</v>

1570
01:40:55.210 --> 01:40:57.190
um,
Iverson two years,

1571
01:40:57.191 --> 01:41:01.060
a bunch and past the six or eight months I would say,

1572
01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:04.390
um,
to Dan Harris's.
Um,

1573
01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:09.030
I listened to a fashion one.
Yeah,

1574
01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.000
a little bit of everything.

1575
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:14.960
<v 1>So Dan Harris,
this is Dan Harris of 10% happier.
Yes.
All right.</v>

1576
01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:16.820
Why do you listen to Dan Harris?

1577
01:41:16.821 --> 01:41:19.100
Because I was going to ask you if you have a meditation.

1578
01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:25.160
<v 5>It's,
it's interesting.
Someone asked me the other day,
do you meditate?
And I said,</v>

1579
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.110
I don't,

1580
01:41:27.111 --> 01:41:31.550
but I really feel like I do because I listened to so many people speak about

1581
01:41:31.551 --> 01:41:35.480
meditating that I really,
I feel like I do.

1582
01:41:35.690 --> 01:41:38.720
I had to think for a second.
I almost said yes.
And I was like,
no,
no,
no.

1583
01:41:38.721 --> 01:41:42.710
Actually I don't meditate.
But I listened to people speak about it.
Um,

1584
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:48.170
and I have a little bit,
I've tried,
I've done it and I,

1585
01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:52.750
I enjoy it.
Some of it is,
it feels a little cultish,

1586
01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:55.760
<v 1>plenty of that floating around.</v>

1587
01:41:57.550 --> 01:42:01.420
But you didn't like the like cat's paw and black roses I sent you.

1588
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:02.340
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

1589
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:05.240
<v 5>I like when people,
um,</v>

1590
01:42:05.570 --> 01:42:09.020
I'd like to hear about people's experience of life changing experience.

1591
01:42:09.021 --> 01:42:09.910
And I think that's what,

1592
01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:13.430
that's what really interests me is how something can affect a person,

1593
01:42:13.431 --> 01:42:16.280
whether it's reading a book,
whether it's hearing a mantra,

1594
01:42:16.281 --> 01:42:18.420
whether it's meditating.
Um,

1595
01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:22.610
so that's why I like listening to people speak about their practices or how it's

1596
01:42:22.611 --> 01:42:26.360
influenced their life or what they were going through that required that.

1597
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:29.440
Yeah.
I love learning from people's experiences.

1598
01:42:29.441 --> 01:42:31.900
So I think that's one of the reasons I listened to his.

1599
01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:32.691
<v 1>So I think,</v>

1600
01:42:32.691 --> 01:42:36.600
I think you've been meditating your entire life because of your kind of feelings

1601
01:42:36.601 --> 01:42:38.990
and your comfort level with Rep.

1602
01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:40.730
<v 5>Right?</v>

1603
01:42:40.730 --> 01:42:44.710
<v 1>I think that is one in the same in a lot of respects.</v>

1604
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:47.150
<v 5>I mean,
the one thing that I've,
and I don't,</v>

1605
01:42:47.151 --> 01:42:51.100
I don't really know where I got it from,
but I,
one thing that I do,

1606
01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:54.550
I realized that our thoughts are so spread out and that they go in so many

1607
01:42:54.551 --> 01:42:57.430
different directions.
And when I,

1608
01:42:57.730 --> 01:43:02.470
when I noticed that my mind goes to places that are so unnecessary.
When we,

1609
01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:06.400
when I create my own stories that are so far from the truth,

1610
01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:09.550
I bring it,
I bring it to,

1611
01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:14.050
I bring it back to the center of my breath.
So I do think about just breathing.

1612
01:43:14.530 --> 01:43:18.340
And that's not like me sitting in a chair and having thoughts are saying,
okay,

1613
01:43:18.341 --> 01:43:20.650
now I'm going to meditate for 10 minutes.
That's just me.

1614
01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:24.280
Whether it's on a practice court and things are not going well or I'm making so

1615
01:43:24.281 --> 01:43:29.020
many EHRs and all of a sudden I just create the story that is so that it's so

1616
01:43:29.021 --> 01:43:32.650
far from the truth or the reality.
It would be an example of that.

1617
01:43:32.890 --> 01:43:36.760
So say I,
you know,
say my coach has me say,

1618
01:43:36.761 --> 01:43:40.600
I studied some video analysis and he showed me a particular stroke that he wants

1619
01:43:40.601 --> 01:43:44.530
me to work on or a particular movement and he,

1620
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:49.210
you know,
he's at,
this is,
that's incorrect and this is,

1621
01:43:49.211 --> 01:43:53.180
he shows me an example of what he thinks I should do a little differently.

1622
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:58.100
And so I go on the practice court.
I started doing that and with repetition,

1623
01:43:58.130 --> 01:44:01.640
I'm not getting the outcome that I'm,
that I wanted.

1624
01:44:02.150 --> 01:44:04.910
And so I plant the story that no,
he's incorrect.

1625
01:44:04.911 --> 01:44:09.860
He doesn't know what he's talking about and,
or you know,
or that,

1626
01:44:09.861 --> 01:44:14.000
no,
actually this is not,
I,
this doesn't feel right.
This doesn't feel natural.

1627
01:44:14.001 --> 01:44:16.430
I'm not going to feel natural.
It doesn't feel natural now.

1628
01:44:16.431 --> 01:44:20.120
It's not going to feel natural in a competitive state of mind.

1629
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:24.050
And I know all those things are completely not true.

1630
01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.320
Those are all things that I'm putting in my brain.
How do you catch that?

1631
01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:30.130
<v 1>What do you say in your own head when you catch it?</v>

1632
01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:34.180
<v 5>I'm so aware of my surroundings and I'm really aware of,</v>

1633
01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:39.010
of like the choice of the kind of the inside choices that I make.

1634
01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:44.040
I've had sort of this feeling from a young age where I know how my mind can

1635
01:44:44.531 --> 01:44:49.531
affect others or like my surrounding and myself included without having to say

1636
01:44:50.081 --> 01:44:54.850
one word.
Yeah.
So I try to bring it back to my breath and um,

1637
01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:58.930
or sometimes changing those words completely,

1638
01:44:58.931 --> 01:45:01.030
even though those are also not true,

1639
01:45:01.031 --> 01:45:05.500
but they're much better than the negative outcome that you're putting out into

1640
01:45:05.501 --> 01:45:06.130
the world.

1641
01:45:06.130 --> 01:45:09.940
<v 1>I interrupted at some point,
which I'm prone to doing cause I get all excited.</v>

1642
01:45:10.930 --> 01:45:15.850
I also want to recommend,
I want to recommend hardcore history with Dan Carlin.

1643
01:45:15.851 --> 01:45:16.750
If you haven't heard it,

1644
01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:21.810
I would recommend starting with tomorrow morning wrath of the cons is what I

1645
01:45:22.181 --> 01:45:25.600
would recommend starting with it is my favorite podcast of all time and he does

1646
01:45:25.601 --> 01:45:28.410
one episode every six to 12 months.
Uh,

1647
01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:33.170
but you will see why they are incredible.
And uh,

1648
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:37.780
also I want to,
I'd be remiss if I didn't say thank you to Lewis,

1649
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:42.770
a mutual friend who made,
who made the introduction very,
very good man.

1650
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:49.130
I,
I think we didn't get around to it cause I got all hoppity and jumped in.

1651
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:53.660
Right now you do this,
you have the espresso with very important foam.

1652
01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:57.620
You have some conference calls,
you take care of sugar Povo and so on.

1653
01:45:58.320 --> 01:45:59.730
<v 5>Then my phone's goes,</v>

1654
01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:04.880
my phone goes in my bag for the next few hours and I train.

1655
01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:07.260
<v 1>When do you eat?
What do you have for breakfast?</v>

1656
01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:12.400
<v 5>Um,
I eat probably like 30 minutes before I get to,</v>

1657
01:46:12.690 --> 01:46:13.960
to practice,
so I,

1658
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:18.150
<v 1>okay.
So for two,
for the first two and a half,
three hours.
Your ninth grade?</v>

1659
01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:22.630
<v 5>I have a liter of water
and a cup of coffee.</v>

1660
01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:25.990
<v 1>Is it special water?
No.
Okay.
How's the on water?</v>

1661
01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:29.440
$27 southern California water.

1662
01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:36.430
<v 5>Got It.
And so I drink that.
I drink my coffee and then breakfast,</v>

1663
01:46:36.431 --> 01:46:41.431
I usually make myself a smoothie or a green juice with spinach and Kale and Chia

1664
01:46:43.481 --> 01:46:48.481
seeds and coconut water and all the other Greens.

1665
01:46:48.610 --> 01:46:49.443
Cucumber.

1666
01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:55.890
And I always have a piece of Rye bread kind.
That's kind of the European.

1667
01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:57.810
Um,
I love Rye bread.

1668
01:46:57.811 --> 01:47:02.790
So I start with that and I either put some goat cheese on it,

1669
01:47:02.850 --> 01:47:05.940
a piece of protein or avocado

1670
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:08.820
and some berries.
And that's,
it

1671
01:47:09.490 --> 01:47:10.480
<v 1>sounds delicious.</v>

1672
01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:14.593
I love,

1673
01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:21.370
my tendency is to eat a whole loaf of Rye bread.
If I allow myself a little bit,

1674
01:47:21.371 --> 01:47:23.320
I'm not very good at that moderation thing.

1675
01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:26.710
<v 5>Well,
the thing I would,
the thing about Rye bread is that I,</v>

1676
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:29.050
I don't think that it's so good.

1677
01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:33.960
<v 1>So that I,
I mean I think better than some other breads,
but it's not like,</v>

1678
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:37.980
like sour dough I love,
but I don't,
I don't eat regular bread that much.

1679
01:47:37.981 --> 01:47:41.040
So if I was eating a piece of sourdough,
I'd probably have three pieces.

1680
01:47:41.041 --> 01:47:44.060
But Rye bread is in between.
It's

1681
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:51.070
digestible.
It's not a snickers bar.
Exactly.

1682
01:47:51.690 --> 01:47:54.760
But you don't want too much of it.
All right.
Now this is,

1683
01:47:55.050 --> 01:47:56.130
this is a smart approach.

1684
01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:02.860
Just a few more things in the last few years or just in recent memory,
right.

1685
01:48:03.490 --> 01:48:08.490
What is a new belief or behavior or habit that has greatly improved your life?

1686
01:48:10.690 --> 01:48:11.620
Does anything come to mind?

1687
01:48:12.170 --> 01:48:12.411
<v 5>I mean,</v>

1688
01:48:12.411 --> 01:48:16.940
one thing that I had to go through in the past 15 months was being away from my

1689
01:48:16.941 --> 01:48:19.850
sport because of the suspension that I faced.

1690
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.390
And I went through this time period,
um,

1691
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:28.190
obviously with a lot of questions and questions of whether I would return to

1692
01:48:28.191 --> 01:48:33.110
sport,
whether it turned to the sport that I played.
But during that same time,

1693
01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:34.610
I also realized,

1694
01:48:34.611 --> 01:48:39.611
and I had a chance to stop and really recognized how and what I've really done

1695
01:48:43.281 --> 01:48:48.281
in my life and my career to inspire others and to,

1696
01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:49.841
and I,
I,

1697
01:48:49.841 --> 01:48:53.900
I'm using the word inspire a lot because that's how I kind of see other people

1698
01:48:53.901 --> 01:48:56.150
inspire,
you know,
my life.

1699
01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:01.720
But I had so many moments in instances where I would come across people that

1700
01:49:02.301 --> 01:49:07.301
would start a conversation with me and tell me kind of how I've influenced their

1701
01:49:07.791 --> 01:49:12.580
kids or how I've,
how they've seen me compete.
And then I'm,
you know,

1702
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:17.450
they admire my,
my spirits so much and that they can't wait to see me back.

1703
01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:23.030
And I don't,
I never had that realization before,
which sounds crazy and,

1704
01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:26.510
but I never really understood or I don't,

1705
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:30.080
I don't think I really understood.
Um,

1706
01:49:30.110 --> 01:49:34.610
maybe it was selfishly how much I impacted other people.

1707
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:39.090
<v 1>Did you notice that because PR madness,</v>

1708
01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:42.540
it was stressful and you saw that as a counter,

1709
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:45.240
a counter balance or why do you think you noticed it?

1710
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:49.960
<v 5>I think I noticed it because people are so many more people came,</v>

1711
01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:55.350
had had the courage to speak to me and which,

1712
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.300
which usually,
um,
you know,

1713
01:49:58.301 --> 01:50:01.990
people would come up to you and ask for an autograph or ask for a picture and it

1714
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.450
would just be,
you know,
what,
a few seconds of your time.

1715
01:50:05.110 --> 01:50:10.110
But these were instances where people would come and have a proper conversation

1716
01:50:11.231 --> 01:50:16.231
with you about how they're so they can't wait to see me back and they can't wait

1717
01:50:16.571 --> 01:50:19.390
to see me play and what,
what I mean to them.

1718
01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:25.140
And it was just different.
It was a different communication.

1719
01:50:25.141 --> 01:50:29.980
It was a different way of talent.
And every person helped me feel better.

1720
01:50:29.981 --> 01:50:32.980
There's no doubt.
But it was,
um,

1721
01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.970
it was chefs coming from the kitchen and they were pilots coming from the

1722
01:50:36.971 --> 01:50:40.460
cockpit and it was just an experience.
I,

1723
01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:42.490
I don't think I would have ever felt,

1724
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:47.910
and maybe because I never wanted to feel that like huge responsibility that I

1725
01:50:47.981 --> 01:50:52.180
did have this impact and I always wanted to keep impacting and always be the

1726
01:50:52.181 --> 01:50:55.840
right example.
Maybe that,
that's why I never quite,

1727
01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:58.060
but I do think that's a consciously,

1728
01:50:58.570 --> 01:51:01.720
I didn't want to give into that because maybe that would have added more

1729
01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:04.420
pressure.
You know,
because as I said before,

1730
01:51:04.421 --> 01:51:08.680
like my parents never made me feel that if I did or I didn't make it,

1731
01:51:08.681 --> 01:51:13.180
that it would be all right to go back to where we started.
Yeah,
it was just,

1732
01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:18.570
it was a very eyeopening moment.
You had your first sponsor is,

1733
01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:20.200
I understand that when you were 11,

1734
01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:26.660
when you were getting that amount of attention and

1735
01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:31.090
adulation from fans and chefs and so on,

1736
01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:37.820
it would seem to me a very human temptation and very easy to get a very big head

1737
01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:43.660
and for that to fix your life and performance.
And so on.
How do you,

1738
01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:47.740
how do you counteract that or how do you avoid that?

1739
01:51:47.741 --> 01:51:49.600
Because that's been the downfall of many,

1740
01:51:49.601 --> 01:51:53.980
many people who've been in the limelight for various things.

1741
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:55.860
I will say that I'm,

1742
01:51:56.020 --> 01:52:01.020
I'm a fairly realistic person and I know I've been through a lot.

1743
01:52:02.351 --> 01:52:06.850
And so I faced,
I faced a lot of grief.

1744
01:52:06.851 --> 01:52:11.410
I faced a lot of press,
I faced a lot of success.

1745
01:52:11.890 --> 01:52:16.660
I faced a lot of
boardroom meetings.
I've seen a lot,

1746
01:52:16.661 --> 01:52:21.490
I've seen a lot in my years.
And
at the end of it is,

1747
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.680
it's all,
a lot of it is,

1748
01:52:24.681 --> 01:52:29.681
is superficial and a lot of it almost seems not human like superhuman,

1749
01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:34.690
but behind everything,
there's a very human person.
You know,

1750
01:52:34.691 --> 01:52:36.850
there's a very normal,
there's a,

1751
01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:40.750
I'm very much a simple human being that,
I mean,
I,

1752
01:52:41.770 --> 01:52:45.160
I've been fortunate to make good money from my career,

1753
01:52:45.650 --> 01:52:50.480
but those things are never things that make me the happiest.
And I know that.

1754
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:54.560
And I realized that the values that you have in your life are,
um,

1755
01:52:55.190 --> 01:52:56.510
I much smaller than that.

1756
01:52:56.540 --> 01:53:00.590
And they bring so many more rewards than money could ever,
could ever bring new.

1757
01:53:00.591 --> 01:53:04.040
Of course it's helpful.
And knowing that I,
you know,

1758
01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:07.040
it puts a huge smile on my face that I can,

1759
01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:11.360
that I can support my grandparents and then I can buy them a home and that I

1760
01:53:11.361 --> 01:53:14.330
know they're going to be comfortable and they can have their garden and grow

1761
01:53:14.331 --> 01:53:18.830
their cucumbers and that my cousins can have a proper education.

1762
01:53:18.831 --> 01:53:22.940
And that feeling is incredible.
But that's,

1763
01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:26.270
and that's a feeling that,
of course,
money brings you.

1764
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:30.500
But I think the value,
I mean,
like I said,

1765
01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:34.100
the relationship that I've had with my parents,
you know,
they're,

1766
01:53:34.101 --> 01:53:38.060
they're also very strong people and they,
they will tell me if,

1767
01:53:38.150 --> 01:53:40.850
if something,
you know,
if they're,

1768
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:45.050
if they see that something's going on or if my,

1769
01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:48.530
my decisions are not correct and they're very real.
And I like,

1770
01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:51.770
I surround myself with real people,
you know,
I want to,

1771
01:53:51.771 --> 01:53:55.580
I'm a very honest person myself.
I think that's part of the Russian character.

1772
01:53:55.581 --> 01:53:57.940
I say it like it is.
Like I said,

1773
01:53:58.010 --> 01:54:01.270
I'm very straight on about what I feel and,

1774
01:54:01.271 --> 01:54:04.070
and that's sometimes gotten me into trouble,
you know,

1775
01:54:04.071 --> 01:54:07.310
just based on maybe I should keep a few opinions to myself,

1776
01:54:07.311 --> 01:54:12.311
but I like this idea of tell me how you feel about things.

1777
01:54:12.351 --> 01:54:16.820
Tell me,
tell me straight up,
you know,
don't go around,
don't,
you know,

1778
01:54:16.821 --> 01:54:20.570
maybe I,
this,
this word may be is,
is brutal.

1779
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:26.150
It's like neither here nor there.
So it's hard.

1780
01:54:26.151 --> 01:54:29.840
It's definitely hard because from a young age I could have made so many

1781
01:54:29.841 --> 01:54:33.470
different decisions that could have gotten me to different places.

1782
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:40.350
Avoided making one of the best decisions that your parents helped you make.

1783
01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:45.710
I mean at that age is a lot of decisions that my parents made,
but I think it,

1784
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:47.900
from a a business point of view,

1785
01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:53.840
I've been been able to be associated with many great brands.

1786
01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:58.640
Um,
and there is a lot of opportunities,
especially when I was young to make,

1787
01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.710
um,
what I like to call a quick money.
It's like,
why are,
why are in the bank,

1788
01:55:03.711 --> 01:55:08.080
you show up for a shoot and you do it and you smile and you leave.
And,

1789
01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.040
and there you are.
Um,
and that is,

1790
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:14.930
it's not that,
it's,

1791
01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:19.540
it's great that you have this company and this brand that you know,

1792
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:22.130
has tracked you down and I seen you in a,

1793
01:55:22.131 --> 01:55:24.740
studied you and wants you to be a part of their brand.

1794
01:55:25.130 --> 01:55:29.720
But I've always felt like the best decisions I've made are based on real

1795
01:55:29.721 --> 01:55:30.441
partnerships,

1796
01:55:30.441 --> 01:55:35.441
like real understanding of what a company of what myself wants from each other

1797
01:55:35.991 --> 01:55:37.520
and why we want to work together.

1798
01:55:37.521 --> 01:55:39.870
And I really believe that's one of the reasons I've,

1799
01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:44.970
I've had these partnerships for such a time.
Um,
I mean,

1800
01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.820
one example is with Nike.
I mean it's,

1801
01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:52.380
it's so much more than just me wearing a swoosh on the court.
Um,

1802
01:55:53.130 --> 01:55:57.930
like I,
I go into a store and I take pride in and back.
That looks,
I was,

1803
01:55:57.931 --> 01:56:01.680
well actually I was walking around the other day and someone came up to me and

1804
01:56:01.681 --> 01:56:05.760
said,
wow,
you look like you could,
you could be like a Nike billboard.
And I was,

1805
01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:09.780
<v 4>you know,
and you kind of knows it.
And I,
I looked,
I didn't know I give that was,</v>

1806
01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:13.840
you know,
funny or not,
or they were like making fun of what I was wearing,

1807
01:56:14.370 --> 01:56:16.970
but I looked at her and I was like,
yeah,
and this,

1808
01:56:16.971 --> 01:56:20.250
so while you're Maria Sharapova of course you are,
they pay you to,

1809
01:56:20.490 --> 01:56:22.500
they pay to wear that.
And I said,
no,

1810
01:56:22.501 --> 01:56:26.700
actually you have no idea how happy I am to where this,
um,

1811
01:56:27.090 --> 01:56:31.620
<v 5>like you,
you kind of grow a fondness of the people that you work with of the,</v>

1812
01:56:31.650 --> 01:56:36.300
there's so much that goes into a campaign,
a,

1813
01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:40.800
a product a and I love that stuff.
Okay.
I purse.
I love knowing.
I got,

1814
01:56:40.801 --> 01:56:42.830
I went to the Nike Campuses,
um,

1815
01:56:42.930 --> 01:56:46.800
after my Harvard experience and I followed around.
Um,

1816
01:56:47.130 --> 01:56:49.500
I wanted to meetings and I kind of shadowed,

1817
01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:53.550
I was like a little ghost and all these meetings because I wanted to learn about

1818
01:56:53.551 --> 01:56:54.450
like product developers

1819
01:56:54.710 --> 01:56:57.290
<v 1>that was at Beaverton.
All right.
Yeah.
Nice.</v>

1820
01:56:58.190 --> 01:57:00.380
<v 5>So I went into these meetings and I just,</v>

1821
01:57:01.170 --> 01:57:05.900
I wanted to know why a product is dropped and why this material is used and why

1822
01:57:05.901 --> 01:57:08.780
that material was being developed.
And um,

1823
01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:12.320
there's just so much incredible technology.
I just,
I love fashion.

1824
01:57:12.321 --> 01:57:15.590
I love creativity,
so I got to learn a lot about that.

1825
01:57:15.591 --> 01:57:18.200
But you take great pride in the people that you work with and,

1826
01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:22.250
and the decisions that I,
that I made,
um,

1827
01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:27.370
that started with either a friendship or a partnership where you understand the

1828
01:57:27.501 --> 01:57:31.520
company and you know,
the people have,
are the ones that have grown.

1829
01:57:32.210 --> 01:57:34.520
<v 1>I mean,
you're playing the long game and a lot of ways,</v>

1830
01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:40.460
I think there are many people who feel like they know a lot about you.

1831
01:57:40.890 --> 01:57:44.520
So my last two questions are about things that people might not know about you.

1832
01:57:44.521 --> 01:57:46.500
And hopefully there's a lot of that in this conversation already.

1833
01:57:46.501 --> 01:57:51.501
But the first one is if you had to give a Ted talk about something you are not

1834
01:57:51.811 --> 01:57:53.560
known for no tennis.

1835
01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:54.893
<v 5>All right.</v>

1836
01:57:55.150 --> 01:57:58.690
<v 1>Uh,
for instance,
what would you talk about?
What is the,</v>

1837
01:57:59.270 --> 01:58:03.880
the personal obsession that few people know about or,

1838
01:58:04.290 --> 01:58:06.840
or something you're good at that few people know about that you would talk about

1839
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:08.183
or anything.
Wow,

1840
01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:13.310
<v 5>I'm good at,
but I,
and I don't know if I necessarily do a Ted talk on it.</v>

1841
01:58:14.210 --> 01:58:19.210
I have this year I have a huge passion for architecture and um,

1842
01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:24.320
yeah,
I've,
I think I've always said that if I was in a tennis player,

1843
01:58:24.321 --> 01:58:28.820
I would love to,
I would love to be an architect.
I find it's,

1844
01:58:28.930 --> 01:58:31.250
it's like my,
it's my happy place.

1845
01:58:31.251 --> 01:58:36.251
Like when I am able to drive around palm springs or drive around Tuscany and see

1846
01:58:38.050 --> 01:58:41.860
the differences and beams and windows and um,

1847
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:44.200
like I love studying that and I just,

1848
01:58:44.201 --> 01:58:48.520
I spent a few years building a home myself and that process that could jail if I

1849
01:58:48.521 --> 01:58:53.470
had the time,
which I don't have at the moment,
I would just do for fun.
Um,

1850
01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:56.380
so yeah,
that would be something that I'm passionate about,

1851
01:58:56.381 --> 01:58:57.490
but not many people know.

1852
01:58:58.060 --> 01:58:59.050
<v 1>What do you like about it?</v>

1853
01:58:59.051 --> 01:59:02.230
And do you have any favorite types of architecture or architects?

1854
01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:09.040
<v 5>Yeah,
absolutely.
Some from Neu tread to frank Gehry.</v>

1855
01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:09.893
Um,

1856
01:59:10.090 --> 01:59:14.980
I love like the indoor and outdoor field and I love one when architects are able

1857
01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:20.310
to bring nature into a home and make it feel like you were living outside,

1858
01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:25.510
but you're kind of in this cocoon environment.
I don't know if that makes sense.

1859
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:29.140
Um,
but I've,
Oh yeah,

1860
01:59:29.141 --> 01:59:34.141
I've just always been fascinated by how someone can have an idea and draw some

1861
01:59:34.391 --> 01:59:39.391
lines and two years later you have structure and you have placement and you have

1862
01:59:40.181 --> 01:59:43.030
a floor plan and you have this maze.

1863
01:59:43.031 --> 01:59:47.320
And it actually started from a young age because I,
growing up in Florida,
I went,

1864
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:49.470
I was invited to um,

1865
01:59:50.230 --> 01:59:54.540
for a few sleepovers and I would go to a sleep over at a rich PR.

1866
01:59:54.610 --> 01:59:58.280
That time is like a rich person's home that had four or five bedrooms and I'd

1867
01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:00.250
never seen a home that had four or five.

1868
02:00:02.890 --> 02:00:06.940
<v 4>What are all these rooms for?
Why is like two dining rooms?</v>

1869
02:00:06.941 --> 02:00:08.380
Like why isn't one enough?

1870
02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:13.130
<v 5>Um,
and that's when I became fascinated with floor plans and um,</v>

1871
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:17.930
how like something connects to another thing and like the usage of space and,

1872
02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:22.840
and then details like colors and materials.
Um,
yeah,

1873
02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:26.200
it was just always really appealing.
What is your personal favorite color?

1874
02:00:27.850 --> 02:00:29.710
Um,
I love neutral colors,

1875
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:34.420
so I love grays and darks and no browns.

1876
02:00:34.630 --> 02:00:36.760
Wow.
I don't want to say black cause that's,

1877
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:40.460
<v 4>I mean when I say someone,
a little girl asked me the other day,</v>

1878
02:00:40.461 --> 02:00:43.780
what's your favorite color?
Because she wanted,

1879
02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:49.120
she wanted to draw something for me and I was about to say black and I was like,

1880
02:00:49.370 --> 02:00:52.010
oh no,
she's not going to like me if I say black.

1881
02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:56.090
So now every time someone asks me my favorite color,
I'm like,
ah,
yellow.

1882
02:00:58.810 --> 02:01:03.350
It sounds so much happier than black.
I guess it's hard to say.
Do a little girl

1883
02:01:05.330 --> 02:01:08.760
black like the grim reapers Cape.
Exactly.

1884
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:13.790
So I ended up with yellow.
That's your cover story.

1885
02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:18.470
Very last one.

1886
02:01:19.110 --> 02:01:20.680
<v 1>And uh,</v>

1887
02:01:20.890 --> 02:01:25.440
we'll see what we get is what is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you

1888
02:01:25.441 --> 02:01:29.130
love?
And I'll give you an example,
an example of this.
Uh,

1889
02:01:29.131 --> 02:01:32.790
and I asked Cheryl strayed this question can we wrote wild,

1890
02:01:32.791 --> 02:01:36.870
which was made into a movie and amazing woman and she said,

1891
02:01:36.871 --> 02:01:41.010
every sandwich I get has to be in uniform layers.

1892
02:01:41.070 --> 02:01:45.150
So every bite is a similar to the next as possible.
So if she gets a sandwich in,

1893
02:01:45.151 --> 02:01:48.270
like all the Avocados are kind of over on one side or whatever,

1894
02:01:48.271 --> 02:01:51.360
she'll reopen it and rearrange it so that everybody is the same.
Now,

1895
02:01:51.361 --> 02:01:53.100
I'm not saying you have to have something like that,

1896
02:01:53.101 --> 02:01:56.370
but does anything come to mind and unusual habit,

1897
02:01:56.430 --> 02:02:01.180
a weird object and absurd thing.
Anything that you love that is a little odd.

1898
02:02:01.770 --> 02:02:03.660
<v 5>Random things.
Like I,</v>

1899
02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:08.280
I always put my left shoe on before my right and not be not just a tennis shoe

1900
02:02:08.281 --> 02:02:10.920
but like any shoe because I never,

1901
02:02:10.921 --> 02:02:14.190
when I'm at a store and I'm trying shoes and they hand me a right shoe,
I'm like,

1902
02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:15.210
uh Oh,
sorry.

1903
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:20.820
Like I'm fine with like opening the box again myself

1904
02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:27.300
to give you a strange luck.
Um,

1905
02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:32.940
then like for my out my match court outfits I don't like to wear,

1906
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:37.260
usually people like to wear the same outfit,
so if they like did well in it,

1907
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:39.820
they wear it again.
Um,

1908
02:02:40.050 --> 02:02:42.930
I mean they wash it but then where it again or maybe they don't wash it,

1909
02:02:42.931 --> 02:02:46.680
I don't know.
So I do the opposite.
I,
I don't wear it again.

1910
02:02:47.010 --> 02:02:49.770
I alternate.
So you never,
you know,

1911
02:02:49.771 --> 02:02:51.900
does that mean you want to wear the same exact one?

1912
02:02:51.901 --> 02:02:54.930
I'll wear the same looking outfit,
but I have a few different ones.

1913
02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:57.440
<v 1>Okay.
But never the exact same outfit again.
Okay.</v>

1914
02:02:59.530 --> 02:03:02.200
<v 5>I love it.
Not In that same tournament</v>

1915
02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:06.120
<v 1>when you win a huge higher,
um,
I,
you know,</v>

1916
02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:09.780
I feel like I'm making a liar of myself,
but when you win a big tournament,

1917
02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:13.360
do you have a favorite cheat food or anything that you sell it?

1918
02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:17.500
<v 5>Great.
I love sweets.
I love,
um,
I love Dolce de Leche.</v>

1919
02:03:20.150 --> 02:03:24.060
I love 'em.
We have this cake in Russia.
Um,
it's called the [inaudible].

1920
02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:26.640
It's a honey cake.
Um,

1921
02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:32.120
I could eat that every day for breakfast,
lunch,
dinner,
or is it different?

1922
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:37.700
No,
it's a little,
it's not as crunchy.
It's a soft cake.
I see.
It's a layer cake,

1923
02:03:37.701 --> 02:03:41.540
but it's a soft cake.
And Yeah.
I,

1924
02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:44.750
I love Cherry Blake.
When my grandmother makes cherry jam,

1925
02:03:44.751 --> 02:03:48.980
I could eat that by the spoons.
And that's like a child and memory.

1926
02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:51.530
Yeah.
So I love,
I love sweets.

1927
02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:55.880
<v 1>Oh,
it makes sense for sugar pover for an athlete.
Right.</v>

1928
02:03:56.330 --> 02:04:00.880
Thanks a lot of sentence and a,
well,
it's great for glycogen replenishment,
right?

1929
02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:01.723
Yes.

1930
02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:05.300
For those people wondering bullshit to let Shea also known as the crack cocaine

1931
02:04:05.301 --> 02:04:09.870
of Argentina.
Uh,
delicious on vanilla ice cream.
And,
uh,

1932
02:04:10.130 --> 02:04:13.550
if,
if it's going to keep other people up until four in the morning cause it'll

1933
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.200
drive them nuts.
Rds,
Romanian,
right.

1934
02:04:18.750 --> 02:04:23.270
It's that it doesn't bother anybody.
Uh,
Marie,
this has been so much fun.

1935
02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:26.670
I really appreciate you taking the time and thank you.

1936
02:04:26.671 --> 02:04:31.430
So I really encourage people to learn more about your story.
I cannot wait.

1937
02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:36.620
Do you read unstoppable and people can find you at [inaudible] dot com Facebook.

1938
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:42.840
It's facebook.com/sharapova and then Twitter and Instagram are both at Maria

1939
02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:43.690
Sharapova.
Uh,

1940
02:04:43.710 --> 02:04:48.710
do you have any final ask of the people listening or a suggestion for the

1941
02:04:50.011 --> 02:04:51.810
audience?
Anything that comes to mind?

1942
02:04:52.690 --> 02:04:56.620
<v 5>Uh,
no.
I just,
I hope that they continue listening to your work cause I,</v>

1943
02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:58.210
but when I started,

1944
02:04:58.211 --> 02:05:02.260
I was so impressed by your interviews and the way you're able to,
um,

1945
02:05:02.530 --> 02:05:06.670
get a lot out of people and in a conversational form.
And,
um,

1946
02:05:06.730 --> 02:05:09.790
so keep listening and,
uh,
yeah,
and I'm,
I'm so,

1947
02:05:10.090 --> 02:05:15.090
I'm really excited about the opportunity that I had to share my story with other

1948
02:05:15.251 --> 02:05:18.970
people and to share my journey.
And,
um,
you know,

1949
02:05:18.971 --> 02:05:23.860
sometimes we think that our story is not special and everyone's story is very

1950
02:05:23.861 --> 02:05:28.861
special and I've just been so excited about being able to put it on paper and

1951
02:05:28.991 --> 02:05:33.400
for everyone,
um,
you know,
to read,
to read it.

1952
02:05:33.401 --> 02:05:35.700
So yeah,
it's a big,
it's,
you know,

1953
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:38.530
I've always been a very personal and private individuals,

1954
02:05:38.531 --> 02:05:43.531
so it's sort of a big moment for me because I share a lot of frame of mind that

1955
02:05:43.631 --> 02:05:47.950
I had as a young girl and as an athlete,
as a person,
as a daughter,
um,

1956
02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:49.090
in relationships.

1957
02:05:49.091 --> 02:05:53.890
So there's a lot I share that I never thought a few years ago I would be able
to.

1958
02:05:53.980 --> 02:05:57.580
Um,
it's exciting.
It's a little scary,
puts you in a vulnerable place,

1959
02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:01.270
but I'm very looking forward to,

1960
02:06:01.271 --> 02:06:03.790
to hearing what people think of it as well.

1961
02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:06.740
<v 1>And a congratulations be,</v>

1962
02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:12.340
we talked about toughness is one of your defining competitive advantages.

1963
02:06:12.341 --> 02:06:17.170
The fact that you recorded your own audio book.
Oh my God.
No,

1964
02:06:17.171 --> 02:06:21.370
I was like,
oh,
it's giving me enough credit for this.
So my God,

1965
02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:26.410
like you think walking through or running a marathon in the desert with no water

1966
02:06:26.411 --> 02:06:29.080
is hard.
Like recording an entire audio book.

1967
02:06:29.230 --> 02:06:33.310
<v 5>I had to take a couple of days off after that because I was training in the</v>

1968
02:06:33.311 --> 02:06:37.780
mornings and then I'd go and I'd record six to eight hours for three days.
Good.

1969
02:06:37.781 --> 02:06:42.340
God and I,
I called my team at the end of the third and I said I,
I,

1970
02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:43.031
first of all,

1971
02:06:43.031 --> 02:06:48.031
I have no voice and second of all like you have off tomorrow

1972
02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:50.650
<v 1>cause they're not coming.
Yeah,
it is.</v>

1973
02:06:50.651 --> 02:06:55.651
It is one of the most comprehensively exhausting experiences you can imagine,

1974
02:06:55.900 --> 02:06:59.110
which is why I've never recorded one of my own audio books.
I've all,

1975
02:06:59.111 --> 02:07:01.210
I've done bits and pieces and then I've tapped out.

1976
02:07:01.690 --> 02:07:02.860
<v 5>Right.
So I,
well,</v>

1977
02:07:02.861 --> 02:07:07.330
what I liked at the end of it was that after I read it and when you read out

1978
02:07:07.331 --> 02:07:12.300
loud it was,
I didn't want to change a single thing.
Yeah.

1979
02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:13.460
And that was when I,

1980
02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:18.470
<v 1>that is incredible milestone.
Credibly rare,
incredibly,</v>

1981
02:07:18.471 --> 02:07:18.980
incredibly rare.

1982
02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:23.980
Which means that the book has to be really,

1983
02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:27.200
really good.
I just,
that isn't a really clear and no,
no,

1984
02:07:27.201 --> 02:07:30.890
I'm telling you that's a really,
really clear indicator.
If you didn't change a,

1985
02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:32.360
it means that it's B.

1986
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:37.440
It means that our dear friend Mr well,
I'm kidding.
I don't know,

1987
02:07:37.441 --> 02:07:42.210
but a rich Cohen I know of his work really got the voice right,

1988
02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:47.130
which is really,
really hard to do so I'm excited to check it out.

1989
02:07:47.131 --> 02:07:50.450
Everybody check it out and unstoppable.

1990
02:07:50.451 --> 02:07:54.170
You can find it everywhere and thank you so much for the time,
Maria.

1991
02:07:54.230 --> 02:07:58.520
I know that your time is precious and I know you have a lot of demands on your

1992
02:07:58.521 --> 02:08:02.000
time so I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

1993
02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:04.070
And to everybody listening,

1994
02:08:04.670 --> 02:08:09.670
you can find the show notes as usual links to everything we talked about,

1995
02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:12.250
links to the architects,

1996
02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:17.140
she named links to unstoppable self links to everything in the show

1997
02:08:17.141 --> 02:08:21.670
notes@tim.blog forward slash,
podcast and as always,

1998
02:08:21.671 --> 02:08:25.630
thank you for allowing me to make this my job,
I guess.

1999
02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:28.750
And until next time,
thanks for listening.

2000
02:08:30.590 --> 02:08:33.980
<v 6>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

2001
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:36.950
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2002
02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:40.240
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2003
02:08:40.250 --> 02:08:42.860
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday?

2004
02:08:43.130 --> 02:08:47.360
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

2005
02:08:47.361 --> 02:08:47.720
Fridays,

2006
02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:52.280
a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

2007
02:08:52.281 --> 02:08:53.600
pondering over the week.

2008
02:08:53.810 --> 02:08:56.570
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2009
02:08:56.571 --> 02:09:00.020
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2010
02:09:00.021 --> 02:09:04.370
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

2011
02:09:04.610 --> 02:09:09.610
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2012
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:13.010
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

2013
02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:18.080
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

2014
02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:20.300
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2015
02:09:20.570 --> 02:09:25.220
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

2016
02:09:25.221 --> 02:09:28.400
out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very next one.

2017
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:29.623
And if you sign up,

2018
02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:33.830
I hope you enjoyed this episode is brought to you by a cent protein,

2019
02:09:33.831 --> 02:09:38.831
the cleanest least process protein I've ever consumed and I have tried just

2020
02:09:39.231 --> 02:09:42.470
about everything since well before the four hour body.

2021
02:09:42.770 --> 02:09:46.130
I've started my day with 20 to 30 grams of protein.

2022
02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:48.140
First thing that has been part of my routine,

2023
02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:52.910
but I don't always have the time or necessarily the desire to cook an entire

2024
02:09:52.911 --> 02:09:54.440
meal,
so what to do.

2025
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:59.390
Protein powders can be a fast way to get this protein needs met,

2026
02:09:59.450 --> 02:10:03.590
but most products are full of crap.
They're bleached,
they have excess sugar,

2027
02:10:04.100 --> 02:10:07.520
terrible artificial sweeteners or just straight forward low grade,

2028
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:12.790
low quality protein ascent contains a zero artificial ingredients and the parent

2029
02:10:13.731 --> 02:10:15.350
company is actually cheese manufacturer,

2030
02:10:15.351 --> 02:10:19.910
so they produce their own native proteins.
It's,

2031
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:23.990
it's really fascinating and I've looked at they're processing it takes or it

2032
02:10:23.991 --> 02:10:26.090
took them about five years to develop.

2033
02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:31.250
You can mix the protein in as little as four ounces without any clumps or issues

2034
02:10:31.251 --> 02:10:35.060
of mixed ability whatsoever and they nailed taste.
They tested,
for instance,

2035
02:10:35.590 --> 02:10:39.470
for the chocolate version 282 different versions.

2036
02:10:39.471 --> 02:10:40.730
They put a lot of money in,

2037
02:10:40.731 --> 02:10:44.900
a lot of time into RMD for this particular product,

2038
02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:47.090
nab both way and my seller casing.

2039
02:10:47.091 --> 02:10:52.091
So if you want to say improve body composition and recovery overnight slow

2040
02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:56.270
release,
you can take from my seller casein or in my case whey protein,

2041
02:10:56.380 --> 02:11:00.180
I would take postworkout for instance,
or in the morning.
So check it out.

2042
02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:02.690
These guys were really fascinating.
Visit a sense,

2043

If you want a very quick 20th 30 gram dose to start your day or after workout.

2049
02:11:23.181 --> 02:11:27.260
This is a fantastic option.
It is arguably the best that I've found.
So again,

2050
02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:31.130
chicken up a scent,
protein.com forward slash Tim,

2051
02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:33.710
this episode is brought to you by kettle and fire,

2052
02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:37.910
which makes some of the best bone broth and certainly the most convenient that

2053
02:11:37.911 --> 02:11:42.911
I've ever found and I have a big stack of them on my kitchen counter right now I

2054
02:11:43.161 --> 02:11:48.161
have one container every morning and this first came highly recommended to me by

2055
02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:53.360
path podcast guests such as Amelia Boone who is a four time world champion in

2056
02:11:53.361 --> 02:11:57.470
both stops,
mudder,
Spartan race,
etc. And Dr Dominic D'agostino,

2057
02:11:57.471 --> 02:12:00.680
the incredible hulk of scientific research is check him out too.

2058
02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:04.580
But there are few things that make kettle and fire special.
Number one,

2059
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:06.920
they are the first shelf stable.
In other words,

2060
02:12:06.921 --> 02:12:10.730
never frozen bone broth that uses bones from 100% grass fed,

2061
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:15.320
organically raised animals,
so you are what you eat,

2062
02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:17.150
ate,
if that makes sense.

2063
02:12:17.151 --> 02:12:20.270
So it's very important that you understand if you're consuming animal protein,

2064
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:24.770
what they consume.
They also use longer cook types of 20 plus hours,

2065
02:12:24.771 --> 02:12:27.860
which means more collagen and other nutrients.
For instance,

2066
02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:33.280
they contain 19 times more collagen then one of their close competitors.

2067
02:12:34.190 --> 02:12:35.840
And an independent lab confirm this,

2068
02:12:36.050 --> 02:12:39.380
I'll leave the competitor's name out of it because I don't want to get sued.

2069
02:12:39.381 --> 02:12:42.680
But that's the case and it is not frozen.

2070
02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:45.530
So thanks to many millions of dollars of packaging equipment.

2071
02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:50.090
Their bone broth doesn't require freezing or shipping with dry ice.

2072
02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:50.721
So like I said,

2073
02:12:50.721 --> 02:12:54.830
it's just sitting on my kitchen counter in boxes and then I can keep them up.

2074
02:12:54.831 --> 02:12:55.880
They're basically ready to drink,

2075
02:12:56.030 --> 02:13:00.800
keep them up on stove top or in a microwave and your ready to rock and roll.

2076
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:05.070
You also get a nice payload of Glucosomine glycine,
uh,

2077
02:13:05.090 --> 02:13:09.410
along with the Gel to and everything else that I mentioned.
So check it out.

2078
02:13:10.070 --> 02:13:13.010
I've been hugely pleased with this and like I said,

2079
02:13:13.011 --> 02:13:14.480
had been consuming it every morning.

2080
02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:17.450
It gives you about let's say 20 grams of protein,

2081
02:13:17.451 --> 02:13:19.880
which is a nice little slow carb diet boost,

2082
02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:20.930
if that's what you're looking for it.

2083
02:13:20.990 --> 02:13:25.990
Then I'll typically sip this out of a very large camping coffee mug as I do some

2084
02:13:26.961 --> 02:13:31.010
writing or journaling so that you have it.
Check it out.
It's been,

2085
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:35.250
I favor the chicken,
but uh,

2086
02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:38.130
each to his own or her own.
So check it out.

2087
02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:43.160
Kettle and fire.com/tim and you can receive 20% off of your entire order.

2088
