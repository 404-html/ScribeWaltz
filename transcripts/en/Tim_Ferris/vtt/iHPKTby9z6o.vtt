1
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.830
Neil,
welcome to the show.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

2
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.950
I has been hoping to have this conversation for years and with a flashback for,

3
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.600
you know,
10,
15,
by 20 plus years I've been reading your work.

4
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.180
I can't say that about many people I've ever met

5
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.570
<v 2>and I mean you've been asking me incredibly politely,
um,</v>

6
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.870
if I could do the podcast or anything vaguely

7
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.120
edging around it and giving me open invitations for,
for a good decade.

8
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.320
It's this true.
Um,
you know,

9
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:57.321
and I love the fact that we've managed to do the occasional tiny goofy thing I

10
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:00.830
got,
I got to do,
read a page of your book.
That's right.

11
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.410
<v 1>That's right.
You read a page of the book,</v>

12
00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:06.730
which was incredible because I find your voice as many people do rather

13
00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:07.564
hypnotic.

14
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.900
And then we got to do a very short chapter in tribe of mentors.

15
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.310
The last book,
thank you very much for answering those questions.
And uh,

16
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.060
it's,
it's just such a,
such a thrill to be able to spend time with you.

17
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.880
I'm loving it.
And I thought,
I thought we could begin with the,

18
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.840
the glorious beginnings.
And maybe for those people who can't see this,

19
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.300
I'll give some context.
I have not just one recorder but two,
three,

20
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.070
four different sets of audio.

21
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.510
And that's in part because I was a or am once bitten,

22
00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:45.790
twice shy when it comes to audio.

23
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.500
And then you shared one of your early days stories.
What happened?

24
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.050
<v 2>Oh,
so,
um,
when I was 15,</v>

25
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.590
I really wanted to meet and talk to writers and artists I admired and I couldn't

26
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.960
figure out how you did this.
I didn't know about conventions.

27
00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:13.730
If there were conventions back in 1975,
76.

28
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.050
Um,
so I had a brilliant idea.

29
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.330
I would start a magazine.

30
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.380
The magazine as far as I was consent and even have to exist.

31
00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:28.580
The fact that it went on to exist was really fun.
And we called it metro.

32
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.170
Um,
which was the name I came up with because it sounded like a magazine.

33
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.600
It didn't just sound like a magazine.

34
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:37.700
It sounded like a magazine that you have heard of.

35
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.240
And I love the fact that over the years,

36
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.340
metro magazines around the world actually do exist now,
but in 1975,

37
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.700
they didn't,
but I could phone up and say,
what from Metro magazine?
And people go,

38
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.560
Oh yeah,
you know,
I've always just had broken.

39
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.270
So over the phone,
nobody knew that we were 15.
Um,

40
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.360
and I remember interviewing,
uh,
Michael Moorcock,

41
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.340
uh,
who was an author whose work I loved with,
with my friend Dave Dixon,

42
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.610
who told me recently he just found the tape and is threatening to put it up as

43
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:20.710
some kind of glorious podcasts,
which I really hope he does.
Um,

44
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.960
15 year old,
the old game.
And then Dave Dickson interviewing Michael Moorcock.
Um,

45
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.990
but the,
the one that taught me my lesson was the,

46
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.910
I think it was the second interview we did,
we'll cook was the first.

47
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.403
Um,

48
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.280
and it was Roger Dean and Roger Dean is an artist and designer most famous back

49
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.480
then for the covers of yes,
albums,

50
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:53.680
this beautiful sort of calligraphy and these floating islands and things like

51
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:58.300
that.
And I got talking to some kid on the train who said,

52
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:01.630
Oh yeah,
you know,
I know Roger Dean.

53
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.820
And so we found up budgeting publisher,
which was basically a Roger Dean,

54
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.690
I think they were called Dragon's dream.
And uh,
said,
you know,

55
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.290
like 20 interview Roger went down to Brighton.
Um,

56
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.780
I remember the sheer amazement and joy of these paintings that were,

57
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:26.620
as far as I was concerned,

58
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.510
iconic religious emblem stay.
They were,

59
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.110
you know,
I,
and I didn't like,
yes,
very much.
In fact,

60
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:37.810
I didn't really like much of the music that he'd done covers too,

61
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.620
but I had a copy of his book views and just loved it.

62
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:46.540
There was a painting he did of some badges.
There was just these things.

63
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:49.750
Um,
it felt very lord of the rings.

64
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:54.751
It felt very fantastical and there were these amazing paintings covered in dust,

65
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.950
propped up against walls and we interviewed him.

66
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.330
And at the end of the interview I noticed that the tape wasn't going round and

67
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.820
got home,
played it.

68
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.320
And you can hear this 30 seconds of us talking.

69
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.890
There's 30 seconds of us talking in higher and higher pitched voices faster and

70
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:23.410
faster,
like mad chipmunks and then it stops.

71
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.040
And that was the Roger Dean interview and I,

72
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.180
and the great thing about that was when seven years later I really was a

73
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.140
journalist.
I really was going around interviewing people.

74
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:43.141
I was interviewing people for magazines that existed and um,

75
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.700
you know,
had existed before we decided to do the interviews and things.
Um,

76
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.780
I always carried spare batteries.
I always carried spare tapes

77
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.770
if I could,
you know,
at the point I could afford to,

78
00:05:58.771 --> 00:06:02.580
I even carried a spam micro cassette recorder just in case

79
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.330
<v 1>Justin Case two is one and one is none as they say sometimes.</v>

80
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:10.220
And I said the gods,

81
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.370
the gods gifted you with a malfunction early.

82
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.400
<v 2>Exactly.
One good malfunction and you learn your lesson.
This,
that pain thing.</v>

83
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.340
<v 1>And we were chatting before we sat down to record as I was gathering copious</v>

84
00:06:24.341 --> 00:06:29.110
beverages,
water and tea and so on for us,
I said,
I'm using the royal us,

85
00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:32.680
I suppose firstly for me.
And I got water too.

86
00:06:32.681 --> 00:06:37.681
And we were talking about this location downtown where we're sitting and I've,

87
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.620
I've decided in the last few years to use locations outside of my home for a lot

88
00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:47.920
of what I do because I found it,
uh,

89
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.150
that is it being sitting at my kitchen table doing a lot too sometimes produce

90
00:06:52.151 --> 00:06:52.261
them.

91
00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:57.261
Malays this is this odd association or lack of dissociation between work and

92
00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:02.230
home.
And I had read at one point that Maya Angelou and I hope I'm getting that

93
00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:06.940
pronunciation right,
would rent hotel rooms to work on a lot of her writing.

94
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.060
And then you brought up another name.

95
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.740
<v 2>So I'm back in about 1997 I read an article by Ian Fleming.</v>

96
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.620
He wrote the James Bond books about how he wrote the James Bond books

97
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.530
and you read this article and you realize something which is Ian Fleming did not

98
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.740
enjoy the process of writing.
Um,

99
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.340
I was always fascinated by the fact that that

100
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.700
several of Roald Dahl's,

101
00:07:41.701 --> 00:07:46.701
most famous short stories were plotted by and Fleming Fleming would really,

102
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.760
yeah,
he gave Dowel,
no idea.

103
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.030
The two best short story twists,

104
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.800
which our lamb to the slaughter where the woman kills her husband with a leg of

105
00:07:58.801 --> 00:08:02.980
lamb and then cooks it,
um,

106
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.330
and feeds it to the detective who is going,

107
00:08:06.331 --> 00:08:10.590
I cannot figure out what he was hit with a is any inflowing plot.

108
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.650
And so is the one about the evil antique dealer who finds this amazing antique,

109
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:17.923
um,

110
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.240
in on some farm and decides to cheat the farmers and explains it.

111
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.220
Well,
the thing isn't worth any money,
but the legs,
the legs are worth some money.

112
00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:33.810
So I'll,
uh,
I'll give you a,
you know,
20 quid for the legs,

113
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:34.890
um,

114
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:39.890
and is about to take away this million pound a antique thing and the farmers

115
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.040
helpfully rip off the legs and throw the rest of it away.

116
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.280
You made this easier for you and uh,

117
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.370
and those plots were both the and plantings and you start realizing,
oh,

118
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.240
you really don't like writing when you read his thing on how he wrote the gins

119
00:08:54.241 --> 00:08:57.160
been books.
Uh,

120
00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.760
you read a James Bond book into weeks,

121
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.850
you check into a hotel,

122
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.130
you have to check into a hotel somewhere that you don't want to be.

123
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.340
Otherwise you might go out and walk around and become a tourist.

124
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.330
You have to check into a not terribly nice hotel room,

125
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:21.450
otherwise he might luxuriate men enjoy it and instead what you want to be is

126
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:23.020
focused on getting out

127
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.730
and then you having nothing else to do in this town in this place.

128
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.920
You settle down and you write like a fiend and you get your James Bond book

129
00:09:38.141 --> 00:09:41.860
written in two weeks and you leave this horrible hotel room and that was how he

130
00:09:41.861 --> 00:09:46.000
did it and I have tried it a couple of times.

131
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.690
I did it with the American draft of Neverwhere.

132
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:53.560
That was the first one I ever tried and I did the entire

133
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.830
set of American draft,
which was a big second drug.

134
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.010
The book had already been published in the UK,

135
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.430
but my American editor wanted stuff done because she pointed out that the book

136
00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:11.140
as it existed was written for people who knew,

137
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.810
knew that Oxford street was a big street with lots of shops on it and you know

138
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:21.870
it or whatever it was written for Brits and Londoners and she wanted something

139
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.650
expanded.
So I expanded it.
Um,

140
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.980
and I was in a room with as far as I remember,

141
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.130
no windows in the,

142
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.710
I think it was a Marriott in the World Trade Center and um,

143
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.200
which is no longer there.
But writing in that hotel room,

144
00:10:50.201 --> 00:10:51.970
you just wanted to be out

145
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:54.790
<v 1>and it's,
it seems to me,</v>

146
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.950
and you can't believe everything you read on the Internet,

147
00:10:56.951 --> 00:11:01.120
so I want you to certainly fact check me as needed,
but that you,

148
00:11:01.121 --> 00:11:02.350
you also

149
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.270
have or have had some internal rules so you can,

150
00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:11.740
you can use your external environment to assist.
But,
but I read,

151
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.570
uh,
that and again,
feel free to correct,

152
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.330
but making rules the importance of making rules,
rules.
Like,

153
00:11:19.331 --> 00:11:21.730
you can sit here and write or you can sit here and do nothing,

154
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.430
but you can't sit here and do anything else.
That,

155
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.510
<v 2>that was always and still is when I go off.
Right.
That's my biggest role.</v>

156
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.700
Could you speak to that?
Yeah.
Because
um,

157
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.460
I would go down to my lovely little gazebo,

158
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:41.790
the bottom of the garden sit down and I'm absolutely allowed not to do anything.

159
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.250
I'm allowed to sit at my desk.
I'm allowed to stare out at the world.

160
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.760
I'm allowed to do anything.
I

161
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.270
as long as it isn't anything,
not allowed to do a crossword,

162
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.680
not allowed to read a book,

163
00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.760
a clamp to phone a friend out loud to,

164
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.160
you know,
make a claim model of something I,

165
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.650
all I'm allowed to do is absolutely nothing or right.

166
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.250
And what I love about that is I'm giving myself permission to write or not
write,

167
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.790
but writing is actually more interesting than doing nothing.
After a while,

168
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.081
you know,

169
00:12:27.081 --> 00:12:31.460
you sort of sit there and you've been staring out the window now for five

170
00:12:31.461 --> 00:12:35.810
minutes and it kind of loses its child going.
Well actually,

171
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:42.500
might as well write something.
And um,
and it's hard.

172
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:43.940
I'm,
as a writer,

173
00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:49.130
I'm more easily distractable.

174
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.310
Um,
I have a three year old son.

175
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.990
He is the epitome of cuteness and charm.

176
00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.620
He's more fun playing with him than it is writing,

177
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.600
which means if I'm going to be writing,

178
00:13:02.601 --> 00:13:07.601
I need to do it somewhere where I don't have a three year old son singing to me,

179
00:13:09.861 --> 00:13:14.810
asking me to read to him,
demanding my attention.
Um,
and I think that's it.

180
00:13:14.811 --> 00:13:19.190
I think it's a really just a solid rule for writers.
It's like,
yeah,

181
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.660
you don't have to write,
you have permission to not.
Right.

182
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.860
But you don't have permission to do anything else.

183
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.000
<v 1>That reminds me of another one of my favorite writers.</v>

184
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.710
You being the one who is sitting in front of me,
uh,
John McPhee,

185
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.840
nonfiction writer,
uh,
who has spent much of his life in Princeton,

186
00:13:42.841 --> 00:13:47.040
New Jersey,
but has written some incredible pilled surprise winning nonfiction.

187
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.030
And I was lucky enough to take class with him a thousand years ago.

188
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.240
And his,
his rule was very similarly.

189
00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:59.040
It didn't state it explicitly who would sit in front of his first as a young man

190
00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:03.660
typewriter and you could sit in front of the blank page and from 8:00 AM to 6:00

191
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.690
PM,
with the exception of a break for lunch and swimming,

192
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.130
it was the blank page or writing.
It's disallowed from doing anything else.

193
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:17.030
Are there any other rules or practices that you also hold sacred or important

194
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.303
for your writing?

195
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.520
<v 2>Ah,
some of them,
uh,</v>

196
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:29.060
just things for me for example,
um,

197
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.200
most of the time,
not always.

198
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:38.530
I will do my first draft in fountain pen,

199
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:45.620
um,
because I actually enjoy the process of writing with a fountain pen.

200
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.450
I like the,
um,
I like filling a fountain pen.

201
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.630
I uncapping it.
I like the weight a bit in my hand.
I like that thing.

202
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.870
So I'll have a notebook.
Um,

203
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:04.330
I'll have a fountain pen and I'll write if I'm doing anything wrong.

204
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.280
If I'm working on a novel,
for example,

205
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.970
I will always have to fountain pens on the go at least with two different

206
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:18.971
colored inks at least because that way I can see at a glance how much work I did

207
00:15:21.051 --> 00:15:24.950
that day.
I can just look down and go look it up.

208
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.570
Five pages in brown I that I wrote that half a page in black.

209
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:32.260
That was not a good day.
Um,

210
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.910
nine pages in blue come.
That was what a great day.
Um,
I,

211
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:41.900
I you can just sort of get a sense of,
okay,
are you,
are you working?

212
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.200
Are you making forward progress?
Um,

213
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.120
what's actually happening?

214
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:53.310
And I also love that because it emphasizes for me that nobody is ever meant to

215
00:15:54.981 --> 00:15:59.060
read your first draft.
Your first draft can go way off the rails.

216
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:04.570
Your first draft can absolutely go up in flames.

217
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.073
It can,

218
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:11.390
you can change the age,
gender,

219
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:16.340
number of a character.
You can bring somebody dead back to life.

220
00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:20.300
Nobody ever needs to know anything that happens in your first draft.

221
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.550
Is you
telling the story to yourself?

222
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.270
And then I'll sit down and tight and I'll put it onto a computer.
Um,

223
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.000
as far as I'm going to send the second draft is where I try and make it look

224
00:16:35.001 --> 00:16:36.620
like I knew what I was doing all along.

225
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:42.630
<v 1>Do you edit then as you're looking or translating from the first draft on the</v>

226
00:16:43.451 --> 00:16:45.610
page to the computer?

227
00:16:45.611 --> 00:16:50.580
Or do you get it all down as is in the computer and then edit?

228
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.080
<v 2>Oh No,
I definitely,
that's my editing process.</v>

229
00:16:53.081 --> 00:16:58.081
I figure that's my second draft is typing into the computer and also I love,

230
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.610
um,
so backing up a bit here,

231
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.700
um,
when I was,

232
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.380
what was I 27,

233
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.440
28 in the days when we were still in typewriters and there were just a handful

234
00:17:16.871 --> 00:17:20.770
of people with word processes,
which were clunky things with disks,

235
00:17:20.771 --> 00:17:24.850
which didn't hold very much and stuff.
I edited an anthology

236
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.890
and uh,
enjoyed editing minds,
don't you?

237
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.610
Most of the stories that came in were about 3000 words long

238
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.460
move forward in time,
not much,

239
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.620
five,
six,
seven years,
mid nineties.

240
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.370
Everybody is now on computer.

241
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.280
And I edited [inaudible] Short Story on felony and the stories that were coming

242
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:56.790
in tended to be somewhere between six and 9,000 words long

243
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:03.890
and they can't really have much more story than the 3000 words once.

244
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:08.460
And I realized that what was happening is it's a,

245
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:13.461
it's a sort of a computery thing is if you're typing,

246
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.500
putting stuff down his work,

247
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.870
if you've got a computer,
adding stuff is not work.

248
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.300
Choosing his work.

249
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.450
So it sort of expands a bit like a gas.

250
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:32.220
If you have two things you could say,
you say both of them,

251
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.610
if you have the stuff you want to add,
you add it.
And,

252
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.220
and I thought,
okay,

253
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:43.221
I have to not do that because otherwise my stuff is going to balloon and it will

254
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:47.190
become gaseous and thin.
Um,

255
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.980
so what I love,

256
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.880
if I've written something on a computer and I decide to lose a chunk,

257
00:18:55.891 --> 00:19:00.120
it feels like I've lost work.
If I delete a page and a half,

258
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.510
I feel like there's a page and a half.
It just went away.

259
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.230
And that that's a piece of the House with the work I've just lost.

260
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.670
If I'd been writing in a notebook and I'm typing it up and I can look at

261
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.820
something go,
I don't need this page and a half

262
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.620
and I believe it out.

263
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.650
I've just saved myself work and it feels kind of like I'm,

264
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.790
I'm treating myself.

265
00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:33.450
So I'm just trying to always have in my head the idea that maybe I'm somehow on

266
00:19:37.721 --> 00:19:42.720
some cosmic level paying somebody by the word in order to be allowed to write

267
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.200
that,
that if they're there,
they should matter,
they should mean something.

268
00:19:47.201 --> 00:19:48.550
And so it was important to me.

269
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.810
<v 1>And you mentioned,
uh,</v>

270
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:55.810
you mentioned distraction earlier and you're dangerously adorable son,

271
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:03.680
uh,
which,
which I certainly agree with.
Uh,
I had read somewhere,

272
00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.690
I actually,
before I get to that,
this,
this might seem like a very,

273
00:20:08.691 --> 00:20:12.920
very mundane question,
but what type of notebooks do you prefer?

274
00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:17.870
They large like legal pans.
Are they leather-bound what type of note?

275
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.270
<v 2>Um,
when they came out,
I really liked,
I,</v>

276
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.540
I've used a whole bunch of different ones.
I bought big drawing ones,

277
00:20:26.541 --> 00:20:29.300
which actually turned out to be a bit too big.
Oh,

278
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.040
I kind of liked how much I could see on the page.
Uh,
those were the ones I wrote,

279
00:20:34.041 --> 00:20:38.180
star dust and m and American gods in sort of,
you know,

280
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.720
big size,
but they weren't terribly portable.

281
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.560
I went over to the mole skins,
um,

282
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.850
and I loved them when they first came out and then they dropped their paper

283
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:56.851
quality and dropping paper quality doesn't matter unless you're writing and

284
00:20:58.511 --> 00:21:03.511
fountain pen because all of a sudden it's bleeding through and all of a sudden

285
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.240
you're writing on one page,

286
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.340
leaving a page blank because it's bled through and writing on the next page.
Um,

287
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.290
and Joe Hill,

288
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.550
about a six or seven years ago,

289
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.040
uh,
Joe Hill,
that the wonderful horror fantasy writer,

290
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.900
um,
suggested the loyal to them to me.

291
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:34.810
And,
um,
so my usual notebook right now,

292
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.720
it's a lawyer term because I really like the,

293
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:43.510
the way you can pension rate stuff in them and the thickness of the paper and

294
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:47.070
that just like sort of mole skins,
but the push of moles hair,

295
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:52.390
they're just better.
Um,
and I also have been writing,

296
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:57.420
I wrote the graveyard book and I'm writing the current novel in a,

297
00:21:58.121 --> 00:21:58.954
uh,

298
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.400
these beautiful books that I bought in a stationary shop in Venice,

299
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.720
um,
built into a bridge summer in Venice.
There's a,

300
00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:18.100
there's a little stationary shop on a bridge and they have these beautiful

301
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.180
leather bound blank books that just look like hard back books,

302
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:26.510
but they're blank paper pages.
And,
uh,

303
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.560
I wrote the graveyard book in one of those,

304
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:34.620
I bought four of them and now I'm using the next one on the next novel and it

305
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:41.800
may well go into another one.
Um,
I'm not sure.

306
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.830
And then at home in my home,

307
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.660
my house in Wisconsin,
which is where my stuff is,

308
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:58.070
you know,
I've,
I've got my,
we live in Woodstock,
um,

309
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.480
but I have an entire life's worth of stuff still sitting in my house and in

310
00:23:03.821 --> 00:23:06.760
Wisconsin and it,
it's become archives.

311
00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:12.210
It's essentially kind of fabulous having a house that is an archive.

312
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.510
Um,
but waiting for me in that house

313
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:24.060
is a book that I bought for myself about 25 years ago.

314
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.260
And before I die,
I plan to write a novel in it.

315
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:30.933
Um,

316
00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:36.780
and it's an accounts book from the mid 19th century.

317
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.420
It's 500 pages long.
Every page is numbered.

318
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.810
Um,
it's um,

319
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:52.540
lined with accounts lines but pretty faint so it'll be nice to write a book in

320
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:58.331
it and it is engineered so that every single page lies flat and it's huge and

321
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:05.000
it's heavy and it just looks like a book.
But you know,

322
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:10.060
Dickins or somebody would've written a novel him and I've just been waiting

323
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:13.130
until I have an idea.

324
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:18.590
Bit is huge and weird and Dickensian enough and whether or not actually get to

325
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:21.980
write it in dip pen,
I'm not sure,

326
00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:25.490
but I definitely want to write it in a sort of um,

327
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.880
old Victorian something slightly copper plating,

328
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:35.600
one of those old flex nib pens that they stopped making them carbon paper came

329
00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:37.040
in.
Um,

330
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:41.690
just so I can get that kind of spidery Victorian handwriting.

331
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:47.830
<v 1>I'm just imagining you putting pen to the first page when you finish the first</v>

332
00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:50.420
page and what that will feel like.
That's going to be a good day.

333
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.800
<v 2>It will,
it will be either a good day or an incredibly bad days.</v>

334
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:57.670
I'll get to the end of the first page.
It's,
oh no,
I have this pristine,
but it is,

335
00:24:57.671 --> 00:24:58.870
it is the,

336
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:04.270
the thing that I tell young writers and by young writers,

337
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.350
young writers can be any age.
You just have to be starting out.
Um,

338
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.730
which is anything you do can be fixed.

339
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.050
What you cannot fix is,
is the perfection of a blank page,

340
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:22.230
but you cannot fix is that pristine unsullied whiteness of a screen or a page

341
00:25:24.491 --> 00:25:26.980
with nothing on it because there's nothing that affects,

342
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:32.330
<v 1>you mentioned the word and it might be that I'm a little slow moving because I'm</v>

343
00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:36.490
from Long Island,
but lifetime.
How do you spell [inaudible]?

344
00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.420
<v 2>That one.
L,
e,</v>

345
00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:43.421
I s c h I think is tt t.

346
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.310
U.
R m

347
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.980
and then 1917,
I think is the,

348
00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:54.290
the uh,
their Twitter handle is definitely liked to him.

349
00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:55.124
1970.

350
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.290
<v 1>I'll put that in the show notes for folks so you'll be able to find it.</v>

351
00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.830
Since you gave me a,

352
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.770
and I'm not intending to turn this episode into a shopping list,

353
00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:09.270
but I've never used fountain pens.
Really.
I have not.
And My,

354
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.520
my uh,
assistant,
my dear assistant,
uh,
does,
she loves using found pence.

355
00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:15.660
She enjoys the act.
I've,
I've had,
uh,

356
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.650
a few sloppy false starts and then been rather impatient.

357
00:26:19.651 --> 00:26:21.930
But if I wanted to give it a shot,

358
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.080
are there any particular fountain pens or criteria that you would use and

359
00:26:27.091 --> 00:26:27.820
picking?

360
00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.260
<v 2>I'm good pen.
You know,</v>

361
00:26:29.261 --> 00:26:32.980
the biggest criteria I would use in picking,

362
00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:34.503
um,

363
00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:39.570
if you have the choice is go somewhere like New York's Fountain Pen Hospital.

364
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.680
Um,
is that a real place?
It's a real place.
It's called the Fountain Pen Hospital.

365
00:26:46.681 --> 00:26:50.140
They sell lots of new pens.
They recondition old pens.

366
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.830
They look after [inaudible],
um,

367
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.000
and try them out because the lovely thing about fountain pens is they are

368
00:26:57.001 --> 00:27:01.320
personal.
You,
you,
you can,
no,
no,
no.
And then you find the one,

369
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:02.573
um,

370
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:08.110
I tend to suggest to people who are,
uh,

371
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.380
just nervously,
you know,
I've never used a fountain pen.

372
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:17.540
What should I do?
And I will point them out.
Lemy Lam,
why?

373
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:18.600
Um,

374
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.600
who have some fabulous startup pen and they're not very expensive and they're

375
00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:28.080
good.
They do a pen called the law,
the safari,

376
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.270
but they have a bunch of good,

377
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:34.890
good startup pens and they're just nice to,

378
00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.090
to get into the idea of do I like doing this?
Um,

379
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:42.850
the,
um,

380
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.710
<v 0>okay,</v>

381
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.730
<v 2>let's see.
What am I using right now?
Um,
what am I going here?</v>

382
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:55.980
I've got heel.
So,
um,

383
00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:00.060
this one here is a pilot.
Um,

384
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.540
it's a Namiki and it's a flexing them ever so slightly.

385
00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:10.410
When you put down and weight on it,
the uh,

386
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:15.630
the nibble spread.
Um,
it's a beautiful,
beautiful pen.

387
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.070
Um,
though that one's a pilot.

388
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.610
I think this one here is the Namiki and it's really weird because Namiki is

389
00:28:23.611 --> 00:28:26.100
pilots.
I,
I don't quite understand that this is,

390
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.670
maybe it's a sort of Toyota Alexis thing,
I think it is.
It's that kind of thing.

391
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.660
Um,
and this one here is called a falcon.

392
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.280
And again,

393
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.720
you put a little bit of weight on it and the line we'll just spread and thicken,

394
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:42.030
which is part of the fun,
um,

395
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.460
of fountain pens.
Um,
and I will just,

396
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:52.700
you know,
I'll,
I'll go and play a,
there's a lovely Italian,
when I got my Aa,

397
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.700
my agent,

398
00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:00.410
I did a thing some years ago when I realized that I was losing a lot of actual

399
00:29:04.021 --> 00:29:08.550
writing time to signing foreign contracts.

400
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:14.400
And um,
this is for books,
this is for books or occasionally,
you know,

401
00:29:14.401 --> 00:29:18.330
for stories or things being reprinted around the world.

402
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.840
And the contracts would come in and there would be big sheaves of them because I

403
00:29:27.181 --> 00:29:31.530
get printed all around the world and foreign contracts,
a lot of them,

404
00:29:31.531 --> 00:29:34.470
you have to sign a lot and you have to do a lot of initialing and,

405
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.570
and I would sit in that going,

406
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:41.370
I am just spent 19 minutes signing a pile of contracts.

407
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.310
And I loved that.
I got to sign it.
But,
so I contacted my agent,
I said,

408
00:29:45.311 --> 00:29:48.010
can I give you like power of attorney?
Would you mind?
Just,

409
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.360
can you just sign these things for me?
And she's like,
absolutely great.

410
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:57.340
And so I got to,
she'd never used a fountain pen and I got her a fountain pen.

411
00:29:57.341 --> 00:29:58.770
I actually went to uh,

412
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:04.380
The New York Fountain Pen Hospital with her and did the thing of showing her

413
00:30:05.021 --> 00:30:08.350
pens,
you know,
what do you like can then,
and I got her a viscosity,

414
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.660
which is just these lovely Italian pens.
Um,

415
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.750
and mostly I love the sort of,

416
00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:24.751
the slightly fetishistic bit of having bottles of beautifully colored ink.

417
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:29.650
When you start talking to fountain pen people,
they,
they,
they really,

418
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.850
they pretend to be interested in what Penn you like,

419
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.180
but they don't care because they found their own pens that they love.

420
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.210
And they said,
what do you use?
And I,
you know,

421
00:30:40.211 --> 00:30:44.050
I use pilot eight to two threes for signing.

422
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.480
And I actually now I bought a pilot take two,
three.
Um,

423
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:53.590
cause it's just a fantastic signing pen.
It's a work course.
It keeps going.

424
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.650
And I got one in 2012

425
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.770
and it was my signing pen.
I signed through ocean at the end of the lane,

426
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.060
you know,
before the book had come out,
I'd already pre-signed,
you know,

427
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:12.360
written my signature 20,000 times with this pen and seen footage of you icing

428
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.440
your hand after signings.

429
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:19.240
That was the signing tool that I really got into icing my hand because,

430
00:31:19.241 --> 00:31:22.030
and wrist and arm.
Um,

431
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:27.190
and you know,
I did the numbers and as far as I can tell,

432
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:31.530
I have signed about one and a half million signatures with that pen,
uh,

433
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:36.940
which remained and I had to send it off to pilot at one point,

434
00:31:36.941 --> 00:31:39.790
not because the NIB was in trouble because the,

435
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:44.791
the plunger mechanism was starting to stick and they fixed it for me and sent it

436
00:31:44.801 --> 00:31:45.634
back.

437
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.880
And then my three year old son found a place behind a cast iron fireplace in our

438
00:31:54.911 --> 00:31:55.810
house in Woodstock.

439
00:31:55.990 --> 00:32:00.640
If you just insert your father's pilot three pen,

440
00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:05.230
which you have found on the table just to see if it would go in there,

441
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.480
you can actually guarantee that nobody without disassembling the house,

442
00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.830
we actually have to take the entire house apart.
Um,

443
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:19.890
do uninstaller a cast iron fireplace from 1913 to get at the pens I've gotten

444
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.980
that is that pen now has been given as a sacrifice in their house goods and I

445
00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:24.814
need to get a new,

446
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:31.720
<v 1>it strikes me at least it seems as we're talking that many of the decisions</v>

447
00:32:33.681 --> 00:32:38.150
you've made,
the tools you've found an enlisted,
uh,

448
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.133
act to

449
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:45.310
not writing unappealing or at least boring after five minutes and to in to sort

450
00:32:46.071 --> 00:32:50.330
of enhance the act of writing to make it something that is enjoyable.

451
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:51.210
I don't know.

452
00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:54.780
<v 2>That's true.
It is true.
But they also exist for another reason,</v>

453
00:32:54.781 --> 00:32:56.220
which is kind of weird,

454
00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:01.610
which is to try and trivialize what I'm doing and not make it important and

455
00:33:04.321 --> 00:33:07.770
freighted down with weight because that paralyzes me.

456
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.810
Um,
when I started writing,

457
00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:17.490
I had a typewriter.
It's a manual typewriter.

458
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.450
When I sold my first book,

459
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:27.150
I have the money to buy an electric typewriter.

460
00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:33.000
Um,
what was that first book?
Uh,
Gosh,

461
00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.960
I actually don't remember whether I bought the electric typewriter with the

462
00:33:36.961 --> 00:33:41.961
money from a book called ghastly be unbelief book of science fiction and fantasy

463
00:33:42.751 --> 00:33:47.520
quotations.
I did with Kim Newman or whether I did it,
whether it was,

464
00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:52.040
um,
for,
uh,

465
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.430
that Yuran Duran biography that I did,
either way,
I was just 23.

466
00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.590
And,
um,

467
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:03.780
and what I would do back then is I would do my rough draft on scrap paper,

468
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.790
single spaced so that it couldn't be used.
Um,

469
00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:13.230
and also so that I could get as many words on and,
you know,
paper was expensive.

470
00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:17.940
Um,
and then so,

471
00:34:17.941 --> 00:34:19.410
so I could always do that.

472
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.830
And I remember the joy of getting my first computer and just the idea that I

473
00:34:25.831 --> 00:34:27.900
wasn't making paper dirty,

474
00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.530
nothing mattered until I press print.

475
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:36.210
And that was absolutely Natalie liberating.
Um,

476
00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.600
and then,
you know,
a decade on

477
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.220
picking up a notebook,

478
00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.640
it was for star dust of which I decided that I wanted the rhythms of star dust

479
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.610
to be sort of very antiquated rhythms.
And I thought

480
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.970
there's probably a difference to the way that one writes with a fountain pen.

481
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:04.913
Um,

482
00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:13.560
17th century writing,
17th,
18th century writing,
um,

483
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:19.520
you notice tends to go in very,

484
00:35:19.561 --> 00:35:24.540
very long sentences and long paragraphs.
And I,

485
00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:30.020
my theory about this is that one reason why you get this is because you're using

486
00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:33.440
dip pens and if you pause,
they,

487
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.080
they dry up cause he just have to kind of keep going,

488
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.710
forces you to do a kind of writing where you're just,

489
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.160
you're gunning for a very long sentence and you're going to go over a long

490
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:48.150
paragraph and you're going to keep moving in this thing and you instead of

491
00:35:48.151 --> 00:35:52.260
thinking ahead,
um,
with,

492
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.020
if you're writing on a computer,

493
00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.520
you'll think of the sort of thing that you mean and write that down and then

494
00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:07.290
look at it and then fiddle with it and get it to be the thing that you mean.

495
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:10.830
If you're writing and fountain pen,
if you do that,

496
00:36:10.831 --> 00:36:14.520
you just wind up with a page covered with crossings out.

497
00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:19.430
So it's actually so much easier,
um,

498
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:25.410
to just sort of think a little bit more.
You,
you slow up a bit,

499
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.060
but you're thinking the sentence through to the end and then,

500
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:31.740
then you start writing,

501
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:36.520
you write that and then you pause and then you write the next one.
Um,

502
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:42.170
at least that was the way that I hypothesized I might be writing and I wanted,

503
00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:48.000
uh,
start us to feel like it had been written in the late 1920s.

504
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:53.930
Um,
and I thought,
well,
to do that I should probably get myself a,

505
00:36:53.931 --> 00:36:56.520
uh,
a fountain pen and a book come out.

506
00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:01.410
So that was how I started writing that.
And again,

507
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.770
what I loved was suddenly feeling liberated was like,
ah,

508
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.800
I'm not actually making words and not going down in [inaudible] on a computer

509
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:10.644
screen.

510
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.050
<v 1>This trivializing is,</v>

511
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:17.380
I think,
very,
very important.
Uh,

512
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:22.450
and I'd love to dig into it a little bit because this is something that's come

513
00:37:22.641 --> 00:37:26.410
up quite a bit initially,
very unexpectedly with,

514
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.360
with people I interview on the podcast and we're having conversation with Sean

515
00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.700
White,
you know,
legendary snowboarder.

516
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.750
And I asked him what he said to himself,

517
00:37:35.751 --> 00:37:40.751
what was his internal monologue or dialogue right before the gate opened for the

518
00:37:41.031 --> 00:37:45.920
last run in the Olympics for the gold medal.
And his answer was,
who cares?
Yeah.

519
00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.730
Which surprised me.
And he said,
yeah,
because if,
if in effect it,

520
00:37:49.731 --> 00:37:52.160
if I apply an incredible amount of weight to myself,

521
00:37:52.161 --> 00:37:55.610
it's going to do nothing but handicap me.
And you do see,

522
00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.730
or if there are many examples of,

523
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:03.760
of writers of musicians who have such crumbled with Sophomore Syndrome after a

524
00:38:04.311 --> 00:38:06.650
success and had great difficulty put it,
putting out work.

525
00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:08.700
You've put out a lot of very,
very good work.
I've,

526
00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.810
I've read and listened to and watched a lot of your work.

527
00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:17.630
What are other things you do to remove that weight,
if anything?

528
00:38:17.631 --> 00:38:20.540
Are there things you say to yourself when you commit to writing a book?
When you,

529
00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:25.700
when you sign the agreement with the publisher for yet another novel,
uh,
is,

530
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:28.880
is there any other advice that you would give or any other things that you do

531
00:38:28.881 --> 00:38:32.890
that helped to remove the sort of psychological,
uh,

532
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:34.550
performance anxiety?

533
00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.070
<v 2>Well,
you're,
me,</v>

534
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:40.900
you tend to do the things that are not actually,

535
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.543
um,

536
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:48.730
financially sensible but make life easier.

537
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.320
I write,

538
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:54.340
I like writing things that nobody's waiting for.

539
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.260
It's much more stressful writing things that people actually are waiting for

540
00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.920
that people care about.
Um,

541
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.050
it's why

542
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:11.550
it felt wonderful to follow American gods up with Caroline.

543
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.950
Nobody even knew that I wanted to be a kid.

544
00:39:14.951 --> 00:39:17.980
So author and it was an odd kind of thing to be.

545
00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:22.660
And I've just written this giant novel.
It's one,

546
00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:27.661
all of the awards and it's incredibly ADOT and it's thick and it's a proper

547
00:39:29.591 --> 00:39:32.440
book.
And look,
I got the Hugo and look,

548
00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.050
I've got the nebular and so on and so forth.
And then,

549
00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.190
um,
here's a book nobody's waiting for about,
did you work on,

550
00:39:42.191 --> 00:39:46.540
so you worked on that before.
Anyone knew?
In other words,

551
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:49.570
you hadn't set expectations.
Caroline was written.

552
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:54.550
I felt Caroline was unpublishable.
In fact,
I was told it was initially.
Um,

553
00:39:55.690 --> 00:40:00.520
and uh,
I,
I started it for my kids.

554
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.480
My daughter in particular,
Holly.
Um,

555
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.960
I showed it to an English editor who told me it was completely unpublishable.

556
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.710
Uh,
we moved to America.
Um,

557
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.810
the idea was that I was writing in my own time,
but I didn't have any own time.

558
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.370
Somewhere in there.
I sent it to my friend Jane Yolan,

559
00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:29.260
I mentioned to Jane,
who was amazing children's,
um,
author,

560
00:40:29.261 --> 00:40:34.261
but also at the time was editing a line of books and she showed it to,

561
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.430
she wanted to buy it.

562
00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:41.460
And the people upstairs at the publishing house said,

563
00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.600
absolutely not.
And,
and you know,

564
00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:47.950
this was just the first third of Carolina hadn't even got bad yet.
Um,

565
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.040
and,
uh,
and I put it away.
And then

566
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:59.440
a few years on I looked around and realized that I now had another daughter.

567
00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:04.440
I now had Maddie and she was a baby and she was getting bigger.

568
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.160
And if I didn't finish that book is this book I started for Holly and now

569
00:41:09.161 --> 00:41:12.790
Holly's two old almost,
and I needed to finish it.

570
00:41:12.791 --> 00:41:16.450
So I sent it to my new editor,
but I sent it to my ad out to editor.

571
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:21.480
I didn't have a children's editor,
um,
Jennifer Hershey at,

572
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:22.030
uh,

573
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:27.030
at trying to remember what we at Harper Collins at the time or was it still a

574
00:41:29.471 --> 00:41:32.020
Avon?
I think it was still a fun,
haven't yet been.

575
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:33.620
They even got bought by Harper Collins,

576
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:36.350
which is how I became a Harper Collins author.

577
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.570
And she read it and she called me up and she says,
this is great.

578
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.100
What happens next?
And I said,

579
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:48.101
send me a contract and we will both find out so and bless her.

580
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.083
She did.

581
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:55.270
And so I went back to writing it because now it was actually something that

582
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:57.710
actually had a delivery date attached.

583
00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:02.860
And I did not have the time to write it in.

584
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:04.940
It wasn't like I have more time.

585
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:10.450
And I remember what I did was I had a notebook by the side of my bed

586
00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:19.780
and instead of reading three or four pages a night and then turning off the

587
00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:21.680
light and going to sleep,

588
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:27.620
I would write maybe 50 words of Coraline,

589
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.090
which doesn't seem much right before bed right before bed.

590
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:36.020
So I wasn't right a reading before bed,
I was just writing before bed.

591
00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:40.280
But I go to bed and I would reread what I'd written on Carolina and I would do,

592
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.920
you know,
five or six lines of Coraline.
Um,

593
00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:51.170
but if you do it in that way,
you know,
you've written a page a week.

594
00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:56.180
And so it,
it,
it kept moving forward.

595
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:01.160
And then we went on a cruise,

596
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.490
a fundraising cruise for the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund,

597
00:43:04.491 --> 00:43:06.440
which is a first amendment thing.

598
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.760
And I was working on American gods and I did not pack due to a packing error,

599
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.100
be American gods notebooks,

600
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.950
but I did have the car line book with me.

601
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:27.910
So on that cruise I got to write quite a bit more Coraline.

602
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:33.340
And then a couple of months later I was done in a despair of ever finishing

603
00:43:34.731 --> 00:43:38.270
American gods because I've been writing it by that point for at least 18 months

604
00:43:38.271 --> 00:43:42.800
and figured that I had about a year to go and uh,

605
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:48.790
just said fuck it and wrote Coraline and just finished it and sent it off to my

606
00:43:51.171 --> 00:43:54.380
publisher.
And it's like,
here is a book,
you can publish this.
And they're like,

607
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:56.960
that's great,
but we'll,
we'll wait for American girls.

608
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:03.470
Do you tend to work on multiple projects at once?
Is that used to?

609
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:08.210
I used to be really good at working on multiple projects at once.
I think

610
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:13.660
I have to start,
um,

611
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:19.610
I think I have to start accepting that I'm not as good anymore at that.

612
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.390
Um,
what does that mean?

613
00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:29.330
It means that in the old days when I was young,

614
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:33.210
I would have at least three things on the go,

615
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:37.080
which was great because if I got stuck on any one of them,

616
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:42.450
I would do the other.
Um,
even when I was writing American gods,

617
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.510
I would always have the next of the sort of the coming to America short stories

618
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:50.070
in my head.
So if I got stuck on shadow,

619
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:54.180
I would just take a week and I do one of the coming to America stories and then

620
00:44:54.181 --> 00:44:55.740
I go back to shadow again.

621
00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.483
<v 3>But</v>

622
00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:04.100
<v 2>these days I don't think I'm as good at that anymore.</v>

623
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:07.460
I think I am.
Um,

624
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.470
I think it's great to have three or four things going on.

625
00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:13.040
But there is that point,
my stopped looking at myself and going,

626
00:45:13.041 --> 00:45:15.710
actually I'm getting less done.

627
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:20.450
I'm not doing that thing where I get stuck on project day.

628
00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:24.540
So I just immediately nip over to project B.

629
00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.900
It takes me a little ramping up time to get to the headspace.

630
00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.780
Now Project B and at the point where I have projects,
a,

631
00:45:32.781 --> 00:45:35.900
B,
c and d all waiting for me,

632
00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.480
what I do is look at them,

633
00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:42.710
make a noise like lurch from the Addams family.
You go on those

634
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.390
<v 3>Oh</v>

635
00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:49.540
<v 2>kind of noises like off and make a cup of tea and a plate with ash or something.</v>

636
00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:52.630
Um,
so I think actually I,

637
00:45:52.631 --> 00:45:56.560
it's one of those things where you just know thyself.

638
00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:01.180
I think I now have to start to going no,
just,
just one thing at a time,

639
00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:02.760
which also means I am,

640
00:46:02.761 --> 00:46:07.761
I'm going to have to say no to more introductions and things.

641
00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:13.250
Yeah.
Because,
and I love doing introductions.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

642
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.490
Engines.
You mean writing introduction,
writing introductions,

643
00:46:15.491 --> 00:46:17.650
writing introductions to other people's work,

644
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:22.570
writing introductions and essays and things.
Where you go,

645
00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:27.250
here is the thing I love.
I want to,
I can get it to the world.

646
00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:32.730
I can tell people why I love this thing and maybe they'll discover it.

647
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:35.080
And every now and then and you know,

648
00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.350
sometimes you know,

649
00:46:38.351 --> 00:46:42.460
your introduction makes no real difference in the scheme of things.

650
00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:47.650
Um,
and then sometimes,
uh,
you know,

651
00:46:47.651 --> 00:46:52.540
James Thurber,
um,
I was told I could bring,

652
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:53.320
you know,

653
00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:58.320
that they would bring them the 13 clocks back into print if I wrote an

654
00:46:58.391 --> 00:46:59.890
introduction to it.
So it was like,
yes,

655
00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:04.090
I'm writing an introduction to it and then because it has an introduction by me,

656
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:09.780
I've run into many hundreds of people who I assume are representatives of

657
00:47:10.871 --> 00:47:14.000
thousands of people,
um,
over the years who've said,

658
00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:18.310
I picked up that book because your name was on the cover.
And Oh my God,

659
00:47:18.311 --> 00:47:23.080
it's become my favorite book.
And I read it to my kids,
it's amazing.
And I go,

660
00:47:23.081 --> 00:47:25.660
good.
That's,
that's what it's for.
And that's why you do this.

661
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:30.010
You mentioned,
uh,
writing right before

662
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.290
<v 1>bed.
So I'd love to talk about the</v>

663
00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.620
be,
not the scheduling,
but the timing of writing.
So I was,

664
00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:42.621
was doing prep for this conversation and it came across an interview in which

665
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:45.730
you said that for,
for nonfiction,

666
00:47:45.731 --> 00:47:48.760
you can kind of write wherever it happens to fall off.

667
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:50.800
It's a script or something else,
but that for novels,

668
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:55.540
very often you tend to write between say one and 6:00 PM where you'll handle

669
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:59.910
email,
maybe writing a blog post and so on the morning.
And,
uh,

670
00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:05.560
I'd love to chat about that because,
uh,
many of the writers I've spoken to,

671
00:48:05.561 --> 00:48:07.960
and I'm sure it's,
it differs person to person,

672
00:48:07.961 --> 00:48:11.890
but tend to write either very late or very early because they feel like they

673
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:12.810
avoid distractions.
Yeah.

674
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.200
<v 2>When I started out,
um,
from,</v>

675
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.760
from the age of about 22 when I was a young journalist,

676
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.830
26,
27,
uh,
starting out comics writer,

677
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:35.320
um,
you know,
all through that I was a late,

678
00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.150
late,
late night writer.
Um,

679
00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:42.010
nothing really happened until the kids were in bed.

680
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:47.950
Nine o'clock,
I might have faffed around a little bit during the day,

681
00:48:47.951 --> 00:48:49.000
but now

682
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.400
it's all done and now I'm getting down to work and um,

683
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.053
uh,

684
00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:01.720
two or three o'clock in the morning and I'm writing in England at this point,

685
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:06.750
I may phone a friend in America just to talk enough to make sure that I'm awake.

686
00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:15.340
Um,
but so that's what I did.
And um,

687
00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:20.170
and I was a smoker and a coffee drinker and it was great.

688
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.010
I moved to America in 92.

689
00:49:24.011 --> 00:49:28.900
I gave up smoking s 93,

690
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:33.490
um,
stop drinking coffee when over the t,
um,

691
00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:37.590
and tried being a late night,
right.

692
00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:41.680
Try and carrying on being a late night writer and gradually realized that I

693
00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:42.760
wasn't really any more.

694
00:49:42.761 --> 00:49:47.200
What tended to happen was somewhere around one in the morning I'd be writing

695
00:49:47.201 --> 00:49:52.201
away and then I would lift my head from the keyboard at four o'clock in the

696
00:49:53.861 --> 00:49:58.861
morning and have 3000 pages of the letter m and it just go okay.

697
00:50:02.021 --> 00:50:04.480
That it doesn't really work anymore for me.

698
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:08.350
And then I started reshuffling.

699
00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:13.750
I'm trying different things out.
Part of

700
00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:16.800
what I discovered,

701
00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:22.400
particularly about being a novelist is writing a novel works best if you can do

702
00:50:24.571 --> 00:50:28.540
the same day over and over again.
Hmm.
Um,

703
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:34.280
the closer you can come to just groundhog day,
you just repeat that day.

704
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:40.100
You,
you've set up a day that works for yourself.
Um,
you know,

705
00:50:40.101 --> 00:50:40.934
I,
I,

706
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:46.610
the last novel that I actually wrote,

707
00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:47.923
um,

708
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:53.840
I was at Tori Amos is wonderful house in Florida.
She has this lovely,

709
00:50:53.841 --> 00:50:58.550
so to house on the water that she's lent me many times to go and write in.

710
00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:00.163
Um,

711
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:04.880
and I went down there and I would get up in the morning,

712
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:07.820
I would go for a jog,

713
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:13.370
come back,
um,
do my yoga,

714
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:18.650
uh,
get dressed.
Um,

715
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:20.510
and,

716
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:25.430
and getting the car drive down to a little cafe,

717
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:30.080
whether it were just enough people around that I knew that other people existed,

718
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:33.470
but nobody that I would ever be tempted to talk to.

719
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.870
And I would order myself a cup of Large Cup of green tea,

720
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:42.500
sit in the corner and just start writing.

721
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:48.160
And I would do that day over and over and over and over.

722
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:50.930
And you know,

723
00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:55.250
a couple of months later I looked up and I had the ocean at the end of the lane,

724
00:51:55.251 --> 00:51:59.030
which was only meant to,
I'm going a short story anyway.
It just kept going.

725
00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:04.310
Um,
and I,
I,
that I think works really,

726
00:52:04.311 --> 00:52:07.220
really well.
I also think that the,

727
00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:12.690
the most important thing for human beings is to be aware of the change.

728
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:19.460
You know,
the,
the biggest problem we run into is going,
this is who I am.

729
00:52:19.461 --> 00:52:22.340
This is what I'm like,
this is how I function.

730
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:27.500
While failing to notice that you don't do that anymore,

731
00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:32.740
I'm perfectly aware that I may one day become one of those people who wakes up

732
00:52:34.611 --> 00:52:39.440
early in the morning and goes and writes.
Um,
my friend Jean Wolfe,

733
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:40.670
who is

734
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:47.020
now in his late eighties and is one of,
um,
you know,

735
00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:50.740
the finest writers that America has.
Um,

736
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:54.860
for years was a,

737
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.720
an editor of a magazine about factories,

738
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.400
I think it was called plant engineering.

739
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:06.070
And so he'd get up at four o'clock in the morning and write for an hour

740
00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:12.410
before anything else before the day started,
before he had to leave.

741
00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:15.830
For Work and before anybody else was up.

742
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.430
And that was how he did it.
Um,

743
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:25.040
I cannot imagine getting up in the morning and just writing,

744
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:30.000
not how my head works.
I need a while to get here.
Um,

745
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.690
but I can absolutely imagine that one day I'll,

746
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:39.600
I'll have become one of those morning writers from having been a late night,

747
00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:44.520
right to in my youth and an afternoon writer and my,

748
00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:48.720
in my middle age in my dotage I could absolutely become,
I'm wanting right

749
00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.720
<v 1>in your dotage.
Uh,
I think that's going to take a while.
Uh,</v>

750
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:58.820
I do want to ask you a question related to a name that came up a little earlier

751
00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:02.090
and that is
this,

752
00:54:02.091 --> 00:54:05.390
of course I think I'm getting right because it comes from a reliable source,

753
00:54:05.391 --> 00:54:10.070
which is your blog and get a pretty reliable,
it's very reliable.

754
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:12.200
And,
uh,
for those,

755
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:16.100
those who know your work outside of the blog and it really encouraged to,

756
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:17.510
to read some of your work on the blog,

757
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:22.840
there's some really touching personal work,
uh,
one in particular about,
uh,

758
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.640
your gorgeous white dog whose name I'm currently,

759
00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:30.170
just such a beautiful piece,
uh,
that uh,
in fact,
um,

760
00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:34.460
I will you thanks for,
because it led to,
in part there are many factors,

761
00:54:34.461 --> 00:54:38.690
but to me getting my first dog as an adult Mali,

762
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:42.050
which I put off for decades.
So thank you for that.
But this question,

763
00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.730
beautiful piece is,
is related to Holly.

764
00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.770
And I'm going to use this as a very sneaky way to ask you a question that you'd

765
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:56.420
probably dislike being asked.
And it involves 57 year olds.

766
00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:02.380
So my understanding is you were convinced to speak to daughters class about

767
00:55:03.681 --> 00:55:08.330
where ideas come from and uh,
what I,

768
00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.390
what I noted here,
I'm not going to ask it that way,
but the,

769
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.600
the line that stuck out was you get ideas when you ask yourself simple
questions.

770
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.620
Well,
what if dot,
dot,
dot.
What if you woke up with wings?

771
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:22.880
If only if only real life was like it is in Hollywood musicals.
I wonder.

772
00:55:22.881 --> 00:55:26.260
Dot,
dot.
Dot.
If this goes on,
this is one I really liked.
You know,

773
00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:29.000
if this goes on telephones are going to start talking to each other and cut out

774
00:55:29.001 --> 00:55:33.390
the middleman.
Wouldn't it be interesting if dot,
dot,
dot.
Uh,
in,

775
00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:37.060
in the,
the question I'm going to ask as a follow up,

776
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:41.400
it doesn't have to map perfectly to this,
but,
uh,

777
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:45.470
I would love to hear the genesis story of the graveyard book.

778
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.380
And the reason I asked you about that book specifically is that it is my,

779
00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:52.610
my absolute favorite,
uh,

780
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:57.550
fiction audio book of all time and to this is,

781
00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:02.560
I remember the exact moment when I finished the graveyard book in audio.

782
00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:05.060
And there are multiple versions of people who ask me,

783
00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:09.470
I have not listened to the ensemble version and I'm sure it's spectacular,

784
00:56:09.471 --> 00:56:12.200
but not,
not to sound creepy.
I do find your voice very soothing.

785
00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.430
And I finished it as my plane was not my plan.

786
00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:21.550
Let me rephrase as a plane was landing and that a few minutes before we landed

787
00:56:22.101 --> 00:56:23.770
and I thought about the book.

788
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:28.030
<v 2>So it's,
it's,
it's had a,
a wonderful place in my heart and my mind.</v>

789
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:30.070
Where did that book come from?

790
00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:33.270
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

791
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.691
<v 2>it's actually,</v>

792
00:56:33.691 --> 00:56:38.691
I can give a slightly better answer to that now that I could have done a year

793
00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:44.400
ago or I have done for previous years because I found something accidentally,
uh,

794
00:56:44.401 --> 00:56:47.790
recently,
um,
which

795
00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:53.730
was,
uh,
which gave me an insight into stuff on it.
So

796
00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:01.640
I was 25 years old.

797
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:04.163
Um,

798
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:08.760
it would have been 1984 or 85,

799
00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:12.210
maybe even eight into 86.
Um,

800
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:19.530
I was living in Sussex and a little town and a very tall house.

801
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.530
Um,
my dad owned the house.
Uh,

802
00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:26.710
actually what he owned was a shop underneath,

803
00:57:26.711 --> 00:57:29.950
but the house sort of keen came with it.
Um,

804
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:34.390
because little old English towns go back for a long time.

805
00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:39.490
The house was at least 300 years old,
um,

806
00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:45.670
and it was across a little lane from a country graveyard and the house was

807
00:57:45.671 --> 00:57:47.830
incredibly tall,
an incredibly thin.

808
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:51.100
You get a couple of rooms and then you get stares.

809
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:56.080
And I had a son who at that point was two years old,

810
00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.240
um,

811
00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:02.350
and his favorite thing was his little tricycle.

812
00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:08.320
And the problem with little tricycles is you cannot ride them around houses like

813
00:58:08.321 --> 00:58:11.950
that.
Otherwise you die,
you get the stairs and you die.

814
00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:13.930
Um,

815
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:18.930
and so every day I would take him and his little tricycle over the road to this

816
00:58:20.441 --> 00:58:25.441
little church yard and he would peddle happily round and round the paths

817
00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:31.000
through the gravestones.

818
00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:36.070
And I remember just the,

819
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:40.660
the thought process,
I remember going,
he looks so happy.
Yeah,

820
00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:44.470
it looks really comfortable.
There was something very sweet about it.

821
00:58:44.471 --> 00:58:48.310
A little kid riding a tricycle through a graveyard

822
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.290
and I thought I could do a story about it.

823
00:58:52.291 --> 00:58:54.940
Wouldn't it be fun to do a story about that?
You could do a story like a,

824
00:58:54.941 --> 00:58:55.661
it will be like,

825
00:58:55.661 --> 00:59:00.310
can I have a kid in a graveyard getting brought up by dead people?

826
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:02.201
And then I thought,

827
00:59:02.201 --> 00:59:07.201
well actually Kipling already kind of did that once with the jungle book,

828
00:59:08.261 --> 00:59:12.430
which is a kid in a jungle being brought up by wild animals and teaching him the

829
00:59:12.431 --> 00:59:13.870
things that wild animals.
No.

830
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:19.200
So I wouldn't have to have a kid in the graveyard being taught the things that

831
00:59:19.391 --> 00:59:20.224
dead people.
Now

832
00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:27.660
I went up to my office,

833
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:31.230
my little office sat down at my typewriter

834
00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:37.020
and started to,
right now when I'm told people this in the past,

835
00:59:37.021 --> 00:59:42.021
I've said I wrote a couple of pages and realize that it wasn't good enough and I

836
00:59:42.901 --> 00:59:43.734
was wrong.

837
00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:48.980
I actually wrote an entire first chapter I discovered because about a year ago

838
00:59:52.471 --> 00:59:57.030
looking for something else,
I found it
and uh,

839
00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:58.500
wasn't pretty good.

840
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:05.480
What was fascinating and delightful about it was the port trait of the kid,

841
01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:13.560
which was very obviously a really actually looking back on it,

842
01:00:13.561 --> 01:00:16.710
quite good pen portrait of my son Mike,

843
01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.980
who is now a that you did that.

844
01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:24.630
I'm describing the baby and I only knew one.
So,
so it's,
it's Mike.

845
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:30.180
Um,
and that was really interesting.
But story doesn't work.

846
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:34.170
And I think,
I forget,
I think I've got a,
um,

847
01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:39.830
there's this,
there's a demon in it.
I don't have,
um,

848
01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:44.900
who I think is the person who winds up being the person who kind of accepts him

849
01:00:46.891 --> 01:00:51.240
into the grave yard.
Um,
you know,

850
01:00:51.241 --> 01:00:54.420
nothing's quite right,
but the,
there's a central idea there.

851
01:00:56.190 --> 01:01:00.120
But I wrote,
I remember writing that and just going,
okay,

852
01:01:00.121 --> 01:01:03.960
this is a better idea.
Um,
I am a writer.

853
01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.410
Hmm.
So I need to put this off.

854
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:10.650
I'm about,

855
01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:12.700
<v 0>yeah.</v>

856
01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:15.490
<v 2>A decade later I came back,</v>

857
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:20.170
tried it again,
and this time,

858
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:26.710
you know,
at least according to memory,
it was only a couple of pages.

859
01:01:26.711 --> 01:01:30.490
And again,
I went,
oh no,
still not good enough for this.

860
01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.530
May I pause for one second?
Yeah.

861
01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:38.250
You must have ideas for potential stories all the time.

862
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:42.940
Yeah.
But this was different.
This was one where I knew,

863
01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:49.110
I knew it had legs and I knew it was real and I knew it was good.

864
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:56.320
Um,
and in fact,
uh,
you know,
it was interesting,

865
01:01:56.321 --> 01:01:59.830
there was a point where I thought I wasn't going to do it,

866
01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:04.540
and I kind of gave the idea to Terry Pratchett.
We've been,

867
01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:08.490
we've had our photos taken in a graveyard and it would,

868
01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:12.280
we were talking about graveyards and kids,
and I said,
well,

869
01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.070
there's this book that I was going to write and this is what I was going to do

870
01:02:15.071 --> 01:02:19.150
in it.
And what is lovely is Terry didn't do any of that,

871
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:24.300
but he took,
he wrote a book called Johnny and the Dad,
which was

872
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:27.150
sort of taking some of this stuff,

873
01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:31.860
but it wasn't close enough that I couldn't then still do my story.

874
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:33.263
Um,

875
01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:37.690
but what was great is I knew that this was still important and I still wanted to

876
01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:42.810
tell the story.
And over the years I would just let it accumulate.

877
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:46.590
And finally,
um,

878
01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:49.740
in about 2003,

879
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:54.780
I finished writing,
I think it was an NC boys,

880
01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:00.000
which I also listened to an audio.
Ah,
Lenny Henry,
isn't it brilliant.

881
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:03.730
Ratable incredible.
Such a great read.
Um,

882
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:08.670
and I got to the end of Anansi boys and I thought,
you know,
I,

883
01:03:09.310 --> 01:03:11.040
I definitely,
I'm getting any better.

884
01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.920
I think this is now as a writer,
um,

885
01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.660
probably me,
it's probably it,

886
01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:23.790
I may improve even a tiny bit,
but it's not going to be the leaps and bounds.

887
01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:26.460
And I know that I was,
so,

888
01:03:26.461 --> 01:03:30.270
I have absolutely no excuse for putting off the graveyard book.

889
01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:35.010
But what I've started the other two times and it didn't work.

890
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.300
I started with chapter one.

891
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.760
I'm going to start right in the middle and I wrote the first two pages of,

892
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:49.950
um,
of,

893
01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:53.670
of the witches headstone chapter four,

894
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.580
and did emotionally exactly the same thing.
I always do.

895
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.590
I had always done at that point where the graveyard,
but we just got,

896
01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:06.480
it's just not good enough.
It's not good enough.
My daughter Maddie,

897
01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.120
because at this point we're on,

898
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:13.770
we're in the Cayman Islands on a small holiday.
Me,
Maddie,
and Holly.

899
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:18.690
Maddie comes out,
let's see,
one does over to me and says,
well,
what are you doing?

900
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.730
I said,
I'm writing a story.
She says,
read it to me.

901
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.740
So I read her the first page and a half that I'd written

902
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:28.800
and she said,
what happens next?

903
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.870
So I kept going and I think I would,

904
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:38.280
I would absolutely have been capable of giving up and failing at that point,

905
01:04:38.281 --> 01:04:41.460
except Maddie wanted to know what happened next.

906
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:46.520
So I kept drinking and by the end of that I'd written a story that felt like it

907
01:04:47.611 --> 01:04:51.810
worked.
I had the tone,
I had the voice,

908
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:56.400
I had Silas,
I had all of that stuff.
What is the range character,
by the way?

909
01:04:56.401 --> 01:04:57.750
So lovely Silas.

910
01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:02.220
And then I started at the beginning and I,

911
01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.110
and the the,

912
01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:10.220
the one thing that I have no idea where it came from because it was just sitting

913
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:14.040
in the notebook when I came to star.

914
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.600
It's like I'd written it at some point in the previous

915
01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:25.810
five years knowing that it would be,

916
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:31.300
you know,
knowing that I would have to stop at some point was just the line.

917
01:05:31.301 --> 01:05:33.610
There was a hand in the darkness,
net held a knife.

918
01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:38.700
And knowing that that was the first line of the story and feeling kind of,

919
01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:45.310
you know,
having very mixed feelings about that because going well on the whole,

920
01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:50.470
this story is going to be very loving.
It's going to be very tender,

921
01:05:50.471 --> 01:05:53.740
it's going to be about growth,
it's going to be about families,

922
01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.740
it's going to be about villages,
it's going to be about people.

923
01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:02.290
But the first few pages are going to be absolutely terrifying.

924
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:05.110
And that was the first line.

925
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:10.270
<v 1>Yeah,
I think you did.
You certainly delivered on the first few pages being very,</v>

926
01:06:10.271 --> 01:06:11.110
very terrifying.

927
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:16.480
I'm going to go back and listen to that again.

928
01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:18.520
Maybe I'll try ensemble this time around

929
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:22.800
<v 2>the ensemble is real.
I mean,
you know,
I,
um,</v>

930
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:27.960
I'm,
I'm not just saying this because for me,
you know,

931
01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:32.590
listening to one of my own audio books is a lot like back when you were young

932
01:06:32.591 --> 01:06:37.150
and we had answering machines and you would be listening to the messages people

933
01:06:37.151 --> 01:06:41.200
had left for you and then you'd suddenly hit your own voice and it's just like,

934
01:06:41.201 --> 01:06:46.060
no,
I don't sound like that.
Um,
but I,

935
01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.700
but it's Derek.
Jack Kirby,

936
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:53.080
who was one of England's greatest actors as the narrator,
you,

937
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:57.280
the cast of people like Miriam Margolyes,
[inaudible] Smith,

938
01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.400
just this fabulous gassed.
So

939
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.550
<v 1>you mentioned a name that I was planning on bringing you up anyway.</v>

940
01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:05.970
And that is Terry Pratchett.
Yeah.

941
01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:12.450
And I think many people who at least in the United States are less familiar with

942
01:07:13.361 --> 01:07:16.090
Terry then perhaps they should be.
Uh,

943
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:21.150
could you tell us who Terry is and how you first met

944
01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:26.410
<v 2>Terry Pratchett?
Um,
later,</v>

945
01:07:26.411 --> 01:07:31.411
Sir Terry Pratchett was an English writer who died in March,

946
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.360
2015.
Um,
he was a humorist,
a satirist,

947
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:44.390
best known for the Discworld novels set on a flat earth,

948
01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.910
which is on the back of four elephants on the back of an enormous turtle

949
01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:54.450
swimming through space.
And,
uh,

950
01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:59.130
he was my friend.
Um,
Terry and I met

951
01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:04.860
when his first book,
first Discworld book.

952
01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.790
The color of magic was due to come out in paperback.

953
01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.800
And,
uh,
we met for years and years.

954
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:18.780
We would tell everybody we met in a Chinese restaurant.
And,
uh,

955
01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:19.920
again,
a few years ago,

956
01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:24.921
I found my desk diary from 1985 and I thought,

957
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.920
ah,
there's Terry and me meeting in February,

958
01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:34.170
uh,
1985.
I wonder which,
um,

959
01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.550
Chinese restaurant,
it wasn't,

960
01:08:35.551 --> 01:08:39.510
it turned out we actually met on like the 28th of January and it was Berta

961
01:08:39.511 --> 01:08:43.680
rallies,
Italian restaurant in Gooch's street.

962
01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:45.660
I think it was cute street.
Um,

963
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:50.670
improving the memory is gloriously fallible.
Um,

964
01:08:51.150 --> 01:08:56.150
embarrassingly so since I'd actually filmed a piece to camera in a Chinese

965
01:08:56.581 --> 01:09:00.800
restaurant,
um,
about Terry's passing,
um,

966
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:04.980
but it's,
you know,
I was a young journalist,

967
01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:10.380
Terry at the time was working as the press officer for the,

968
01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:15.690
uh,
central electricity board in the UK.

969
01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.670
And,
um,

970
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:25.060
we hit it off in a way that it's just that sort of thing.

971
01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:30.650
We go,
oh,
you have the same kind of mind that I have.

972
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:36.200
Not exactly,
but the Venn diagram of overlap is,

973
01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:42.310
it was the point where we got onto the subject of green was of account books.

974
01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:45.723
Um,

975
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:51.790
and Terry mentioned that he had come up with one code,

976
01:09:52.341 --> 01:09:56.750
the net crow telecom,
nickel on the book of the telephone numbers of the dead.

977
01:09:57.470 --> 01:10:01.250
And I said,
that's really weird.

978
01:10:01.251 --> 01:10:03.200
I've just come up with one called the lever full.

979
01:10:03.201 --> 01:10:07.220
Virome Haggen are from the book of yellow colored pages.

980
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:08.900
And it's going,
oh,

981
01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:12.410
we have the same kind of head that goes to the same kind of places.

982
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:16.670
And we became friendlier,

983
01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:19.150
a friendlier,
after awhile,

984
01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:24.220
Terry would start sending me his books to read as he was writing them.

985
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:28.150
Um,
you know,
uh,

986
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:34.570
a floppy disk would arrive and it would have 30,000 words on it of a novel,

987
01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:41.210
or my phone would ring and Terry would say,
oh,
it's me.
So,
which is funny,

988
01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:46.820
and they just be writing and he wants somebody to talk to.
So

989
01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.230
I had written,
um,

990
01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:59.240
a book called don't panic,
the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy companion,
uh,

991
01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:02.830
which was great.
I got to work with Douglas Adams.

992
01:11:02.831 --> 01:11:07.831
I've got to rummage through Douglas's filing cabinets and obscurity stuff.

993
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:11.590
I'd written the whole book of,
uh,

994
01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:15.510
who was and what hitchhikers was.

995
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:20.870
And I realized by the end of it that I could write in that style classic English

996
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:25.890
humor with funny footnotes and things like that.
That was,

997
01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.060
it was something I could do.

998
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:31.470
And I had an idea for a book

999
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:36.780
inspired really by,
um,

1000
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:41.130
reading the Jew of Malta.
I've been reading,
uh,

1001
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.160
Malos the Jew of molter and there's just a line in it where these evil Jews mate

1002
01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.130
and they compare evil that they've done.
And I thought,

1003
01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:54.780
you know,

1004
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:59.780
you could do that scene with demons and it will be really nice if

1005
01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:05.490
you got demon number one who's done lots of evil.

1006
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:09.240
Demon number two has done lots of evil and evil demon number three.

1007
01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:12.480
He just hasn't really,
you know,

1008
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:15.900
and that was the start.

1009
01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:21.360
So I wrote and I had this idea about a baby swap,

1010
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:25.500
kind of like the omen,
but it all goes wrong and it becomes a nice kid.

1011
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:30.830
So I wrote 5,000 words of um,

1012
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:37.850
this thing and I sent it to a few friends to look at and then Sandman and books

1013
01:12:39.201 --> 01:12:42.030
and magic took over my life and my time and

1014
01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:44.730
didn't really think about it.

1015
01:12:44.731 --> 01:12:48.420
I knew that it was a thing and I knew I get to it one day and then I got a phone

1016
01:12:48.421 --> 01:12:53.010
call from Terry.
How much later was this?
Maybe eight months,

1017
01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.390
nine months.
And he said that that thing you sent me,

1018
01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:01.530
you doing anything with it?
And I said,
well,
no,
I'm doing Sandman.
I'm doing,

1019
01:13:01.531 --> 01:13:05.700
but it's magic.
And he said,
well,
I know what happens next.

1020
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:11.750
So either Salamay the idea and what you've written so far.

1021
01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:17.310
Oh,
we can write it together
now as far as I was concerned,

1022
01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:20.010
that was a lot like Michelangelo ringing you up and saying,
Hey,

1023
01:13:20.011 --> 01:13:23.670
do you want to paint a ceiling together this weekend?
You know,
young,
I,

1024
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:27.930
I loved Terry's craft.

1025
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:31.710
Terry became somewhere in the,

1026
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.650
before the arrival of JK Rowling,
the bestselling novelist in the UK,
I mean,

1027
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:40.350
tens of millions of copies,
millions upon millions of copies.
Um,

1028
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.940
this was before that,
this was,
you know,

1029
01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:49.290
he just retired from,
um,

1030
01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:53.430
the,
the electricity board to become a full time writer.

1031
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:58.800
I knew how good he was
and I'm like,

1032
01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:02.310
this is a fabulous apprenticeship.

1033
01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:05.730
So even though I didn't have the time,

1034
01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:11.640
I said yes and my life,
you know,
I back on it.

1035
01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:14.110
I'm just really glad that I was 27,

1036
01:14:14.111 --> 01:14:17.950
28 when I was doing this because I couldn't do it now.
I mean,

1037
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.260
just physically and mentally couldn't do it now.

1038
01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:25.120
But I would write Sandman until midnight.

1039
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:30.900
I would write the books of magic from midnight until about two 30 and I would

1040
01:14:32.441 --> 01:14:36.610
write good omens from two 30 until about 6:00 AM.

1041
01:14:36.611 --> 01:14:41.480
And then I would get up at one o'clock in the afternoon and my aunt swimming,

1042
01:14:41.481 --> 01:14:45.400
she answering machine would have a little blinking light on it and I would press

1043
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:50.401
the button and the tape would rewind and then Terry Pratchett's voice would come

1044
01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:56.380
out of it and he'd go,
get up,
get up,
you busted.
I've just written a good bit.

1045
01:14:57.490 --> 01:15:01.660
And,
you know,
that was a,

1046
01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.370
so that was,
that was the process of writing was very fast,
very mad.

1047
01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:11.770
Um,
I was the first draft,
second draft took us,
took us much longer.

1048
01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:17.230
Um,
but you know,
we,

1049
01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:21.430
we had good omens.
We have this wonderful,
incredibly collaborative book.

1050
01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:23.043
Um,

1051
01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:27.550
it was almost immediately bought by Hollywood and Terry and I went out and had

1052
01:15:27.551 --> 01:15:32.551
one of those hellish or for Hollywood experiences that you laugh at when other

1053
01:15:34.031 --> 01:15:37.480
people tell you in their store is about them because you're like,

1054
01:15:37.690 --> 01:15:40.390
I can't be that bad.
And it's like,
no,
it really is that bad.

1055
01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:45.250
It really was that bad.
Um,
and then

1056
01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:50.650
over the years,
Terry Gilliam and tried to make it into a film,
which we,

1057
01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:54.430
we loved the idea of,
uh,

1058
01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:59.760
then we were going to do it as a TV series and we couldn't really find somebody

1059
01:16:01.751 --> 01:16:05.200
to adapt it.
And eventually Terry,

1060
01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:11.730
Terry and I had a deal that we would never do anything individually on good

1061
01:16:13.241 --> 01:16:15.550
omens that had to be together or not at all.

1062
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:17.390
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1063
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:22.340
<v 2>And then one day he emailed me and uh,</v>

1064
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:24.920
he said,
look,
you have to do this.

1065
01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:26.550
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1066
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:31.550
<v 2>you have to do this because you're the only other person who has the same amount</v>

1067
01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:37.521
of love for an understanding of the old girl that I have and I want to see it

1068
01:16:38.071 --> 01:16:41.620
before the lights go out.
And then,

1069
01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:45.490
and I said,
okay.
And then Terry died,

1070
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:50.800
which meant that now had become this sort of last request.

1071
01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.230
And if the upcoming good omens series is good,

1072
01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.210
which I believe it is,

1073
01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:04.010
a lot of what makes it good.
A lot of what,

1074
01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.060
cause I was the show runner,
I wrote it and I show ran it.

1075
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:14.080
But I think what makes it good is I wasn't prepared to compromise on it.

1076
01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:21.650
And I am normally very prepared to compromise.

1077
01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:26.300
I'm encouraging when other people want to bring ideas to the table.
I'm like,

1078
01:17:26.301 --> 01:17:29.120
yeah,
go do something fun with this.
I've already done the book or whatever.

1079
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:34.870
But in this case I had a Terry Pratchett in the back of my head who I had to

1080
01:17:35.391 --> 01:17:39.800
please.
And,
you know,

1081
01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:41.510
the producers would say,
well,
Neil,

1082
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:45.650
I know you've written this sequence where agonist nutshell the,

1083
01:17:45.651 --> 01:17:49.910
which is taken out and burned and it's,
you know,

1084
01:17:49.911 --> 01:17:51.680
we have villages and we have,

1085
01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:57.220
it's the 1640s and you've got a Jon Bon fire and an explosion and all of this

1086
01:17:57.471 --> 01:17:58.970
kind of stuff.
And,
and,
um,

1087
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:04.720
we felt we could save a lot of money and do it just as well if we had woodcuts

1088
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:08.720
of what happened and the narrator telling the story.

1089
01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:12.590
And I would be like,
okay.

1090
01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.990
And then I would stop.
And I would think,
what would Terry think about that?

1091
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.633
I'm like,

1092
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:23.930
Terry would have nothing polite to say about any of these people.

1093
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:26.840
And it's like,
you know,
I'm sorry,

1094
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:31.700
we're going to have to do it the way I wrote it and the way it is in the book.

1095
01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:35.720
We're not doing it with woodcuts.
And,
um,

1096
01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.880
and it was like that all the way through and was like,
you know,

1097
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:45.910
just trying to hold the line and make this thing that Terry would have been

1098
01:18:46.011 --> 01:18:48.110
proud of,
um,
using,

1099
01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:53.240
using stuff that we came up with.

1100
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:57.500
Um,
in the book using stuff that we'd come up with,

1101
01:18:57.710 --> 01:18:59.600
talking after the book,

1102
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:04.240
stuff that we would have put into the next book if there ever had been one.
Um,

1103
01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.410
and just making it all,

1104
01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:11.430
all something that Terry would have been proud of.
Um,

1105
01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.160
and it's been really wonderful.

1106
01:19:15.570 --> 01:19:20.570
This south by southwest has been the first time anybody has seen anything from

1107
01:19:20.731 --> 01:19:23.700
good omens and we showed some clips.

1108
01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:28.530
Am hearing audiences laugh?
Um,

1109
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:33.600
what's kind of amazing?
I was like,
oh,
it does work.
It is.

1110
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:35.310
They're liking it.
They're loving it.

1111
01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:39.450
<v 1>It does work.
You should me only a very short clip,</v>

1112
01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:43.680
but I know the book and I'm familiar with it.

1113
01:19:43.681 --> 01:19:44.910
And with,

1114
01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:49.950
with the work you've done or any work or characters I deeply care about,

1115
01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:53.700
I collect comics from my entire childhood,

1116
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:58.170
still have probably 10,000 polybag comics that I refuse to get rid of.

1117
01:19:58.590 --> 01:20:03.480
And every time a comic book movie would be made in my younger years because they

1118
01:20:03.481 --> 01:20:05.550
were not done generally very well,

1119
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I would sort of peek through a crack in my fingers to see how characters would

1120
01:20:11.281 --> 01:20:12.270
turn out.
And it was,

1121
01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:16.350
it was always a very stressful for me because it's so much invested,
uh,

1122
01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:19.800
in many different characters.
And I'm just,
I'll give,
uh,

1123
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:23.670
a thank you to Hugh Jackman,
forgetting,
uh,
Logan and Wolverine.
Right.

1124
01:20:23.671 --> 01:20:26.790
Which was a huge relief.
And seeing this clip,
it,

1125
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:31.440
it really gave me the feeling that you had pulled it off,

1126
01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:33.030
that it,

1127
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:37.980
that it lived up to my experience as a reader and a listener.

1128
01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:41.300
<v 2>I think mostly we have,
um,</v>

1129
01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:45.700
and I think that is a lot of that is costing,

1130
01:20:46.410 --> 01:20:50.600
um,
Michael Sheen and David Tennant

1131
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:53.450
what perfect.

1132
01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.440
And they've never really been any and anything before.

1133
01:20:58.210 --> 01:20:59.043
Um,

1134
01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:04.060
because they go up for the same parts because they have very similar actors and

1135
01:21:05.301 --> 01:21:08.360
people were like,
why would you cost them?
Why don't you go,

1136
01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.300
it's like costume,
the same person you can.
Well,
yeah,
kind of is actually,

1137
01:21:14.301 --> 01:21:16.700
and it's one of the reasons why it works so well.

1138
01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:21.020
They have joked about,
and I'm not showing if they're joking about,

1139
01:21:21.021 --> 01:21:25.160
if ever I write a stage play version of good omens,

1140
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:29.740
they would go on tour with it.
An alternate roles each night.

1141
01:21:31.810 --> 01:21:35.490
<v 1>Brilliant idea.
Wow.
I want to,
uh,</v>

1142
01:21:36.190 --> 01:21:37.210
well first I should say,

1143
01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:40.450
and we'll put this certainly in the show notes and everywhere else and in the

1144
01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.930
people will have already heard in the introduction,
but where,

1145
01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:46.570
where can people learn more about good habits?

1146
01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:50.640
<v 2>Uh,
that's a really good question.
Well,
the,
you know,</v>

1147
01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:55.620
one thing that I would recommend you do is read the book,
um,

1148
01:21:56.250 --> 01:22:00.010
uh,
good omens,
the novel by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.

1149
01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:02.293
Uh,

1150
01:22:02.890 --> 01:22:07.740
and it won't spoil anything for you with the TV show.

1151
01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.760
There's enough stuff in there that I put in for people who knew the book.

1152
01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:19.200
I kind of,
there,
there are Easter eggs in the wet.

1153
01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:22.620
Only somebody who's read the book will know that something is funny or know why

1154
01:22:22.621 --> 01:22:23.520
something's happened.

1155
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.470
But there's also things that people who read the book will not be expecting.

1156
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:31.320
So that's,
that's the first thing.
Um,

1157
01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:37.880
youtube or any Amazon prime ads have the ad for good omens up the trailer.

1158
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:44.610
You can go and watch that.
Um,
it's a lot talk here than the trailer.

1159
01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:47.820
The trailer is,
is a lot of it is things going bang,

1160
01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:53.190
because that's what they like putting in trailers.
If it were me,
I would,

1161
01:22:53.191 --> 01:22:55.440
my trailer would have just been so to have like,
you know,

1162
01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.090
three minutes of two characters talking and it's like,
Hey,

1163
01:22:59.091 --> 01:23:03.330
you go here is the trailer if you like this,
you like the show.
Um,

1164
01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:07.390
but I think very wisely they put in,
you know,

1165
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:13.830
giant walls of Fire and heaven and Hell and hell hounds and,

1166
01:23:13.931 --> 01:23:15.700
and all of the Gloria stuff.

1167
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:21.000
<v 1>You mentioned a word,
uh,
apprenticeship.</v>

1168
01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:26.380
What are the types of things that you learned from Terry or picked up?

1169
01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:30.080
<v 2>The biggest thing,
looking back on it,</v>

1170
01:23:30.230 --> 01:23:35.230
that I learned from Terry was a willingness to go forward without knowing what

1171
01:23:38.961 --> 01:23:42.110
happens.
You might know what happens next,

1172
01:23:42.111 --> 01:23:45.740
but you don't know what happens after that.
But it's okay because

1173
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:48.343
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1174
01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:53.270
<v 2>you're a grownup and you will figure it out.</v>

1175
01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:58.130
Um,
there's lots of metaphors,

1176
01:23:59.050 --> 01:24:02.090
um,
for writing a novel.

1177
01:24:04.190 --> 01:24:07.670
And George Rr Martin,
for example,

1178
01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:12.140
divides writers into architects and gardeners.

1179
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:14.940
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1180
01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.960
<v 2>I can be an architect if I have to,</v>

1181
01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:23.340
but I'd rather be a Gardner.
I would rub up,

1182
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.890
plump the seeds,
water them,

1183
01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:32.090
and figure out what I'm growing as they grow and then prune it and trim it and

1184
01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:36.920
uh,
you know,
pleat Shit,
whatever I need to do,
um,

1185
01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:41.550
to make something beautiful that appears intentional.
But at the end of the day,

1186
01:24:41.551 --> 01:24:46.551
you have to allow for accidents and randomness and just what happens when things

1187
01:24:46.591 --> 01:24:47.424
grow.

1188
01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:48.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1189
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:49.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1190
01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:54.630
So the joy of good omens really.

1191
01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:55.211
I mean,

1192
01:24:55.211 --> 01:24:59.710
the best thing about good almonds was having Terry Pratchett as an audience

1193
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:04.920
because if I could make Terry laugh,
I knew,
you know,
that,

1194
01:25:04.921 --> 01:25:09.340
that it's like hitting that bell in,
in,

1195
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.340
you know,
hitting the thing in the circus with the hammer.

1196
01:25:12.370 --> 01:25:14.560
If you bring the bell at the top.

1197
01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:18.370
And that's what I did when I could make Terry laugh.

1198
01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:24.140
<v 1>He is no longer with us.
And uh,</v>

1199
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:29.570
I'd be curious to know how he faced mortality it because I,
I,
for instance,

1200
01:25:29.571 --> 01:25:31.070
have Alzheimer's on both sides of my family.

1201
01:25:31.071 --> 01:25:34.850
So I've had the opportunity to observe people with Alzheimer's,
which is,

1202
01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:38.000
it can be very,
very difficult.
How did he,

1203
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:41.240
how did he approach his or his own mortality?

1204
01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:46.270
<v 2>Terry made out of stone.
Dashingly powerful.
He,</v>

1205
01:25:46.271 --> 01:25:49.390
I mean,
he,
he faced it head on and he made,

1206
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:51.583
uh,

1207
01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:56.890
two or three incredibly powerful documentaries,

1208
01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:01.300
one about Alzheimer's.
Um,

1209
01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.090
the one that ripped me up emotionally,

1210
01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:06.973
um,

1211
01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:11.930
was the one about assisted suicide was the one about the right to die,

1212
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:18.400
which Terry became a very firm believer in and made his film as a,

1213
01:26:20.451 --> 01:26:24.320
as a piece of polemic about should you be,

1214
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:28.250
should you be allowed to turn off?
Should he be allowed to go kid,

1215
01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.870
this is the situation I'm in and I'm in this body.
I am done.

1216
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:35.300
And uh,

1217
01:26:36.690 --> 01:26:37.340
<v 0>okay.</v>

1218
01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:37.671
<v 2>You know,</v>

1219
01:26:37.671 --> 01:26:42.671
he followed a man to Switzerland where he,

1220
01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:48.230
he went through the end of life process and they turned off the camera as well.

1221
01:26:48.231 --> 01:26:53.120
He did.
Um,
and it was incredibly moving.

1222
01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:56.300
Terry,
the last time I saw him

1223
01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:01.520
confided in me pretty proudly

1224
01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:07.460
that he did have the,
the Death Cup tail

1225
01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.530
and,
uh,
that it was hidden away,

1226
01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.350
but then it was there for him when he was ready.

1227
01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:24.210
And I knew at that moment he was never going to take it

1228
01:27:25.770 --> 01:27:30.770
because Terry had a kind of rear brain Alzheimer's memory was basically okay,

1229
01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:35.100
but shapes weren't,

1230
01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:39.120
the physical world had fallen slightly apart on him.

1231
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:44.750
Um,
you know,
he couldn't see things.
He couldn't perceive objects.
He,

1232
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.580
he could still think straight.
But,

1233
01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:50.490
but all of your spacial recognition,

1234
01:27:50.491 --> 01:27:55.380
all of your object recognition and stuff was failing.
And I thought,

1235
01:27:55.410 --> 01:27:58.710
even if you've got this stuff,
you never,
you can't find it.

1236
01:27:59.010 --> 01:28:01.530
You can't get something from a hidden place.

1237
01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:06.000
Nobody else is going to get something from the hidden place for you.

1238
01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:11.070
I don't want.
So
I thought,

1239
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.150
and you've hit,

1240
01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:16.560
you're now actually beyond the point where you ever wanted to be.

1241
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.900
You can want to be here.
You wanted to have stopped

1242
01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:24.690
four or five months ago,

1243
01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:31.110
but now you're here and if you're here,
you're here to the end.

1244
01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.140
And indeed,

1245
01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:39.390
a few months later he fell into one consciousness and

1246
01:28:41.370 --> 01:28:44.700
a few months after that he stopped completely.

1247
01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:50.640
Um,
but it was inspiring.
It was inspiring.

1248
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.560
Watching Terry
talk about Alzheimer's,

1249
01:28:55.561 --> 01:28:56.640
bringing the Alzheimer's,

1250
01:28:56.641 --> 01:29:01.140
which everybody has to deal with one way or the other,

1251
01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:06.390
into the public consciousness as something that was okay to talk about,

1252
01:29:06.391 --> 01:29:09.480
not as something slightly shameful that happens to grandpa.

1253
01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:11.843
Um,

1254
01:29:14.530 --> 01:29:18.880
and also just talk about the right to die and talking about it as a,

1255
01:29:18.881 --> 01:29:22.000
as a human right.
And it

1256
01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:23.723
<v 0>okay.</v>

1257
01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.770
<v 2>You know,
I,
I really,
and I understand or you know,</v>

1258
01:29:29.771 --> 01:29:34.450
you can list out to me all of the reasons why it's a bad idea and look,
you know,

1259
01:29:34.451 --> 01:29:38.320
here's a creepy family and if they could kill mum for the money,

1260
01:29:38.321 --> 01:29:41.080
they wouldn't right now they've got her in a home,
but you know,
they,

1261
01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:45.510
they would have killed her and announced that she wanted to do it herself or,

1262
01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:49.240
or whatever.
I get all that,
but also

1263
01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.520
I get that,
um,

1264
01:29:56.130 --> 01:30:00.840
the right not to be alive,
the right to did all the right to go,
okay,
I've,

1265
01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:04.500
I've come as far as I can in this.
Um,

1266
01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:08.610
and it's okay to stop before,
before

1267
01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:15.700
I become something that is a shallow shadow of who I once was.

1268
01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:23.000
Um,
you know,
that that then has to be a right to,

1269
01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:25.350
<v 0>okay.</v>

1270
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:29.550
<v 2>How does it feel as,
as such a close friend of his to be able to,</v>

1271
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:35.990
to share this work that you created together and really,

1272
01:30:38.761 --> 01:30:40.680
really weird.
The,
the,
um,

1273
01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:45.590
mostly it's wonderful and then sometimes it isn't.
And,
um,

1274
01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:48.720
Saturday night

1275
01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:54.480
Amazon had taken over a,
you know,

1276
01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.740
19,000 square foot lot,

1277
01:30:59.310 --> 01:31:03.100
turned it into the garden of earthly delights.
Um,

1278
01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:08.010
it has a bookshop in a corner and the hairdressers and a giant tree in the

1279
01:31:08.011 --> 01:31:10.380
middle that serves alcohol,

1280
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.200
it has wings that if you stand in front of them and activate some kind of

1281
01:31:16.201 --> 01:31:21.000
Instagram filter,
um,
or maybe it was a snapchat filter,

1282
01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:25.420
will make the wings start to flap.
Um,

1283
01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:27.001
oh,
you know,

1284
01:31:27.001 --> 01:31:32.001
just filled with wonderfulness that I'm there and that we have singing nuns and

1285
01:31:32.731 --> 01:31:34.260
then a queen cover band.

1286
01:31:34.261 --> 01:31:39.090
Come on and I'm looking around and there's Jon Hamm and

1287
01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:45.540
David Tennant,
Michael Sheen and the,
Oh my,
my guys from my lovely,

1288
01:31:45.930 --> 01:31:50.010
um,
American gods cast come over and they're hanging out.

1289
01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:54.420
I'm getting to introduce,
it's like introducing it to families.
And,
um,

1290
01:31:56.980 --> 01:32:01.270
I was kind of melancholy because

1291
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:08.550
I knew that I should just be enjoying it.
I knew I should just be gone.

1292
01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:11.290
This is,
this is magical,
this is,
this is the kind of fun,

1293
01:32:11.291 --> 01:32:12.490
wonderful thing that you,

1294
01:32:13.210 --> 01:32:17.500
you don't get very often in your life and I should just be exulting in it.

1295
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:22.630
And instead,
I'm just thinking always Terry were here,

1296
01:32:23.050 --> 01:32:25.030
he would have loved the nuns.
He would've,

1297
01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:30.220
he would've had a great time with the queen cover band and he would have been

1298
01:32:31.810 --> 01:32:32.760
just,
you know,

1299
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:37.360
grumbling to me about tiny details and enjoying it.

1300
01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.570
Um,
or,

1301
01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:45.580
or taking enormous pleasure in tiny details and you know,
having,

1302
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:49.330
deciding which color wings he liked having best or whatever,

1303
01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:54.070
he would have loved it and he's not around.

1304
01:32:55.210 --> 01:32:57.460
And then by the same token,

1305
01:33:00.190 --> 01:33:05.190
I know Terry well enough to also know the,

1306
01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:10.420
the way that Terry was built and who Terry was,

1307
01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:14.800
we probably would never have got to this point had Terry been alive.

1308
01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:17.110
Because

1309
01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:23.020
if you're doing something like making a big TV show or something,

1310
01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:27.370
something this big and this complicated where things can go wrong.

1311
01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:35.040
Sometimes when things are getting weird or things are going wrong or you know

1312
01:33:37.811 --> 01:33:39.850
the BBC are going a bit mad or whatever,

1313
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:46.470
the only thing you can do is just focus on the outcome and just keep going and

1314
01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:51.880
keep steady course and so on and so forth.

1315
01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:57.180
And I knew Terry well enough and work with Terry Long enough to know that he was

1316
01:33:57.850 --> 01:34:00.250
absolutely constitutionally incapable of doing that.

1317
01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:03.370
Know at the point where things,
any,

1318
01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:08.371
any one of a dozen places where all we would have to have done is just keep on

1319
01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:14.470
going.
And you know,
Terry would have been making the,

1320
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:20.070
the phone calls to the head of the BBC or the head of Amazon or you know,

1321
01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.550
telling Jeff Bezos exactly what he thought of him,
what it was just like no,

1322
01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.480
that just the wrong thing to do right now.

1323
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:30.220
So there's also that sort of witness of going

1324
01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:35.260
had Terry Bunner and we probably would never have got here

1325
01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:40.990
and getting,
but getting here was all about making this thing for Terry,

1326
01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:46.580
which he also wasn't here for,
which is why I'm saying I,
you know,
so,
so at,

1327
01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:51.340
at giant interwoven panoply of,

1328
01:34:51.341 --> 01:34:53.740
of strange emotions,

1329
01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:58.800
absolute joy and having made it joy and having made it for Terry because,

1330
01:35:01.330 --> 01:35:02.163
um,

1331
01:35:02.690 --> 01:35:07.690
nothing else would have stopped me writing novels for three and a half,

1332
01:35:08.991 --> 01:35:11.180
four years.
Um,
but that did,

1333
01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:17.560
<v 1>I think I have to imagine he'd be thrilled to see you in this amazing circus,</v>

1334
01:35:18.210 --> 01:35:18.700
uh,

1335
01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:23.700
just before this piece of work is released to hopefully millions more people who

1336
01:35:24.731 --> 01:35:26.110
will be impacted by the work

1337
01:35:26.850 --> 01:35:29.250
<v 2>I think.
And I think he would have loved,</v>

1338
01:35:30.210 --> 01:35:33.570
I think he would have loved so much of this and also being Terry,

1339
01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:38.010
he would have loved the fact that then people will come and pick up good omens

1340
01:35:38.011 --> 01:35:41.700
the book and then they'll go and read Discworld books and that will make Terry

1341
01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.593
even happier.

1342
01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:48.680
<v 1>Neil,
this has been so much fun.
Cool.</v>

1343
01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:53.440
<v 2>19 minutes already.
90 minutes that just that that flu</v>

1344
01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:54.800
<v 1>it did.
It did.</v>

1345
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:58.790
And I certainly hope it's not the last time we have a chance to have to do it

1346
01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:03.500
again.
I'm just about to start.
I would really love to and uh,

1347
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:08.630
I know we have,
well let me not state it that way.
Many,

1348
01:36:08.631 --> 01:36:13.631
many of my fans are your fans and just as Terry shared his gifts with the world,

1349
01:36:14.061 --> 01:36:16.580
you continue to share yours and it has an impact.

1350
01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:20.300
It helped me through some very tough times.
I was able to transport me,

1351
01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:23.180
delight me,
shock me,
scare me,

1352
01:36:23.181 --> 01:36:26.300
and take me through a whole range of emotions I didn't at the time,

1353
01:36:26.301 --> 01:36:27.410
even though I had access to.

1354
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:32.470
So I want to thank you for making good art and sharing it with the world.

1355
01:36:33.321 --> 01:36:37.670
You've done a great job.
You are so ridiculously welcome.
Thank you.

1356
01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.220
And do you have any

1357
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:46.250
closing comments,
thoughts,
remarks,
anything you'd like to say before we wrap up?

1358
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:49.540
<v 2>No,
not really.
I,
I'm,
you know,</v>

1359
01:36:49.541 --> 01:36:53.170
I genuinely enjoy,
enjoyed.

1360
01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:58.580
One of the great things about having you as a fan is the books arrive from you

1361
01:37:00.490 --> 01:37:04.300
and they actually get read.
Um,
I'm,
you know,

1362
01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:09.980
and I learned from them because you go off and explore parts of things that I'm

1363
01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:13.190
never going to.

1364
01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:18.130
And so I appreciate that too.
Enormously.

1365
01:37:18.330 --> 01:37:21.780
<v 1>Thank you so much.
And for everybody listening,</v>

1366
01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.790
we will include links to everything we've discussed,
including Fountain pens,

1367
01:37:26.850 --> 01:37:31.110
including Fountain Pants.
It's might be the time to buy some stock

1368
01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:35.280
and everything that came up.

1369
01:37:35.281 --> 01:37:39.360
We'll be in the show notes as always at tim.blog/podcast.

1370
01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:44.720
You can just search Neil or gay men and it will pop right up and to Neil.

1371
01:37:45.331 --> 01:37:48.150
Once again,
thank you so much.
I really,
really appreciate it.

1372
01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:51.990
And to everyone listening,
until next time,

1373
01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:56.760
read widely and check out good omens and chat soon.

1374
01:37:56.970 --> 01:37:57.270
Bye.
