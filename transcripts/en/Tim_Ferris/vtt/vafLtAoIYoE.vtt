00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.850
I used them to create book cover prototypes for the four hour body,

9
00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:40.190
which went on to becoming number one New York Times bestseller.

Tim,

18
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.140
this episode is brought to you by headspace.

19
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.350
More than 80% of the people I've interviewed,

20
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.360
world class performers across the military,
entertainment,
sports,

21
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.380
and beyond all have some type of meditative practice.

22
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.560
I tried for years and years and failed miserably.

23
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.580
The key is making it simple and you can dramatically improve your life in just

24
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:36.470
10 minutes a day and technology can help you.

25
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.940
This change comes through guided meditation and headspace is by far the most

26
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:45.290
popular app for this purpose.
More than 4 million users.

27
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.910
It's meditation made simple,

28
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.390
so what I recommend is that you take this practice meditation,

29
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:52.250
which is rooted in thousands of years of tradition,

30
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:57.251
supported by thousands of scientific studies and try it for 10 minutes a day for

31
00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:00.530
10 days.
That's all you need to do.

32
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:04.310

Hello Ladies and germs.

41
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:36.710
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

42
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:41.300
my dog is yawning and it is my job to deconstruct world class performers of

43
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:46.301
various types from military to entertainment to academia to sports chess,

44
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.040
everything in between and tease out the routines,
habits,
favorite books,

45
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.240
etc that you can use.

46
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.300
And this episode we have Luis von Ahn on Louis phone on von a h n who is an

47
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:03.820
entrepreneur and computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University.

48
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.940
He is known for inventing captures and we'll get into that.

49
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.410
Being a MacArthur fellow,

50
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:12.370
which is often nickname the genius grant and selling two companies to Google in

51
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:16.600
his twenties Luis has been named one of the 10 most brilliant scientists by

52
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:20.650
popular science magazine,
one of the 50 best brains in science by discover,

53
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.420
one of the top young innovators under 35 by the MIT technology review and one of

54
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:29.530
the 100 most innovative people in business by Fast Company magazine.

55
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.640
He has many things,
many interests that to keep him busy,

56
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.350
but the primary is Duolingo.

57
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.070
Luis is currently the cofounder and CEO of Duolingo,

58
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:41.950
a language learning platform created to bring free language learning to the

59
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:45.550
world.
They have more than 100 million users,
including yours truly,

60
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.750
and that makes it the most popular way to learn languages in the world than it

61
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:53.800
is the most downloaded app in the education category on both iTunes where it has

62
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:58.170
a five star average and more than 3,300 reviews and Google play.

63
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.400
I first met Luis as an early investor in Duolingo.
I tracked them down,

64
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.870
which was very hard.

65
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:08.920
I tracked Louise and his cofounder Severin down after you guys.

66
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:11.290
My fans actually told me I had to see it.

67
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.180
It was in Beta at the time and via Twitter and Facebook you guys informed me.

68
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:18.250
I reached out to them.
That's how that came together.

69
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:21.820
And every time I meet Louis I learned something new and certainly I hope you

70
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:22.654
will learn a lot.

71
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.200
In this episode we talk about his favorite books and resources you'd recommend

72
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:28.210
to entrepreneurs,
language learning tips,

73
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.900
the very clever way he caught cheating students at Carnegie Mellon,

74
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:35.080
which is a great story.
Early mentors and key lessons learned,

75
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.760
the story of building and selling companies like recapture how to recruit and

76
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.350
vet technical talent.
Uh,
the most surprising sources of users for Duolingo.

77
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.600
And it goes on and on.
So we talk about quite a lot.

78
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.530

81
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.580
Welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me,
Tim.

82
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.550
And I thought we could start where a lot of people start in the morning,

83
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:14.580
which is breakfast.
You mentioned this briefly when we were doing a sound check.

84
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.860
What did you have for breakfast this morning?

85
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.200
I had a Greek yogurt and you,
you added some contexts.

86
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.620
Is that that you've had the same thing for breakfast for the last year,

87
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.690
possibly two or three years.

88
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:31.290
It's the identical Greek Yogurt is the [inaudible] Greek yogurt to the one they

89
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.680
have to combine the fruit,
but the spoon never fits in there.

90
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.250
That's the one.
And do you,

91
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.900
do you have meals that you repeat for lunch and dinner?

92
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:43.860
I mean are you,
do you,

93
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.570
have you standardized your daily routine in other ways besides breakfast?
Not,

94
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:53.200
not that well,
I have a breakfast is pretty standardized.
My,
my,
my,

95
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:57.210
my lunch is pretty different.
Everyday we got free lunch,
a,
a Duolingo.

96
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.210
<v 2>I it just,
I eat that.</v>

97
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.170
<v 1>Got It.
Does standardize the word makes me think of testing.</v>

98
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.660
And when I think of testing,

99
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.690
I actually got pinged by a former student of yours and the students said,

100
00:06:12.241 --> 00:06:16.290
ask him to explain how he catched he,
how he catched.
Boy,
here we go.

101
00:06:16.291 --> 00:06:19.330
I need to study English here,
Kim.

102
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.450
Or was it you kept yeah,
catch no,
I said this unfortunately,
uh,

103
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.880
caught cheaters in your,

104
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.230
one of your classes at Carnegie Mellon and I was hoping maybe you could explain

105
00:06:31.231 --> 00:06:32.064
how that went.

106
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.780
<v 2>Yeah,
I did the,
I did quite a bit.
Um,
so I,
I used to teach this class.</v>

107
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.520
I'm on leave,
I'm a professor,
but I'm on leave.
Um,

108
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.840
I used to teach this class called great theoretical ideas in computer science,

109
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.010
which is,
um,
kind of the,

110
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:50.910
the hardest class most people have ever taken in their lives.
Um,

111
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.800
and it's,
it's basically discreet math and,
and,
and it's pretty hard now.

112
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.570
A lot of people use to cheat.
It's a large class.
It's about 200 kids.

113
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.730
A lot of people used to cheat and in different ways.
On a,
I started becoming,

114
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.190
I started becoming really obsessed with catching people cheating.
I,
it was,

115
00:07:11.191 --> 00:07:15.330
it was,
I didn't even do anything bad to them after I caught them cheating.

116
00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:19.860
It was more like a fun game for me.
Right.
Um,
so for example,

117
00:07:19.861 --> 00:07:22.680
one of the things they couldn't do is some of the assignments I said,

118
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.640
it is against the class policy to Google.
Um,
um,

119
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.340
now you can think what you want about that policy.

120
00:07:29.341 --> 00:07:32.040
I don't think it's that great of a policy,
but that's a policy that I inherited.

121
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.700
But that class has always basically said he cannot Google for assignments,

122
00:07:35.701 --> 00:07:39.990
solutions.
Uh,
so one of the things I did was,
um,
I,

123
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.080
uh,
I would,
uh,
you know,
sometimes I would assign,
um,

124
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.640
homework and I would actually seed the answers to some of the things in websites

125
00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:53.010
that were crawled by Google,
but that I owned,
uh,

126
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.910
and I could tell people's Ip addresses and everything.

127
00:07:56.911 --> 00:07:58.500
I would catch people cheating that way.

128
00:07:58.501 --> 00:08:02.220
I basically set up honey box for people to cheat and,
and you know,

129
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.560
you could say that's entrapment,
but that's,
that's what I did.

130
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.710
<v 1>Do you recall any examples off hand?</v>

131
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.820
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean,
I,
well of the exact websites,</v>

132
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.710
I don't know where they are or the terms.
I mean,
yeah,
I mean,
one of them was,

133
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.660
um,
there was,
there was one that was called,
ah,
gear on McChrystal's puzzle.

134
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.710
It's,
it's made up,
but I,
I made that word up beforehand.
I made sure there was no,

135
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.540
no such thing on Google.

136
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.040
And I made a website that had the right solution,

137
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.360
but it recorded everybody's Ip address.
And at Cmu you can figure out,
you know,

138
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.540
their dorm from their IP address so I can figure it out,
which,

139
00:08:39.541 --> 00:08:43.380
which person was actually checking.
It turns out that time of the 200 students,

140
00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:48.120
about 40 Google for the answer.
Um,
and that was fun.
Uh,

141
00:08:48.121 --> 00:08:51.300
I used to do all kinds of things like that.
And then the students were pretty,
um,

142
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.900
there were,
there were all usually scared of,

143
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.690
of almost everything being a trick.
Ah,
so I,

144
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.440
I would do that in the first one or two assignments and then afterwards they

145
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:03.870
would,
they would learn not to,
not to cheat.

146
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.920
<v 1>So,
so the,
the story,
the progression I've heard is that you would,
uh,</v>

147
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.340
you would bring up slides silently,
did you do this?

148
00:09:13.341 --> 00:09:16.640
Or it was like a screenshot of whatever it is,

149
00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:21.170
the glory [inaudible] problem or whatever circled then a screenshot of the your,

150
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.650
your,

151
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.670
the who is for the domain site or the domain that people would go to with your

152
00:09:25.671 --> 00:09:27.010
name circled since you own it.

153
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.000
<v 2>Yup.
Yup.
That's when you could see the whole class.
You could,</v>

154
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.810
you could see their faces change.
It was,
it was pretty fun.

155
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:41.010
<v 1>No,
but you didn't have to actually hunt down each identity,
right?</v>

156
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:45.860
I mean,
did you offer them a choice?
I mean,
tell me if this is true.
So the,
the,

157
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.270
the story,
the lore is that you,

158
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:53.271
would you offered them the option of confessing and take a zero for the

159
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:58.870
homework?
Otherwise they would get reported or head or is it not?
Is it all,

160
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.490
have you,
who have you been talking to?

161
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.720
<v 2>That was the case that that was exactly the case because it took a little bit of</v>

162
00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:10.290
effort to go and figure out who was who.
Uh,
so I would just,
I would say if you,

163
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:14.120
if you just confess you got a zero on the assignment on and all kinds of people

164
00:10:14.121 --> 00:10:16.850
confess.
I even had some people confess it didn't even actually do anything.

165
00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:19.760
They just say,
well,
you know,
I don't know what the hell I was doing,

166
00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:21.170
so I'm just going to throw my name in there.

167
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:22.670
I'd rather take a zero on the assignment

168
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.370
<v 1>if we rewind the clock.
So that's as a professor,
when did you become,</v>

169
00:10:31.371 --> 00:10:34.760
at what age did you become a professor at Carnegie Mellon?

170
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.730
<v 2>Um,
it was probably 25.</v>

171
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.420
<v 1>25.
Yeah.</v>

172
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.840
And was it clear that you are going to be involved with computer science from a

173
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:46.860
very young age?

174
00:10:46.861 --> 00:10:49.350
Could you describe for people where you grew up a little bit about your

175
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:50.150
childhood?

176
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.700
<v 2>Yeah,
sure.
I grew up in Guatemala,
uh,
which is by the way,
it's,</v>

177
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.140
that's not where they keep the prisoners.
That's Guantanamo.

178
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.080
Do you get that a lot?
I get that a lot.
It's like,

179
00:11:00.081 --> 00:11:02.720
is that way they keep the prisoners that no,
it's not.
Uh,

180
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.830
it's also not where they in Brendan invented the avocado sauce of the Guacamole,

181
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:11.570
uh,
different.
Um,
so the,
uh,
yeah,

182
00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:16.340
I grew up in Guatemala.
Uh,
I started liking computers at about age eight.

183
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.360
My mom,

184
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.200
I really wanted a Nintendo because everybody wanted to intend though our or my

185
00:11:21.201 --> 00:11:23.420
friends all had an intense dose on.
And I told my mom,

186
00:11:23.421 --> 00:11:28.140
but my mom had gotten me a commodore 64.
[inaudible] 64.
Yeah,

187
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.390
a lot of spy hunter on color.
60 feet.
Yes.
I played a lot of games there.
Uh,

188
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.630
but at first when I first got here,
I was pretty pissed off because I thought,

189
00:11:35.631 --> 00:11:40.250
man,
I want an endo.
Um,
but instead she got me that and she said,
well,

190
00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:42.900
you figure that out.
Uh,
and so I,
uh,

191
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:46.460
I had to figure out how to use the computer to play games.
Um,

192
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.650
and then I started trying to figure out,
you know,

193
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.530
because you only would buy me a couple of games a year and I would get of them.

194
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.070
I started trying to figure out how to get more and more games and you know,

195
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:00.670
the best way to do that was basically the copy them from other people.
Uh,

196
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.440
so I started doing that at a young age.
Um,
I don't,

197
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.090
I think the statute of limitations has passed by now,

198
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:11.320
but I was basically pirating games that an enlarge scale in Guatemala city is

199
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:12.310
basically what I was doing.

200
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.070
<v 1>And what did you,
what did you learn in those early days of copying games that,</v>

201
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.570
that helped you later?

202
00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:23.571
Or give you an indication that you had a proclivity for using computers and

203
00:12:23.761 --> 00:12:24.594
computer science?

204
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.060
<v 2>I was pretty good at,
I mean,
I,
you know,</v>

205
00:12:27.061 --> 00:12:30.120
most of these things had some sort of copy protection.
Uh,

206
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.690
usually it was like hidden files or something that if you just knew how to list

207
00:12:33.691 --> 00:12:38.160
the directory,
uh,
with,
by,
by showing the hidden files,
you could see them.
Uh,

208
00:12:38.161 --> 00:12:39.390
so it was,
it was not that hard.
