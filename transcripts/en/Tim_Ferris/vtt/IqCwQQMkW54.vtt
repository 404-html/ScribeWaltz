Optimal at this altitude,

00:00:02.861 --> 00:00:06.100
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

Anything else would
like to be,

<v 1>This episode is brought to you by movement watches and that is spelled M v m t</v>

6
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.880
movement watches.

7
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.680
I first became aware of this company back in 2014 when there are brand,

8
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:36.514
brand new,

9
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.600
maybe company because they won first place in Shopify as build a business

10
00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:41.434
competition.

11
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.730
The founders are two college dropouts who wanted to wear fancy watches but had

12
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.410
one wee little problem.

13
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:51.170
They couldn't afford fancy watches so they decided to scratch their own itch.

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.910
Since then,
they're high quality.

15
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:56.630
Affordable watches have gone from startup to more than 1 million watches sold

16
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.940
across 160 countries.

17
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:02.150
It's an awesome success story and when you check out the product,

18
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:03.860
you'll know why they offer classic design,

19
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.280
quality construction and many different modern styles.

20
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:11.990
So you can really pick one that suits you.
You might want to start one.

21
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:16.400
I would suggest probably appeal to a lot of folks out there is the classic black

22
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.190
silver,
so search classic black silver.

23
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.090

This podcast is brought to you by Mizzen and main.

30
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.370
Many of you long time listeners know how I feel about Mizzen and main.

31
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.700
They make the most comfortable dress shirts in the world.

32
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.640
Quite possibly they use advanced performance fabrics,

33
00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:00.230
which provides stretch and comfort,

34
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.370
but that's not the real selling point to me.
That's all great.

35
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.360
It's all really good,
but they are the only dress shirts so to speak,

36
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:12.830
that I travel with because you don't have to iron them no more steaming,

37
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.100
no more headache.
I can just bunch them up and throw them in a bag,

38
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:19.010
pull them out and no one will be the wiser.

39
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.510
They're fancy enough for important dinners,
but made from athletics,

40
00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:25.430
sweat wicking material.
So they're all purpose.

41
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.710
And hundreds of pro athletes love these shirts,
including NFL,
all pro JJ watt.

42
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.580
And last time these guys were on the show.
They sold out of every item.

43
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.390
They feature every single skew.
So if you're interested in getting a shirt,

44
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.510
you might want to check them out on the faster side.

Hello boys and girls.
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode,

49
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.310
the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers of

50
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:06.940
all different types,
whether they come from the worlds of business,
chess,

51
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.230
military,
sports,
you name it.
In this case poker.

52
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.290
This episode of the podcast features Phil Hellmuth at Phil underscore,

To each have polka world series of poker bracelets than any other person in

56
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:30.940
history.
I'm not drunk.
I'm high on life.

57
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.950
This interview comes from my television show,

58
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:37.951
fearless fear and in parenthesis less because the objective is to learn to fear

59
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.221
less,

60
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:43.480
not be fearless in which I interviewed world class performers on stage about how

61
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:47.560
they've overcome doubt,
conquered fear,
and made their toughest decisions.

62
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:51.100

67
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.090
We recorded about three hours of material when Phil and I sat down and only one

68
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:17.320
hour was used for the TV show.

69
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.350
That means this podcast is almost entirely new content that did not appear in

70
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:25.330
the television episode.
In this conversation,

71
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:28.000
we explore many things including Phil's morning routine,

72
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.670
the importance of goals and blessings,

73
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.910
how he became the youngest person to win the world series of poker,

74
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.410
his prep for the high stakes games in which he plays what it takes to compete at

75
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:43.060
the highest level and much,
much more.
Also,
since we recorded the show,

76
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:47.890
Phil published his autobiography,
Poker Brat,
well titled,
you can check that out.

77
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.720
So with all of that said,

78
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.510
please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with Phil Hellmuth and let's get

79
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:57.120
started,
right?
Meow,
enjoy.

80
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.360
I'm your host,
Tim Ferris.

81
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.290
And on this stage will be deconstructing world class performers of all types to

82
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:11.800
uncover and distill the specific tactics they've used to overcome doubt,

83
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.820
tackle their hardest decisions,
and ultimately succeed on their own terms.

84
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.960
So let's do a show of hands.

85
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.360
How many people here think they can tell when someone is lying?

86
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.590
50% now,
how many of you think you can lie and not get caught?

87
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.790
30 how many of you who raised your hands?

88
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:34.210
It'd be willing to bet your entire life savings on being able to do that?

89
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.280
All right.
It's six or seven.
Well,
for the last 30 years.

90
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.740
My guest tonight has made his living reading behavior,

91
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.380
analyzing the odds and gambling for his future.

92
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.270
In 1989 he became the youngest main event champion at the world series of poker

93
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.100
and he holds the world record for most of it.
Winds at 14 and he's still going.

94
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.120
Please welcome author,
entrepreneur and professional player,
Phil Hellmuth.

95
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.520
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

96
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.750
<v 2>I can always tell it,</v>

97
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.680
I have a lot of friends who watch poker and I'm an avid sand but not a competent

98
00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:12.400
player.

99
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.240
So we're not going to be at the same table anytime and less than a spectator.
Uh,

100
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.170
but I can always tell when you're on because of the beeping it's in.

101
00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:24.520
Draws me into the room.
The good news is this isn't really a family programming,

102
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:28.630
so no beliefs,
uh,
in this conversation if the,
if it all comes out.

103
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.370
I want to talk a little bit about the scrappy.

104
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:35.380
You're trying to encourage me to swear.
You know,
this is my,
I'm from Long Island.

105
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.850
It might come out on my part.
I do drop f bombs if I get wound up.
So,

106
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.810
<v 3>uh,</v>

107
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.780
yeah I guess that's light nudge but swearing swearing's part of the lexicon now

108
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:48.380
and things have changed so much,
you know,
um,
you know,

109
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:51.950
and so I do probably swear more than I should even want them on the microphone

110
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:54.440
doing events,
you know,
and someone will be like,

111
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.050
there's always one or two people of the couple of hundred at the event,

112
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:59.930
they're offended.
They usually don't say anything.
That's pretty good.

113
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.620
I mean that's pretty,
pretty good percentage.
I mean that's when

114
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.840
like I have a goal sheet on my mirror and I have a blessing sheet on my mirror.

115
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.360
So at the morning when I'm brushing my teeth and not paying attention,

116
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:17.960
I see what my lifetime goals are,
what are my goals for that year.

117
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.030
And then I also see my blessings.

118
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.470
So I leave hopefully happy cause I've seen the blessings and focus cause I know

119
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:27.520
what my goals are.
So for me that's,
you know,
somebody

120
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.350
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

121
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.540
<v 3>so let me just wrap this up cause this kind of fun.
So the other day,</v>

122
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.960
<v 2>all the time in the world</v>

123
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.760
<v 3>is at Starbucks three or four months ago.</v>

124
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.240
And someone came up to me and I was really tired.

125
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:49.140
It was a Sunday morning and I had slept well and someone came up to me that

126
00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:50.880
doesn't know me that well or whatever,

127
00:07:50.881 --> 00:07:55.470
but I'm polite and I smiled and I shook his hand or whatever and just wanted to

128
00:07:55.471 --> 00:07:56.760
get my coffee and get out of there.

129
00:07:56.761 --> 00:08:01.200
And then his wife pops up and she's just glowing and she's like,

130
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.340
Phil,
I got to tell you,
I was at your speech.

131
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:11.030
I put my goals up on my mirror and I accomplish them with within two months.

132
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.820
And she was glowing.
And I thought,
wow,

133
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:19.380
I had a profound influence on her life and it just made me feel,

134
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.280
I gave me,
I know as a professional poker player at the top of the game,

135
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.330
I do things no one else does in the game.
And I know that I'm motivated.

136
00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:31.170
I've known,
I've known this since maybe 2002,
um,

137
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.110
where,
where someone came up to me and they said,
Phil,
I was in a coma and I,

138
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.050
and I woke up,
cause I imagine playing you heads up at poker.

139
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.960
And this guy sat down in the audience when I was playing heads up for a world

140
00:08:45.961 --> 00:08:48.360
championship and my wife said,

141
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.180
he sat down and you want 11 hands in a row.
And she said,

142
00:08:54.181 --> 00:08:57.960
there's something weird.
And so from that moment on,

143
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.920
way back in 2002,
I realized that I'm motivating,
you know,

144
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:06.570
that I'm inspirational to people,
not the stuff that you see on television,

145
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.050
although that's kind of fun to watch me beeping and whatever.

146
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.420
But me performing at the top of what I do,
you know,

147
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:16.254
I mean,

148
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.030
you watch some great athletes do things no other great athletes can do.

149
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.870
I liked watching tiger woods in his prime.
I like watching Michael Jordan.

150
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:30.090
Now I'm not as big as those guys,
but in my industry I,

151
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:32.010
it's kind of fun to see,
wow,

152
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.810
how did Phil know that to fold this or move in with this?
And so,
yeah,

153
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:40.080
I think,
I think when your,
uh,

154
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.620
when I'm achieving the most I can achieve and I'm playing poker like no one else

155
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:50.400
has ever seen,
I think that that can be inspirational for,

156
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.590
you know,
millions of people that watch it.
So we,

157
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.390
in that period when you were struggling,

158
00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:02.391
did you have any particular coping mechanisms or strategies that you use,

159
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:06.000
things to occupy your time that helped you get through that?

160
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.290
Absolutely big coping mechanism for me.
And this applied itself in poker too,

161
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.770
because when you're young in poker,
you're usually reckless.

162
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.270
So I told you I won the main event,
$750,000 for first,
right?

163
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.690
This is 1989 men.
So,
you know,

164
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.470
and I'd been taking way too many chances.
And uh,

165
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.630
and so at that point from there,
yes,
I was smart.

166
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:35.580
I bought a penthouse condominium,
you know,
and paid cash for it.
Yes.

167
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:37.470
I put aside money for taxes,

168
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.750
but the other $300,000 I lost.
So yeah,
I ended up with,

169
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:47.160
and I mean we have bought a couple cars,
so beautiful cars,
penthouse condominium,

170
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.490
but I'm struggling to pay $800 a month.
Condo fees.
Yeah,

171
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:52.950
it's like a year later,

172
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.750
and so the coping mechanism there is rather than,

173
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.160
it's not that I'm avoiding the present,
it's that you're like,

174
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.940
this is a moment where there's a lot of rain.
So number one,

175
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:09.210
I'm going to develop strategies for the next time I have money.

176
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.240
My money management system has to be really solid and I have to actually apply

177
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:18.390
it and use it.
That's number one.
Number two,
I would,

178
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.500
I would look forward and I'd say,
all right,
what does it look like in two years?

179
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.660
It looks amazing in two years,

180
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.130
and so in the depths of dealing with some of the worst times,

181
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:35.750
I would take advantage of that down period of that being trodden down to be more

182
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:40.710
focused.
All right,
how did this happen?
How can I play poker better?

183
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:42.040
How can I meant money management,

184
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.500
money management is more important than playing poker or poker players.
Just,

185
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.370
Oh yeah,
we can ask me about that later.
But that's very interesting topic.

186
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.160
But to go with it,
you know,
so that that was,
those are the,

187
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:58.140
those are the kinds of the things I would use.
Vince Vaughn,

188
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.950
I was talking about this last night,
you know,
he,
he taught me,

189
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.970
he taught me something that I hadn't thought about much.

190
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.690
When someone's looking at a flop,
they usually haven't hit it.

191
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:09.070
They're trying to figure out do I have anything,

192
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.310
the flop meaning when the dealer,
when the first three cards come out,
yes.

193
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.890
But you have to pay attention to all of that.
Tells a story we have.

194
00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:20.020
And then when the next card they'll look at it for a long time to try to figure

195
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:21.280
out what to make of their hand.

196
00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:26.281
Whereas if they look at it quickly then either have nothing or we were talking

197
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:29.200
about potentially a strong position.
That was a great observation.

198
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:31.930
And his part made me realize how smart he is.

199
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.680
Increased my respect factor for him cause he,

200
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.060
cause he got it and pointed out something that I hadn't been paying attention to

201
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:44.830
recently.
But everything adds up.
It's a picture,

202
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.970
you know,
and,
and how much are they betting and,
and when the next card comes off,

203
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:50.830
now there's four in the middle.
How much are they betting?

204
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.350
And when the fifth card comes up,
how much are they betting?

205
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.270
Are they hesitating because they think I have to bluff all in here and I have to

206
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:01.150
man up to do it.
And then when they bluffed it,

207
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:04.270
they put it in the right away or do they wait?
You know,

208
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.950
and then people try to use things to throw you off so you have to decipher the

209
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:09.820
whole picture.

210
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.960
So I trust my instincts and when I'm on I look,

211
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.490
I look great.
Yeah.
But I'm just not on every day.
So,
you know,

212
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.650
we filmed so much poker.
Yeah.

213
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.900
There's days where I'm off and then a million of the kids watch it and they say,

214
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:29.680
fill sucks at poker.
Phil.
Sucks at poker.
Phil sucks at poker.
I hear that.

215
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.550
I've heard that so often in my life.
Um,
that I'm not good at poker.

216
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.210
It's crazy to me.
It's because they watch my worst moments.

217
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.470
And I think I wonder if I watched this guy who was criticizing me for watched

218
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:46.380
all of his worst moments,
you know,
the blooper reel for somebody else,
Bro.

219
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.270
Deep.
And so you were talking about when you're at your best,

220
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.370
and by the way that can get to me people,
you know,
I mean,

221
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.290
people were telling me I wasn't good at poker.

222
00:13:56.291 --> 00:14:00.640
Coming into the game had passed me by coming into 2010.

223
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:06.130
Um,
uh,
I sucked at poker,
you know,
uh,
uh,

224
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.100
you know,
uh,
because I hadn't done anything in a couple of years and I mean,

225
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.920
Internet forms filled with how bad I was at poker because I'm a big target and

226
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:18.620
because I hadn't done anything lately.
And that's fair criticism.
Yeah.

227
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.810
And then all of a sudden,
2011 came and I had,
you know,

228
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:25.360
three second place finishes and everybody's like,
wow.

229
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.220
And in 2012 came and I won two bracelets and everybody's like,
oh my God.

230
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.810
But I swear I'll never forget this 2011,

231
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:36.723
um,

232
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.600
they were talking about how I was like I'd fallen out of the top 500 poker,

233
00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:46.450
how I sucked at the game.
Exactly.

234
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:51.370
Three weeks later I had to second place finishes and they were talking about how

235
00:14:51.371 --> 00:14:52.220
it's the greatest

236
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.370
<v 2>and that was just like,
all right,
what changed?</v>

237
00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.690
I mean I was given some advice early on when I was,

238
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.870
when I was writing because I was getting really thrown for a loop with

239
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.611
criticisms.

240
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:08.030
I remember the first time I got a negative Amazon review the very first time you

241
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.480
out and,
and I wrote this really logic,

242
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.440
a logical,
compassionate reply this like long,

243
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:18.600
I spent hours on this thing and the carpet.
I was like,
yeah,
go fuck yourself.

244
00:15:18.601 --> 00:15:23.410
And I was like,
ah,
the humanity,
why won't you listen Internet?
And uh,

245
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.770
somebody said to me,

246
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.700
you're never as bad as they say you are and you're never as good as they say you

247
00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:32.420
are either.
And I was like,
all right,
let's put,
did you then stop reading reviews?

248
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.800
I stopped reading most of them on Amazon and Youtube in a few places where it's

249
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:40.060
like always devolves to like Hitler after like two pages.

250
00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:44.420
Like how did we get to Hitler?
Like it's a kitten video,
but the uh,

251
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.410
what I wanted to ask you before I get too far away,
so you just kind of gave up.

252
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:52.980
Like I stopped looking at poker forums,
I thousand one.
Yeah,

253
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.150
I just stopped looking.
Yeah.
Well I think it's like you don't,
you,
it's,
there's,

254
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.960
there's how to deal with something and then there's choosing not to like

255
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:01.610
strategically choosing not to deal with it.

256
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.360
So sometimes it's easier to not go where it's slippery if you don't want to
slip.

257
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:10.250
Right.
So it's just like with temptation with a quality problem,

258
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:10.851
but like beautiful,

259
00:16:10.851 --> 00:16:14.540
smart women kind of swarming around when you're in Vegas or something like that.

260
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:15.560
Similarly,
it's like,
well,

261
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:20.590
I don't want to have to waste the energy to manage my response to something that

262
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:24.320
isn't going to be productive anyway because the good stuff is just going to make

263
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:28.490
my head inflate and the bad stuff isn't going to be probably even accurate or

264
00:16:28.491 --> 00:16:29.540
it's gonna make me feel terrible.
It's like,

265
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:32.390
what's the outcome that I'm looking for?
But what I wanted to ask you,

266
00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:36.470
because we all my whole life to stay with that a second life has been,
you know,

267
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.650
I would get too inflated by the good stuff.
My ego gets all pumped up.
Yeah.

268
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.760
Now you get to devastated by the bad stuff.
You know what I mean?
And,

269
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.470
and I look back and I was very defensive in a lot of the videos that you may or

270
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:49.101
may not show,

271
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:53.090
but a lot of these videos of super defensive until 2011 2012 and I'm like,

272
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.750
wait a minute,
I'm the all time champion.
I have all the records.

273
00:16:56.751 --> 00:16:58.010
Why am I so defensive?

274
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.850
And I think that's part of that defensiveness that that's part of maybe ties in.

275
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:05.210
I want to be,

276
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:11.480
I want to be great and I want everybody to think I'm great at Games,

277
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.480
specifically poker.
And uh,
and I think that might may drive me.
Um,

278
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:21.410
I'm trying to get away from being defensive.
It's tough.

279
00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:24.770
I'm pretty defensive too.
I mean,
I remember I read a tweet today and I was like,

280
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.060
what?
Oh,
Twitter,
Twitter,
I'm,

281
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.110
or Stephen Fry opted out of well known comedian actor of being on Twitter.

282
00:17:33.111 --> 00:17:35.570
And he said,
it's like too many people have peed in the pool.
He's like,

283
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:38.870
I'm out of here.
They're going to break from Pitt.
From Twitter.
Yeah.
Grass.

284
00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:43.650
But useful metaphor.
Anyway,
I want to talk about,
uh,

285
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.980
one of the times,
maybe you weren't at your best.
You've lost all this money.

286
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.010
Just to go back to where we

287
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.690
<v 3>were in your timeline,</v>

288
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.920
and I'd read about you setting and number of goals maybe in a taxi cab.

289
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.070
Am I making this up?
Uh,
there were a few goals.

290
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:04.200
One was world series of poker,
I believe.
Uh,

291
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.070
if this is fiction,
let me know.
Second was uptight.
I've got it.

292
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.990
I've got it from here.
Yeah.
So,
so,
I mean,
this,

293
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:17.970
this was probably,
I was 21,
I guess,
maybe 22,
something like that.

294
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.260
And,
um,

295
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.570
and I had this kind of like one of these weird touchpoints where something

296
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.610
amazing happens to me.
Weird,
right?
So I'm playing poker and Madison,
Wisconsin,

297
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.900
I wake up and it's foggy and it's,
you know,

298
00:18:33.901 --> 00:18:37.260
and there's snow on the ground and I'm like,
you know,

299
00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:41.640
and I'm looking at a two and $4 limit game,
but I have $20,000.

300
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.560
You go to the game,
you might make 200 bucks,
right?
Yeah.
So,
but why do I,
what's,

301
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:47.730
what am I doing?
You know?

302
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:50.400
And so I go over there and I'm bored and I don't want to,

303
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.570
and there's no golf course is open and I can't find anything kind of fun to do.

304
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.260
And so two of the guys from the game,
I say,
Hey,

305
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:00.180
let's go have a drink.

306
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.290
So I've never been a big drug guy,
but I smoked pot.

307
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.670
And then we go to the bar and I'm having a drink and they're playing pool for 10

308
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:13.460
or $20 a game.
And it's like one in the afternoon.
Yeah.

309
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:14.310
And I've,

310
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:18.690
and I'm having a drink and I've smoked pot and I'm suddenly like in there

311
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:22.740
arguing about $20 at the pool table.
And I'm like,

312
00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:27.090
what the fuck am I doing with my life?
You know?

313
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.950
And I'm like,
I gotta get Outta here.
Yeah.
So I go and I,
and I'll never forget,

314
00:19:31.951 --> 00:19:36.780
I opened this door,
right?
And Boom,

315
00:19:36.781 --> 00:19:41.580
like the sun is out now and it's bouncing off the snow and it's just like,

316
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.700
it's like a metaphor for what happened at that moment was the reality of what

317
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:51.090
happened at that moment.
I opened the door and I saw all the light,
right?
Just,

318
00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:53.520
and it's coming at me and it's bouncing off everything.

319
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:57.420
And I've been in some dingy bar and I'm just like,
wow,
what is this?

320
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.490
And I call for a taxi.

321
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.480
I would never drive when I'm doing something silly like that,

322
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:08.700
I get back to my apartment and I'm like,
what are you doing with your life?

323
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.110
And the first thing I do,

324
00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:13.590
I have all this positive momentum and all this energy and I'm like,

325
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:17.460
this is my lifetime goals.
I'm going to win the main event,

326
00:20:17.461 --> 00:20:19.710
the world series of poker.
If Andre Poker player,

327
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:21.240
I'm going to be the best in the world.

328
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.100
I'm going to meet and marry an amazing woman.
I'm going to buy a beautiful house.

329
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.700
I'm going to buy a beautiful car and maybe one or two.

330
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:33.660
So I'm going to write a New York Times bestselling book,
right?
So I said,

331
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.730
these are my lifetime goals,
like six of them,

332
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:41.190
and then add all this positive momentum and all this energy.
And I'm like,

333
00:20:41.191 --> 00:20:45.480
wow,
I in order to get there,
how am I going to do it?
Well,

334
00:20:45.481 --> 00:20:46.680
I think of it as a pyramid.

335
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.100
First I have to be able to not smoke pot,

336
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.360
not become an alcoholic.
Um,
manage my money,

337
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.300
all these little things on the bottom row of the pyramid.

338
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:02.380
And then there's the next row of the pyramid exercise,
eating healthy,

339
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.401
all of this stuff.

340
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:06.580
And the next year I'll make sure that you're studying the game all the way to

341
00:21:06.581 --> 00:21:09.370
the top.
So I designed a pyramid in that moment,

342
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:14.260
just as creative breakthrough I'm having,
right?
And,
and then I'm like,

343
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.600
well actually I love the concept of a pyramid.
And in poker the money flows up.

344
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.920
So I designed that pyramid.
In that moment I'm just writing for hours,

345
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:24.754
like a mad man.

346
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:29.260
And at the bottom of the pyramid is like all the small stakes games that might

347
00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:32.590
happen at a bar.
And then all the home games,

348
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.030
and then some of the Games in Vegas and some of the big games in La,

349
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.450
all the money flows up.
All the people that have success here come to this level.

350
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.050
They dump off the money or they go up most dump off the money.

351
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.710
So the money flows all the way up.
So if I want to be,

352
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.340
if I want to win millions or Deca millions playing poker,

353
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.840
I have to be up here at the top as a player.

354
00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:01.030
And I have to use this pyramid and make sure that I check all the boxes on all

355
00:22:01.031 --> 00:22:04.030
these blocks to get there.
Right.

356
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:08.810
And I came up with the concept,
I'm overwhelming people.
No,

357
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.050
I have two pyramids and a lifetime goal list.

358
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.620
And then I decided it's important to have something on my bathroom mirror,

359
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.210
which we talked about a little bit already.
And so that concept came that day.

360
00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:24.090
So all of this amazing positive momentum.
But to me that was one of the most,
uh,

361
00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.650
I'm calling that in my autobiography,
Poker Brat.

362
00:22:26.651 --> 00:22:31.240
I'm saying that chapter's called.
I can see the light and I just talk about that.

363
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.880
And then I'm devising all these money management strategies.

364
00:22:34.881 --> 00:22:38.950
So what were some of your,
that was a profound moment for me in my life.

365
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.690
What were some of your,
because this is,

366
00:22:40.691 --> 00:22:45.100
this is I think a really critical component as you alluded to earlier.

367
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.060
What were some of those money management strategies before?
Before we,

368
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:54.010
I'll come to that.
But before I say the amazing thing was with all those goals,

369
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:03.030
all those little holes I looked like a year later my wife found the list and

370
00:23:04.211 --> 00:23:08.050
maybe two years later and I had knocked off five of those lifetime goals
already.

371
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.530
I'd won the main event.
I'd met Kathy.

372
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.350
You know,
I bought this beautiful condominium.
I,
you know,

373
00:23:17.351 --> 00:23:20.440
I bought some beautiful cars and so just,

374
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:23.290
it was amazing how many boxes I checked.
Now,
the bestselling book,

375
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.510
I didn't know this and Oh four when I put out play poker,
like the pros,

376
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.240
I didn't know that this would be the one.

377
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.930
I just saw the poker wave coming and I put a how to book out there.

378
00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.800
Wrote up myself.
We talked about this last night.
It took two months,

379
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.160
1500 words a day.
Put it out there.

380
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.360
Some guy holds it up on ESPN.
He'd played a seven card,
low tournament,

381
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.930
seven card loke.
What'd he never played before?
What does that mean?

382
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:53.390
What's a seven card?
Low term?
Uh,
so I mean,

383
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.900
basically the world series of poker as a seven card stud tournament to hold 'em

384
00:23:56.901 --> 00:24:00.440
tournament,
Omaha,
all these different variations of poker.

385
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.660
So he's playing in a seven card though.
He said,

386
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.770
I read Phil Home Use Book and he holds it up,
holds it up on ESPN.

387
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.530
I read Phil,
have you split?
Can I cash for $17,000 not a million.
Not 2 million.

388
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:18.060
$17,000.
Boom.
My book hits the best seller list.
Yeah.

389
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.620
<v 0>Oh Wow.</v>

390
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:25.290
It's

391
00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:29.350
<v 3>a lifetime Dole.
Sorry.
I remember Harper Collins calls me.
They somehow,</v>

392
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.910
I guess we had cell phones by then.
So yeah,
so they,
they called me and they said,

393
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:39.070
yeah,
where are you staying?
And I'm like,
I'm at the,
I'm at the Loews Hotel.

394
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.590
And they said,
okay,
your book just hit the New York Times bestseller list.

395
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:49.480
We just sent a bottle of dom tier room.
And I'm like,
and it was a how to list.

396
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:53.050
So I just walked around high for weeks because that was one of the last goals

397
00:24:53.051 --> 00:24:55.660
that I had to accomplish.
Yeah,
yeah.

398
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.890
And there's so many directions we could go,

399
00:24:59.891 --> 00:25:04.330
but I'm going to go back to the wealth money management.
Yes sir.
So at that time,

400
00:25:04.331 --> 00:25:08.050
because this is,
this is a critical survival skills,
it seems like,
I mean,

401
00:25:08.051 --> 00:25:09.720
foundational for I'm,

402
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:12.640
he came back to this because I think the people out there should know this.

403
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.620
What's more important?
Great poker skills are great money management,

404
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:24.100
money management.
And I'll tell you why.
If you have a guy that has poker skills,

405
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.750
let's do a diagram here.

406
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:31.170
Poker skills of sick of 80 let's say poker skills of 90 okay?

407
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.620
And you have a guy of poker skills of 80 but the guy with 80 manages money

408
00:25:35.621 --> 00:25:38.830
better.
He's going to have a much more comfortable life.

409
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.600
He's going to win as money.

410
00:25:40.601 --> 00:25:44.770
He's going to sit down in the smart games at the right time with the right

411
00:25:44.771 --> 00:25:47.890
amount of money,
and he's just going to flow along.

412
00:25:47.891 --> 00:25:50.560
He's going to pay all of his bills.
It's gonna look boring.

413
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.730
Some of the outside was going to say,
Oh,
you're too conservative.
But meanwhile,

414
00:25:54.731 --> 00:25:56.920
look at the guy who was 90 all right,

415
00:25:56.921 --> 00:26:00.760
but no money management skills loses all his money in one night.
Yup.

416
00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:05.770
Now he has to borrow money from us.
Friends loses that too.
Then he gets staked,

417
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.640
right?
That means someone who's bankrolling,
someone banks rolls him,

418
00:26:09.641 --> 00:26:14.470
but he has so much skill that he hits for 500,000 a tournament.
Okay,

419
00:26:14.471 --> 00:26:19.471
but his back or gets 250,000 but still now we as 250,000 now he's back in

420
00:26:20.171 --> 00:26:21.004
action.

421
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:25.570
You know when he has a couple of successful months runs up to 400,000 but then

422
00:26:25.571 --> 00:26:30.010
over a series of two weeks loses the whole 400,000 barrels from all of his

423
00:26:30.011 --> 00:26:34.060
friends again because he paid him back last time.
This time he borrows more,

424
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:38.740
get sticked again.
That's in case you can't pay his bills.
That's a miserable,

425
00:26:38.741 --> 00:26:39.910
that's a tough existence.

426
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.850
And so that's why money is more important than poker skills.
Now,

427
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:46.930
how specifically by running,

428
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:51.380
I remember I remember a story where my wife thought I was a madman.

429
00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.000
He was a 1997 she thought it was.

430
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.370
<v 2>I'm wondering how many stories you have,
like uh,
but let's,
let's,</v>

431
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:01.180
let's start with this one.
So

432
00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.960
<v 3>we're saying as soon as I'm worth $1 million,
I'm going to get staked.</v>

433
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:10.240
That meant based on what my house was worth on stocks,

434
00:27:10.241 --> 00:27:11.830
all the stuff that I had in my life.

435
00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.950
And so I determined I hit the million dollar mark.
This is in asset.
Yeah.

436
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.591
And assets.

437
00:27:17.591 --> 00:27:22.591
Call it 1997 and I was on the way down and I was like,

438
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:28.030
all right,
I'm getting staked.
I'm going to have ted for stake me.
You know,

439
00:27:28.031 --> 00:27:29.560
cause people were lining up to stake me.

440
00:27:29.561 --> 00:27:34.210
I had pretty good results and so I'm going to have ted Forrest stake me and I

441
00:27:34.211 --> 00:27:37.450
was celebrating honey I'm getting staked by,

442
00:27:37.451 --> 00:27:39.290
wasn't celebrating the fact that I was getting staked.

443
00:27:39.291 --> 00:27:44.260
I was celebrating the fact that I could hit $1 million in net worth and get

444
00:27:44.261 --> 00:27:48.190
staked.
No one in history had done that to that point that I have ever heard of.

445
00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:53.230
Everybody else would go a,
let's get $200,000 from the house.
Let's sell a car,

446
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:57.400
let's sell some stocks.
Not me.
So I was celebrating in my wife.

447
00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:02.020
I just remember in a hotel in San Francisco,
I was all like,
yes,
you know,

448
00:28:02.021 --> 00:28:06.670
and my wife just was staring at me like with daggers,
like,
what's wrong with you?

449
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.490
You're getting staked and you're celebrating.
But that wasn't it.

450
00:28:09.491 --> 00:28:14.491
The point was I was going to draw this line in the sand and I did it and I got

451
00:28:14.591 --> 00:28:19.591
staked for the next three or four or five years until 2001 and,

452
00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:26.320
and Ted and Ted Forrest was great.
Like,
uh,
like he,

453
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.570
like if I had money,
do,
if I have,

454
00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.650
my bills were a lot less than if I had 5,000 a month in bills or 7,000 or

455
00:28:32.651 --> 00:28:33.484
whatever it was.

456
00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:38.050
He would just like press a button and send me the money that was getting staked.

457
00:28:38.051 --> 00:28:39.850
And I had no worries.
I played less.

458
00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:43.690
I spent more time with my family at that point.
And then all of a sudden,

459
00:28:43.691 --> 00:28:48.691
2001 I won 500,000 and tournament's quickly and Ted was entitled to like 400 of

460
00:28:50.531 --> 00:28:53.560
it.
Maybe I want,
yeah,
400 over it or whatever.

461
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.850
And I was more than happy.
You know,

462
00:28:56.851 --> 00:29:00.940
he had faith in me and he made a bunch of money because of me and that was
great.

463
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:02.403
Um,

464
00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.330
but that's what discipline it takes to have great money management.

465
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:11.860
And now today I have a system where only risk $10,000 a day.

466
00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:13.893
Um,

467
00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:19.030
<v 2>I'm playing,
you have to look at the percentage.
I look at the percentage,</v>

468
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.650
look at the percentage,
10 thousands not lot risk,

469
00:29:23.651 --> 00:29:26.710
$10,000 a day.
No,
the percentage.

470
00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:31.540
I'm proud of that because actually if I could translate to people at home,

471
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:35.680
I don't know what that would be for someone at home.
Take a guess.

472
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:39.850
I mean,
I,
I've done,
I have to take a guess that your net worth,
I don't know.

473
00:29:39.851 --> 00:29:42.840
I forget net worth liquid assets.
Yeah,
I would say it,

474
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.870
it's something that you can comfortably lose and not have it materially
affected.

475
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.710
<v 3>Do you?
Correct.
Correct.
Correct.
And,
and I just figured.</v>

476
00:29:51.711 --> 00:29:56.180
And so for me that was a big step implemented this five years ago and,

477
00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:01.250
and it's been super successful for me because 10,000 doesn't last too long in

478
00:30:01.251 --> 00:30:05.960
the games I play in.
Right.
But I can't always tell when I've lost 10 whether I'm,

479
00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.340
the reason I implemented it,

480
00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.830
I can't always tell if I'm playing poorly or if I'm just getting unlucky.

481
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.320
There's always,
there's always mystery there,

482
00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.250
mystery surrounding how good your playing.
And so I just decided to,
like,

483
00:30:19.251 --> 00:30:21.980
for me it's been a great system and if I lose it,
I'm like,
all right,

484
00:30:21.981 --> 00:30:25.250
I can't do anything.
I can't play for 24 hours or whatever until I wake up.

485
00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.760
All right,
well I might as well go to the movie.
I might sleep a couple of times,

486
00:30:28.761 --> 00:30:30.920
couple of shifts,
watch some movies in the room,

487
00:30:30.921 --> 00:30:34.700
chill and show up fresh the next day.
And,
and there's,

488
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.820
I don't want to lose 10 today.
I just did it yesterday.

489
00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.200
So you come up like ready to play and you've thought about did I do everything

490
00:30:42.201 --> 00:30:43.910
right?
So,
I mean that's,

491
00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.520
that's been a good system for me for the last five or six years.

492
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:52.280
How would you have reacted had you not one?

493
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.490
I think it would have been devastating.
Um,

494
00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.870
but I would have still had 350 400,000 you have to understand at that point I

495
00:31:02.871 --> 00:31:03.704
was already,

496
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:09.070
there were four majors per year and then there were like nine world series that

497
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.800
year.
They were saying 11 world series of poker championships.

498
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.050
And then there were like three other ones who really wanted to win,

499
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.880
which I considered majors.

500
00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:22.390
And one of them was the bicycle club main event and I won that one in 1988 in

501
00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:28.730
August.
So I had already won one of the majors and was all over the poker press.

502
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.630
And so to win that was just kind of like,
you know,

503
00:31:32.631 --> 00:31:34.610
that that was the greatest moment,

504
00:31:34.611 --> 00:31:38.120
maybe the greatest moment in my poker career just to win that.

505
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:39.980
It's nice to back it up

506
00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:46.020
<v 2>13 more times.
This,
speaking of backing it up at what point before 1989.</v>

507
00:31:46.021 --> 00:31:47.670
So I know we're doing a little memento style,

508
00:31:47.671 --> 00:31:52.470
like chronologically fragmented approach here,
but bear with me the,

509
00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:56.490
I don't know why I keep looking at you.
You look very pensive.
Uh,

510
00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:00.210
the question was,
which I appreciate.
It's like thinking hard.
I the,
uh,

511
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.673
the question is,

512
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:06.330
when did Johnny show you his hand?

513
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.890
This is what I've read.

514
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:12.270
Maybe this is also just myth and you saw something

515
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.720
<v 3>or at least you told him he's answering hand the answering thing about this.</v>

516
00:32:15.721 --> 00:32:18.060
This is more for poker people.
I'll try to,

517
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.580
I'll try to make it so everybody can understand.

518
00:32:20.581 --> 00:32:24.090
So the blinds were five and 10,000 whenever heads up.

519
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.960
And first thing I had whispered to Johnny Chan,

520
00:32:27.961 --> 00:32:30.120
we played 32 men side whispered at the beginning.

521
00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:35.100
You're going to have to play perfect and get lucky to beat me.
Now,

522
00:32:35.101 --> 00:32:38.480
if the cameras that have been working in those days,
um,
that,
that,

523
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.850
that's one that have been played a lot and people would have said,
boy,

524
00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:43.280
that kids cocky,
but I wish we were to just search.

525
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:48.281
Chan could here and exactly forehands before I had had the ace seven of

526
00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:49.700
diamonds,

527
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:54.700
I still remember and I opened for 35,000 so you have to think in terms of how

528
00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:57.950
much money you're raising.
Okay,

529
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:02.540
so that's three and a half times the big blind.
That's how they look at it.

530
00:33:02.541 --> 00:33:04.610
These days at 3.5 is pretty big,

531
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:08.930
but then sham called the 35 and raised 130,000 more,

532
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:12.530
almost twice the size of the pot.
These are unheard of.

533
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:16.100
Big numbers and a mental note went off.
I said,

534
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:20.870
I'm not going to play with them this hand,
but he's stepping on the aggression.

535
00:33:20.871 --> 00:33:24.560
Now I can see he's putting a lot of money.
He's become very aggressive.

536
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.390
I'm going to fold this.

537
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:30.320
I don't like folding it because everybody else in the world back then would put

538
00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:33.590
a lot of money in with an any ace,
especially a seven suited said,

539
00:33:33.591 --> 00:33:36.440
I'm going to fold this,
but I noticed he's changed.

540
00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:39.380
His style in my mind was just completely encompassed and how am I going to win

541
00:33:39.381 --> 00:33:40.820
this?
Exactly.

542
00:33:40.821 --> 00:33:45.200
Forehands later I looked at two black nines and it was like the script was

543
00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:46.034
already written.

544
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.720
I'm going to open for 35,000 he's going to raise 130,000 and I'm going to just

545
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:56.750
pile and 700,000 just boom that quick.

546
00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.820
And so it was like,
sometimes scripts are written from hands.
And so I did that.

547
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.550
He did it.
I waited.
I didn't want to give anything away.

548
00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:06.170
I didn't want to show any excitement,

549
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.590
didn't want to do anything that would change him from doing what he was going to

550
00:34:09.591 --> 00:34:10.424
do.

551
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:15.300
He reraise hundred 30,000 the minute those chips hit the pot,
I said,
I'm all in.

552
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:20.480
That's like he started the hand with 600,000 boom,

553
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:25.030
I'm raising all your chips right back on you.
And um,

554
00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.200
and it was two black knight's a pretty strong hand.

555
00:34:27.201 --> 00:34:31.790
And now he started studying and thinking.
And I thought to myself,

556
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.910
if he had ace king or Ace Queen or Ace Jack or Ace 10 he would have put the

557
00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:38.060
money in already.
And those hands are very close.

558
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.940
Like maybe I'm a 12 to 10 13 to 10 favorite.

559
00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:45.680
I don't want to play a pot where I'm only 12 to 10 or 13 to 10 I don't want to

560
00:34:45.681 --> 00:34:46.820
leave it to chance.

561
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.750
I also thought that he would call with any pair above tens instantly.

562
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:53.480
So at that point I'm thinking,
wow,
what does he have?

563
00:34:53.481 --> 00:34:54.890
Do I want them to call or not?

564
00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.250
And I'd been around poker long enough where I didn't want to influence the

565
00:34:58.251 --> 00:35:01.160
action by saying by acting strong or acting weak.

566
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:06.620
I said just let things play out and see where it lands.
But if he had king queen,

567
00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:08.540
I didn't want him to call him only a small favorite.

568
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.320
What do you had the ace seven of spades.
I was Kinda surprised.

569
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.810
Also he would have called right away with eights or sevens,

570
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.480
which is a great position for me.
When he had ace seven of spades,

571
00:35:17.481 --> 00:35:22.481
I was Kinda surprised it was a little weaker and I think he decided this kid is

572
00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:23.324
tough.

573
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.560
He and I had faced off in the 1988 world series he'd seen me.

574
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:32.240
We'd faced off in August at the tournament I won when I won the major at the

575
00:35:32.241 --> 00:35:37.241
bicycle club that I just mentioned and so he knew that was there.

576
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:41.400
He'd even come out in Esquire magazine in January and said,

577
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.320
this kid is going to win the main event.

578
00:35:43.321 --> 00:35:47.220
As soon as he learns to Tuck it in a little bit.
That was more fuel for my fire.

579
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.620
Reading myself in Esquire magazine.
That was a big thing man.
Back then,
you know,

580
00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:56.640
I mean nobody talked about poker and so I just I and so when he called with a

581
00:35:56.961 --> 00:35:58.980
seven of spades,
I was kind of surprised,
but again,

582
00:35:58.981 --> 00:36:02.250
I thought already going to find a way to outdraw me.
I mean it's just like,

583
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.020
it's not that I felt the negativity,

584
00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:08.130
it's more like you have to be prepared for him to hit it.
He's been lucky.

585
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.720
You've watched them get lucky and so I mean when that six of spades hit,
I was,

586
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.270
you know,
most are lear heaven.

587
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:20.580
I was going to tell you about the question that Antonio asks me that I told you

588
00:36:20.581 --> 00:36:24.810
about last night.
Let's this jump into,
okay,

589
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.910
now the subjects which fulfill,
get used to it.

590
00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:35.370
Antonio is a mutual friend,
very,
very savvy investor and entrepreneur doesn't,

591
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.730
we can say his last name,
right?
Sure.
Antonio,
Gracias.
Antonio Grassy Ceus.

592
00:36:38.731 --> 00:36:41.460
Amazing guys on the board of Tesla Space X.

593
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.840
Really great friends with Elon Musk.
Let's say we met originally.
Yeah,

594
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.950
we met at then Alon must party.
How lucky were we?
The beat,

595
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.260
it was like,
how did they lose bracelets?
And we ended up with like,
anyway,

596
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:58.190
well especially me,
this guy,
no,

597
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.700
I mean pretty amazing to be there.
But anyway,
uh,

598
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.380
so you know,
Antonio grassiness last year my ego was flying out of control.

599
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.820
I want a bracelet.

600
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.960
And then for three months straight I was losing maybe 10 sessions.

601
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:16.260
I've never last more than three sessions that I can remember for years.

602
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:20.550
Last 10 sessions in a row,
my ego's flying out of control.

603
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:25.500
Right?
I'm more tempted than ever by these beautiful,

604
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.770
smart women,
you know?

605
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.390
And so I'm treading on this Eagle Path and I'm having fun every day,

606
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:38.460
just popping from,
I'm doing events in New York,
Chicago,
appearances.
Just like,

607
00:37:38.461 --> 00:37:39.420
I just feel like,

608
00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:44.421
I just feel like I felt like I was attractive then everybody and I'm just having

609
00:37:45.891 --> 00:37:50.000
a blast with it,
you know?
And uh,
and I'm in the Hamptons,
you know,

610
00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:55.001
and just all this fun stuff is happening and so it's leading to a little bit of

611
00:37:55.341 --> 00:38:00.050
a car wreck for me.
And then Antonio grassiness asked me,
he said,
Phil,

612
00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:04.100
how many bracelets would you have without your wife?

613
00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.040
And I wanted to answer selfishly,
well,

614
00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.640
I might have more cause I'd play more tournaments,
but I knew that wasn't true.

615
00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:15.290
Yeah.
And I was like,
nine,

616
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:17.240
you said you have 14,

617
00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.020
nine [inaudible] you really think you'd have that money without her.

618
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:26.840
And I thought,
wow,
maybe seven.

619
00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.810
And the minute that that connected with me,

620
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:35.150
this egotistical guy walking around,
not mistreating anybody,
nice to everybody,

621
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:39.070
I've learned that,
you know,
respect everybody.
I've learned that.

622
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:44.080
Um,
but still flying high and his own like jetstream,
you know,

623
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.860
just kind of like thump.
Boom.

624
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.750
And a week later,
um,

625
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:58.000
my iPhone picture was,
I had two iPhone pictures,
one on the outside,

626
00:38:58.001 --> 00:39:01.000
which was a Clinton and I,
and then the other one in the inside,
George Bush.

627
00:39:01.001 --> 00:39:04.450
And I write,
so don't come at me.
I said Democrats and Republicans,

628
00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:10.740
but I erased one and put my wife up and I erase the other and I put my wife and

629
00:39:12.041 --> 00:39:15.280
sons up over the next two weeks.
And so I did it.
I thought,
wow,

630
00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:20.050
this is the Antonio effect.
Right.
Um,
you know,
he's,

631
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.650
I think,
I think if Alonzo ever struggle,
which of course he never has.

632
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.550
I think Antonio's helped him out.
He's just been amazing.

633
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.760
And so just that one question just kind of,

634
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:32.980
I felt like it rerouted my life a little bit.

635
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:37.330
And then in four sessions in my home game,

636
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.340
I won so much money.

637
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:45.280
I won like four x what I'd lost over the last three months and I just became

638
00:39:45.281 --> 00:39:47.560
more solidly entrenched in the process.

639
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:50.680
Like that was a key family first.

640
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:56.730
Then you have your fun movie star life where all these great things happened,

641
00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:01.990
but family first.
And so that was significant for me.
Um,

642
00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.610
just that question

643
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:09.620
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

644
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.930
<v 2>on a related note,
this is a question from Facebook,
Melanie Nelson,</v>

645
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:19.950
what's the secret to his long lasting marriage?
So I'd just love to know,
I mean,

646
00:40:19.951 --> 00:40:23.970
I'm going to tweak it a little bit,
but what other things have you done,
right?

647
00:40:23.971 --> 00:40:25.920
I mean it's,
what other things have you worked on?

648
00:40:25.921 --> 00:40:30.240
How have you worked on making it this long?
I mean,
it's a rarity in this world,

649
00:40:30.241 --> 00:40:31.320
at least in the u s

650
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.390
<v 3>rare,
you know,
and it hasn't,
it's not always easy,
right?
I mean,</v>

651
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.810
I think one thing is that,
you know,
I still have great desire for my wife.

652
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.790
I still lust after honey.
I love you

653
00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:50.330
and that's important to keep that,
it's important to keep that.
Um,

654
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.780
I think for me,
um,
you know,

655
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:57.270
I think my wife was probably ready to leave me in [inaudible] 99 like,

656
00:40:57.271 --> 00:41:01.530
who the hell is this guy married a diamond in the rough,
you still in the rough,

657
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.850
you know,
you're still,
you're still a piece of coal.
What,
what did we were,

658
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.230
we were supposed to change and grow up.
You're a smart guy.

659
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:12.960
Her threatening to leave me devastated me and,

660
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:16.530
but my wife's smart,
so she didn't do anything drastic.

661
00:41:16.531 --> 00:41:21.531
We went into therapy together and I worked really hard at all my faults.

662
00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:27.360
Too much ego too,
self centered to narcissistic,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Right?
A lot,

663
00:41:27.361 --> 00:41:29.970
a lot of stuff there was really important to work on.

664
00:41:29.971 --> 00:41:34.220
And I saw the truth in all of that and I was thinking about it every week.

665
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:38.600
We'd spend an hour and a half,
two hours,
three hours a week and you know,

666
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.760
figuring out how things I might've done wrong to her,

667
00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:49.130
mostly unintentionally.
Sometimes I'd be trying to do her a favor.

668
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:53.930
But of course,
sometimes women think differently than men.
Men are from Mars,

669
00:41:53.931 --> 00:41:55.210
women are from Venus,
right?
Yup.

670
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:59.330
So I learned a lot about that stuff and it changed my primary relationship.

671
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.330
So I grew for a year and a half.
Massive growth.

672
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.230
And what I found is all the other relationships change.
One of my friends,
uh,

673
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.170
John Benet was crying in the car fill.

674
00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:13.490
It's the first time you've listened to me and 10 years crying.
Wow.

675
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:17.210
And I was like,
that's,
that's my wife's effect.
Yeah.
You know?

676
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.700
So in changing the primary relationship and focusing in becoming better,
it shit,

677
00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.560
it made me smarter and wiser in all my other relationships.

678
00:42:24.561 --> 00:42:29.450
And it helped my poker too because poker is a people game.
Yeah.
And so,

679
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.440
so I think,
so at the end of it I was like,
well,
uh,

680
00:42:33.441 --> 00:42:38.140
she made me into a better man and we ended up coming out like this.
Um,

681
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:42.620
and so I remember six months later I'm like,
man,
I missed this gross.

682
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:48.350
I want to go back into therapy just so I can get better and grow more.
And so,

683
00:42:48.351 --> 00:42:51.680
I mean,
that's one thing that's,
that's been really smart for us.
And then,

684
00:42:51.681 --> 00:42:53.150
you know,
I mean,
and then,
you know,

685
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:58.210
in the 30s we all know that a lot of women are leaving men and in the forties a

686
00:42:58.881 --> 00:43:03.440
lot of men are leaving women.
The,
the math and the science are undisputed.

687
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:08.240
And so when I struggled a little bit with whether or not,
you know,

688
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.400
I wanted to be in this relationship,

689
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:13.690
I asked her to change a few things and,
uh,

690
00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.720
we went into therapy together and she did.
And so we just keep growing.

691
00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:22.790
We keep getting better and better,
better understanding of each other.
Um,

692
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.780
and you know,
and I think now at my age,

693
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.850
I'm probably safe to be with her for another 25 years.
Uh,

694
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.330
I know how to avoid the temptations,
you know.
Um,

695
00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:40.280
and I play with fire a little bit sometimes and that I'm in those positions and

696
00:43:40.281 --> 00:43:43.940
having fun.
Um,
but it,
it just like,

697
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:47.630
I just don't think after 27 years of not shading,
I'm going to go out and shape.

698
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:48.583
Yeah.

699
00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.600
<v 2>How'd your poker skills help you away from the table?</v>

700
00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.270
And you mentioned negotiation.
Uh,

701
00:44:02.271 --> 00:44:07.271
are there any other areas in which you can think poker has helped you?

702
00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.050
Well,
I don't know.
I have to think about that.
I mean,

703
00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:17.500
maybe the answer is everything.
I mean,
it couldn't be everything.
Yeah.

704
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:20.680
I mean it just,
I went to a lot of my friends who would love poker.

705
00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.170
We're not professional players by any stretch of the imagination,

706
00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.320
but I had one friend of mine,
very well educated guy,

707
00:44:26.321 --> 00:44:31.090
I mean he has a tattoo of a semi colon.
I support very well educated guy,

708
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:31.973
John.
Uh,

709
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:36.990
<v 3>who says that he learned all he needs to know about sort of navigating the world</v>

710
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:39.300
from his learning of,
I have one.

711
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:43.990
So my friend Alan Mishra who cured tennis elbow,
I didn't say it out loud.

712
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:48.570
Well you know Allen Allen.
Yeah.
Allen is one of the foremost experts

713
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.910
in something called platelet rich plasma.
PRP injections.

714
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:55.290
So they take out your whole blood,

715
00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:59.160
they spin it in a centrifuge and then they isolate the growth factors and then

716
00:44:59.161 --> 00:45:03.000
reinject it locally into injuries.
Like tennis always been in the New York Times.

717
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:04.600
Fascinating guy.
Yeah.
That's amazing guy.

718
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:09.420
He came to me and Oh two and said,
I have this PRP thing.

719
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.330
Yeah.
So I got involved with them,
but really I'm like,
dude,

720
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.580
you're going to change the world.
And he's like,

721
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:15.900
that's just what I needed to hear.

722
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.290
And so I've invited my poker camps and we hang out.

723
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:23.580
And right now we're in a suicide football league together.
We have one team left,

724
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:25.920
so we're trying to decide colleague,

725
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:30.450
it's just one where you have to pick a winner each week.
Yeah.

726
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.610
But you can only pick a team once per year.

727
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:35.880
So by the end you're picking Cleveland and some other teams that haven't won

728
00:45:35.881 --> 00:45:40.680
money games.
Got It.
Okay.
But Anyway,
um,
uh,
Alan told me that,

729
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:44.340
you know,
playing poker has helped him read his patients.

730
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.720
These high profile patients come to him and he says,
well,

731
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.530
did you hurt your knee doing this?

732
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:56.750
And if they hesitate,
it's like no transfers coming.

733
00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:01.710
Like he can have you been taking your medicine the last three weeks and he can

734
00:46:01.711 --> 00:46:03.210
tell whether they're lying or telling the truth.

735
00:46:03.211 --> 00:46:06.330
And that's good for him because then he can design a better program for that.

736
00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:11.060
Yeah.
Fantastic.
Doctor,
hard to get ahold of a fundraiser.

737
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:15.090
A very,
very popular competent guy.
Well,
he's the guy that invented the,
you know,

738
00:46:15.091 --> 00:46:18.480
the surgery that Colby had on the knee where I went to Germany.
Yeah.

739
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.380
Alan invented PRP.
Alan owns three US patents on PRP,

740
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.840
and yet when Colby goes over to Germany,

741
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.450
no one mentions Alan Mishra's name is Ian Venter.
Yeah,

742
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:32.670
it's some doctor in Germany.
Yeah.
It's amazing what he can do.
Imagine this folks,

743
00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:38.010
you have your own blood.
He spins up the PRP.
Okay.

744
00:46:38.011 --> 00:46:41.310
The,
the growth hormone.
Let's just say that you have Alzheimer's.

745
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:45.270
They pour the PRP and the area with Alzheimer's.

746
00:46:45.271 --> 00:46:49.770
He thinks that may be one area that he can help.
Say you had a heart attack.

747
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:54.870
They've already proven that your heart will come back 85% better with your own

748
00:46:54.871 --> 00:46:55.230
blood.

749
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:59.940
So imagine we've been searching the top of the Himalayas for amazing things when

750
00:46:59.941 --> 00:47:03.770
it's inside your blood.
All this ability to cure and a,

751
00:47:03.771 --> 00:47:08.490
and Alan's working on some curing cancer stuff.
Uh,
which is amazing.
And I,

752
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.630
I don't know.
I,
I,
I dunno,
I,
I,
maybe I'm naive.

753
00:47:12.631 --> 00:47:15.720
I believe he has a decent shot to,
I believe he's going to cure cancer.

754
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.560
Let me just,
this,
this small world story.
I mean,
it's worth pointing out.
I mean,

755
00:47:25.561 --> 00:47:29.520
I'm not originally from the bay area.
You're not originally from the bay area.
Uh,

756
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.040
I got advice very early on.
This is on my answering machine,

757
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:35.500
actually way back in the day from a mentor.
And he said,

758
00:47:35.501 --> 00:47:38.440
you're the average of the five people you associate with most.
I was like,
Huh.

759
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:42.550
And that's been one of the pieces of advices,
guided a lot of my decisions,

760
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:45.550
one of which was where to move to live.
So the bay area,

761
00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:49.860
you just happened to bump into people like telling mushroom and it's amazing.
Ah,

762
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.660
when you hear the word,
he's a crazy guy.
He just said,
hey,

763
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:56.590
he just went to the Nobel prize winners and said,
Hey,
uh,
I have a new concept.

764
00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.960
You know how we're trying to starve cancer cells?

765
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:02.380
I'm just going to feed them platelet rich plasma and see how that works.

766
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.130
You know?
So there's been some progress,

767
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.160
so I'll probably sound stupid do you can keep this in,

768
00:48:09.161 --> 00:48:10.870
but I'll probably sound stupid saying he's going to,

769
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:14.200
I think he's going to cure cancer,
but I'm sticking by it.
Eh,

770
00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:19.750
he certainly cure a lot of other stuff,
so yeah,
he's a brilliant guy.

771
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.880
No one knows his name.
Those true.

772
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.780
When you hear the word successful,

773
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.510
who's the first person who comes to mind for you and why?

774
00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:33.653
<v 0>Wow.</v>

775
00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.950
<v 3>I mean,
I think of,
I think of some of my best friends,</v>

776
00:48:36.951 --> 00:48:38.870
I think of Chamath Palihapitiya.

777
00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.340
I think a Billy and people don't really,

778
00:48:43.341 --> 00:48:45.560
unless you're a business insider or you haven't heard of these guys,

779
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.320
can you explain why?
Is that what you're thinking?

780
00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.280
You're thinking what Elon Musk done is beyond success,

781
00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.750
what he's doing,
you know,
he thinks we live in a matrix.

782
00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:01.430
You know,
he,
he sending people to Mars,

783
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.630
he has Tesla,
he has basic cs.
That's extraordinary.

784
00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:09.590
And I'm
sorry,

785
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:12.940
I was thinking Chamath Palihapitiya and Millie,
the wire,

786
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:17.420
these two very famous investors at this point.
Again,

787
00:49:17.421 --> 00:49:19.760
nobody in the room knows her name.
So why are they,

788
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:23.170
what makes them successful to you?
Well,
the thing I like about thing,

789
00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:26.930
I define success a little differently.
So Chamath,
um,

790
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:30.620
I mean I tease him that he got lucky.
He didn't want to go to Facebook.

791
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:32.960
They just kept giving him more and more stock.
He's like,

792
00:49:32.961 --> 00:49:34.220
I don't know if this thing's going to work.

793
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:39.170
So finally it took the stock and went,
so,
you know,
each point is worth,
what,

794
00:49:39.171 --> 00:49:42.290
2 billion.
Now?
He's done pretty well.
So,

795
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:47.930
but it's what he's done.
He plays poker great.

796
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.460
He,
his family's great.
He has an amazing wife,

797
00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:55.700
Bridget,
and three young children.

798
00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:01.220
And I see the effort that he puts into like,
you know,

799
00:50:01.221 --> 00:50:05.540
they used to as a lot of people in Silicon Valley,
the three nannies,
the maids,

800
00:50:05.541 --> 00:50:09.860
all that kind of stuff.
And these guys have gone a little bit away from that.

801
00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:15.350
Um,
and chammas he's been cooking meals for his wife and kids a little bit,

802
00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.650
which I've never done,
but it's amazing to me.

803
00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.670
He's put family first.
Yeah.
And yet still change the world,

804
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:28.760
you know,
uh,
deployed billions,

805
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.980
one point $2 billion now out into the field.
He's crushing it.
Right.

806
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.510
Um,
and then I looked at my friend Billy,
who,
you know,

807
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:43.540
spends a fair amount of time in his backyard with his young kids and,

808
00:50:43.791 --> 00:50:47.600
uh,
and you know,
deals come to him.
As you know,

809
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:49.820
he's really good friends with Elon Musk.

810
00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:55.810
And I think when alarm flies over to Paris to do a climate change,

811
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:57.740
there's one other guy on the plane.

812
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:03.350
It's bill and bill because bill is brilliant and you want bill with you cause

813
00:51:03.351 --> 00:51:07.490
bill is going to help you write your climate speech,
you know,
um,

814
00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:11.510
when the gigafactory opens,
he want Billy next to,
you know.

815
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:16.520
And so these guys,
um,
they're living,

816
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:21.200
they're having a really nice lives and bill is one of the best angel investors

817
00:51:21.201 --> 00:51:24.950
in history.
Yeah.
Maybe the best angel investor in history,
we don't know,

818
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:30.110
but he's been involved with,
but he sits in his backyard and I'll go,

819
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.920
I,

820
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:35.480
what was it two days ago I went and we had lunch together and we had a drink and

821
00:51:35.481 --> 00:51:37.730
just kind of chill,
you know,
and that's,

822
00:51:37.731 --> 00:51:40.910
and I'll go to his house once a week and spend four hours in the afternoon

823
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:43.700
sitting in the backyard.
He has,
you know,

824
00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:48.050
a one year old and a three year old and a six year old and they're coming by,

825
00:51:48.051 --> 00:51:52.760
always spicing up the atmosphere.
And it just,
I enjoy that.

826
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:56.000
I enjoy the,
the friendship thing.
I didn't get that.

827
00:51:56.270 --> 00:52:00.620
I didn't get that until 2010 I was all about poker and family.

828
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:04.430
And then I just,
I kind of realize it's seeped into my life.

829
00:52:04.431 --> 00:52:08.240
The importance of strong friendships.
Definitely.
So

830
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:14.090
there's a concept of forgiveness that's hugely important.

831
00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.560
And so for me personally,
when I was studying Buddhism,
um,

832
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:22.730
and we spent a week at Iceland,
Kathy and I,
my wife and I,
a week at epsilon,

833
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:26.570
we weren't allowed to talk Aslin for those guys who don't know if this sort of

834
00:52:26.571 --> 00:52:31.571
idyllic spot in big Sur [inaudible] like spiritual place that was famous from

835
00:52:32.001 --> 00:52:36.020
the 60s has natural hot springs and it's really fun.

836
00:52:36.021 --> 00:52:40.700
And so when I studied Buddhism,
the concept of forgiveness was important.

837
00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:46.850
I had someone steal $28,000 from me.
Now understand

838
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:49.940
I was staking this guy.

839
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:55.210
I was feeding his family of that $28,000 that he had online that he stole from

840
00:52:56.601 --> 00:53:00.290
me.
14,000 was his only to do is call me and say,
Phil,

841
00:53:00.291 --> 00:53:05.030
I need 7,000 you take 7,000 will 14,000 on.
Instead,

842
00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:09.350
he chose to steal 28,000 from me when I got the phone call.

843
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:13.010
But this has happened.
I said,
what happened?

844
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:18.770
And I was in shock.
This guy just stole 28,000 from me.

845
00:53:18.771 --> 00:53:22.700
I'm sending money to his family,
I'm staking them.

846
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.450
What's going on here?
And uh,

847
00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:30.300
and I called my friend John Benetti Ben,
he's like fry em.

848
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:35.850
Really see evidence,
crush him,
destroy him for life.

849
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.720
We had the evidence,
neat pile of evidence released on the Internet.

850
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:43.300
He's destroyed for life.
But what good does that to me?
Yup.

851
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:48.660
What good.
And so I was just furious and steaming and whatever.

852
00:53:48.661 --> 00:53:53.661
And I called the guy and he was crying on the phone and I finally just decided,

853
00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.750
honey,
you and I are going out to dinner.

854
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.930
We're going to have the most expensive dinner and the most expensive bottle of

855
00:54:00.931 --> 00:54:03.960
wine I can have because my life is amazing.

856
00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:08.730
And I've spent one hour or two hours of my time steaming cause someone stole

857
00:54:08.731 --> 00:54:12.270
from me.
We went out,
we had a really nice dinner.
At the end of that dinner,

858
00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:16.380
I said,
I'm going to completely forgive the guy.
Nothing was ever released,

859
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:26.080
but here's some beauty.
Here's what I didn't expect.
I got paid back in full.

860
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:30.700
This guide defends me to everybody on the planet.

861
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:34.540
My wife said he's turned into a like a protector of yours.

862
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.290
So now there's a big profile guy.

863
00:54:38.291 --> 00:54:41.200
He's defending me to everybody telling everybody what a great guy I am.

864
00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:45.760
And I remember the other amazing thing about this.

865
00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:50.230
This happened on a Monday night.
I could've released it all hell breaks loose.

866
00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:54.610
The Internet just goes crazy in the poker world.
Instead,

867
00:54:54.611 --> 00:54:57.850
I flew to Connecticut to playing a poker tournament.

868
00:54:57.851 --> 00:55:02.040
$10,000 buy in on Friday.
You can't make this up.
You can't.

869
00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:05.710
I saw the guy walked out on me in the hallway.
I shook his hand.

870
00:55:05.711 --> 00:55:10.300
It hurt a little bit.
It hurt a little bit,
but I shook his hand.

871
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.780
I wouldn't give him a hug.
I've shook his hand,

872
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:18.500
but I never had to worry about him again after shaking his hand.
Right.
Yup.

873
00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:22.030
And this is the freaky thing.
I played in that tournament.

874
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:25.540
Now if I were at war with him and I don't know,

875
00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:28.840
he couldn't say anything negative about me,
but he might just start throwing mud,

876
00:55:28.841 --> 00:55:32.590
trying to come up with stuff.
Right.
I Dunno.
He couldn't,
he could never attack me.

877
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:36.120
Right.
But people would make shit up.
Right?
Yeah.
Um,

878
00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:39.040
so rather than in some mud throwing contest,

879
00:55:39.041 --> 00:55:43.140
my mind is focused on the poker tournament.
You can't make,
I can't just,

880
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:45.070
I want $280,000.

881
00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:51.120
<v 0>No
preferred place.</v>

882
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.500
<v 3>280,000 exactly 10 times.
What?</v>

883
00:55:55.501 --> 00:55:59.460
You lost what had been stolen from me.
So I got the 280,000.

884
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:04.140
The guy paid me back and full and he's been a protector of mine all cause I

885
00:56:04.141 --> 00:56:07.800
forgave this really bad act.
Bad Actor Act.
Yeah.
Right.

886
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.360
So I love the concept,

887
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:12.270
I forget was this isn't the only time I have another great forgiveness story.

888
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:16.080
In fact,
I'm going to tell it because if anything makes us edit,

889
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.600
I want the forgiveness stuff to make the edit.
Okay.

890
00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:24.310
Another guy who I used to play poker with and the eighties I'm in Madison,

891
00:56:24.311 --> 00:56:28.060
Wisconsin.
He made sure that I was banned from the big game.

892
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.990
He didn't want me to play in the big game in Madison.
He banned me.

893
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.400
So it was a lot of animosity towards him rise.

894
00:56:35.401 --> 00:56:37.160
He afraid of losing or why didn't even what you've play?

895
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:40.360
Partly that probably thought I was acting up a little bit,

896
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:43.480
but I think it was mostly didn't want me in the game because I was winning so

897
00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:47.230
much money in Madison.
He banned me for three years.

898
00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:52.231
I moved in 1993 and 1994 I saw him with some other friends that I invited them

899
00:56:53.861 --> 00:56:54.694
out to a movie.

900
00:56:56.650 --> 00:57:00.460
We went out to a dinner and a movie and that was nice as I could be and I

901
00:57:00.461 --> 00:57:05.140
completely forgave him.
Okay.
In your head or in my head,

902
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:09.580
and sometimes that's an act where a lie down on a bed.

903
00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:13.300
I'll close my eyes and I'll try to meditate and I'll send love towards that

904
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:17.410
person that I hate.
I'll just waves of love,

905
00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:21.340
whatever that means to the individual.
But when I'm doing that,

906
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:23.650
I usually am on the bed a long time.
Cause then I'm like,

907
00:57:23.651 --> 00:57:25.720
well I have to send love to all the people I love to.
Yeah.

908
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:27.950
<v 0>So</v>

909
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:30.710
<v 3>they're 20 minutes,
but I don't know,
I can't explain it to you.</v>

910
00:57:30.711 --> 00:57:33.590
Then the very next time I see someone like that who have sent love too,

911
00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.330
it's like they've received it.

912
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:38.870
So did they just notice that my demeanor towards some change,

913
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:42.650
that I'm happy to see them or what happened?
I don't know.
I can't explain it.

914
00:57:42.651 --> 00:57:43.484
So what,
how would this guy,

915
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:48.200
so this guy calls me three years later and led me to and said,

916
00:57:48.201 --> 00:57:49.034
hey listen,

917
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:54.140
I recommended you for this deal and I made like $14 million.

918
00:57:55.130 --> 00:58:00.130
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

919
00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.520
<v 3>so I gotta Tell Ya,
I'm into forgiveness.</v>

920
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:07.900
So I forgive everybody.
So now,
but I haven't had,

921
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.700
I haven't had some of the really horrible stuff happened.
You know,

922
00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:14.200
like I don't know,
rape or stuff like that.
I don't,

923
00:58:14.201 --> 00:58:17.230
I wouldn't know how to counsel someone.
Just really traumatic stuff happened,

924
00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:20.050
you know?
But I know for me,

925
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:25.470
forgiving people stealing from me and all this other stuff has led to amazing

926
00:58:26.261 --> 00:58:30.490
results and I have no hatred in my heart.
I get to walk around happy everyday,

927
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.850
you know?
And again,
I think it's really huge.
I'll say it again.

928
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.330
When you're walking down any hallway in,
anybody in the planet walks towards you,

929
00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:38.440
I don't have to turn left or right.

930
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:43.940
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

931
00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:46.630
<v 2>I think it's also,
uh,
you know,</v>

932
00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.100
I remember thinking to myself at one point that beat if you're offended easily

933
00:58:50.101 --> 00:58:53.970
because I am offended easily.
I have some anger issues.

934
00:58:53.971 --> 00:58:56.820
Sometimes you're a bad resource allocator.

935
00:58:56.970 --> 00:59:01.970
It's a bad use of this finite resource wishes your energy and calories and hours

936
00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:07.530
on this planet when you're awake.
So for me it's like,
all right,

937
00:59:07.531 --> 00:59:10.470
well it's kind of a two for one.
If you forgive people,
you get the altruism,

938
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:14.100
but you also got the practicality and then you get these unforeseen ripple

939
00:59:14.101 --> 00:59:16.480
effects later.
I wasn't expecting

940
00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:20.680
<v 3>the ripple effects,
but it happens.
It's just wonderful.
I'm like,
wow,</v>

941
00:59:20.681 --> 00:59:24.410
this is this something I'm going to do the rest of my life.
Um,

942
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:29.600
I've had guys,
like,
I've had guys,
right,
80 negative blogs about me.

943
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:33.710
It's about the way I play poker.
Never cross the line to personal,

944
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:37.520
maybe a little bit in there and forgave those guys.

945
00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:40.850
And I knew this guy who attacked me all this time that actually kind of loved
me.

946
00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:45.890
So I forgave him and we moved on and we're friends.
So I've never written a red,

947
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:49.060
I've never written anything negative about him ever.
But it's okay.
Yeah,

948
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.740
I don't feel the need to,
you know.

949
00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:57.090
<v 2>So I want to maybe take a hard left turn and talk about turning away from</v>

950
00:59:57.371 --> 01:00:01.240
forgiveness to rampage from forgiveness to ram fit.

951
01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.140
Don't worry,
we're not going to end on a sour.
They knew at that rate.

952
01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:09.300
We're not going to end on a sour note.
So you told the story last night.
Well,

953
01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.390
I was having some mall back,
let's be honest.
And uh,

954
01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:16.960
you told the ongoing on the rampage story,
now it was,

955
01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:20.290
was this in Europe or was it somewhere else?

956
01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:25.560
<v 3>So then we had a $300,000 buy in tournament in May and a,</v>

957
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:30.400
and I decided there was a 300 k there was another hundred k another hundred k.

958
01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.630
And so I thought,
you know what,
I've been bad at raising money to play poker.

959
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.800
I have let one guy stake me,
I've made them like 1.5 million.

960
01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:42.070
It's been great,
but let me try this other way.

961
01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:46.600
And so I reached out to my friends,
but I wasn't sure they would respond.

962
01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:50.650
So I reached out.
So I thought,
but I only want to reach out once.

963
01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:53.980
So in this email I'm going to list,
I'm gonna say the first thing,

964
01:00:53.981 --> 01:00:55.180
it's a high risk investment.

965
01:00:55.450 --> 01:01:00.220
You're putting up $540,000 for me to play six tournaments,
high risk.

966
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:03.100
So be aware you probably going to lose your money.

967
01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:05.420
That's how I led the email and then a,

968
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:10.420
and then I said I listed the events when they would be on television because

969
01:01:10.421 --> 01:01:14.050
it's kind of fun when you're sticking someone to watch them live on television,

970
01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:18.340
they're playing your money,
you're live on television.
Like,
that's my horse man.

971
01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:20.920
I mean that's like better than having somebody in the Kentucky Derby.

972
01:01:20.921 --> 01:01:24.700
The derby only lasts 60 seconds.
You,
they got to watch me play.

973
01:01:24.701 --> 01:01:27.700
If you'd like to be nervous for hours,
they get to watch me.
Yes,

974
01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:32.650
they got to watch me play 20 hours of live television in this event or more than

975
01:01:32.651 --> 01:01:34.390
that.
And so it's kind of cool.

976
01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:37.780
So I sent it out and I also put wiring instructions and I said,

977
01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:41.770
let's see what happens.
$540,000 so I'll take,

978
01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.370
I'll take a 10% free roll and I'll put in the first 54,000 that way I'm playing

979
01:01:45.371 --> 01:01:48.580
for 20%.
All right,
let's see what happens.
Well,

980
01:01:48.581 --> 01:01:52.680
within 20 hours I sold up and then people were mad at me cause I didn't get him

981
01:01:52.681 --> 01:01:55.870
in.
So,
um,

982
01:01:55.871 --> 01:02:00.871
so now I'm playing this $300,000 buy in tournament and it's live on Fox sports

983
01:02:01.061 --> 01:02:05.020
net and we're,
we're on day two or whatever.

984
01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:08.530
I think it's sold out at 48 players.
We're on day two,

985
01:02:08.531 --> 01:02:12.820
it's late and maybe even day three and I'm feeling boxed in.
What does that mean?

986
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:16.840
I have a young,
great player on my right.
Dan Smith,

987
01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.360
another great player,

988
01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:23.380
fader Holtz on my left who's been crushing it in 2016 just crushing it and

989
01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:28.830
there's somebody else there and I just felt like they're onto me.

990
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:32.820
They're playing me too well.
And I said,
screw this.

991
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:36.390
I might bust myself,
but I'm going to try something else.
I said,

992
01:02:36.391 --> 01:02:39.390
this is it that they're just there to attuned to me.
Well,

993
01:02:39.391 --> 01:02:42.840
they've also have years of tape on your correct.
So I said,

994
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:45.210
I'm on a rampage,
raise it,

995
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:49.890
and I'm throwing the chips in and I'm saying I'm on a rampage.

996
01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:52.230
Like once every 15 seconds I'm on a rampage.
I'm Amanda.

997
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:57.380
I raised 10 pots in a row and they were like from being this calm patient fill

998
01:02:58.050 --> 01:02:59.880
to all of a sudden raising.
And they're just like,

999
01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:04.620
I just saw the looks on their faces.
What the Hell is going on here?
Raise it,

1000
01:03:04.621 --> 01:03:06.810
raise it,
raise it.
Well,
the whole cards are flushing to the world.

1001
01:03:06.811 --> 01:03:11.160
Nine deuce off suit,
Jack four off suit,
you know,
seven do soft suit.

1002
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.380
Just nothing.
I'm not even looking at my hands.

1003
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.710
I didn't even look at a hand during my rampage.
Raise it,
raise it,
raise it.

1004
01:03:16.711 --> 01:03:18.180
I'm on a rampage.
I'm on a rampage.

1005
01:03:18.181 --> 01:03:21.360
I'm winning every pot accumulating all these chips.
And I'm like,
all right.

1006
01:03:21.361 --> 01:03:25.920
I messed up their flow.
Right.
And um,
and if they do call and bedding,

1007
01:03:25.921 --> 01:03:30.180
the flop,
a bedding,
the turn firing,
just throwing chips in there.
And I'm saying,

1008
01:03:30.181 --> 01:03:34.890
I'm on a rampage.
I'm on a rampage.
It was great television.

1009
01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.910
I'm sure two things happened.
One,

1010
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:42.310
I'm finally in the big blind.
All the backers are like my horses on a rampage.

1011
01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:46.620
Well,
yeah.
Oh,
I got those emails the next day.
Trust me.

1012
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:49.500
So now I'm in the big blind.
I hadn't looked at my whole cards.

1013
01:03:49.501 --> 01:03:52.950
There's a guy in the small blind and I said,
I'm on a rampage.

1014
01:03:52.951 --> 01:03:55.890
Everybody else had fold.
They don't dare raise my blind.
He's like,
all in,

1015
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.650
he puts 2 million in.
I looked on a queens,

1016
01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.760
I call 700,000 he has a nine and a 10 I owned that point.

1017
01:04:02.761 --> 01:04:06.540
I'm at 1.4 million and I'm on a rampage.
And I'm on a rampage.

1018
01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:11.070
I'm going on and on about it.
And finally,
finally I slowed down.

1019
01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:15.930
Now the next day,
so I did this.
No one understands on the planet why I did this.

1020
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:20.370
This is one reason why I'm a bad poker player.
They say,
right?

1021
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:23.700
What I'm trying to do is just lose my mind,

1022
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:27.810
be crazy and let them know you're not bluffing me for this next 20 hands.

1023
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:32.040
You are not going to bluff me.
You might beat me,
but if you raise me,

1024
01:04:32.041 --> 01:04:35.040
I'm calling all your rear raises too.
I'm telling them,
you reraise me,

1025
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:38.150
I'm calling,
so let's just get it on.
You know,
I don't,

1026
01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.100
it just doesn't matter to me.
It's all threatened bluster.

1027
01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:45.180
And I probably would've called them if they reraise me because that's just what

1028
01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:47.490
I was going to do,
you know?
And so,

1029
01:04:47.491 --> 01:04:50.220
but it really changed the dynamics of the game.
Now,
of course,

1030
01:04:50.221 --> 01:04:55.020
the next day I had like five different investors emailing me.
Phil,

1031
01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:58.230
don't lose it like that again.
Fill.
What were you thinking,
Phil?

1032
01:04:58.231 --> 01:05:01.100
What are you doing?
Why are you playing nine too soft too?

1033
01:05:01.101 --> 01:05:04.110
Why are you playing Jack Three off suit?
You know all of these commentary,

1034
01:05:04.111 --> 01:05:06.150
you know,
and I'm just like,
I'm like,

1035
01:05:06.151 --> 01:05:10.980
doesn't anybody see the brilliance of what I did
know?

1036
01:05:10.981 --> 01:05:15.030
They see the insanity of what I just did.
One in the same,
right?

1037
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:18.040
It's like everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.
Custom auto

1038
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.510
<v 2>trader.
My tasks.
You have a pretty theory now let me go on a rampage.</v>

1039
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:27.100
So we're going to wrap up with some of the,
by the way,
some of them,

1040
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:31.060
some of the highest ratings ever in poker history.
Yeah,
I mean,
no,
sure.

1041
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:34.660
I mean to watch me go crazy like that.
Those clips have been watched just a ton.

1042
01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:36.870
It isn't gentlemen,
Phil,
you

1043
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:42.020
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

1044
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:50.540
<v 4>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

1045
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:53.540
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1046
01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:56.810
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1047
01:05:56.811 --> 01:05:59.420
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday?

1048
01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:03.950
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

1049
01:06:03.951 --> 01:06:08.570
Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that

1050
01:06:08.571 --> 01:06:10.160
I've been pondering over the week.

1051
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:13.130
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1052
01:06:13.131 --> 01:06:16.610
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1053
01:06:16.611 --> 01:06:20.900
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1054
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.200
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1055
01:06:26.871 --> 01:06:29.570
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1056
01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:34.640
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1057
01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.860
So if you want to receive that,

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:51.370
I hope you enjoyed this podcast is brought to you by Mizzen and main,

1062
01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:55.760
many of you,
long time listeners know how I feel about visiting Maine.

1063
01:06:55.850 --> 01:07:00.020
They make you most comfortable dress shirts in the world.
Quite possibly.

1064
01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:03.680
They use advanced performance fabrics,
which provides stretch and comfort,

1065
01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:07.820
but that's not the real selling point to me.
That's all great.

1066
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:11.810
It's all really good,
but they are the only dress shirts,
so to speak,

1067
01:07:11.811 --> 01:07:16.520
that I travel with because you don't have to iron them and we're steaming no

1068
01:07:16.521 --> 01:07:20.300
more headache.
I can just punch them up,
throw them in a bag,
pull them out,

1069
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:24.230
and no one will be the wiser.
They're fancy enough for important dinners,

1070
01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:28.910
but made from athletics,
sweat wicking material so they're all purpose.

1071
01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:34.160
And hundreds of pro athletes love these shirts,
including NFL opera,
Jj Watt,

1072
01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:38.000
and last time these guys were on the show.
They sold out of every item.

1073
01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:39.740
They feature every single skew.

1074
01:07:39.741 --> 01:07:43.850
So if you're interested in getting a shirt and might want to check them out on

1075
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:44.900
the faster side,

1076
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:50.200
just go to tim.blog four slash shirts and you can receive $50 off when you

1077
01:07:51.231 --> 01:07:53.450
purchase three or more shirts.
So check it out.

1078
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:58.930
tim.blog/shirts this episode is brought to you by movement watches and that is

1079
01:08:01.821 --> 01:08:04.550
spelled M v empty movement watches.

1080
01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:09.410
I first became aware of this company back in 2014 when there are brand,

1081
01:08:09.411 --> 01:08:13.380
brand new,
maybe company because they won first place in Shopify,

1082
01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.930
build a business competition.

1083
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:19.400
The founders are two college dropouts who wanted to wear fancy watches but had

1084
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.110
whoa wee little problem.

1085
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:24.860
They couldn't afford fancy watches so they decided to scratch their own itch.

1086
01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:25.941
Since then,

1087
01:08:25.941 --> 01:08:29.570
they're high quality affordable watches have gone from startup to more than 1

1088
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:32.630
million watches sold across 160 countries.

1089
01:08:32.631 --> 01:08:35.840
It's an awesome success story and when you check out the product,

1090
01:08:35.841 --> 01:08:37.550
you'll know why they offer classic design,

1091
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.990
quality construction and many different modern styles,

1092
01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:45.680
so you can really pick one that suits you.
You might want to start one.

1093
01:08:45.681 --> 01:08:50.030
I would suggest probably appeal to a lot of folks out there as the classic black

1094
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:52.800
silver,
so search classic white silver.

1095
01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.780
