00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.170
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.650
I'm a cybernetic organism.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.090
<v 1>this episode is brought to you by teeter.</v>

5
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.200
I am so thrilled to have connected with these guys because I've used teeter

6
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:32.270
products for many,
many years.

7
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:36.710
I've traveled around the country and the world with teeter products and I'm

8
00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:41.711
sitting about 15 feet in my home from one of their inversion tables and we're

9
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:44.390
going to talk more about all of that.

10
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.500
One of my rituals is hanging and I should say not really that it's a maintenance

11
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:52.310
and performance program.
I hang not just in the morning potentially,

12
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:55.370
but particularly after a day of bearing weight,

13
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.480
whether that includes weight training and Jersey Gregorich world record holder

14
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:04.070
insists on this type of inversion therapy after training or just wearing heavy

15
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:08.810
backpack around a few minutes goes a long way towards better sleep.

16
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:12.050
In my case,
less back pain,
neck pain,
leg pain.

17
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.430
It's not a panacea obviously,
but inversion therapy,

18
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:19.570
which uses gravity in your own body weight to decompress the spinal relief

19
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.580
pressure on the discs and surrounding nerves seems to help with a whole slew of

20
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.190
conditions.
And just as a general maintenance program,

21
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:32.810
it's one of my favorite things to do.
So what to say about that teeter?

22
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:37.130
Why teeter teeter is the best known name in inversion table since 1981 more than

23
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:41.090
3 million people have put their trust and teeter tutor is also the only

24
00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:45.080
inversion table brand that has been both safety certified by underwriters

25
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:48.230
laboratories.
That's Ul for you people in that industry,

26
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:53.000
you will recognize it and registered with the FDA as a class one medical device

27
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.840
and they're giving a very special offer just to you guys,

28
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:00.170
my listeners for a limited time that you can get the teeter inversion table with

29
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:01.130
bonus accessories,

30
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.110
which I have a bunch of again in the room next to me and a free pair of gravity

31
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:09.560
boots so that you can invert at home or take the boots with you to the gym.

32
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:10.640
So these gravity boots,

33
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.030
I have three separate pairs of gravity boots bought with my own monies in three

34
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:18.590
different cities that I've had for a very,

35
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:20.930
very long time because I don't want to travel with them necessarily.

36
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.960
They look kind of like ski boots,
but without the foot portion,

37
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.680
and they hook you upside down so you can take them really anywhere you want to

38
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:29.180
go to get this deal,

39
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.070
which is a savings of over $148 it's very specific,

40
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.220
so maybe it's 149 you have to go to teeter.com forward slash Tim,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.710
So if you're thinking yourself,
what the hell is this thing he's talking about?

47
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.800
I can't even envision it in my head.
Well,
take a look at the photos.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.240
this episode is brought to you by helix sleep.

50
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.070
Last year I committed to making sleep a top priority,

51
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.260
trying to fix onset insomnia or continuing to fix that depth of sleep,

52
00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:26.270
quality of sleep.
I tracked a lot.

53
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:31.271
I tested a lot and I revisited really everything from the daily routine to the

54
00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:34.790
surfaces.
I slept on playing with the chilly pad,
whatever,

55
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.910
and when I moved to Austin I got all new beds including mattresses from Helix,

56
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.670
working with the world's leading sleep experts.
Certainly some of them.

57
00:03:43.671 --> 00:03:47.570
He looks sleep developed mattresses personalized to your preferences and sleep

58
00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:51.920
style to make sure that you can have the best sleep possible without costing

59
00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:53.630
thousands upon thousands of dollars.

60
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.890
He looks sleep has recently added a new layer to customize sleep with the helix

61
00:03:57.891 --> 00:03:58.670
pillow.

62
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.150
The all new pillows are fully adjustable so you can achieve perfect comfort

63
00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:06.080
regardless of sleep position or body type or if you're a shifty type like me,

64
00:04:06.081 --> 00:04:07.610
I move around quite a bit when I sleep.

65
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.020
Just take their simple two to three minute sleep quiz to get started and that

66
00:04:12.021 --> 00:04:16.400
will help ensure that they can build a mattress or pillow that you will love the

67
00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:17.120
mattress,

68
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.680
whatever this be spoke mattresses that you arrive at a we'll get to you within a

69
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.240
week and the shipping is completely free.

70
00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:26.720
You can try the mattress for 100 nights and if you're not completely happy

71
00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:28.640
they'll pick it up and offer a full refund.

72
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.840
I tested that refund policy because I test all of the sponsors and kick the

73
00:04:32.841 --> 00:04:33.411
tires a lot.

74
00:04:33.411 --> 00:04:37.880
We tested it and they came through and making sure that we got ultimately the

75
00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:42.260
right mattress for my body.

Hello,
boys and girls,
ladies and germs.

81
00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:07.490
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to a very special episode of the Tim Ferriss

82
00:05:07.491 --> 00:05:09.650
show.
I'm going to start this off with a quote,

83
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.510
quote with the telescope was for astronomy and the microscope for biology.

84
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.310
Psychedelics will be for the understanding of the human mind that is tributed to

85
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.120
Stanislav Grof.
This episode you're going to hear,

86
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.270
I've been looking forward to recording for more than a year now.

87
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.170
It might be the most important episode that I've put out in the last two to

88
00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:33.380
three years,
so please trust me and give it a full listen.

89
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.620
Even if you don't think it will interest you at all,
it will surprise you,

90
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.610
perhaps shock you and definitely make you think differently.

91
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.950
Michael Pollan's newest book,

92
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.330
and this is his first podcast about it is my new favorite of his.

93
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.360
It is titled how to Change Your Mind.
Subtitle,

94
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:53.840
what the new science of psychedelics teaches us about consciousness,
dying,

95
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.120
addiction,
depression,
and transcendence.

96
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.050
This is an episode that we'll explore not just the science and applications of

97
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:05.300
Psychedelics,
but also Michael's personal exploration.

98
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.010
It's quite a wild ride for those who don't know who Michael Pollan is on Twitter

99
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:11.240
at Michael Paulin,

100
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.310
he's the author of seven previous books including cooked food rules in defense

101
00:06:15.311 --> 00:06:17.480
of food,
the Omnivore's dilemma.

102
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:22.340
Also a great book and the botany of desire.
Also a fantastic book,

103
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:24.380
all of which were New York Times bestsellers,

104
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:27.440
a long time contributor to the New York Times magazine.

105
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:31.040
He also teaches writing at Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley,

106
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.280
where he is the John S and James L.
Knight,

107
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.370
professor of Science Journalism in 2010 time magazine named him one of the 100

108
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:42.080
most influential people in the world.

109
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.770
This is also where I want to make a public announcement,

110
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:47.900
and that is partially due to Michael's book.

111
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.990
I am committing $1 million over the next few years to supporting scientific

112
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:54.620
study of psychedelic compounds.

113
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.830
This is for me by far the largest commitment to research and nonprofits that

114
00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:00.664
I've ever made,

115
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.720
and if you'd like to perhaps join me in supporting at a higher level,

116
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.430
check out Tim dot.
Blog Ford.
Slash.
Science.
It's Tim dot.
Blog forward slash.

117
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.970
Science,
but why would I do this across the board?

118
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.980
I've done a number of things in the scientific realm and the molecules discussed

119
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.360
in this episode and some incredible clinical results from well designed studies

120
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:26.710
have absolutely captured my attention over the last two years and after waiting

121
00:07:26.711 --> 00:07:29.950
in and supporting some smaller studies,
seeing the results,

122
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:33.640
I've decided to go all in on scientists exploring this area.

123
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:37.990
It just seems to be an Archimedes lever for potentially solving a wide range of

124
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:42.340
root cause problems.
Instead of playing whack a mole with symptoms one by one.

125
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.090
So this episode will explain why I'm so goddamn excited and all that preamble

126
00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:53.170
out of the way.
Grab a cup of coffee,
relax,
put your seat back,
settle in.

127
00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:57.010
And I really hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I did.

128
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.100
Without further ado,
here is Michael Pollan.

129
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.420
Michael,
welcome to the show.
Thank you Tim.
Good to be here.

130
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.370
I am so thrilled to be sitting down to have this conversation.

131
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.400
And I thought back to when we first met and I believe I owe some thanks to Matt

132
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.430
Mullenweg,
the CEO of Automattic,

133
00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:25.431
because I believe that I attended an event he had organized that might have been

134
00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:32.070
for the Omnivore's dilemma.
I think it was perhaps,
uh,
in defense of food.

135
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.080
But I've,

136
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:38.230
I've followed your career for so long and read so many of your books.

137
00:08:38.281 --> 00:08:43.281
I thought one place we could start is with the conception of Michael Pollan as

138
00:08:45.631 --> 00:08:50.250
food writer and
a common misconception.

139
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.750
Perhaps we could start off with you just how the

140
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.240
<v 3>new book came to be.
How did you end up writing this new book?</v>

141
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.480
Sure.
Well to go back,
I think we met at a benefit for grist.
Oh,
that's right.

142
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.180
That is right.
That was also involved.

143
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.870
And that was around the time of independence of food or food rules or something.

144
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:16.800
Yeah.
At a Tony Conrad's house.
That's right.

145
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.090
That's absolutely right.
Back a few years.
Yeah.

146
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.840
But I think that was the first time we met.
Um,
so yeah,

147
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:26.730
this book does certainly seem like a departure for me.
And in some ways it is.

148
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.170
Um,
but in other ways I see it as very continuous with the kind of work I've been

149
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:35.910
doing.
As I see it.
I think of myself as a,

150
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:37.560
as a kind of nature writer.

151
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.790
I really like writing about the engagement of humans with other species.

152
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.220
And I've been doing that since my first book,

153
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.290
which was a book called second nature,

154
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:49.600
which was really about what was going on in my garden.
Um,

155
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.180
and I always been interested in the fact that we have these symbiotic

156
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:59.160
relationships that were active participants in nature,
not just spectators.

157
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.560
Uh,
and then we have,
um,
uh,
and that the,
the,

158
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.980
the usual American way of thinking about nature that we inherit from Thoreau and

159
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:12.210
Emerson and John Muir is of a very passive relationship.
And I've always,

160
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:16.170
as a gardener,
I've always been interested in the more active relationship,

161
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:19.950
the way we use plants and the way they in turn use us.
Um,

162
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.760
so if that's the kind of spine or the,
the trunk of my work,

163
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:28.680
all the food work is kind of a big fat branch off of that.
Um,

164
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.910
and that's,
you know,

165
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:33.900
looking at what is one of our most powerful engagements with the natural world,

166
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.120
uh,
which is agriculture,
uh,
which,
you know,

167
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:39.510
changes nature more than anything else we do.
Really.
Um,

168
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:43.800
so I've been on that branch for now for books,
I guess,

169
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:44.851
and uh,

170
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:49.560
but I've never lost interest in the other ways we engage with the natural world.

171
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.780
And one of the most curious of these,
which I touched on in a,

172
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.790
in a book called Botany of desire,

173
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.120
was the fact that we use plants to change our experience of consciousness and a

174
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:06.530
very select group of plants and fungi has evolved,
uh,

175
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:11.460
the chemistry that does that with varying degrees of,
uh,
of,

176
00:11:11.461 --> 00:11:14.040
um,
disruption.
Um,

177
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.870
and I've always been curious as to why such a desire and it is a universal human

178
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:19.321
desire.

179
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:24.150
There is not a culture on earth that doesn't use some plant or fungi,

180
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.910
fungi to change consciousness with one notable exception,
the Inuit.

181
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.240
And the only reason they don't is none of that stuff grows there.
Um,

182
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.381
and uh,

183
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:38.790
so what's that desire about what good is it for us to change consciousness?

184
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.610
Why do,
why do people seek it?
So that's,
you know,

185
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:45.870
that's kind of been a theme of my work that I've never fully explored in a book

186
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.600
until this one,
until how to change your mind.

187
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.200
So there is that continuity in my mind,
uh,

188
00:11:52.201 --> 00:11:55.210
and it is part of a larger narrative that I've always been interested in.

189
00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:00.070
And then there's the fact that I'm intensely interested in health.
Uh,

190
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:04.750
I've been writing about health,
uh,
in my last couple of books on food.
Um,

191
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.020
you know,
we have a situation where,
uh,

192
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.700
our biggest physical health problems or chronic diseases linked to our diet,

193
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.630
um,
but we also of course suffer from,
um,

194
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.520
a real crisis and mental health.

195
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.380
And that also made me very interested to take a look at psychedelics,
uh,

196
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.250
since they promise,
uh,
to,
uh,
to contribute to solving that problem.

197
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:32.140
<v 1>Did,
did,
did that interest in exploring psychedelics?</v>

198
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.170
This is going to be very,
uh,

199
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.930
the mental like conversation chronologically.

200
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:39.340
We'll probably bounce around quite a bit.

201
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.740
Did that begin with the article about psychedelic psychotherapy in the New

202
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.800
Yorker called the trip treatment?
Did it proceed that,
how did,

203
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.300
how did that piece yeah,
cop come about.

204
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.520
<v 3>That was my first real foray.</v>

205
00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:58.690
I think I talked about psychedelics briefly in botany of desire and quoted

206
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:02.350
Aldous Huxley and the idea of the reducing valve and,
um,

207
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.180
whether we had a more accurate or less accurate picture of the world when,
uh,

208
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:12.010
when high.
Um,
but yeah,
my spirit,
my first serious forward foray was,

209
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.370
uh,
I had heard this remarkable,
uh,

210
00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:19.420
about this remarkable research using psychedelics silicide been in particular

211
00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:24.130
magic mushrooms or the ingredient in magic mushrooms to treat people,
uh,

212
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.230
who had cancer diagnoses.
And this seems so improbable to me.

213
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:34.660
I couldn't imagine wanting to take a sec Adeleke when confronting my mortality,

214
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.330
um,
that I became very curious to explore it.
Um,

215
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.660
and so embarked on what was almost a year long project,
uh,
looking at,
uh,

216
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.850
silicide siliciden and talking to dozens of people,

217
00:13:48.851 --> 00:13:52.090
cancer patients,
some of them still alive,
some of them no longer alive.

218
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.210
And how this single experience,

219
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:59.770
a high dose psilocybin experience administered,
uh,
with a guide,

220
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.551
um,
you know,

221
00:14:00.551 --> 00:14:05.551
in a very controlled setting had completely reset their thinking about

222
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:10.240
mortality,
had given them a mystical experience that,
uh,

223
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:15.260
dissolve their egos and made them think about their place in the world in such a

224
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:21.481
novel way or their sense of their own self interest as so broad that dying,

225
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.160
uh,
lost its sting.
Uh,
and,
uh,
completely in some cases.

226
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:31.930
I remember this one woman I talked to,
uh,
who had,
um,

227
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.340
uh,
her name was a dyna bizarre.

228
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:41.770
She was a figure skating instructor in New York City and she was in her early

229
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:41.771
sixties,

230
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:46.771
and she had ovarian cancer and she was absolutely paralyzed by the fear of a

231
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:50.050
recurrence.
Uh,
even though she,
you know,

232
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.260
had a successful course of therapy and she,

233
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.320
she had a suicide in a journey.
And,
uh,

234
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.400
she went into her body and under her rib cage,

235
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.590
she confronted this black mass.
It wasn't her tumor because it wasn't in her,

236
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:10.940
uh,
you know,
were her ovaries would be.
It was,
uh,
under her rib cage.

237
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:15.380
And she realized it wasn't her tumor.
It was a fear.
And she screamed at it.

238
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:19.640
She said,
get the fuck out of my body.
And she said,
advantaged.

239
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.970
And from then on she had no fear.

240
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.920
And in the article for the New Yorker,

241
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:28.460
I w I did the usual play it safe journalist thing where I said,

242
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:29.480
and after the experience,

243
00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:32.570
her fear had been substantially diminished or something that I thought would

244
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:32.870
slip,

245
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.110
<v 1>pass the fact checkers.
And</v>

246
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.610
<v 3>as we tend to do,
and uh,
they called her though in check the quote with her and,</v>

247
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.660
uh,
and she said,
no,
that's completely wrong.
It was not diminished.

248
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.550
My fear was eliminated.

249
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.470
And what she explained is I learned during that psilocybin trip that though I

250
00:15:50.471 --> 00:15:54.490
couldn't control the cancer,
I could control the fear.

251
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.970
And that was just life changing for her.
Um,

252
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.530
so reading about these experiences,
um,
which seem,

253
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.430
you know,
too good to be true,
almost,
uh,
almost implausible.

254
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.720
I became more and more interested in going deeper.
You know,

255
00:16:10.721 --> 00:16:13.990
as a journalist there,
there are two kinds of articles we write there.

256
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.410
They're the ones where we exhausted the subject and we're so sick of it,

257
00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:22.090
we can't wait to move on.
And then they're the ones where we realize,
you know,

258
00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:26.200
I've only scratched the surface here and this was one of those I had only

259
00:16:26.201 --> 00:16:28.480
scratch the surface.
There was so much more to learn.

260
00:16:28.481 --> 00:16:32.980
And then there was also this mounting curiosity to have some experiences in my

261
00:16:32.981 --> 00:16:33.814
own.

262
00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.700
<v 1>We're definitely going to,
uh,</v>

263
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.810
explore that terrain.

264
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.960
I thought a one very helpful aspect of the book is the glossary of terms that

265
00:16:47.611 --> 00:16:48.690
you include in the beginning.

266
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.490
And it's actually in the end of the printed version.
Oh,
it is.
All right.

267
00:16:53.491 --> 00:16:56.580
So I received a free prepublication copy

268
00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.540
<v 3>into the back.
It just felt a little text booky to confront it first.</v>

269
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.130
<v 1>It is very textbooky,
but it,</v>

270
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.600
it helps provide people with whether at the back of the book,
at the beginning,

271
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.700
uh,
definitions that I think can,
can help to inform the conversation.

272
00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:13.720
So for people who are,

273
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.350
who have heard the term no doubt psychedelic or psychedelics

274
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:23.470
but are unclear on exactly what that refers to,
can you,
could you define that?

275
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.910
What are psychedelics?

276
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:28.180
<v 3>Sure.
I'd be happy to.
I'd be happy to try.
You know,</v>

277
00:17:28.181 --> 00:17:32.110
one of the interesting aspects of the story of the history of what we'll call

278
00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:33.640
psychedelics,
uh,

279
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:38.350
for reasons I'll explain is that the name kept changing because people really

280
00:17:38.351 --> 00:17:42.370
didn't understand these molecules.
They were so strange.
Uh,

281
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:47.020
so at first they were called psychometrics.
Uh,
this is in the early fifties,

282
00:17:47.021 --> 00:17:52.021
soon after LSD was made available to researchers and a psychotomimetic,

283
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.670
basically men,
it was a psychoactive drug that mimics psychosis.

284
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:00.180
And lots of psychiatrists would look at the,
what happened to people and say,

285
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:03.210
well,
they're having a psychotic episode turned out to be wrong,

286
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:06.900
but it sure looked that way.
And,
um,
and then they,

287
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.890
then other people call it a psycholytic,
uh,
which means mind loosening.

288
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.530
And they were using it in a,

289
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.590
basically in your typical talk therapy session,
uh,

290
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.420
as a way to loosen a lytic means mine loosening,
uh,

291
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.520
people's defenses and allow them to get in touch with subconscious,
uh,

292
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.570
thoughts and emotions.

293
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.900
Psychedelic as a term is coined in 1957,

294
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.920
uh,
by,
uh,
a key figure in this history named Humphry Osmond.

295
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.990
Osmond is an English psychiatrist who moves to Saskatchewan because the

296
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:46.770
provincial government was willing to let him study whatever he wanted,

297
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:49.410
which happened to be a Mescalin and LSD.

298
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.120
And they had a very progressive health department in Saskatchewan.
And,
um,

299
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.840
he w he got involved with Aldous Huxley and in fact,

300
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.850
is the person responsible for giving Aldous Huxley his first Mescalin

301
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:07.110
experience.
Uh,
and they corresponded extensively as people use to do.

302
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.480
And in one of their correspondence,
they were,

303
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:14.130
they were trying to come up with a better word for these drugs because they

304
00:19:14.131 --> 00:19:17.070
simply didn't believe it was true that it made people crazy.
In fact,

305
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:19.320
they believed they could make people saying,

306
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.180
so they went back and forth and Osmund ironically enough,

307
00:19:24.181 --> 00:19:28.140
not the brilliant writer came up with the term that stuck and that was

308
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:28.980
psychedelic.

309
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.240
And that essentially all that means is mind manifesting.

310
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.580
That these are compounds that help the mind manifest its its deepest,

311
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.350
uh,
qualities and uh,
it caught on.
And,

312
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:48.300
um,
we think of it as a very kind of sixties terms associated with Timothy leary

313
00:19:48.301 --> 00:19:49.820
and,
and the counterculture,

314
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.880
but in fact it was coined by a psychiatrist in the 50s.
Um,

315
00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:58.470
so it's simply means mine manifesting and I use it to refer to what are

316
00:19:58.471 --> 00:20:02.190
sometimes called the classical psychedelics.
Um,

317
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.930
I tend not to think of Mgma as a secondary,
even though some people do or,

318
00:20:06.931 --> 00:20:08.620
or cannabis as a secondary tick,

319
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.380
but that group of chemicals that include Mescalin Dmt,

320
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:17.410
uh,
silicide been magic mushrooms and Lsd and there,

321
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.080
and there's a handful of others that are unified by the fact that they work on

322
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.200
similar receptor network in the brain and have roughly similar effects on the

323
00:20:28.051 --> 00:20:31.290
mind on,
you know,
on the phenomenology of the experience.

324
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.910
So that's really when I talk about psychedelics,
that's what I've gotten.

325
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:38.930
Mine and the by phenomenology you mean the subjective reporting of this

326
00:20:39.111 --> 00:20:41.820
subjective experience that felt experience?
Yeah,

327
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.340
it's a very fancy word for how it feels.

328
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.640
<v 1>Why did you dedicate this book to your father?</v>

329
00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:57.900
<v 3>Ah,
well,
um,
for a couple reasons.</v>

330
00:20:57.901 --> 00:21:01.900
Some of which I didn't understand till I finished the book.
Um,

331
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.990
I did it because my dad was very sick for most of the time I was writing it.

332
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.120
He,
he himself had terminal cancer and died of lung cancer and uh,

333
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:15.180
earlier this year in January.
Um,
so I wanted,

334
00:21:15.181 --> 00:21:18.480
it was my last chance to dedicate a book to him or at least one that he would

335
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.860
see.
He didn't get to read it.
Um,
so I thought I would do it,
but

336
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.060
as I've thought about it since I realized this book is,

337
00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:31.110
you know very much about him,
uh,
a friend of mine read the book and said,
wow,

338
00:21:31.111 --> 00:21:36.090
your father is on every page.
And I didn't know what that meant exactly,

339
00:21:36.091 --> 00:21:40.740
but I've since given it some thought and I realized that one of the reasons I

340
00:21:40.741 --> 00:21:45.030
got so interested in the experience of cancer and,
and,
and that,

341
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:50.090
that confrontation with one's mortality is that my dad was going through that.

342
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.030
But unlike the patients I was talking to,

343
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.000
the volunteers and the suicide and experience,

344
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.920
he really didn't want to talk about it.

345
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.070
And it was just a conversation we couldn't have.

346
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.120
And we had a lot of conversations in his last year or two.
Um,

347
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:11.030
but for whatever reason,
I don't really understand how he was processing a,

348
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:15.930
what was coming because he really wouldn't share it.
And so in a sense,

349
00:22:15.931 --> 00:22:19.350
I was,
I was having conversations I wanted to have with him,

350
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.630
although I was certainly afraid to,
in some ways,

351
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.090
I was having those conversations with these other people,
these,

352
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.830
these strangers who I got to know,
uh,
and,

353
00:22:27.831 --> 00:22:32.580
and hearing how they thought about their death and how silicide been changed,

354
00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:37.380
how they thought about their death really became a proxy for a conversation I

355
00:22:37.381 --> 00:22:38.520
never had with my father.

356
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:45.290
<v 1>What effect did that have on you?
I mean,
if,
if,
if anything jumps out,
I mean,</v>

357
00:22:45.291 --> 00:22:49.450
is there any salient effects that had on you?
Did you,
did you,

358
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.960
did you end up feeling a sense of closure or resolution in some way?

359
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.310
<v 3>Uh,
you know,</v>

360
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.620
in a way I wish my father had been able to have one of these experiences.

361
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:05.500
I don't know that he would have gone for it.
Um,
you know,

362
00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:08.920
he's such a different generation.
He was probably too old to qualify.

363
00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:13.810
He was 88 when he died.
Um,
but it's kind of a black box.

364
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.280
Uh,
you know,
that was a generation,
didn't always talk about these things.
And,
um,

365
00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:19.773
uh,

366
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.840
I do think it had an effect on me in that having given so much thought to death

367
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:32.830
and the process and the afterlife as psychedelics makes you do.

368
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.293
Um,

369
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.600
I think in his last weeks and months and days I was more available to him than I

370
00:23:41.861 --> 00:23:44.320
would have been.
Um,
you know,

371
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.150
I think that I was not,
um,

372
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.920
as fearful or as defensive is probably a better word.
You know,

373
00:23:51.921 --> 00:23:56.270
one of the things our egos defended us against his death.
One of the big things.

374
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.430
And so when we're confronted by it,

375
00:23:58.431 --> 00:24:00.950
we figure out a million ways to think about something else or,

376
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.850
or turn away if we can.
But I was very present for his death.

377
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.000
I was with him and my mother in the apartment for the last week.

378
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.300
And I didn't feel there was any barrier.

379
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:16.301
I felt like I was able to say everything I needed to say to be physically

380
00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:20.720
available to him.
Um,
so in a sense,
I think my own,

381
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.560
my own psychedelic experiences in the amount of thought I'd give it to,

382
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.940
to dying,
uh,
because of that article I'd worked on,
um,

383
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.380
probably made me a,

384
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:34.870
a better caregiver in some ways and better able to process,
uh,

385
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.420
what was happening.
And,
and you know,
I guess I did a lot of preparation to,

386
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:43.370
cause I saw it coming for a couple of years.
Um,
uh,
that takes,

387
00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:46.370
you know,
that takes away none of the power of the experience.
Um,

388
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.650
but I do think if,
you know,
it's funny,
uh,
some,

389
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.640
some journalists just started doing interviews on this book and one of the

390
00:24:52.641 --> 00:24:56.000
questions you get asked is how did your own experiences change you?

391
00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:00.020
And that's a hard question to answer.
It's,
it's subtle in some ways,

392
00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:04.130
but it was my wife who said,
well,
uh,
I really think you would've,

393
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.700
you would've been different around your father at the end if you hadn't had

394
00:25:07.701 --> 00:25:10.400
those experiences.
And you know,
I think she's probably right

395
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:18.080
<v 1>based on all of my reading of your work based on,</v>

396
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.350
uh,
the,

397
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:24.350
the conversations I've observed you having a and our limited exchanges that

398
00:25:24.691 --> 00:25:29.160
we've had,
you've always struck me as a very open minded,
uh,

399
00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.430
journalist while very skeptical,

400
00:25:32.431 --> 00:25:36.690
which is a good combination for the profession you've chosen.

401
00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:42.020
What were you most skeptical of going into the process of saying,

402
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.910
considering a book on this topic?

403
00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:49.080
And did you go in with the intention of having your own experiences?

404
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:55.210
<v 3>I didn't go in with that intention when I started the New Yorker article.
Um,</v>

405
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.970
I didn't know it was possible to have.

406
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.570
Obviously you can have a psychedelic experience if you can find the drugs.

407
00:26:01.571 --> 00:26:05.770
But I mean to have the sort of orchestrated guided experience,

408
00:26:05.771 --> 00:26:09.790
which I think is if people need to understand is a fundamentally different way

409
00:26:09.791 --> 00:26:13.990
of using the same chemical,
but the,
the experience is like very different.

410
00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.020
Um,
and uh,

411
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.920
it was actually in the course of working on that article that I kept getting

412
00:26:20.921 --> 00:26:25.450
like these whispers that there was this underground and uh,
that,

413
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:30.130
you know,
there was a kind of shadow world and not too far away from the,

414
00:26:30.131 --> 00:26:35.050
um,
the,
you know,
the legit researchers.
I was,
I was interviewing and,

415
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.880
um,
so I,
I started getting inklings that that might be possible.
Um,

416
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.940
but I,
I'm not,
uh,
um,
I'm not a psychonaut.

417
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.240
Uh,
and I was not,
uh,

418
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.450
I had very little experience.
I mean,
it was kind of odd.

419
00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:53.010
I just kind of came of age,

420
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.190
a little wrinkle in time where there weren't a lot of psychedelics around.

421
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.150
And by the time they were available to me,
I was,
I was terrified to them.

422
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.200
I'm sort of more a product of the moral panic against psychedelics.

423
00:27:04.201 --> 00:27:07.620
Then of the psychedelic sixties.
I mean,
just to give me an idea,

424
00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:12.450
I was 12 during the summer of love.
I was 14 during a Woodstock.

425
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.600
So this,
I was a little,
you know,
uh,

426
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:20.100
I came a little late to the party and the party was getting pretty sour already.

427
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:25.100
Um,
you know,
the scene in San Francisco had gotten really sour and,
uh,

428
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:30.110
there was a lot of bad information but scary information about psychedelics that

429
00:27:30.241 --> 00:27:33.900
were out there.
So this wasn't a natural thing for me.
And you know,

430
00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:37.650
what you call my skepticism is journalistic skepticism,
but it's also,
you know,

431
00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:42.240
Plano fear and,
and you know,
wondering,

432
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:47.190
is this for real?
Um,
I did have skepticism.

433
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.470
I think that the results of these studies,

434
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.310
which hadn't been published when I published on them,
it was quite,

435
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.900
it was very much to the New Yorkers credit.

436
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:59.930
They were willing to let me do 14,000 words on essentially a scientific research

437
00:28:01.141 --> 00:28:04.920
that hadn't been peer reviewed yet.
Um,
and,
uh,

438
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.730
but I gradually became convinced by the,
you know,

439
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:12.750
the authority of the people who were talking to me that they had,
had,
had,

440
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:17.610
had these transformative experiences.
Um,
I tend to,

441
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.090
uh,

442
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:22.770
but I do write about psychedelics and I think that's,

443
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.810
this is somewhat unique about the book with one foot outside of this world and

444
00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:30.030
only one foot in it.
Um,

445
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.680
and I think that that distance is very important,
um,

446
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:35.730
for various reasons.

447
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.390
I think it's important to remain critical as a journalist and when you see

448
00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:42.900
things that are being hyped,
um,
and you know,

449
00:28:42.901 --> 00:28:47.770
that that may well happen with psychedelics.
Um,
uh,
it's something I,
I,

450
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.280
I'm concerned about.
Um,

451
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:55.550
but also as a way in for readers who may not be experienced or may have their

452
00:28:55.831 --> 00:28:57.740
own doubts or fears.
Um,

453
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.730
I become a surrogate for the reluctant a traveler.
And,
um,

454
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.610
and that's,
you know,
that's always been part of my work.
I,
I,

455
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.800
I don't like to write as an expert.
Um,

456
00:29:07.801 --> 00:29:10.020
another reason I sort of moved off of food,

457
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:15.260
at least for the time being is I really like writing closer to the beginning of

458
00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:19.950
the learning curve.
Um,
when everything is still new and exciting and I,

459
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:22.020
and I can bring a sense of wonder to it.

460
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:27.410
I don't think readers really like being lectured at by a highly experienced

461
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.020
experts.
Um,

462
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.210
I think they'd rather come on a journey of a or an education with you.

463
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.920
And so I was outside this world and dipping my toe in,
you know,

464
00:29:37.921 --> 00:29:42.220
first kind of very tentatively and then,
you know,

465
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.650
<v 4>kind of my whole foot,
uh,</v>

466
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:48.910
and then much larger part of my body.
Um,

467
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.900
but it wasn't a natural progression for me and it wasn't an easy progression.

468
00:29:52.901 --> 00:29:56.630
I mean,
we'll talk about this,
but my,
you know,

469
00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.490
each of my own psychedelic journeys,
um,

470
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.520
that I had for the book were preceded by a sleepless night of incredible anxiety

471
00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:12.760
where I was just a ping pong ball with arguments going back and forth.

472
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:15.820
Like,
are you crazy?
You know,
you're 60 years old,

473
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.400
you could have a heart attack up there on that mountain.

474
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:20.860
And this guy is not going to call nine one one.
He's,

475
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:25.240
he's worried about his freedom.
Um,
and,
and then the other side saying,

476
00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:27.810
well come on,
aren't you curious about what you might learn?
And,

477
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.090
and by the way you've got a book deadline coming up,
you've got to do this.

478
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:36.160
And so I had every,
every time it was like that,

479
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:39.610
it never got easier.
Um,
and uh,
you know,

480
00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:44.611
I realize now that was my ego defending itself against the assault to come.

481
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.930
And of course our egos have command of our rational faculties so they make

482
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:54.640
really good arguments and mine was definitely making a good argument to me,

483
00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:56.470
but thank God I ignored him.

484
00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:02.610
<v 1>Could you talk a bit about what we know or suspect about the neuroscience behind</v>

485
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:10.120
how these compounds may have the effects they have?

486
00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:13.780
And just as please jump into,
correct me at any point cause you,

487
00:31:13.781 --> 00:31:17.020
you are certainly better versed with,
with all of this,

488
00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:20.740
but when you mentioned for people who,
who don't have the background,

489
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:25.741
when you mentioned guided experiences or supervised environments and the New

490
00:31:27.341 --> 00:31:28.174
Yorker piece,

491
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.620
I'll just give a little bit of background for people who may not be aware that

492
00:31:32.621 --> 00:31:37.600
that includes certainly underground options,
but also includes,
uh,

493
00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.440
universities like Johns Hopkins,
Nyu,
Nyu,

494
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.910
and ever expanding list and,
uh,
some very,

495
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.630
very credible researchers.
Uh,

496
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:53.620
certainly some who,
who would be considered the researchers,

497
00:31:53.621 --> 00:31:58.270
researcher and scientist.
Uh,
what do we know of the science?

498
00:31:58.271 --> 00:31:58.811
Because these,

499
00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:03.400
these compounds have been so mysterious in a sense.

500
00:32:03.401 --> 00:32:07.600
They've been so continually used for certainly centuries,

501
00:32:07.601 --> 00:32:11.980
if not millennia by different civilizations.

502
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.510
Uh,

503
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.990
you can find totems from the mass attacks going back thousands of years and so

504
00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:19.150
on.
What,
what,

505
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.830
what new insights or theories have,
uh,

506
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:27.010
have caught your attention in the,
the scientific realm?

507
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:31.580
<v 4>Well,
the neuroscience I just have to say is absolutely fascinating.</v>

508
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:33.110
And for me intellectually,

509
00:32:33.111 --> 00:32:36.710
that was kind of one of the most exciting parts of the research was,

510
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.580
was learning what were,
what these chemicals

511
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.630
<v 3>are teaching us about the mind and the brain.
Uh,
you know,</v>

512
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:48.950
there's a famous quote by Stanislav Grof who was a,
um,

513
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.420
a check emigre psychiatrist who worked with psychedelics extensively when there

514
00:32:53.421 --> 00:32:57.740
were legal in his practice.
And he said,
I think this is in the early seventies.

515
00:32:57.741 --> 00:33:01.430
He said something that,
you know,
sounds outrageous.
Uh,

516
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:05.300
which is that psychedelics would be for the study of the mind,

517
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:10.330
what the telescope was for astronomy and what the microscope was for biology.

518
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:15.260
That's a pretty big claim.
And,
um,
uh,

519
00:33:15.261 --> 00:33:18.230
and it sounded like hyperbole to me when I first heard it,

520
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:23.120
but having spent a lot of time in these labs with these scientists,

521
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.750
I no longer think it's impossible that he's right.

522
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:31.820
He may well be right.
Um,
but that said,
you know,

523
00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:36.620
the brain is still very poorly understood consciousness even more poorly

524
00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:37.311
understood.

525
00:33:37.311 --> 00:33:42.230
So it's important to understand that everything I'm about to tell you is,
um,

526
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.080
uh,
you know,
hypothesis.
Um,

527
00:33:47.081 --> 00:33:49.220
and some goes a little further than a hypothesis,

528
00:33:49.221 --> 00:33:54.140
but there's still a lot of mysteries.
The first one being how does,
let's say,

529
00:33:54.141 --> 00:33:54.470
you,

530
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:59.470
you ingest LSD or psilocybin and we know that it links to a certain kind of,

531
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.750
uh,
brain receptor,
the,
uh,
the,
uh,

532
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.470
h two five a or a receptor,

533
00:34:06.471 --> 00:34:11.180
which is the same one that's that a SSRI engage with.
And that sounds like,
oh,

534
00:34:11.181 --> 00:34:14.870
we really understand something,
but,
but what happens downstream of that?

535
00:34:14.871 --> 00:34:17.570
We don't have a clue how you get from that activity,

536
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:22.540
activation of those receptors to the phenomenology,
the felt experience of,
um,

537
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:26.810
of the drugs.
Um,
so there's,
there's a lot we don't understand,

538
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.350
but one of the most interesting clues,
uh,

539
00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.200
has come from the work done,

540
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:36.440
especially at imperial college in London.
Uh,

541
00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:41.330
but also it's now happening at other places in Switzerland and at Hopkins too,

542
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:46.250
to image the brains of people on psychedelics.
Um,
by image,

543
00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:50.570
I mean use Fmri or some of these other modalities,
um,

544
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:55.630
to see what's going on in the brain when people are under the influence.

545
00:34:56.330 --> 00:35:00.230
And the biggest takeaway from that work,
uh,

546
00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:02.900
and this is in papers that,
uh,
Robin Carhart,

547
00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:05.240
Harris and imperial college has published,

548
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:10.250
is that contrary to what the neuroscientist expected,

549
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.140
which was that the brain would kind of light up with extra activity,
uh,

550
00:35:15.141 --> 00:35:16.550
because there was such,
you know,

551
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.860
visual and auditory fireworks going on during the experience.
They found that,

552
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.000
um,
activity in the brain was actually depressed by psychedelics,

553
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.750
particularly in one network.

554
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.650
This was a network I had never heard of it before until I started doing this

555
00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:37.340
work.
And it was only discovered about 15 years ago by a neuroscientist,

556
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:41.670
American neuroscientist at Washington University named Marcus Raichle.

557
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:47.240
And that is the default mode network called that because this is kind of where

558
00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:51.810
the brain goes when it's not busy.
Um,
it's where you go to ruminate,

559
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.290
worry,
a daydream.
Um,

560
00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.240
and it was discovered when they were administering Fmr Ris,

561
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:04.650
uh,
to people and needed to get a baseline.
And they would tell people,

562
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.480
don't do anything.
Just lie there and don't,
you know,
no tasks.

563
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:11.700
And they would see that.
Oh,
interesting.

564
00:36:11.701 --> 00:36:14.010
The brain is actually quite active when you're doing nothing.

565
00:36:14.011 --> 00:36:15.810
And this part of it is very active.

566
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:21.290
This part is a linked set of structures that include the prefrontal Cortex,

567
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:28.140
the posterior cingulate cortex.
These are both in the Cortex,

568
00:36:28.141 --> 00:36:32.490
which is the evolutionarily most recent part of layer of the brain on the

569
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:34.920
outside.
Um,
and,

570
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.390
and then those link down into deeper older structures like,
uh,

571
00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:44.280
that are involved with memory,
uh,
and um,
emotions.
Um,

572
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.200
and it appears to be a very important hub.
Uh,

573
00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:52.710
the brain is a hierarchical system and the default mode network kind of is in

574
00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:56.950
charge,
uh,
is a regulator of the whole.
And um,

575
00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.230
it's involved in a range of metacognitive,
uh,
functions.
Uh,

576
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.640
that includes self reflection and rumination time travel.

577
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:10.110
That's thinking about the past and thinking about the future,
um,

578
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.400
theory of mind.
Uh,

579
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.190
that's the ability to imagine mental states or attribute mental states to
others.

580
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:22.350
Um,
and uh,
the what is called the autobiographical memory,

581
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:25.920
uh,
the autobiographical self.
Forgive me.
Um,

582
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:31.010
this is kind of where we integrate what's happening to us with the narrative we

583
00:37:31.951 --> 00:37:35.610
have of who we are.
Uh,
which is a mix of,
you know,

584
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.330
everything that's happened to us before are the parts of our biography we think

585
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:43.280
about and our objectives for the future.
And to have an a,

586
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:48.150
a sense of self that's consistent over time,
something we prize,

587
00:37:48.151 --> 00:37:51.540
even though it's probably completely illusory.
Um,

588
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:57.000
that work of constructing that happens in a part of the parts of the default

589
00:37:57.001 --> 00:37:57.834
mode network.

590
00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:02.400
So you could say it's kind of the seat of the self or the ego to the extent that

591
00:38:02.401 --> 00:38:04.530
we can say that.
And,
um,

592
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:09.210
and how interesting that this particular network important as it is,

593
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:14.040
gets,
goes offline or at least has activity diminished.

594
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.590
And,
and this is really interesting.

595
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:21.210
The more precipitous the drop in activity in the default mode network,

596
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:26.480
the more likely someone is liable to report that they experienced ego

597
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:29.690
dissolution,
that that,
uh,

598
00:38:29.691 --> 00:38:33.000
experience that's common on a high dose of psychedelics.

599
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:38.120
That can either be terrifying or absolutely ecstatic of having your sense of

600
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:42.070
self disappear or melt or dissolve.

601
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:47.290
And which is then followed by this merging with,
um,
you know,
the larger world,

602
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:52.240
the nature of the universe,
other people.
And,
um,
uh,

603
00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:55.580
so that seems to be involved with the,
you know,

604
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.570
dimunition of activity in this,
in this particular network.

605
00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:03.930
So that gives us a window into the self and into spiritual experience because

606
00:39:04.421 --> 00:39:09.340
that experience of ego dissolution feels to people like a mystical experience

607
00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:13.000
feels like a,
it's very spiritual.
This sense of,

608
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:17.060
you know,
transcending this bag of bones we are and,
and,

609
00:39:17.061 --> 00:39:20.590
and actually connect with,
with larger entities.

610
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.730
And it's that experience to that,
um,

611
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.500
may make it easier to,
uh,

612
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:31.330
die in that ego dissolution is a kind of rehearsal for death.

613
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.840
Uh,
giving up yourself and then seeing,

614
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.140
and this was for me the most incredible thing was that,
uh,

615
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:43.600
your ego could die,
but you still perceive you're,

616
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:47.590
there's still a consciousness,
another consciousness.
And um,

617
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:52.120
and I think that that's enormously comforting to a,
to people.
So anyway,

618
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:54.100
from a neuroscientific point of view,

619
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:58.360
this is a really interesting insight and psychedelics gave it to us.

620
00:39:58.361 --> 00:40:00.040
There are two other things I want to say about it.
That's,

621
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.340
it's also even more interesting.
One is that when they,

622
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:08.670
when other researchers at Yale started scanning the brains of really experienced

623
00:40:08.771 --> 00:40:12.460
meditators,
you know,
people would 10,000 hours,
we really know how to,

624
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.890
how to meditate.
Um,

625
00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:20.320
their scans look very similar to the people on psychedelics on Siliciden,
uh,

626
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:20.831
that they,

627
00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:25.831
to that meditation is another way to quiet the default mode network.

628
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.710
And my guess is there's several others too.
My guess is it's quieted when you're,

629
00:40:29.711 --> 00:40:34.600
um,
uh,
you know,
when you fast,
uh,
s uh,
you know,

630
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:39.370
when you're on a vision quest,
when you go into sensory deprivation,
um,

631
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:44.490
my guess is that all these powerful experiences may well involve alternate

632
00:40:46.151 --> 00:40:50.050
modalities for shutting off,
requiring the default mode network.

633
00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:53.550
So that's a big takeaway,
uh,
and I think,
um,

634
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.060
will be significant in the future.

635
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.660
The other point I want to make about that and the neuroscience is that,

636
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:04.130
uh,
also coming out of Robin Carhart Harris,
his lab,
um,

637
00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:09.160
was they mapped,
uh,
connections.
They call it the connectome in the,

638
00:41:09.161 --> 00:41:10.390
in the human brain.

639
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:15.430
And that changes during the experience when you turn off the default mode

640
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:16.960
network,
which,
which,
uh,

641
00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:21.961
Robin refers to as the orchestra conductor or corporate executive or capital

642
00:41:22.331 --> 00:41:27.070
city of the brain.
He has all these wonderful metaphors when that goes offline,

643
00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.500
other parts of the brain and other networks that don't ordinarily talk to each

644
00:41:32.501 --> 00:41:36.290
other,
strike up conversations.
And if you look at this image,

645
00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:38.000
which is reprinted in my book,

646
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:40.250
actually they did it in color in the middle of the book.

647
00:41:40.251 --> 00:41:44.000
I didn't even know they could do this.
Uh,
toward the end of the book.
Um,

648
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:47.900
you see that what had been this,
this,
uh,

649
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.170
set of principle,
you know,
main thoroughfares,

650
00:41:51.171 --> 00:41:52.910
connecting different networks in the brain.

651
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.900
Suddenly you get lots of little roads,
uh,

652
00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.960
new connections.
Um,

653
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
myriad new connections get established basically because probably because the

654
00:42:04.191 --> 00:42:09.050
default mode network is not requiring everybody come through that hub.
And,
uh,

655
00:42:09.051 --> 00:42:10.700
so you have,
for example,

656
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:14.810
perhaps emotion centers talking directly to your visual Cortex,

657
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.760
which Lo and behold could allow you to see things you're,
you're feeling,
um,

658
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.410
you know,
could could result in lucid nations.
Those new connections May,

659
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:28.880
and now I'm being speculative,
may manifest as new perspectives,

660
00:42:28.881 --> 00:42:32.180
new ideas,
new means,
new metaphors.
Um,

661
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:35.330
but the point is that by temporarily,
you know,

662
00:42:35.331 --> 00:42:37.310
disrupting the order of the brain,

663
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:42.340
a new order forms and that order may have incredible value it at either the

664
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:47.450
level of mental health and psychology or at the level of creativity.
Um,

665
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.270
and that's what we need to get into right now.
What,

666
00:42:50.271 --> 00:42:54.410
what happens with those new connections?
Do they endure or not?
Uh,

667
00:42:54.411 --> 00:42:57.440
and are there ways to,
uh,
help them endure longer?

668
00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.990
<v 1>The visualization that you mentioned is so</v>

669
00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:08.710
the difference is so pronounced and uh,
it's really something to behold.

670
00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:13.711
So I certainly encourage people to just take a moment to soak the image in when

671
00:43:15.071 --> 00:43:16.000
they have a chance to look at it.

672
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.570
<v 3>And it's not hard to find online too.</v>

673
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:21.150
<v 1>It's not hard to find online.
And what I wanted to,
I mean,</v>

674
00:43:21.151 --> 00:43:24.550
certainly these compounds are not panaceas.

675
00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.370
They don't fix everything

676
00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:29.290
<v 3>and,
and they do have risks.
I mean,
I think we should talk,</v>

677
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:33.970
<v 1>oh,
we're absolutely going to talk about the risks up,
but before we get to that,</v>

678
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:39.030
I wanted to go back to the studies that have been done and to ask you what

679
00:43:41.531 --> 00:43:46.531
studies have most perhaps shocked you or surprise you or have stuck with you?

680
00:43:46.841 --> 00:43:50.530
And just for purposes of a supposed sharing on my side,

681
00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.810
the studies are really wide ranging and many studies had been performed in the,

682
00:43:55.811 --> 00:43:59.890
uh,
suppose,
well,
I'm not sure when the early fifties and early sixties,

683
00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.340
but,
uh,
the,

684
00:44:03.341 --> 00:44:08.140
even looking at the more recent studies related to smoking cessation or

685
00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:12.160
different forms of addiction,
certainly end of life anxiety,
uh,

686
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.690
treatment resistant depression,

687
00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:19.650
dear a number of characteristics that have been really surprising to me when

688
00:44:21.431 --> 00:44:25.170
looking at the results.
But I'd be curious to hear if there are any,
uh,

689
00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:29.410
related to the magnitude persistence or anything of effects that have been

690
00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:32.190
particularly memorable for you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

691
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:32.941
<v 4>Well,
I mean,</v>

692
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:36.630
the first one that was really memorable to me was the first one I read and this

693
00:44:36.631 --> 00:44:40.590
was a 2006 study by a done at Johns Hopkins.

694
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:45.190
In the lab of Roland Griffiths who I believe,
you know pretty well.
And,
um,

695
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:50.750
this was a kind of wild study because it didn't purport to have any practical

696
00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:53.220
utility at all.
It wasn't,
uh,

697
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.550
it had nothing to do with health or healing people.

698
00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.570
It was really an attempt to see if silicide been,

699
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:05.170
could be used to occasion.
That's the verb they use to occasion,
uh,

700
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.710
profound mystical experiences and people,

701
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.010
and the title of this paper is kind of hilarious.
You know,

702
00:45:11.011 --> 00:45:16.011
a high dose of Psilocybin can occasion profound mystical experiences in people

703
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.020
that are,
have you no lasting value or something like that.
Um,

704
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.810
I don't have it quite right,
but it's,
uh,
it,
it just stood out.

705
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:28.950
His weight scientists do this.
That's pretty cool.
Um,

706
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:33.970
and what's a mystical experience doing in a scientific experiment?
Um,
but it,

707
00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:38.670
in a way,
this was the predicate of all the research to come,
uh,
in this,
in this,

708
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:43.320
uh,
renaissance that's going on because,
um,
they had found,

709
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:47.280
first they had proven that you could safely administer these drugs in this

710
00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:51.240
environment,
and that with a very high percentage,

711
00:45:51.241 --> 00:45:56.241
you could induce this kind of experience that people would report as one of the

712
00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.013
three,

713
00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:03.050
a two or three most meaningful experiences in their lives,

714
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:09.420
comparable to the birth of a child or the death of a parent.
Um,

715
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:14.450
the fact that you could induce such an experience in a laboratory reliably with

716
00:46:14.611 --> 00:46:19.290
a mushroom,
uh,
well that,
that kind of blew my mind.
And,
and I talked,

717
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:22.430
I interviewed many people in that trial and,
uh,

718
00:46:22.431 --> 00:46:24.840
and it was really interesting to hear their experience.
These are,

719
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:29.280
these are so called healthy normals.
Um,
so they didn't have a pathology.

720
00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:34.260
They weren't dying.
Um,
and they were kind of spiritually inclined.

721
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:37.110
Uh,
it was definitely,
um,
you know,

722
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:41.460
it seemed to me a common denominator of the people,
the volunteers,
um,
but that,

723
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:46.790
that this drug would create an experience that was indistinguishable from

724
00:46:48.001 --> 00:46:52.410
mystical experiences as we have them in the literature as they were recorded by

725
00:46:52.411 --> 00:46:56.340
the great mystics of,
uh,
of all time.
Uh,
and,
and,

726
00:46:56.341 --> 00:46:59.250
and all the writers who've talked about mystical experience from,
you know,

727
00:46:59.251 --> 00:47:02.670
Whitman to Emerson,
to Tennessee.
Um,

728
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.240
so I thought that was a really cool study.
Um,

729
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.240
and the testimony of the people in it was very interesting.

730
00:47:09.241 --> 00:47:12.720
It was also interesting that,
um,
you know,
followup,

731
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:17.550
they crunch that data very carefully,
and they discovered that,
um,

732
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:22.700
uh,
significant statistically significant percentage of people who had had these

733
00:47:22.701 --> 00:47:27.660
silicide experiences had actually had changes in their personality that we're

734
00:47:27.661 --> 00:47:29.320
enduring.
Um,

735
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.610
psychologist divide personality up into five traits.

736
00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:34.780
And I'm not gonna remember them all,

737
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:37.660
but it's things like conscientiousness and neuroticism,

738
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:42.640
extraversion openness,
and I forget the fifth.
Um,
but,

739
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:46.480
um,
openness,
uh,
which correlates with a,
you know,

740
00:47:46.481 --> 00:47:50.830
tolerance for other people's points of view,
ability to,
to take in lots of,

741
00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:55.690
um,
surprising information,
uh,
creativity.
Um,

742
00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:00.790
actually it was increased a statistically significant increase in openness.

743
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:02.350
Um,
and that's,

744
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:06.340
it's very rare that personality changes in adults at all.

745
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.960
And the idea that a mushroom could induce such a change was really striking.

746
00:48:10.961 --> 00:48:15.820
Now this has yet to be reproduced,
this particular result.
But,
um,
uh,

747
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:19.270
whether there are lasting changes in personality of people who take
psychedelics,

748
00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:23.080
I think is a really rich topic to explore [inaudible] and definitely deserve

749
00:48:23.081 --> 00:48:27.790
more work.
The smoking study you alluded to,
I thought it was also fascinating.

750
00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:32.200
Um,
you know,
here you have one of the hardest of all habits to Kik.

751
00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:35.110
Um,
and,
uh,

752
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.070
80% of people who went through this process,

753
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:44.071
which involved two or three psychedelic trips on psilocybin and some cognitive

754
00:48:44.261 --> 00:48:47.090
behavioral therapy,
uh,
in between,
um,

755
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:52.210
80% were confirmed abstinent ha had,
we're not smoking at the six month mark.

756
00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:54.970
And that number fell to a,

757
00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:58.420
I think it was 67% after a year.
Um,

758
00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.000
this is a small pilot study open label,

759
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:04.360
which means everybody knew they were getting psilocybin and nobody got a
placebo.

760
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:07.720
Um,
but that's,
that's pretty impressive.
And in fact,

761
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:11.890
67% success after a year is better than anything else that's out there.

762
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.870
So this study needs to be a reproduction and it is not,

763
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.860
it's happening.
Yeah.
Sorry to interrupt,
but also as I understand it,

764
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:25.890
it's not a marginal difference in efficacy compared to the standard of care for

765
00:49:29.261 --> 00:49:33.010
looking at alternative treatments.
Uh,
I mean the,
the Delta,

766
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:36.670
at least with this preliminary study as you,
as you mentioned,

767
00:49:36.671 --> 00:49:39.280
open label is something,
I mean,
I,

768
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.550
I somebody out there on the Internet can certainly correct me if I want to save

769
00:49:42.551 --> 00:49:46.690
as perhaps the alternative sort of option B more traditionally speaking,

770
00:49:46.691 --> 00:49:51.691
be somewhere in the 20s and in terms of efficacy at the six month mark,

771
00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:56.940
looking at absence rates,
I could be,
I could be getting the wrong fit.

772
00:49:56.950 --> 00:50:01.050
Um,
there's a,
there's a,
a drug people use calls Shan,
uh,

773
00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:02.590
that I've seen advertised on television.

774
00:50:02.591 --> 00:50:05.280
I think that does a little better than that 20% mark.
But you know,

775
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.880
the patch is not that successful.
And,
um,
uh,
so it's a big deal.

776
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:15.300
But what was also noteworthy to me about that particular study was talking to

777
00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:19.160
the people in the study.
And I would ask them,
you know,

778
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.180
so why did this make it any easier to quit smoking?
I mean,

779
00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:23.620
it doesn't seem to have anything to do with smoking.

780
00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.650
And they would describe an experience that,
um,

781
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:33.290
put their life and their behavior in such a radically new context.

782
00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.670
And they would say that,
you know,
they would say these incredibly banal things.

783
00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:38.504
They'd say,
like,

784
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:43.570
I realized my breath is precious and that there is no life without breath and

785
00:50:43.971 --> 00:50:48.380
it's really stupid to,
to damage your breath.
And I'm like,

786
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:53.120
Duh,
uh,
uh,
didn't you know that already?
And,

787
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.180
and they didn't know it in an intellectual way.

788
00:50:56.181 --> 00:51:01.181
But I think one of the real hallmarks of psychedelic experience is that,

789
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.580
um,
things you think,
you know,
but,

790
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:08.810
but really only exists on the very top of consciousness,

791
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:14.110
suddenly set down roots deep in your subconscious and they become these,

792
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:18.020
uh,
you know,
convictions,

793
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.370
absolute rock solid convictions that you believe in a way you've never believed

794
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:27.260
anything before.
And that I think allows people to kind of,
you know,

795
00:51:27.261 --> 00:51:31.940
put flesh on some platitude,
like smoking is bad for you,
um,

796
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:35.360
and uh,
and killing yourself as stupid,
um,

797
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:37.940
suddenly you feel it at a much deeper level.

798
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.460
And so I was struck by that and in fact,
Matt Johnson,

799
00:51:40.461 --> 00:51:45.290
who was the psychologist that at Hopkins who directed this study,

800
00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:47.420
he calls them dumb moments,

801
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:53.610
is that people have a lot of moments but they're transformative.
Um,

802
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.720
and that is that,
you know,
if you've ever had a psychedelic experience,

803
00:51:56.721 --> 00:51:59.320
there is that weird,
uh,

804
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:03.980
bleeding from banality into profundity and back again that happens.

805
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:08.620
And,
uh,
that definitely seems to go on.
So,

806
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:10.640
so one of the ways,

807
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:15.160
one of the psychological mechanisms that may be at work is this ability to,
um,

808
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:20.530
reinforce an idea that we all already know or we should know better and make it

809
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:24.590
powerful enough to actually guide our behavior.

810
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:30.020
<v 1>What are some of the apple potential applications or current applications in a,</v>

811
00:52:30.061 --> 00:52:35.061
in a scientific environment or elsewhere that are most interesting to you?

812
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:39.900
I'm personally tracking potential use of psychedelics,

813
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.640
which is certainly already in motion outside the u s hopefully we'll be

814
00:52:44.641 --> 00:52:49.390
researched more in the u s but as it would apply to say,
opiate addiction,
um,

815
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:53.040
really,
uh,
problems of epidemic proportions.
Are there,

816
00:52:53.041 --> 00:52:58.041
are there any particular applications that you're paying attention to?

817
00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:01.890
<v 4>Yeah,
well,
I,
you know,
first of all,</v>

818
00:53:01.891 --> 00:53:03.930
it's really important to understand that these,

819
00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:07.770
that this research comes along at a critical moment.
Um,

820
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:12.510
our mental healthcare system is badly broken.
Um,
you know,

821
00:53:12.511 --> 00:53:17.460
if you compare mental health treatment to any other branch of medicine,

822
00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:21.810
um,
mental health care fails a bismal.
I mean,

823
00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:26.490
it has not extended lifespan lowered mortality.
Um,
it hasn't done what,

824
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:31.050
you know,
work on cancer,
work on the heart,
work on,
um,
you know,

825
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:35.970
virtually other infectious disease.
It's remarkable what a pathetic,

826
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:40.710
uh,
track record it has.
Um,
and with all the,
you know,

827
00:53:40.711 --> 00:53:44.690
use of Ssri in the culture and shrinks,
you know,

828
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:48.330
which here in Berkeley there,
you know,
every other person's a shrink.
Um,

829
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.930
the fact is that,
uh,
rates of depression are soaring.

830
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:56.720
Rates of suicide are rising dramatically and addiction to,
um,

831
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:57.600
is rampant.

832
00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:02.600
And so there's a real crisis here and there hasn't been any real innovation in

833
00:54:03.391 --> 00:54:08.000
mental health care since I would say 1990 or so with the introduction of the
SSR.

834
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.940
I's a,
the antidepressants that work on the serotonin system.

835
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:13.583
Um,

836
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:18.120
so I am particularly interested as you are in the work on addiction.

837
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:18.810
Um,

838
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:23.810
I think that that's a very promising and it's an area where we don't have a lot

839
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.660
in the pipeline.
I began as a is,
uh,

840
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:32.750
another psychedelic comes from a root of a tree in Africa and it has been shown

841
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.550
in,
um,
you know,

842
00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:39.600
still very preliminary research to be useful,
uh,

843
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:44.280
with opiate addiction.
Um,
partly because it blunts the,
um,

844
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:50.040
uh,
the withdrawal symptoms at the same time.
It helps you get off the drugs,

845
00:54:50.041 --> 00:54:50.460
but it's,

846
00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:54.990
it's a very heavy and risky psychedelic and it lasts for a very long time.

847
00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:58.770
There are clinics in Mexico that are administering a to opiod addiction,

848
00:54:58.771 --> 00:55:00.480
but there is work,
um,

849
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:05.100
planned to look at suicide and opioid addiction.
Um,

850
00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.380
silicide Bin and alcohol addiction is,

851
00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:13.410
is underway right now in a large study at Nyu that I think bears bears close

852
00:55:14.581 --> 00:55:15.414
watching.

853
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:20.660
And then there's all the work that's about to happen about a suicide and

854
00:55:20.761 --> 00:55:22.180
depression.
Um,

855
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:27.130
treatment resistant depression is the subject of study in Europe,
uh,

856
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:31.290
coming up.
Uh,
and that's,
uh,
people whose depression has not responded to,

857
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:33.030
to other forms of treatment.

858
00:55:33.031 --> 00:55:38.031
So a particularly needy group of people and then a study in this country,

859
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:44.520
um,
of,
uh,
of,
uh,
major depression,
um,

860
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:49.260
and,
uh,
that will be getting underway this year.
Uh,
I think if these drugs can,

861
00:55:49.261 --> 00:55:53.910
can really make a dent in those indications,
it would be,
it would be enormous.

862
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.560
Uh,
it would just be,
you know,
and,

863
00:55:56.561 --> 00:55:59.850
and the depression studies very interesting how that came about.
Um,

864
00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:05.450
the researchers had looked at depression in their population of cancer patients.

865
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.400
They were,
they were dealing with both depression and an anxiety.

866
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:13.910
And the results of those studies found that in roughly 80% of the cases,

867
00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:18.620
uh,
the patient,
the volunteers had had,
um,
uh,

868
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:23.280
statistically significant reductions in symptoms of depression,

869
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.980
anxiety.
So a pretty big deal,
very strong treatment effect,

870
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.090
much stronger by the way.
Then the treatment effect that got Ssri is approved.

871
00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:32.613
Um,

872
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:37.960
but when they went to the FDA seeking permission to do a phase three trial in

873
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:41.620
cancer patients,
the FDA regulators said to them,

874
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.660
we've got a much bigger problem,

875
00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:47.500
a much larger population of people struggling with depression and there's a

876
00:56:47.501 --> 00:56:52.330
strong signal here that this,
that these drugs may help with depression.

877
00:56:52.331 --> 00:56:54.690
So we want you to study that.
Um,

878
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:59.110
and part of the reason they did that is they will recognize that there's not a

879
00:56:59.111 --> 00:57:04.000
lot of drugs in the pipeline and the SSRI,
sir or,
um,
you know,

880
00:57:04.001 --> 00:57:07.180
losing their effectiveness,
which was never too great to begin with.

881
00:57:07.181 --> 00:57:07.920
We're learning,
you know,

882
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:12.920
that ssrs do perform slightly better than placebos and their affect appears to

883
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:19.520
fade over time.
And also people hate being on them.
Um,

884
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.500
because of the side effects.

885
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:21.880
<v 1>See,
you see,</v>

886
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:26.880
you mentioned something that may surprise people and that is FDA support in this

887
00:57:29.021 --> 00:57:31.860
case.
And certainly we don't,
we,

888
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:36.090
we don't necessarily have to get into Mtma,
but MTV was,
uh,

889
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:40.510
granted breakthrough therapy designation to which is remarkable,

890
00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:45.250
expedite the process of phase three trials for PTSD.

891
00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:50.170
And that seems that odd with something,

892
00:57:50.171 --> 00:57:51.820
uh,
that came up earlier,

893
00:57:51.821 --> 00:57:56.620
which was this moral panic after the psychedelic sixties and the controlled

894
00:57:56.621 --> 00:58:00.700
substances act and the current legal status of these drugs.

895
00:58:00.701 --> 00:58:05.110
So what has changed?
I mean,
you would think if we,

896
00:58:05.111 --> 00:58:10.111
if we look at the mystical experiences and the piece that people feel,

897
00:58:10.211 --> 00:58:12.730
or the oneness,
the timelessness,

898
00:58:12.731 --> 00:58:16.060
the ineffability one would be inclined to think,
hey,

899
00:58:16.061 --> 00:58:17.770
if you're trying to treat alcoholism with that,

900
00:58:17.771 --> 00:58:20.410
you're just going to give them a state they want to return to over and over

901
00:58:20.411 --> 00:58:21.244
again.

902
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:25.940
<v 4>Yeah.
Wow.
That's a good question.
I think it's important to understand that,</v>

903
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:30.800
um,
psychedelics are not,
the classical psychedelics are not addictive.

904
00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.100
Um,
so it's not like you're giving them another drug that they're going to get

905
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:36.170
hooked on.
Um,
you know,

906
00:58:36.171 --> 00:58:41.120
in the classic drug addiction experiments where you give a primate,
or I'm sorry,

907
00:58:41.121 --> 00:58:42.950
when you give a rat or a mouse,

908
00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:48.170
two levers in the cage and one has food and one has a cocaine or heroin,

909
00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:52.610
you know,
they'll keep pressing the cocaine or heroin,
uh,
till they die,

910
00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:56.670
um,
over and they'll prefer it over food.
Um,

911
00:58:57.350 --> 00:59:01.910
if you make one of those levers,
give them access to LSD,
they'll press it once.

912
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:06.980
Never again.
They don't want to go there.
And you know,

913
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:10.670
if you've used these drugs,
your first thought on,

914
00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:14.820
on the conclusion of the experience is not,
man,
I got to do that again.
Um,

915
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:18.290
it takes months to recover.
Um,
and the,
and I don't mean recover,

916
00:59:18.291 --> 00:59:20.960
but it takes months to process everything that happened and it was,

917
00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:23.510
it's so disruptive and,

918
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:28.080
and so extreme and experience that your first thought is not one,

919
00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:32.660
where can I get my next hit?
So there's that.
Um,
but yeah,
I mean,

920
00:59:32.661 --> 00:59:35.690
it's a weird idea.
You know,
back in the 50s,
one of the,

921
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.560
the really interesting stories that,

922
00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:42.890
that you find if you dig into the research deep enough and the 50s period is

923
00:59:42.891 --> 00:59:47.230
fascinating,
is that,
um,
bill w the,
uh,

924
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.670
the founder of alcoholics anonymous,

925
00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:54.770
a first he got sober after he had been administered a psychedelic or a drug that

926
00:59:55.761 --> 01:00:00.170
some people call a psychedelic called Bella Donna in,
in the 30s.

927
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:03.650
And then in the 50s,
he got involved with,
uh,

928
01:00:03.651 --> 01:00:08.651
LSD therapy in La and he thought that LSD might be able to help alcoholics.

929
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:14.600
And He,
and he went to the board,
which he was on of Aa and said,
look,
Lsd,

930
01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:17.300
we should really take a look at it and maybe we want to incorporate it in the

931
01:00:17.301 --> 01:00:21.830
program.
And his fellow board members are like,
are you crazy?
I mean,

932
01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:25.760
that's gonna,
that's gonna ruin our brand,
that's going to confuse people.

933
01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.540
So there is a kind of fundamental sense that it seems weird to treat a drug with

934
01:00:29.541 --> 01:00:31.160
another drug.
Um,

935
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:36.080
but these drugs are so substantially different and they appear to be effective

936
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:41.200
in treating at least some kinds of addictions that it would be shameful for us

937
01:00:41.331 --> 01:00:46.310
not to do the research and explore it.
Um,
the kinds of risks,

938
01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:49.880
uh,
that are present in it.
I mean,
there are risks,

939
01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:53.510
but addiction is not one of them.
If that's the case,

940
01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:56.050
why have these wife,

941
01:00:56.060 --> 01:01:00.560
these compounds been so difficult to research?

942
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:02.890
Why are they not freely available?
I mean,
what happened?

943
01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:07.400
They took them off the table for so long.
Well,
I mean,

944
01:01:07.401 --> 01:01:11.270
the 60s happened,
um,
you know,
the,
uh,
there's a,

945
01:01:11.271 --> 01:01:14.830
there's a chapter in the book,
right?
I look at,
um,
the,

946
01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:18.590
the sort of rise in quick fall of psychedelics during the 60s.

947
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:21.360
And it's a really fascinating episode.
And,

948
01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:26.300
and there it's full of cautionary tales.
Um,
you know,
it's funny,
I would ask,

949
01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.800
uh,
uh,
I would ask the researchers I was interviewing,
so what happened?

950
01:01:30.801 --> 01:01:35.360
Why was there such a backlash against psychedelics that that research was,

951
01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.210
was closed down?
You know,
that never happens,

952
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:42.200
that you have a promising field of research and suddenly scientists feel they

953
01:01:42.201 --> 01:01:46.370
can't do it anymore and they're told to stop.
I mean,
this is,
you know,

954
01:01:46.371 --> 01:01:49.610
this is kind of dark age of stuff.
Um,
and,

955
01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:54.380
and in and to a man,
and they are mostly men,
I'm afraid they will say,

956
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:57.890
well,
it's too simple to blame Timothy leary.

957
01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:02.930
And then they'll go on to blame Timothy.
Um,

958
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.890
and he does have a very important role in this.
Um,

959
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.050
and basically Leery,
you know,

960
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:14.051
started studying psilocybin and Lsd at Harvard from 1960 to 1963.

961
01:02:15.801 --> 01:02:20.070
And keep in mind the drugs were legal then,
um,
and uh,

962
01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:25.680
but he got impatient with,
with research,
uh,
with science pretty early on.

963
01:02:25.681 --> 01:02:29.400
And he decided,
well,
you can't really do a controlled study of psychedelics,

964
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:32.760
so why bother?
And he started studying psychedelics in a net,

965
01:02:32.761 --> 01:02:37.010
what do you call the naturalistic environment,
which meant his living room.
Uh,

966
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:42.690
and,
uh,
and as happens to some psychedelic researchers,

967
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:48.110
they lose interest in treating individuals and acquire an interest in treating

968
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:53.460
the whole of the culture.
Um,
because they start seeing that,

969
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:53.731
you know,

970
01:02:53.731 --> 01:02:57.540
retailing these things is too slow when they're so promising and they could

971
01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:00.600
actually save us from civilizational collapse.

972
01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:05.880
And you have this exuberance irrational exuberance I would add that seems to

973
01:03:05.881 --> 01:03:09.960
come up in the minds of some people who work with these compounds.
And,

974
01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:14.130
and it's an occupational hazard,
I would argue.
And uh,

975
01:03:14.131 --> 01:03:17.910
and the current generation of researchers are guarding against it,

976
01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.480
but take them out for a drink and you know,
they'll,

977
01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:24.330
they'll come around to that place,
the value of these,

978
01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:28.820
the value of these compounds for the whole civilization.
Uh,

979
01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.410
which is interesting and they may well be right,
but it's,

980
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:35.730
it's a dangerous way to talk I think.
Um,
and so,

981
01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:40.410
um,
something else was going on in the 60s.
Um,
and that was that

982
01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:46.290
these drugs,
uh,
were used by the,

983
01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.130
um,
by teenagers and people in their twenties.
Um,

984
01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.140
and it created a,
a,
um,
uh,

985
01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:01.380
uh,
generate what was called the generation gap and a very unusual,
um,

986
01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:05.880
splitting of the,
of the cultures and values of two generations.

987
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:10.080
These drugs were doing something very unusual to that historical moment.

988
01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:12.720
And something that will never happen again.
Let me explain what I mean.

989
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:18.430
LSD High Dose Psilocybin or Lsd trip is a kind of rite of passage,

990
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:24.020
a searing rite of passage.
You feel like you,
you,

991
01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:27.800
you went in one person and you came out another person.
Um,

992
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:32.910
and it did this for the young,
at that point,
that's who use these drugs.

993
01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:36.600
Not Too many older people use them.
Um,
and um,

994
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.120
normally a rite of passage knits a culture together.

995
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:47.370
It's organized by the,
by the elders who set up the bar,
whatever it is,

996
01:04:47.371 --> 01:04:51.420
whether it's a bar Mitzvah or a vision quest or whatever it is,
and the youth,

997
01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:56.421
the adolescents pass through that process and then land in the country of the

998
01:04:56.701 --> 01:04:57.534
adults.

999
01:04:57.690 --> 01:05:02.690
And that's how you grow up here was this really freaky rite of passage that was

1000
01:05:03.301 --> 01:05:08.301
taking young people and dumping them in a country of the mind that adults knew

1001
01:05:10.261 --> 01:05:15.010
nothing about.
Um,
and I think it really,
um,

1002
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:20.360
drove a wedge and the culture and it's no accident that you had this unusual

1003
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:25.770
divergence of youth culture in both,
in terms of everything from,
uh,

1004
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:29.650
politics,
uh,
dress,
music,

1005
01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.510
diet,
sexual mores,
morality,
um,

1006
01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:37.390
was different than adults.
And,
um,

1007
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.230
and that was very destabilizing for the culture.
And,
and,
you know,

1008
01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:45.970
not surprisingly,
the elders reacted with,
with fear and panic.

1009
01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:50.250
Um,
and tried to put an end to this,
uh,
you know,
um,

1010
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:54.550
Richard Nixon called Timothy leary who was already a kind of a washed up

1011
01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:57.970
psychology professor called them the most dangerous man in America.

1012
01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.870
That's astounding.
Um,
but you know,
he probably really believed it.

1013
01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:06.540
He believed these drugs were,
we're keeping,
uh,
men from,

1014
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:09.400
you know,
going to fight in Vietnam.
Um,

1015
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:12.520
one of the things that happens is that you,
you,
you know,

1016
01:06:12.521 --> 01:06:16.540
these drugs make you raise questions about the authority structure that you live

1017
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:19.450
in.
And that was certainly happening.
Um,

1018
01:06:19.451 --> 01:06:24.451
so they were very destabilizing and there was a backlash whether Timothy leary

1019
01:06:25.361 --> 01:06:29.650
was solely responsible for that.
That,
that seems unfair.
I mean,
he,
he,

1020
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:32.840
he was definitely the east coast,
um,

1021
01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:35.620
a person most responsible for it.

1022
01:06:35.621 --> 01:06:40.430
But remember on the West Coast you had Ken Keasy,
uh,
the writer,
uh,

1023
01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:45.430
who is turning on thousands of people in his acid tests and as you know,

1024
01:06:45.431 --> 01:06:47.820
is also a psychedelic evangelists.
Uh,

1025
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:52.120
and he was turned on by the CIA inadvertently.
Um,
you know,
they were,

1026
01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:57.360
they were testing their LSD and they were paying people 50 bucks to go to the Va

1027
01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:01.820
hospital in the Menlo Park or Palo Alto and,
and uh,
and,

1028
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.630
and have a dose and they turned on the wrong guy.

1029
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:08.600
<v 1>Yeah.
Story is so outrageous.</v>

1030
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:14.090
It's like I had never,
I'd never been exposed to the details in your book.

1031
01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.560
And it's just,
if someone were to write a novel with that as the plot,
I mean,

1032
01:07:18.561 --> 01:07:23.240
they'd have to be like Haruki Murakami or something.
It's so surreal.

1033
01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:28.060
<v 4>Yeah.
And the idea that the,
that the 60 is what we call the 60s,</v>

1034
01:07:28.061 --> 01:07:32.290
might've been a CIA mind control experiment gone horribly.

1035
01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:36.070
Good or bad.
Yeah.
Is,
is mind blowing.
Um,

1036
01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.760
so I think the drugs would have found their way into the counter culture one way

1037
01:07:39.761 --> 01:07:43.690
or the other.
There were,
you know,
there were other routes besides Timothy Leary,

1038
01:07:43.691 --> 01:07:46.240
even though he was pushing really hard to make this happen,

1039
01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:50.220
but that lead to a backlash.
And you had,
um,

1040
01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.020
the government coming down hard on it.
Um,

1041
01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.980
the media who had,
uh,
been,

1042
01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:59.620
and this was one of the real surprises in researching the book,

1043
01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:04.300
incredibly booster ish about psychedelics,
uh,
time-life,

1044
01:08:04.301 --> 01:08:08.590
which was the most,
one of the most important media empires in the country,

1045
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.690
uh,
controlled by Henry Luce.

1046
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:15.410
They were actively promoting psychedelics up until up til 1965.

1047
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:18.920
Henry Luce loved them.
He and his wife had been treated successfully.

1048
01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:24.190
He published a Gordon Watson's first account of a magic mushroom experience in

1049
01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:27.860
Mexico and the 1950s.
Um,
and in fact,

1050
01:08:27.861 --> 01:08:29.620
he insisted that all coverage of,

1051
01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:33.050
of psychedelics come to his desk so we can make sure it didn't have anything

1052
01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:36.460
negative in it.
So,
so we,

1053
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:41.060
the culture undergoes a radical one 80,
around 1965.

1054
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:46.370
And that leads to the closing off of research.
So that begs the question,

1055
01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:51.350
could it happen again?
Um,
I don't think it could happen quite that way.

1056
01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:56.060
And the reason it couldn't.
Uh,
and for this idea,
I,

1057
01:08:56.061 --> 01:09:00.500
I credit Rick Doblin if he's right and I,
you know,
but he might,

1058
01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.290
he might be wrong,
but Rick Doblin,
who's the head of maps,

1059
01:09:03.291 --> 01:09:06.380
the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies,

1060
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:11.260
thinks that the culture has changed too much,
that we've absorbed so much,

1061
01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.470
so many innovations of the 60s.
Um,

1062
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.220
and that the people now in charge,
many of them have tripped.

1063
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:24.230
Um,
psychedelics are not so strange to them.
And that's why you have,

1064
01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:28.070
you know,
really some establishment voices in,
in,
uh,

1065
01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.500
the psychiatric establishment.
Um,

1066
01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:35.470
people like Paul Summer Grad and,
uh,
Jeffrey Lieberman,

1067
01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.540
both past presidents of the American Psychiatric Association,

1068
01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:42.320
I've talked about their own use of psychedelics and the role it played in their

1069
01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.430
intellectual development.
No doubt.
Uh,

1070
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.530
some of these regulators at the FDA have,
you know,

1071
01:09:48.531 --> 01:09:53.030
first person experience of,
of a,
of psychedelics.

1072
01:09:53.031 --> 01:09:57.860
So they're not terrified of them in quite the way.
Our parents were,

1073
01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:01.790
my parents were in the,
in the 60s.
And I think there's some

1074
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:08.210
comfort in that for people doing this research that it's unlikely to happen that

1075
01:10:08.211 --> 01:10:13.010
way.
Could it happened in another way?
Yes.
I mean,
let's say someone is,

1076
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:16.910
someone dies in this research or there is,
um,
you know,
some,

1077
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:21.350
some adverse,
uh,
you know,
events,
um,

1078
01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:26.300
or their suicides a associated with psychedelics which have happened in the past

1079
01:10:26.301 --> 01:10:30.530
and could happen again.
The,
um,
the cultural climate could change.
Well,
you know,

1080
01:10:30.531 --> 01:10:34.190
we also have Jeffrey sessions is the,
um,
is the,
uh,

1081
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:39.260
attorney general and he's,
you know,
he's not content,

1082
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:42.260
he's not happy with states legalizing cannabis.

1083
01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:47.060
How's he going to feel if the FDA comes forward and,
and approves psychedelics?

1084
01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:51.170
Um,
it's not guaranteed that there'll be against it.
I mean,

1085
01:10:51.171 --> 01:10:53.330
there's another lens you could take to this.
Um,

1086
01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.300
they are deregulated and that's essentially what we're talking about,
right,

1087
01:10:56.301 --> 01:11:00.350
is deregulating a pharmaceutical.
Um,
can I jump in for one second?

1088
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.970
I am so curious.

1089
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Do you not think there would be incredible backlash if a sessions or someone

1090
01:11:07.521 --> 01:11:12.521
else were to come out against phase three trials that are specifically dealing

1091
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.250
with say,

1092
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:17.340
<v 1>victims of sexual assault for Ptsd,</v>

1093
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:22.550
war veterans returning with pronounced trauma and limbs blown off?

1094
01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:27.120
I mean,
it seems to be such a bipartisan issue and in everyone's best interest,

1095
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:32.480
there would seem to be some political risk in trying to stop these types of

1096
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.690
studies.
Maybe I,
maybe I'm not savvy enough.

1097
01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:43.630
<v 4>Right.
And you've,
and your example is the good example.
I mean the,
the,</v>

1098
01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:48.670
the Mtma work or,
um,
PTSD,
uh,
I mean this is,

1099
01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:48.971
you know,

1100
01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:52.690
is there a more sympathetic population or that you could possibly be helping?

1101
01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.690
And in the same way,
um,
you know,
uh,

1102
01:11:56.770 --> 01:12:01.770
the whole system finally was moved to make it easier to have access to aids

1103
01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:05.590
drugs cause there was nothing else that could help.
Um,

1104
01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.090
I think that yes,

1105
01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.760
I think there would be a penalty and I don't think it's an accident.

1106
01:12:09.761 --> 01:12:11.110
It's not a right left issue.

1107
01:12:11.111 --> 01:12:14.800
When you started talking about the military and cops,
um,
you know,

1108
01:12:14.801 --> 01:12:18.640
Rebecca Mercer has donated to,
uh,
to this,

1109
01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:22.960
to research the psychedelic research.
Specifically.
I think with the PTSD work,

1110
01:12:22.961 --> 01:12:26.220
Steve Bannon has spoken out in favor of it.
So,
uh,
and,

1111
01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:30.460
and Peter Thiel is as an investor in,
um,
uh,

1112
01:12:30.461 --> 01:12:32.470
in psychedelic medicine.
So it's,

1113
01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:37.870
it isn't necessarily the case that it's regarded as this left wing thing,

1114
01:12:37.871 --> 01:12:42.520
even though it has these cultural countercultural,
you know,
colorations um,

1115
01:12:42.521 --> 01:12:46.840
so I don't think it's simple at all.
Um,
but we'll see.
We'll see.
You know,

1116
01:12:46.841 --> 01:12:47.360
if the NFL

1117
01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.010
<v 3>Yay looks at it,</v>

1118
01:12:49.050 --> 01:12:52.800
<v 4>these phase three results and this is a couple of years down the road and says</v>

1119
01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:53.910
that yes,

1120
01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:57.180
these drugs should be approved and doctors should be able to prescribe it.

1121
01:12:57.770 --> 01:13:01.280
<v 3>The Dea,
the Drug Enforcement Administration,</v>

1122
01:13:01.281 --> 01:13:04.520
which is part of the Justice Department then has to reschedule them.

1123
01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:10.070
Scheduling drugs is a political,
um,
determination.
Finally.
Um,

1124
01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:14.720
and they have,
DEA has sometimes been immune to a scientific information.

1125
01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:19.100
Um,
but I think it would be,
uh,
you know,
it would be a,

1126
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:23.750
an interesting moment.
Uh,
I'm not sure how it would,
um,
uh,
come out.

1127
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:26.390
But I think that,
um,

1128
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:31.220
this work with dealing with post traumatic stress disorder and dealing with the

1129
01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:36.290
so called existential distress of cancer patients,
um,

1130
01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:40.960
wins the sympathy of the public.
Uh,
especially,
um,

1131
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.480
when you're doing it with a drug that where the risk profile is,

1132
01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.950
is really not very bad.
Um,
so we'll see.
I mean,
I think it's a big question.

1133
01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.120
Um,
you know,

1134
01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:53.210
the idea that there's any kind of logical response on the part of the Trump

1135
01:13:53.211 --> 01:13:56.360
administration to anything that has to be factored into.

1136
01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:01.980
<v 1>So the,
you mentioned risks earlier.</v>

1137
01:14:01.981 --> 01:14:05.040
I think we should talk about that.
I mean,
what,
what is the risk profile?

1138
01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.820
What are the risks of these compounds?
What's the,
you know,
the LD 50,

1139
01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:11.980
if we have a thousand people in a room,
like what's the dose

1140
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.460
<v 3>it takes to kill 500 of them?
Uh,
well,
there's,</v>

1141
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:20.040
there's no known lethal dose of Psilocybin or Lsd that's,

1142
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:23.680
and you know,
if it kills you,
it's not going to be cause it,
it's toxic.

1143
01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.450
They're not toxic.
They're,
I mean,

1144
01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:29.920
remarkably few molecules have this profound effect and they don't stay in your

1145
01:14:29.921 --> 01:14:33.820
body that long.
Um,
so from a toxicity point of view,

1146
01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:37.480
they're remarkably safe drugs.
Um,

1147
01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:41.790
I think that the risks come,
uh,
are more psychological in origin.
Um,

1148
01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:44.260
they are incredibly disruptive.

1149
01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:49.300
They disarm your usual defenses and defenses,
you know,

1150
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:51.730
can be very helpful as well as hurtful.

1151
01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:55.840
And some people without their defenses get into real trouble.

1152
01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:00.760
People do foolish things on psychedelics.
People take them carelessly and they,

1153
01:15:00.761 --> 01:15:05.710
you know,
walk into traffic.
Uh,
they,
you know,
they step off of buildings.
Um,

1154
01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:10.670
uh,
so I think,
and then there is a small,
um,

1155
01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:16.030
a subgroup of people at risk for serious mental illness,

1156
01:15:16.031 --> 01:15:21.031
things like schizophrenia for whom psychedelics can be the trigger a and push

1157
01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:27.760
people into that first psychotic break.
And I think that,
um,

1158
01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.580
that happened,
uh,
you know,

1159
01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.680
wasn't so uncommon with people in their early twenties using these drugs and

1160
01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:39.160
that it happens to be the age where this tends to happen.

1161
01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:41.890
Would it happen without the psychedelics?

1162
01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:46.150
Probably another trauma would have set it off,
if not the second,
secondary.
Um,

1163
01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:49.330
but,
but it does happen.
And I think that,
um,

1164
01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:54.070
one of the reasons that there have not been any adverse events and serious

1165
01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:58.780
adverse events in the thousand volunteers that have,
um,

1166
01:15:58.930 --> 01:15:59.590
been,
you know,

1167
01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:04.120
have been dosed in the modern era of research is that they're screening very

1168
01:16:04.121 --> 01:16:04.954
carefully.

1169
01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.850
Anybody who's got mental illness in their family is not eligible.
Um,

1170
01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:12.610
and,
uh,
so,
you know,

1171
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.520
that's kind of the luxury of doing small trials.

1172
01:16:15.521 --> 01:16:18.010
You can be very picky about who you give the drug to.

1173
01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.940
And that's one of the reasons that phase three may not be quite as dramatic.

1174
01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:26.830
And it's,
and it's,
uh,
you know,
success as,
as phase two has been.
Um,

1175
01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:31.420
so I think that there are people who should not take these drugs and,
um,

1176
01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:37.000
uh,
and it's people at some psychological risk.
Um,
that said,
it's,

1177
01:16:37.001 --> 01:16:40.660
it's worth pointing out.
There's a story.
I tell him the book,
um,

1178
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:44.380
that very often doctors who in the 60s,
especially,

1179
01:16:44.381 --> 01:16:47.400
who weren't familiar with psychedelics in there,
and,
and,

1180
01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.880
and the phenomenology of them,
um,
mistook panic attack,

1181
01:16:51.881 --> 01:16:55.100
simple panic attacks,
which are common on the drugs,
um,

1182
01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:59.800
for psychotic breaks.
And there's a great story that,
uh,

1183
01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:03.550
Andy Wilde told me.
Um,
Dr Andrew Weil,
uh,

1184
01:17:03.551 --> 01:17:08.200
about after he got out of medical school.
And,
uh,
in 1968,

1185
01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:12.410
he hustled out to San Francisco and volunteered at the Haight Ashbury free

1186
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:13.220
clinic.

1187
01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:17.240
And they were seeing lots of bad trips and people would come in and they thought

1188
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:20.840
they were going mad that they were going to die.
And,
you know,

1189
01:17:20.841 --> 01:17:23.750
we shouldn't minimize how bad a bad trip can be.
It's,
it's,

1190
01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:27.440
it's a terrifying experience.
And that,
that too is a,
is a risk,

1191
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:30.130
even if it is just a panic attack.
Um,

1192
01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.040
but Andy had had a lot of experience with psychedelics himself,

1193
01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:39.140
and he saw these,
uh,
this,
these symptoms for what they were.

1194
01:17:39.141 --> 01:17:42.380
And what he would do is he'd come into the little cubicle with his white coat

1195
01:17:42.381 --> 01:17:45.320
and a stethoscope and his clipboard.
And he'd ask a few questions.

1196
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:49.280
And then when he decided the person was not really psychotic,
um,

1197
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:53.000
but was just freaking out,
he would go to the,
he would say,
excuse me,

1198
01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:55.880
but there's someone in real trouble in the next cubicle.

1199
01:17:56.210 --> 01:18:00.140
And all at once,
these people were like,
wow,

1200
01:18:00.141 --> 01:18:04.010
there's someone more fucked up than I am,
and they would feel so much better

1201
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.870
and their symptoms would pass.
Um,

1202
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:11.840
so he understood that you could manipulate the experience,

1203
01:18:11.841 --> 01:18:14.600
which is of course what the guides understand too.
And,

1204
01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:19.020
and rescue someone from what had been a,
a,
a pretty horrifying,
um,

1205
01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:24.200
episode.
Um,
so,
you know,
how many psychotic breaks were there in the 60s?
You know,

1206
01:18:24.201 --> 01:18:26.780
you hear,
you know,
that there were,
you know,
the,
how the,

1207
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:29.720
the emergency rooms were for a period where,
you know,

1208
01:18:29.721 --> 01:18:33.740
full of people on bed LSD trips.
And maybe that's true,

1209
01:18:33.741 --> 01:18:36.840
but what was that actually,
um,

1210
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:39.590
it may have just been a bad trip and bad trips,

1211
01:18:39.591 --> 01:18:43.790
or are first they can be averted with good guiding and second,

1212
01:18:43.791 --> 01:18:47.210
they can actually be very useful to people if they're properly analyzed.

1213
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:51.450
<v 1>And I think the,
uh,
at least,
you know,</v>

1214
01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:56.370
the way that I've started to think about this reading your book and becoming

1215
01:18:56.371 --> 01:19:01.371
involved with the research is that a medium or useful delineation is safe and

1216
01:19:02.761 --> 01:19:05.150
unsafe trip in the sense that difficult,

1217
01:19:05.151 --> 01:19:10.151
it does not necessarily translate to longterm negative outcomes in some cases.

1218
01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:13.360
The contrary are very much the contrary.
Yeah.

1219
01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:18.240
And I want to pause for just a second here to make it an appeal.

1220
01:19:18.241 --> 01:19:20.820
If there are regulators,
uh,

1221
01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:25.850
lawmakers listening and that is that speaking as someone who I assure you is not

1222
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:30.480
dancing around the Playa and a Thong at burning man,
calling himself a shaman.

1223
01:19:30.481 --> 01:19:32.910
That's not my shtick,

1224
01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:37.940
but conversely has looked at a mental illness and friend's suicide and friends

1225
01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:45.600
in high school and college,
um,
have friends with say eating disorders of 20,

1226
01:19:45.601 --> 01:19:50.601
30 years that have been not just mitigated but resolved dif.

1227
01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:53.610
I mean at least I can't say definitively of course,

1228
01:19:53.611 --> 01:19:58.611
but for years now after say one to three controlled sessions,

1229
01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:03.880
looking at the risk profile of these drugs,
there are risks to be sure.
Uh,

1230
01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:08.490
but the,
the potential benefit,
the,
the,

1231
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:13.590
the cost effectiveness and the pronounced,

1232
01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.990
uh,
favorable risk profile is really remarkable.

1233
01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:22.260
I mean,
beyond just about anything I've seen,
not a panacea,

1234
01:20:22.261 --> 01:20:26.640
but with some very promising indications that,

1235
01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:31.670
that make it at the very least worth a researching in depth.

1236
01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:37.230
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
I don't want to sound too much like a proselytizing,

1237
01:20:37.231 --> 01:20:40.160
but if you look at,
say,
uh,
you know,

1238
01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:44.250
if there are drugs looking at f pharmacogenomics,
if I were to take them,

1239
01:20:44.251 --> 01:20:48.750
I could have a fatal response right there,
which are common,
common,

1240
01:20:48.751 --> 01:20:51.660
common drugs.
Uh,
if you take grapefruit juice,

1241
01:20:51.661 --> 01:20:54.330
which it can certainly change the metabolism of many drugs,

1242
01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:59.010
you can have horrible side effects.
And if you look at,
if you were to print out,

1243
01:20:59.011 --> 01:20:59.940
let's just say hypothetically,

1244
01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:04.941
years from now you have silicide been available and you'd go to Walgreens to

1245
01:21:05.101 --> 01:21:07.130
pick up your siliciden.
Uh,

1246
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.710
and maybe it's only available through a therapist or a doctor who's going to be

1247
01:21:10.711 --> 01:21:12.090
supervising a session.
But nonetheless,

1248
01:21:12.091 --> 01:21:15.120
let's imagine this as an exercise and you pick up your,

1249
01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:19.680
your little white bag with the pharmacists,
uh,

1250
01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:22.190
directions and warnings on the side,
uh,

1251
01:21:22.230 --> 01:21:27.230
compared to just about anything else to date that I would have routinely

1252
01:21:27.391 --> 01:21:31.830
consumed the profile of something like a psilocybin would be very,

1253
01:21:31.831 --> 01:21:33.870
very favorable,
uh,
for a lot of things.

1254
01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.200
And of course we're operating from a place of incomplete information just

1255
01:21:37.201 --> 01:21:39.690
because the research has been so stymied.

1256
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:43.740
But the early indicators seem to be really promising.
So I would just say from,

1257
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:47.760
from the standpoint of regulators not calling it the,
uh,

1258
01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:50.220
sort of the golden goose,
but this,

1259
01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:55.370
some of these compounds have the potential to transform how increasingly

1260
01:21:55.831 --> 01:21:57.090
problematic,

1261
01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:02.160
often fatal problems in mental health and elsewhere are treated.
So it's,

1262
01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:03.780
I

1263
01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:07.410
<v 4>agree with you entirely and I think that yes,
as with any drug,</v>

1264
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.600
you've got to compare it with other drugs,
um,

1265
01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:13.500
and that they all have risks and we put up with a certain amount of risk to get

1266
01:22:13.501 --> 01:22:17.060
the benefit and that the risks in this case,
um,

1267
01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:21.870
certainly at the biological level are,
are minor compared to,
uh,
drugs.

1268
01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.940
We take routinely that,
um,

1269
01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:28.590
even over the counter drugs that are more toxic than,
um,

1270
01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.540
than psychedelics as far as we know.

1271
01:22:30.541 --> 01:22:33.270
So I think that's definitely worth keeping in mind.
You know,

1272
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:38.400
because these drugs or illicit,
they're surrounded by this penumbra of fear.

1273
01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.890
That's a good word.
And we need to,

1274
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.380
and we need to like look at them with a very kind of cool objective lens,

1275
01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.990
which is hard to do.
You know,
David Nutt,

1276
01:22:48.991 --> 01:22:52.200
who's a very well known psychopharmacologist in England,

1277
01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:55.770
who's involved with the research.
It's in his lab that Robin Carhart,

1278
01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:56.604
Harris works.

1279
01:22:57.150 --> 01:23:00.930
He did a very interesting analysis of a bunch of drugs and he would compare them

1280
01:23:00.931 --> 01:23:04.620
not even to themselves,
but to other kinds of risky behavior.

1281
01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:06.940
And he gotten really hot water.

1282
01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:12.130
Not only did he say that alcohol is more toxic than Lsd,
which got him fired.

1283
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:16.480
He was working for the government is the Labor government's drugs advisor.
Um,

1284
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:20.760
but then he said,
um,
riding a horse is more dangerous than taking Mtma.

1285
01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:24.330
Now we never put those two things together,
but you know,

1286
01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:25.670
why don't we have this commercial

1287
01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:30.400
<v 1>six about horseback riding?
I'm just seeing the commercial like this,</v>

1288
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:33.580
the 32nd spot,
safer than riding a horse.

1289
01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:39.120
<v 4>You know,
I think we have to,
I think we're really nuts.
I mean in general,</v>

1290
01:23:39.150 --> 01:23:40.830
you know,
any behavioral economist,

1291
01:23:40.831 --> 01:23:43.110
I'm sure you've had them on the show will tell you that we're in,

1292
01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:47.870
we're nuts about risk and,
and really irrational and how we can front it.
Um,

1293
01:23:48.450 --> 01:23:51.090
so it's important to understand that there are risks there.

1294
01:23:51.091 --> 01:23:55.440
Mostly psychological people can have very painful experiences.
Um,

1295
01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:59.460
but in terms of poisoning your body,
um,
you could do a lot worse.

1296
01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:05.340
<v 1>And one of the portions in your book that really caught my attention and got me</v>

1297
01:24:05.421 --> 01:24:08.810
excited was related to the default mode network.

1298
01:24:08.811 --> 01:24:11.960
And I'm probably going to butcher this paraphrasing,
so I want you to correct me,

1299
01:24:11.961 --> 01:24:14.150
but,
uh,
the,

1300
01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:19.360
it was the observation that perhaps some of these conditions that a lay person

1301
01:24:21.651 --> 01:24:24.920
is prone to thinking of is separate.

1302
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:29.540
Whether that's chronic anxiety,
chronic depression,

1303
01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:32.780
OCD,
eating disorders,

1304
01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:37.460
that they may not in fact be a separate as,
as we think.

1305
01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:42.140
And I want to say that doctor Tom Insel may have commented on this former head

1306
01:24:42.141 --> 01:24:46.100
of the national institute,
uh,
on or,
and mental health.
Could you,

1307
01:24:46.101 --> 01:24:48.170
could you just elaborate on that?
Because this,

1308
01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:53.440
it's so exciting to me for,
for many reasons that I,

1309
01:24:53.441 --> 01:24:56.060
I want to do it justice.
So could you explain it?
I'm

1310
01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:59.090
<v 4>glad you brought that up because it's one of the most exciting things in the</v>

1311
01:24:59.091 --> 01:25:00.280
book,
I think.
Uh,

1312
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:05.400
and I talk about this idea that we may be close to or see a path to developing

1313
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:09.080
what I call the grand unified theory of mental illness,

1314
01:25:09.081 --> 01:25:14.081
or at least a set of a big set of mental illnesses that include depression,

1315
01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:19.180
anxiety,
addiction and obsession.
Um,
and,
um,

1316
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:23.480
one of the questions I asked,
and so when I interviewed him was,
and this is,

1317
01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:23.900
you know,

1318
01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:28.820
one of the things I was skeptical about that it seems kind of implausible to me

1319
01:25:28.821 --> 01:25:32.690
that one drug or one,
uh,
you know,
category of drugs,

1320
01:25:32.691 --> 01:25:36.710
like psychedelics should work on so many different indications.
Um,

1321
01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:39.110
isn't that a little too good to be true?
Isn't that,
you know,

1322
01:25:39.111 --> 01:25:41.990
aren't you talking panacea?
And he said,
well,

1323
01:25:41.991 --> 01:25:45.830
what makes you think those indications are so different?

1324
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:47.740
Those illnesses are so different.
Um,

1325
01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:51.170
and he said the distinctions between depression,
anxiety,

1326
01:25:51.171 --> 01:25:56.000
obsession and addiction are actually,
um,
uh,
there's a lot of,
of,

1327
01:25:56.001 --> 01:26:00.470
of a bleeding over from one to another.
And that,
that the,

1328
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:03.410
the names that we give them are really,
uh,

1329
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.080
an artifact of the,
um,

1330
01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:11.210
of the insurance industry and the deck,
the Dsm,
um,
you know,

1331
01:26:11.211 --> 01:26:13.270
the diagnostic manual,
um,

1332
01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.700
we have to assign a number to every diagnosis.

1333
01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:20.750
And so we tend to separate things.
And,
um,

1334
01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:24.530
but he's kind of more of a lumper and he,
and he suggests that,
you know,

1335
01:26:24.531 --> 01:26:28.700
these could be very similar phenomenon.
Uh,
and that,
you know,

1336
01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:32.780
one way a,
another psychiatrist put it is,
is,
um,

1337
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:36.590
you know,
depression is,

1338
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:41.650
is kind of regret about the past and anxiety is regret about the future.

1339
01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:46.160
And I was like,
oh,
that's really interesting.
They are,
you know,

1340
01:26:46.161 --> 01:26:50.960
the real difference between depression,
anxiety is tense,
isn't it?
And,

1341
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:55.880
um,
so when you,
when you step back to another level and you look at,

1342
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:59.120
um,
the mechanisms that may be at work here,

1343
01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:03.560
you begin to see how these,
um,

1344
01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:08.600
illnesses may be very similar.
Uh,
how do I mean?

1345
01:27:08.601 --> 01:27:12.710
Well,
if you look at a,
again,
go back to Robin Carhart Harris,

1346
01:27:12.711 --> 01:27:16.670
his work on the default mode network.
Um,
his premise,

1347
01:27:16.671 --> 01:27:19.580
he wrote another really interesting paper.
I strongly,

1348
01:27:19.581 --> 01:27:23.390
anyone who has an appetite for a little neuroscience,
um,

1349
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:26.530
should check out this paper.
It's called the entropic brain.
Uh,

1350
01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:29.020
and you should put it on your website.
I can send you,
yeah,

1351
01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:34.190
I'll put it in the show notes.
And,
um,
uh,
and there he,
his,

1352
01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:37.580
his idea is that the brain is,
it is as we know,

1353
01:27:37.581 --> 01:27:41.870
a very complex system and,
um,
it has an order,

1354
01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:47.170
an emergent order that is to some extent in forced or regulated by the default

1355
01:27:47.631 --> 01:27:52.100
mode network.
And the ego is the felt,
um,

1356
01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:54.440
you know,
version of that.
Um,

1357
01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.370
and the ego's job is to kind of patrol the boundaries.
All right?

1358
01:27:58.371 --> 01:28:02.060
It's the cop on patrol and it's patrolling the boundary between you and the

1359
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:03.110
other,
you know,

1360
01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:07.640
things that aren't you and you and your unconscious and,
um,

1361
01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:11.510
and the system,
you know,
has this kind of structural order,

1362
01:28:11.511 --> 01:28:16.250
but in many people that order gets overly rigid.

1363
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:21.910
And that brains function along a spectrum from entropy to,

1364
01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:27.320
uh,
rigidity and on the entropy.
And,
um,

1365
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:32.770
you have a serious psychological ailments like a schizophrenia.

1366
01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:37.100
Um,
and you also,
but you also have childhood consciousness,

1367
01:28:37.101 --> 01:28:41.660
which is very chaotic and very psychedelic,
uh,
in many ways.
And,

1368
01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:45.350
um,
uh,
and then on the other end of the spectrum,

1369
01:28:45.351 --> 01:28:49.850
you get to these illnesses characterized by too much order,

1370
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:54.950
essentially.
And that's depression and obsession and a addiction.

1371
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:59.950
And these are essentially ailments where people get stuck in repetitive loops

1372
01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:04.290
that these deep grooves of thought and behavior,
um,

1373
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:09.000
which are enforced by an ego that's become almost punishing,
you know,
um,

1374
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.500
you know,
to authoritarian.

1375
01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:15.780
And so these brains are kind of locked and these other brains,
you know,

1376
01:29:15.781 --> 01:29:18.680
are just w way loose and there's a,

1377
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.060
there's a place you want to be in the middle there.

1378
01:29:21.061 --> 01:29:25.440
There's a point of criticality really where you have enough entropy,
um,

1379
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:29.220
but also enough order and that we go wrong when we,

1380
01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:33.030
when we get too far to one end or the other.
Um,
that's his theory anyway.
It's,

1381
01:29:33.031 --> 01:29:38.000
it's speculative but,
but,
but has a lot of explanatory power.
And um,

1382
01:29:38.850 --> 01:29:41.700
basically he thinks that uh,

1383
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:47.030
psychedelics work by increasing the amount of entropy in the brain and that

1384
01:29:47.491 --> 01:29:52.491
entropy up to a point is a very positive thing and that it is the lack of

1385
01:29:52.801 --> 01:29:55.500
entropy that that traps people in,
uh,

1386
01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:58.350
these very rigid patterns of thought and behavior.

1387
01:29:58.830 --> 01:30:03.820
And that is essentially the LSD or the silicide been lubricates cognition.
Um,

1388
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:06.690
it can go too far and leads to magical thinking,

1389
01:30:06.691 --> 01:30:10.020
which is also on the too much entropy side.
Um,

1390
01:30:10.110 --> 01:30:14.220
but it also can help break people out of those habits.

1391
01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:19.440
So there you begin to see the outlines of a grand unified theory of mental

1392
01:30:19.441 --> 01:30:22.140
illness and that's,
that's really exciting stuff.

1393
01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.980
<v 1>It's a,
it makes me think of,
it's so,
so exciting.
Uh,</v>

1394
01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:28.910
because it's,
it's,

1395
01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:33.400
it's still offers this tantalizing possibility that you could address many,

1396
01:30:33.401 --> 01:30:38.320
many different separately labeled conditions in a similar way.
Uh,

1397
01:30:38.410 --> 01:30:41.790
and uh,
I'm not going to name names,
but I was speaking with a,

1398
01:30:41.791 --> 01:30:43.660
I'm a researcher in this field,

1399
01:30:43.661 --> 01:30:48.340
very well published scientist and the analogy that he used,

1400
01:30:48.341 --> 01:30:49.780
and I'm going to modify it a little bit,

1401
01:30:49.781 --> 01:30:54.040
but he said that my question to him was what,
what is it,

1402
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:57.400
what is a plausible explanation for why these,

1403
01:30:57.401 --> 01:31:02.401
some of these compounds seem to have this longterm reorganizing effect?

1404
01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:08.470
Because the,
the,
the half life of the drug so to speak,
is not months long.

1405
01:31:08.471 --> 01:31:09.304
So like one day,

1406
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:13.840
what the hell happens where these people in some cases have this persistence of

1407
01:31:13.841 --> 01:31:16.600
personality change where they have more empathy a year later,
two years later.

1408
01:31:16.630 --> 01:31:18.160
What on Earth can explain that?

1409
01:31:18.161 --> 01:31:23.020
And the picture he painted because the mechanisms are still so poorly understood

1410
01:31:23.021 --> 01:31:27.730
was,
well,
you can imagine if you're on a,
on a ski mountain,

1411
01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.770
Oh,
I know who you're talking about.
All right.
Yeah.

1412
01:31:29.771 --> 01:31:33.640
After a few hours you have all these worn ruts and it becomes more and more

1413
01:31:33.641 --> 01:31:37.870
likely that people are going to use the,
the ruts that have been laid down.

1414
01:31:37.871 --> 01:31:39.790
But if there's,
you can't get out of them

1415
01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:45.660
<v 4>or your skis keeps tending back into them and you're yes</v>

1416
01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:49.570
<v 1>and so it,
but if you suddenly have five feet of fresh powder,
whatever,
three fee,</v>

1417
01:31:49.571 --> 01:31:51.570
it doesn't really matter.
And then you get up to the top of the lift,

1418
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.290
you all of a sudden have to buy,
almost by definition,

1419
01:31:55.291 --> 01:32:00.250
choose a new path a year at least given the flexibility to choose your new
route.

1420
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:04.600
And uh,
but taken too far,
it's just like being stuck in a blizzard.
Right?
Well,

1421
01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:09.340
let's knock it out.
That's my own admission.
Not terribly original,

1422
01:32:09.341 --> 01:32:12.160
but yet,
but,
um,
it's a,

1423
01:32:12.161 --> 01:32:15.590
I really need to meet a Robin at some point.
I haven't used to.

1424
01:32:15.610 --> 01:32:16.540
You'd need to have mom.

1425
01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:17.691
<v 4>He's,</v>

1426
01:32:17.691 --> 01:32:21.830
he's a brilliant guy and I think who will be recognized as a really important

1427
01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.120
neuroscientists.
Um,

1428
01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:26.330
he's just got a very unusual mind because he can do the hard science,

1429
01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:30.230
but he's also trained as a psychoanalyst.
He's actually a fraud.
Ian.
Very,

1430
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:31.750
very interesting mix of,
uh,

1431
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:35.290
he got into this because he wanted to show the psychological,
the,
the,

1432
01:32:35.291 --> 01:32:40.250
the neuroscientific basis for 40 and ideas like repression and,
uh,

1433
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:41.850
and so yeah,
he's a,

1434
01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:46.160
he's a really interesting guy that I think that that snow metaphor is really

1435
01:32:46.161 --> 01:32:49.070
powerful.
Um,
we,
we don't understand the mechanism.

1436
01:32:49.071 --> 01:32:53.660
What exactly is a filling those ruts,
uh,

1437
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:55.910
you know,
in a way that lasts.
I mean,

1438
01:32:55.911 --> 01:32:59.750
I think though it may go back to that image of,
um,
you know,

1439
01:32:59.751 --> 01:33:03.920
creating some new linkages in the brain,
some new pathways,

1440
01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:06.650
and basically,
you know,
that's what learning is.

1441
01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:11.650
It's a pathway in the brain and then you reinforce it by repetition.

1442
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:17.110
So that if you have had such a linkage on an experience and you simply think

1443
01:33:17.511 --> 01:33:21.530
about it a lot,
and I've certainly done this in my own experiences,

1444
01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:26.540
it reinforces it.
Um,
you can use meditation to reinforce it.
You can,
uh,

1445
01:33:26.541 --> 01:33:30.980
just merely just replay it in your head.
Um,
and,

1446
01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:35.240
and in time you're creating a more and more,
uh,

1447
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:36.850
resilient linkage.
And,

1448
01:33:36.851 --> 01:33:41.851
and that's why I think that the integration a period after the session is so

1449
01:33:43.251 --> 01:33:48.050
important.
Um,
you know,
in,
in all the both underground and above ground,

1450
01:33:48.170 --> 01:33:52.250
uh,
guided sessions,
there are three stages that,
you know,
they prepare you for it,

1451
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:55.640
they guide you,
they sit with you while you're having the experience,

1452
01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.950
and then you always come back the next day.

1453
01:33:57.951 --> 01:34:01.850
And this is probably the most important part to figure out what the hell was

1454
01:34:01.851 --> 01:34:06.500
that all about.
And it's often hard to know.
And,
and many of us take a,

1455
01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:10.880
you know,
a big psychedelic experience that we put in this box called weird drug

1456
01:34:10.881 --> 01:34:11.481
experience.

1457
01:34:11.481 --> 01:34:14.960
And we put it away on the shelf because we don't know what to do with it and no

1458
01:34:14.961 --> 01:34:19.640
one's going to help us.
Um,
but at the integration,
the guide will,
will,

1459
01:34:19.670 --> 01:34:22.130
um,
have you talk out your experience,

1460
01:34:22.131 --> 01:34:26.640
tell the narrative and then we'll kind of underscore a certain ideas.
And I,

1461
01:34:26.641 --> 01:34:31.450
and I remember wellsome times I had when I,
when I had good guiding that,
um,

1462
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:36.910
they would buy by emphasizing one particular theme or insight or image,

1463
01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:39.403
um,

1464
01:34:39.650 --> 01:34:43.700
basically make that linkage a much stronger than it would have been.

1465
01:34:43.730 --> 01:34:47.760
And it became the thing that I thought about the most and then was,
um,

1466
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:51.320
an acquired a certain kind of power in my mind.
Um,
so,

1467
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:55.970
so I think that there's a lot more to be done with figuring out how to take

1468
01:34:55.971 --> 01:34:58.400
elements from the experience and

1469
01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:02.750
<v 5>um,
and kind of reify them.
I make them more real and more lasting.</v>

1470
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.751
<v 1>Michael,</v>

1471
01:35:03.751 --> 01:35:08.751
this seems like a good time to get into those personal experiences and I don't

1472
01:35:09.701 --> 01:35:14.620
know where to start,
but I thought since you mentioned themes,
images,
insights,

1473
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:17.380
we could use that as a jumping off point.

1474
01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.940
And you could start wherever you'd like to start really.
But,
uh,

1475
01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:24.960
I would be very curious to hear you describe any of your experiences that,

1476
01:35:25.570 --> 01:35:28.120
that,
uh,
ended up being very meaningful for you.

1477
01:35:28.230 --> 01:35:32.520
<v 5>Sure.
Yeah.
Um,
you know,
it's funny,
I said earlier,</v>

1478
01:35:32.521 --> 01:35:34.450
I approached the,
uh,

1479
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.910
my psychedelic journeys with a lot of trepidation and I approached the writing

1480
01:35:38.911 --> 01:35:42.750
of them with a lot of trepidation.
I'll after the fact because I,
you know,

1481
01:35:42.751 --> 01:35:46.290
I didn't know that I could,
it's a real literary challenge.
Um,

1482
01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:50.370
if you think about how many trip reports you've read,
there were any good,
um,

1483
01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:53.370
you know,
you can count them on one hand and a,

1484
01:35:53.371 --> 01:35:56.820
so that was the kind of Everest I kept moving toward as I was going through the

1485
01:35:56.821 --> 01:35:57.930
book.
It's like,
oh my God,

1486
01:35:57.931 --> 01:36:01.890
I'm going to have to explain these experiences in the event.

1487
01:36:01.891 --> 01:36:04.590
It turned out to be great fun to write about.
Um,

1488
01:36:04.650 --> 01:36:08.550
I really enjoyed writing about it.
It was,
it was a challenge,
but,
um,

1489
01:36:08.610 --> 01:36:12.000
of the best of the best sore.
Um,
I had,

1490
01:36:12.001 --> 01:36:17.000
just to give you the landscape of it,
um,
I had,
uh,
experiences with,
uh,

1491
01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:19.920
Lsd,
these guided experiences with LSD,

1492
01:36:19.921 --> 01:36:24.350
psilocybin a five Meo DMT and,
uh,

1493
01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:27.620
which is a pretty obscure psychedelic that's made from the,
um,

1494
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:33.540
well that is the smoked venom of the Sonoran desert toad.

1495
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:38.820
Yes.
Somebody figured that out.
Um,
and then,
uh,
Iowasca,
uh,

1496
01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:42.180
a couple,
um,
Iowasca circles.
Um,

1497
01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:47.220
I would say that for me the,
the most,
um,
useful,

1498
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:52.190
insightful experience was a guided silicide been,
um,

1499
01:36:52.410 --> 01:36:57.410
journey where I was trying to approximate the dosage being used in the,

1500
01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.980
um,
uh,
in the above ground trials.
Uh,

1501
01:37:01.981 --> 01:37:05.910
I think I was a little shy of that.
Um,
and uh,

1502
01:37:05.911 --> 01:37:10.410
I worked with a wonderful guide,
a woman on the east coast and,
um,

1503
01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:12.510
what can I say about this experience?

1504
01:37:12.511 --> 01:37:16.680
What was really important about this experience was that,
um,

1505
01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:21.360
I experienced a ego dissolution for the first time.
Um,

1506
01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:26.250
I had read a lot about it and dual consciousness and uh,
uh,

1507
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:30.780
and I was curious to have such an experience and also,
you know,

1508
01:37:30.781 --> 01:37:32.790
very nervous about it.
Um,

1509
01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.360
<v 1>just to pause,
sorry to interject.</v>

1510
01:37:34.361 --> 01:37:39.361
So non dual meaning what that means that you're no longer the the observer.

1511
01:37:40.810 --> 01:37:43.570
<v 5>Yeah.
Normally you know,
where the subject,</v>

1512
01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.660
where they're perceiving subject and everything else is the object of our

1513
01:37:46.661 --> 01:37:47.590
perceptions.
Right.

1514
01:37:47.591 --> 01:37:51.130
And we have this kind of split and that kind of defines our consciousness to a

1515
01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:54.730
large extent.
And uh,
it's rather self selfish way of looking at things.

1516
01:37:54.731 --> 01:37:58.800
But that's most of us look and probably many animals look at things that way
too.

1517
01:37:58.890 --> 01:38:02.850
Uh,
although we don't have much report,
um,
and uh,

1518
01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:06.840
but that nondual consciousness is where that sense of separation,

1519
01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.213
um,

1520
01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:13.160
breaks down either because their other subjects you're aware of,
you know,

1521
01:38:13.170 --> 01:38:15.600
I mean,
I've had an experience where the plants were,

1522
01:38:15.810 --> 01:38:18.570
I realized they had a subjectivity to and they were,

1523
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:22.650
they were looking back at me in a sense.
And,
um,
uh,
that,
that,

1524
01:38:22.651 --> 01:38:27.240
that also tends to break down duel the sense of duality that we go through life

1525
01:38:27.241 --> 01:38:31.430
with.
Um,
so,
so this happened,
um,

1526
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:35.790
you know,
this wasn't always a pleasant experience.
I,
uh,

1527
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:40.990
I took the mushroom was a very large mushroom that I eat with some chocolate.
Um,

1528
01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:44.070
and it was,
and when she,
she was kind of,
um,

1529
01:38:44.370 --> 01:38:46.860
more in the shamonic style of guides,

1530
01:38:46.861 --> 01:38:50.520
as many underground guides aren't really is you have a sense of ceremony more

1531
01:38:50.521 --> 01:38:54.630
than you do in the above ground trials.
Um,
and,
uh,

1532
01:38:54.690 --> 01:38:58.230
initially one of the problems I've had with the underground guides is their

1533
01:38:58.231 --> 01:39:02.640
musical taste,
which is just horrible,

1534
01:39:02.641 --> 01:39:04.290
very often.
I mean,
to me it's,

1535
01:39:04.291 --> 01:39:08.130
it's the kind of music that's fine if you're getting a really high quality

1536
01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:13.260
massage at a,
you know,
a top resort.
But for a psychological experience,

1537
01:39:13.261 --> 01:39:16.920
it seems a little,
um,
uh,
wanting.

1538
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:19.230
And so she put on this piece of,

1539
01:39:19.890 --> 01:39:22.920
of new age claptrap and,
uh,

1540
01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:26.120
and it immediately put me in and I thought it was electronica.

1541
01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.090
I thought it was electronic music.
It turned out not to be.
But,
um,
and I,

1542
01:39:30.091 --> 01:39:35.091
and I immediately put me in this space of a computer or video game.

1543
01:39:35.521 --> 01:39:39.260
I was in a world that had been generated by computers and,

1544
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:43.470
and it was dark and very sleek.
It wasn't scary,

1545
01:39:43.471 --> 01:39:46.920
but it was claustrophobic and just I wanted to be outside.

1546
01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:48.810
So there I was in this,

1547
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:53.370
in this dystopian video game going along and seeing,

1548
01:39:53.371 --> 01:39:58.170
you know,
all these,
uh,
digitally created things.
And,

1549
01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:00.450
you know,
I can imagine somebody who would enjoy this space,

1550
01:40:00.451 --> 01:40:02.220
but it wasn't my space.
And,
uh,

1551
01:40:02.221 --> 01:40:06.270
and I asked her to change the music and it got a little better.
And,
um,

1552
01:40:06.330 --> 01:40:10.680
and as the experience,
uh,
moved on,
I started to get a little anxious that,

1553
01:40:10.681 --> 01:40:14.880
oh my God,
I'm trapped in computer world.
How can I get Outta here?
And,
um,

1554
01:40:14.910 --> 01:40:17.750
but I remembered my flight instructions,
um,

1555
01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:20.400
that's a word used at Hopkins for,

1556
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:24.900
to describe what you're told in the preparation session,
which is if you,

1557
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:28.380
if you see anything scary,
don't try to get away from it.
You know,

1558
01:40:28.381 --> 01:40:32.460
step right up to that monster and say,
what are you doing in my head?

1559
01:40:32.461 --> 01:40:37.360
Or what have you got to teach me?
Um,
and,
uh,
and it's very good advice and,

1560
01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:42.510
or surrender,
you know,
relax your mind and float downstream.
You know,
these,

1561
01:40:42.511 --> 01:40:46.080
all these mantras they give you and there were actually really helpful and I

1562
01:40:46.081 --> 01:40:46.561
realize,
all right,

1563
01:40:46.561 --> 01:40:50.470
I just have to surrender this and I got deeper into the experience.
Um,

1564
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:54.880
and then I,
um,
uh,
am I going too slow to this narrative?
Is this okay?

1565
01:40:55.090 --> 01:41:00.070
This is great.
I'm in no rush.
Okay.
Um,
and then I was,

1566
01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:03.820
it was very powerful for awhile and I was,
um,
uh,

1567
01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.260
getting a little nervous about it and I thought,

1568
01:41:05.261 --> 01:41:07.720
I'm going to take off my eyeshades.
I'm wearing these eye shades.

1569
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:11.710
And one of the great things about the eye shades is there a powerful technology,

1570
01:41:11.711 --> 01:41:15.010
I mean much more powerful than you can imagine.
More powerful than Vr,

1571
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:18.180
virtual reality,
which is not,
they're powerful,
but you know,
it,

1572
01:41:18.181 --> 01:41:20.710
it sends you inside.
So if you take it off,

1573
01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:25.940
and I took it off just to make sure reality was still existing.
Um,
and,

1574
01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:30.070
and to reorient myself.
And also because I had a p,
um,
you know,

1575
01:41:30.071 --> 01:41:33.670
suddenly I saw the,
you know,
the room I was in and,

1576
01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:38.110
and the guide and the plants and the walls and the furniture.
And I was like,

1577
01:41:38.111 --> 01:41:41.990
hi reality,
I love it.
And,
um,
uh,
and,

1578
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.930
but I had to pee and I,
and I went to the,
uh,
uh,

1579
01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:49.030
she was score to me to the bathroom cause I can barely move.
And,
um,

1580
01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:53.170
when I came back and I did definitely didn't want to look in the mirror.

1581
01:41:53.170 --> 01:41:55.500
I was really nervous of what I would see.
And,
uh,

1582
01:41:55.501 --> 01:41:59.440
and I didn't want to look at her either and I was just like a peed,
I produced,

1583
01:41:59.441 --> 01:42:04.441
this describes the spectacular crop of diamonds because everything had this beam

1584
01:42:04.541 --> 01:42:09.190
of light that was,
you know,
being addressed directly to me.
Um,

1585
01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:11.890
and then I came back and she said,
did I want to boost booster dose?

1586
01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.080
And I said yes.
Uh,

1587
01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:18.070
and I looked at her for the first time as she was kneeling next to me and she

1588
01:42:18.071 --> 01:42:23.050
holds out her hands and other mushroom and she has transformed.

1589
01:42:23.051 --> 01:42:26.010
She's normally blonde and she had in her hair,

1590
01:42:26.011 --> 01:42:30.370
had turned black and she was this old Mexican Indian.
And she had,

1591
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:32.590
she had morphed into Maria Sabina,

1592
01:42:32.591 --> 01:42:37.591
this legendary figure in secondary history who gave Gordon Wasson the,

1593
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:39.220
the,
uh,
the first person,

1594
01:42:39.221 --> 01:42:43.640
first Westerner to ever try psilocybin his ceremony in,
in,
uh,

1595
01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:46.210
well Haka back in the 50s.

1596
01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:50.590
And she had turned into this person and her hands were leathery and her face was

1597
01:42:50.591 --> 01:42:53.680
stretched over her cheekbones,
who was quite shocking.
And I,

1598
01:42:53.681 --> 01:42:56.440
and I had to look away and I didn't want to tell her what had happened to her.

1599
01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:58.950
Um,
so I take this,
uh,

1600
01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.790
stepped up dose and when I do that and then I go back under and I put on the,

1601
01:43:03.850 --> 01:43:08.320
um,
uh,
the shades,
the eyeshades again,
um,

1602
01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:13.440
I have this sense of,
um,
disillusion,
um,

1603
01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:18.480
that my identity has just exploded into a thousand little slips of paper,

1604
01:43:20.021 --> 01:43:21.880
like,
like little postits.

1605
01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.980
And I was watching it just get blown to the wind.
And,
um,

1606
01:43:27.010 --> 01:43:31.750
but I wasn't panicking.
I had no desire to,
to reassemble,
you know,

1607
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:35.920
collect all the paper and put it back in a pile.
It was like,
no,
this is fine.

1608
01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:37.560
And um,

1609
01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:41.560
I realized that that's what was happening and there was nothing to be done but

1610
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:46.590
surrender to it and that my sense of self was falling apart before my eyes.

1611
01:43:47.410 --> 01:43:52.410
But what does that mean?
How can your sense of self,
who's my,
who's,

1612
01:43:52.650 --> 01:43:54.710
who's perceiving this?
Um,

1613
01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:58.550
and then it got even more extreme and I saw myself,
uh,

1614
01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:03.500
spread out over the landscape,
like a coat of paint or butter.
Um,

1615
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:08.480
and I was totally fine with it.
That was the kind of most amazing thing.

1616
01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:13.500
And I can't explain what exactly happened because my ego was out there,

1617
01:44:14.421 --> 01:44:16.910
but there was still an eye to take in the scene.

1618
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:21.590
And the lesson of it was that,
you know,
what had,

1619
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:26.000
what should have felt like this personal cataclysm,

1620
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:31.730
total loss himself.
There was no category labeled personal anymore.

1621
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:36.850
And I was able to perceive this whole scene with this dispassionate objectivity

1622
01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:39.170
was like,
that's the way it is.

1623
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:42.650
Unperturbed and it was this new,

1624
01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:46.500
I hadn't had access to this amazing vantage point.
Um,

1625
01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.790
and it made me realize I'm not identical to my ego,

1626
01:44:50.170 --> 01:44:53.300
that chattering voice in our head that accompanies us most of the time.

1627
01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:57.140
It's kind of neurotic and can be annoying,
but it's useful to,
I mean,
you know,

1628
01:44:57.141 --> 01:45:00.530
your ego is what gets the book written.
Um,
but,
uh,

1629
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:04.310
but I had completely separated from it and I hadn't been annihilated.

1630
01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:05.660
That was the amazing thing.

1631
01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:11.180
So that to me was the big takeaway from this experience.

1632
01:45:11.181 --> 01:45:13.640
There were other things that happened.
I had a,
uh,

1633
01:45:13.650 --> 01:45:16.400
a much happier experience with music toward the end,

1634
01:45:16.850 --> 01:45:19.670
after constantly fighting with Mary name,

1635
01:45:19.671 --> 01:45:22.130
I give it the guide about her musical tastes.

1636
01:45:22.131 --> 01:45:25.540
We finally agreed and she put on these buck,
uh,

1637
01:45:25.541 --> 01:45:30.080
unaccompanied cello suites,
which are,
you know,
it's a Yoyo Ma recording.

1638
01:45:30.081 --> 01:45:34.390
It's just,
they're stunning and they're depressing.
That really mournful,

1639
01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:38.480
infinitely sad pieces of music.
Um,
just to chill or nothing else.

1640
01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:39.973
Um,

1641
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:44.150
and now that I was in this non dual state,

1642
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:48.500
uh,
to listen to music,
I mean,
those words don't describe what happens.

1643
01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:51.890
It's to become music,
you become identical with the music.

1644
01:45:51.891 --> 01:45:56.270
And I became identical at various times with the,
the bow,
the horse hair bow,

1645
01:45:56.271 --> 01:45:59.980
you know,
surfing over those strings of that cello.
And then I,

1646
01:45:59.981 --> 01:46:03.560
I went into the cello and,
and you know,
that mouth of space,

1647
01:46:03.561 --> 01:46:07.950
that's where all those vibrations come from.
And,
um,
had a,

1648
01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:12.960
a total mystical merging with this piece of music and to listen to this music

1649
01:46:13.101 --> 01:46:16.400
now sends chills up my spine because I had,

1650
01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:19.040
it wasn't Yoyo Ma,
it wasn't Bob.

1651
01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:23.870
It was like this universe and I was of it.
Um,

1652
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:28.820
so what does that all mean?
You know?
Um,
ah,

1653
01:46:28.850 --> 01:46:30.230
it was,
um,

1654
01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:35.060
a powerful lesson in,
uh,

1655
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:37.430
the role of our ego I think in our lives.

1656
01:46:37.431 --> 01:46:40.370
And that's what I talked about the next day when I came back for the integration

1657
01:46:40.371 --> 01:46:42.500
session.
Um,
I said I had,

1658
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:47.210
I realized that there might be another ground on which to plant our feet besides

1659
01:46:47.211 --> 01:46:51.540
this ego self interested.
And,
um,

1660
01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:55.380
but I didn't know what to do with it because my ego was back on patrol,
you know,

1661
01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:59.640
pretty quickly.
Um,
you know,
doing its usual thing,
keeping,
you know,

1662
01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:04.670
my unconscious at bay and making me understand that I am me and that's somebody

1663
01:47:04.891 --> 01:47:09.180
else and all,
all the stuff that does.
But she said,
and it was interesting,

1664
01:47:09.181 --> 01:47:09.751
she said,
well,

1665
01:47:09.751 --> 01:47:14.751
you've had the experience of not reacting as your ego normally would that,

1666
01:47:14.971 --> 01:47:17.550
that,
you know,
because the ego is kind of trigger happy,
right?

1667
01:47:17.551 --> 01:47:20.820
It's defensive by definition.
It,
it,
it,
it,
it,
Marshall's,

1668
01:47:20.821 --> 01:47:24.780
all your defenses and your supposedly in your interest and sometimes it is in

1669
01:47:24.781 --> 01:47:25.614
your interest,

1670
01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:30.950
but that I'd had a taste of what it was like to not be the victim of those

1671
01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:36.060
trigger reactions.
And she said,
that's something you can cultivate.
And,

1672
01:47:36.090 --> 01:47:40.980
uh,
and I've been cultivating it ever since.
Um,
so that was,
for me,

1673
01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:45.090
that was big news.
That was a big insight for me.
And,
um,

1674
01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:46.840
and I think about that a lot and I,

1675
01:47:46.841 --> 01:47:51.841
and I think it has to some extent changed my relationship to my ego.

1676
01:47:52.381 --> 01:47:53.660
I can,
um,

1677
01:47:54.010 --> 01:47:59.010
I know when he's up to his old tricks sometimes and I can spot it and sometimes

1678
01:47:59.311 --> 01:48:03.840
I can,
um,
put him in his place.
Um,
and that's useful.
Now,

1679
01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:08.730
you know,
30 years of psychoanalysis,
you could probably get to the same place.

1680
01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:12.240
Um,
you do a lot of work on your ego,
but this,

1681
01:48:12.241 --> 01:48:16.350
I didn't four hours or five hours.
Um,
so that was,
uh,
I,
I,

1682
01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:19.440
I now look back on that as a,
um,

1683
01:48:19.530 --> 01:48:24.530
a very positive experience that taught me something important that also gave me

1684
01:48:25.530 --> 01:48:29.480
a,
I mean,
it was a spiritual experience and I'm not someone who,

1685
01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:31.200
who's had a lot of them.
Um,

1686
01:48:31.230 --> 01:48:36.230
but that merging with the music was as powerful as spiritual experiences I've

1687
01:48:36.571 --> 01:48:40.890
had.
And it also gave me a little insight into what is spiritual experience.

1688
01:48:40.891 --> 01:48:44.400
You know,
that term is always kind of mystified me.
Um,

1689
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.830
and I think it's no different.
I mean,

1690
01:48:46.831 --> 01:48:50.820
I hate to put it in the psychodynamic terms and I don't mean to demean anyone's

1691
01:48:50.821 --> 01:48:54.060
more,
um,
mystical understanding of it.

1692
01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:57.060
But to me it's,
uh,
Mr,
uh,

1693
01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:02.120
mystical or spiritual experience is what happens when your ego is put aside,

1694
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.823
um,

1695
01:49:05.230 --> 01:49:09.960
a spiritual experiences about a sense of merging with something larger than you

1696
01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.640
and it's your ego that stands in the way.
And,
um,

1697
01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:16.360
to the extent that you can subdue it or,

1698
01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:20.820
or just put it off to the side for a few hours,
amazing things happen.

1699
01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:21.630
Um,

1700
01:49:21.630 --> 01:49:26.430
and you realize that you are a part of a larger entity and that the mind of Bach

1701
01:49:26.431 --> 01:49:30.750
or Yoyo Mas completely accessible to you.
And,
um,

1702
01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:32.850
uh,
and that was a big deal too.

1703
01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:40.440
So wild.
I,
it's hard for me to even respond to that because as you noted,

1704
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:43.300
I thought you did it very masterful job of,

1705
01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:45.780
of describing these experiences in the book.

1706
01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:48.790
If one of the hallmarks of mystical experience

1707
01:49:49.330 --> 01:49:52.400
<v 1>is ineffability,
it poses a,</v>

1708
01:49:52.401 --> 01:49:57.401
a quite a challenge challenge to put into prose.

1709
01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:02.200
Uh,
and I think that if we think about frozen words also,

1710
01:50:02.201 --> 01:50:06.070
you mentioned the psychotherapy and certainly there's absolutely a role to be

1711
01:50:06.071 --> 01:50:08.920
played in a function for many of these other modalities.

1712
01:50:09.610 --> 01:50:13.870
But it strikes me that they're not mutually exclusive,
but these,

1713
01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:18.900
these very difficult to describe psychedelic experiences allow people oftentimes

1714
01:50:18.911 --> 01:50:22.330
to feel things or to embody things,

1715
01:50:22.331 --> 01:50:27.331
to experience things that would be very hard to talk themselves to as a

1716
01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:33.060
gingerbread trail to a conclusion that then allows them to intellectually he's

1717
01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.280
change their behavior or relationship to their ego.
Things like that.

1718
01:50:36.281 --> 01:50:39.730
I mean there are certain things that are difficult to talk your way out of if

1719
01:50:39.731 --> 01:50:44.110
you didn't talk your way into them.
And I'm fascinated by our hope,

1720
01:50:44.111 --> 01:50:47.110
hope to certainly learn more about why these,

1721
01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:50.320
why did these things seem to have the effect that they do and our understanding

1722
01:50:50.321 --> 01:50:53.080
is so partial.
Uh,
but looking at,

1723
01:50:53.081 --> 01:50:54.880
say you mentioned the treatment resistant depression.

1724
01:50:54.881 --> 01:50:57.990
There's a study at Hopkins also that I've been involved with,
uh,

1725
01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:03.700
for the last year,
a year,
year and a half.
Uh,
and the,

1726
01:51:03.701 --> 01:51:04.940
for instance,
there's a,
if,

1727
01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:07.420
if anyone's interested in throwing their hat in the ring,

1728
01:51:07.421 --> 01:51:11.230
there's an unfunded study,
uh,
at this point at Hopkins,

1729
01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:15.250
they're considering looking at Alzheimer's and even the potential.

1730
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:19.000
But I think they would be looking mostly at its affects on depression and

1731
01:51:19.001 --> 01:51:22.770
anxiety,
but there are some people who have,
uh,

1732
01:51:22.810 --> 01:51:27.730
postulated that there may be a role in neurogenesis,
in the hippocampus.

1733
01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:32.650
Uh,
uh,
Eh,
we're an effect at least from psilocybin,

1734
01:51:32.651 --> 01:51:37.390
which is really a tantalizing of course.
I mean,
selfishly speaking,

1735
01:51:37.391 --> 01:51:40.660
I have Alzheimer's on both sides of my family.
Some of an acute interest in that.

1736
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:45.430
But if we,
if we zoom out from the,
these individual studies,
uh,

1737
01:51:45.850 --> 01:51:50.850
have you thought about how these drugs,

1738
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:51.731
this,
these,

1739
01:51:51.731 --> 01:51:56.731
these classes might intersect with broader societal opportunities or threats,

1740
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:05.800
uh,
at all?
Uh,
I mean,
and not pie in the sky

1741
01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:10.550
<v 5>nature or anything like that to avoid that.
Um,
you know,</v>

1742
01:52:10.610 --> 01:52:14.240
I mean we have pathologies at the individual level and we have pathologies at

1743
01:52:14.241 --> 01:52:19.130
the,
at the civilizational level or the national level.
Um,
and,

1744
01:52:19.190 --> 01:52:23.660
uh,
what's striking to me is that the two biggest,

1745
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:27.620
I think the two biggest challenges we face as a,

1746
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:32.540
as a culture are the environmental crisis and,

1747
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:35.870
um,
tribalism.
There are other words you could put on that,

1748
01:52:35.871 --> 01:52:38.210
but let's use tribalism.
Um,

1749
01:52:39.650 --> 01:52:44.650
both of which are functions of ego consciousness in that what we do to nature

1750
01:52:47.181 --> 01:52:52.181
has a lot to do with the fact that we objectify nature and that we think of

1751
01:52:52.221 --> 01:52:55.610
ourselves as the only subject and everything else is an object.

1752
01:52:55.611 --> 01:53:00.530
Therefore for our use.
Um,
same with uh,

1753
01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:05.080
um,
tribalism.
That too is a sense of uh,

1754
01:53:05.210 --> 01:53:09.410
you know,
an ego patrolling a border on that.

1755
01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:14.000
Everything on this side is us and we will protect it and everything on that side

1756
01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:18.920
we're in a zero sum contest with,
so these drugs,
you know,

1757
01:53:18.921 --> 01:53:23.921
offer an antidote to both those ways of thinking and it is no accident.

1758
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:29.630
I'm sure that the uh,
the fact that the 60s,
you know,

1759
01:53:29.631 --> 01:53:33.680
represented the birth of environmentalism,
um,
yes there was,
you know,

1760
01:53:33.681 --> 01:53:37.490
Rachel Carson and the Cuyahoga River on fire and all the other things that were

1761
01:53:37.491 --> 01:53:38.121
happening then.

1762
01:53:38.121 --> 01:53:41.960
But second Delek consciousness also may have contributed to environmental

1763
01:53:41.961 --> 01:53:46.160
consciousness because one of the things that happens is that the world becomes

1764
01:53:46.161 --> 01:53:50.570
animate in a way it wasn't before and that the plants and the animals and the

1765
01:53:50.571 --> 01:53:55.280
fungi all have their points of view too.
And you feel very connected,

1766
01:53:55.460 --> 01:54:00.230
uh,
in a way that makes it hard to be destructive.
Um,

1767
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:04.070
and same with people.
I mean,
you feel connected to all different kinds of people.

1768
01:54:04.071 --> 01:54:08.210
So,
you know,
I'm not suggesting we need to put these drugs in the water supply.

1769
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:12.650
Um,
there might be some individuals that we can all think of who would benefit

1770
01:54:12.651 --> 01:54:16.980
enormously if they were willing to undergo this sort of therapy.
Um,

1771
01:54:17.210 --> 01:54:19.070
but they're,

1772
01:54:19.071 --> 01:54:23.480
I think they're extremely relevant to the moment we're in and the problems were

1773
01:54:23.481 --> 01:54:24.380
struggling with.

1774
01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:29.120
And perhaps it's no accident that this renaissance is coming about at the time

1775
01:54:29.121 --> 01:54:29.954
it is.

1776
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:35.870
<v 1>You mentioned the drinking water.
Uh,
let's,
let's talk about it for a second.</v>

1777
01:54:35.871 --> 01:54:39.920
So there are,
uh,
there are,
I've observed,

1778
01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:45.580
as I'm sure you have people who are a militant proselytizers of psychedelics who

1779
01:54:49.870 --> 01:54:53.660
are,
are,
are prone to the same type of rhetoric.

1780
01:54:53.661 --> 01:54:56.960
That seemed to cause a lot of trouble in a,

1781
01:54:56.990 --> 01:55:01.160
in the earlier iteration of all of this and the,
in the 60s,

1782
01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:03.170
putting it in the drinking water,
making it legal.

1783
01:55:03.171 --> 01:55:07.110
You want to go to seven 11 and just get the Lsd smoothie,
uh,

1784
01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:10.400
seems like a bad idea to me.
Then you have people on the,

1785
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:13.040
on the far other end of the spectrum,
uh,

1786
01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:17.030
certainly in not too distant history,

1787
01:55:17.031 --> 01:55:22.031
who would not even consider publishing a scientific study involving psychedelics

1788
01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:27.110
wouldn't even consider the scientific merit of a study.
And we,
we,

1789
01:55:27.150 --> 01:55:29.890
we seem to be in a very,
uh,

1790
01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:34.900
well as you put it at renaissance where the research is finally being done to

1791
01:55:35.451 --> 01:55:40.040
clarify the mechanisms of action and the,
the,
the,
the potential,

1792
01:55:40.041 --> 01:55:43.130
but also the risks of these,
of these drugs.

1793
01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:47.580
And it's so exciting to me having really spent so much time as you have looking

1794
01:55:47.581 --> 01:55:52.030
at this,
what are the ways that people can screw this up?
Uh,

1795
01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:56.310
do you know what I mean?
Because it's just,
I really,

1796
01:55:56.311 --> 01:56:01.311
really think we have an incredible opportunity to decipher how these plants and

1797
01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:08.820
compensative in many cases existed while certainly existed,

1798
01:56:08.821 --> 01:56:13.821
but been consumed for millennia and how they fit into a world that is bursting

1799
01:56:14.401 --> 01:56:17.370
at the seams with not decreasing,

1800
01:56:17.371 --> 01:56:20.730
but increasing prevalence of certain types of mental health problems and other

1801
01:56:20.731 --> 01:56:22.620
issues.
It's,
it just,

1802
01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:27.300
it's such an opportunity that I don't want to see wasted.
Uh,

1803
01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:29.850
how can people screwed up?
And what would you,

1804
01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:34.260
is there anything given your ask of people up?
Certainly I would say to people,

1805
01:56:34.261 --> 01:56:34.861
don't go,

1806
01:56:34.861 --> 01:56:39.861
don't find some shaman on like casual encounters on craigslist,

1807
01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:42.380
uh,
and order mail order.

1808
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:46.880
God knows what from the dark web and just decide to do it with your friends on a

1809
01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:49.170
weekend.
A terrible,
terrible,
terrible idea among others.

1810
01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:54.220
<v 5>And,
and,
and,
you know,
going down to Peru and with the first,
you know,
Sean,</v>

1811
01:56:54.230 --> 01:56:58.010
you meet,
I mean,
there've been horrible stories coming out of Peru,
you know,

1812
01:56:58.011 --> 01:57:00.350
sexual assault of women.
And,
uh,

1813
01:57:00.410 --> 01:57:05.410
there was a murder the other day involving a healer and in Peru.

1814
01:57:05.690 --> 01:57:10.010
Um,
so I think carelessness is the great threat.
Um,

1815
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:14.070
and I think carelessness is part of what doomed,
uh,

1816
01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:17.780
psychedelics in the 60s or temporarily doing them in the 60s.
You know,

1817
01:57:17.781 --> 01:57:21.650
one of the great lessons,
if you,
if you study history,
is that,
um,

1818
01:57:21.710 --> 01:57:26.710
until our own time when psychedelics came along and we didn't have any sort of

1819
01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:31.930
conventions or rules to govern their use,
uh,

1820
01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:35.840
and many people to get into trouble and the psychedelics themselves,
you know,

1821
01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:39.650
ignited a catalyzed to kind of backlash.
Um,

1822
01:57:39.710 --> 01:57:44.480
but you go in history and you see that,
um,
these powerful substances were,

1823
01:57:44.481 --> 01:57:48.860
were only used in a very controlled,
um,

1824
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:50.690
considered way.

1825
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:54.500
And that you didn't have individuals taking them on their own.

1826
01:57:54.590 --> 01:57:59.260
There was always a circle.
There were always elders.
There was the showman,

1827
01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:01.990
there was the person who had lots of experience of the,

1828
01:58:01.991 --> 01:58:06.710
of the territory administering it to people.
Um,
it was always,

1829
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:11.210
uh,
organized in a ritual.
There was a ceremony,
um,

1830
01:58:11.211 --> 01:58:13.220
all these cultural forms,

1831
01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:16.770
I'm not saying those ones are right and we should simply,
uh,

1832
01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:19.580
adapt those or adopt those.
Um,

1833
01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:22.070
they may not be right to western culture.

1834
01:58:22.071 --> 01:58:25.610
We may have to come up with our own rituals,
our own ceremonies,

1835
01:58:25.611 --> 01:58:28.250
our own rules of the road for these drugs.

1836
01:58:28.730 --> 01:58:32.000
And I think that to some extent that was the failure of the 60s.

1837
01:58:32.490 --> 01:58:34.220
Now I don't want to paint it with a broad brush.

1838
01:58:34.221 --> 01:58:38.720
There are many people who had wonderful experiences with psychedelics in the 60s

1839
01:58:39.110 --> 01:58:44.020
who had important and,
and,
and,
and created a,
you know,

1840
01:58:44.021 --> 01:58:46.150
great art as a result of their experiences.

1841
01:58:46.150 --> 01:58:49.620
But for the culture as a whole,
it,
it,

1842
01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:52.150
it led to this backlash and a,

1843
01:58:52.170 --> 01:58:56.020
and a and a fair amount of suffering and also the loss of 30 years of good

1844
01:58:56.021 --> 01:58:58.420
research that we could have been doing.
Um,

1845
01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:02.530
and I think that had to do with the fact that we did not have a proper cultural

1846
01:59:02.531 --> 01:59:06.730
container.
Um,
so the question we now face is,
what is that container?

1847
01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:10.960
One of them is the medical system.
That's the path that they are on it.

1848
01:59:10.961 --> 01:59:14.500
And why you and Hopkins,
I don't think that's the only path.

1849
01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:17.680
I agree strongly with Bob.
Jesse,
who's,
you know,

1850
01:59:17.681 --> 01:59:22.570
one of the motive forces behind the revival of research,
who,
who says,

1851
01:59:22.571 --> 01:59:25.510
you know,
yes,
there are people who are suffering and we have to help them,

1852
01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:30.610
but these drugs are also good for what he calls the betterment of well,
people,

1853
01:59:31.630 --> 01:59:34.360
people like myself,
people like yourself.
Um,

1854
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:36.810
and that it would be a shame if they're used,

1855
01:59:36.811 --> 01:59:40.630
was restricted only to toward people with,
um,
you know,

1856
01:59:40.631 --> 01:59:43.750
DSM diagnoses of one kind or another.
Um,

1857
01:59:43.751 --> 01:59:48.310
so what's the proper vessel for them?
Is it,
is it a religious festival vessel?

1858
01:59:48.311 --> 01:59:53.080
Well,
that's not comfortable with everybody.
Um,
we need to figure this out.
Um,

1859
01:59:53.170 --> 01:59:53.501
you know,

1860
01:59:53.501 --> 01:59:58.501
the Greeks apparently used a psychedelic and the mysteries of Leu cysts of the

1861
01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:03.070
Luc and mysteries is,
they're called,
was a,
was an annual,
right,

1862
02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:08.410
where everyone who wanted to in the culture,
well,
not the,
not the slaves,

1863
02:00:08.411 --> 02:00:11.920
but not just the elite used,
uh,
something called the [inaudible],

1864
02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:16.120
which was a psychedelic apparently.
And they had visions and they went to the,

1865
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:19.900
you know,
the afterworld or the underworld.
And,
um,

1866
02:00:20.230 --> 02:00:22.720
it was a very powerful annual,
right.

1867
02:00:23.410 --> 02:00:27.790
You were not allowed to use the Kiki on any other time.
In fact,

1868
02:00:27.791 --> 02:00:28.810
somebody wants did,

1869
02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:33.280
they got ahold of some and they had a party and they were severely punished for

1870
02:00:33.281 --> 02:00:38.170
doing this because they understood that this had to be taken in the best

1871
02:00:38.171 --> 02:00:43.150
interest of the whole society in a way that was,
um,
carefully regulated.

1872
02:00:43.570 --> 02:00:48.240
Um,
and so I think that's where we find ourselves.
I think that the,
um,
uh,

1873
02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:53.250
is figuring out a way to use these drugs to make them accessible to more people,

1874
02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:58.370
um,
but to contain their risks,
uh,
and to,
um,

1875
02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:00.660
how's them in a,
um,
uh,

1876
02:01:00.661 --> 02:01:05.240
a cultural form that's appropriate to them and appropriate to us.
Um,

1877
02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:09.100
that I think is how you prevent,
um,
uh,

1878
02:01:09.101 --> 02:01:11.440
the kind of carelessness that led to trouble.
You know,
I mean,

1879
02:01:11.441 --> 02:01:15.970
I think leary is sin if he had one was giving up on the idea of a guide and,

1880
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.840
um,
uh,
and I think that the,
the guide,
whether it's,
you know,

1881
02:01:19.841 --> 02:01:24.520
a friend who stays close to ground or somebody preferably very well trained and

1882
02:01:24.521 --> 02:01:28.510
experienced,
um,
makes all the difference.
Um,

1883
02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:33.150
and especially as you get older,
I think where you're less of a risk taker,
um,

1884
02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:35.560
people in their twenties,
we'll do the craziest things.
I mean,

1885
02:01:35.561 --> 02:01:38.920
look at the way they drive,
let alone the way they take drugs.
Um,

1886
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:43.790
but as you get older,
um,
working with a guide is a,
um,
uh,

1887
02:01:44.210 --> 02:01:47.570
is at least it was for me.
Um,
made the experience,

1888
02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:52.010
created a space in which I could surrender and,
and put down all my defenses.

1889
02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:55.850
I'm not going to do that,
you know,
walking around Manhattan.
Um,

1890
02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:00.990
and so we have a lot of work to do,
designing the experience,
uh,

1891
02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:02.960
and understanding what the drugs are doing,

1892
02:02:02.961 --> 02:02:07.961
but designing the experience in a way that is safe and conducive to the kind of,

1893
02:02:08.150 --> 02:02:10.700
um,
uh,
work we want to do.

1894
02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:17.470
<v 1>Such an exciting area of,
of exploration.
I'm cautiously optimistic.</v>

1895
02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:22.150
I am too.
I am too cautiously optimistic and I,

1896
02:02:22.151 --> 02:02:27.151
you and I have both interviewed people and heard these stories of

1897
02:02:28.001 --> 02:02:29.950
transformation,
not just anecdotal,

1898
02:02:29.951 --> 02:02:34.840
but also in very controlled scientific environments.
And,

1899
02:02:34.841 --> 02:02:36.790
uh,
you also hear stories as I'm sure you have.

1900
02:02:36.791 --> 02:02:40.450
I heard a story recently and I was talking about the phase three trials with

1901
02:02:40.451 --> 02:02:45.370
someone and a their nephew who is a,
I want to say

1902
02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:50.410
18 or 19,
probably getting the age wrong,

1903
02:02:50.411 --> 02:02:52.270
doesn't really matter for the purposes of illustrating,

1904
02:02:52.271 --> 02:02:56.620
but he has his suffered from severe OCD for many years,

1905
02:02:56.621 --> 02:03:00.430
which has been debilitating.
Smart Kid,
did a ton of research,

1906
02:03:00.431 --> 02:03:02.140
went on to pub med,

1907
02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:07.440
ultimately determined that from mc he thought silicide might be a tool to help,

1908
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.460
uh,
mitigate his OCD.
And it worked.

1909
02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:15.700
But due to the legal classification,

1910
02:03:15.730 --> 02:03:19.540
he was caught with mushrooms and expelled from school.

1911
02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:23.800
And it's just so tragic in a case like that,

1912
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:28.830
that these tools are not available to those who could benefit.

1913
02:03:29.770 --> 02:03:34.750
And I really hope that people will,
uh,

1914
02:03:34.751 --> 02:03:38.260
at the very least consider the importance of scientifically exploring these

1915
02:03:38.261 --> 02:03:43.120
things.
And there's so many different angles of a examination,

1916
02:03:43.121 --> 02:03:46.150
but that's,
that's certainly one,
at the very least,
I mean,

1917
02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:51.400
supporting those who are attempting to understand how these things do what they

1918
02:03:51.401 --> 02:03:56.380
do.
Um,
and I have to commend you for putting this book together.

1919
02:03:56.410 --> 02:03:58.960
And I mentioned this to you in person some time ago,

1920
02:03:58.961 --> 02:04:03.961
but there was simultaneously great relief and great kind of hand to the forehead

1921
02:04:05.831 --> 02:04:08.080
because you,
you saved me from attempting to write,

1922
02:04:08.081 --> 02:04:13.081
w would have no doubt been a far inferior books.

1923
02:04:13.271 --> 02:04:18.271
So I really appreciate you taking the time and also the,

1924
02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:19.413
the uh,

1925
02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:24.490
bringing on board and not relinquishing your skepticism as you explore this

1926
02:04:24.491 --> 02:04:28.540
entire world and the subject matter.
I really think that it is,

1927
02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:32.950
it is such a critical subject.
It's such a critical time.

1928
02:04:32.951 --> 02:04:36.340
So I not only,
and I'm not,
I don't get any,
uh,

1929
02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:40.390
vig on certainly up recommend people read it themselves.
But it's,
it's,
it's,

1930
02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:44.700
it's a book that I think is mind expanding on so many levels.

1931
02:04:44.730 --> 02:04:49.730
Even if you never have any interest in consuming a psychedelic of any type,

1932
02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:51.960
uh,
it is a,

1933
02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:57.590
it is an incredible lens through which to learn more about the mind and more

1934
02:04:59.251 --> 02:05:03.690
about ultimately your entire experience of reality is,
is,
is a,

1935
02:05:03.691 --> 02:05:04.620
as far as we know,

1936
02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:08.820
is filtered through this thing we hold between our ears.

1937
02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:13.050
So it getting to know it better,
uh,

1938
02:05:13.080 --> 02:05:15.540
certainly seems in everyone's best interest.
But,
um,

1939
02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:20.280
I really appreciate all the time that you've taken today and a hope we can talk

1940
02:05:20.281 --> 02:05:24.330
about this many more times.
But,
uh,
besides,
besides people reading the book,

1941
02:05:24.331 --> 02:05:28.140
which everyone should,
I really,
it's,
it's,
I've read many of your books.

1942
02:05:28.141 --> 02:05:31.060
It is my favorite of your books.
Uh,

1943
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:36.000
it's such a difficult tightrope to walk and he,
and you really,

1944
02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:39.600
you really did an excellent job and so many ways.
Uh,

1945
02:05:39.630 --> 02:05:44.400
do you have any parting comments,
suggestions,
asks of the audience?

1946
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:50.820
<v 5>You know,
it's funny people have asked me or am I an advocate for a second,</v>

1947
02:05:50.821 --> 02:05:54.960
Alex and,
um,
and,
and the answer is no,
not yet.

1948
02:05:55.260 --> 02:05:57.900
Um,
I'm an advocate,
as you just said.

1949
02:05:57.901 --> 02:06:01.950
I thought you said quite eloquently the research we have to support the
research.

1950
02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:07.250
There is enormous potential here.
Um,
but it's still has a long way to go.
Um,

1951
02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:11.070
we haven't answered all the questions.
Uh,
as you say,

1952
02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:16.100
this is a book and this is an enterprise speaking larger than the book up to

1953
02:06:16.801 --> 02:06:19.830
understand the mind.
It's not to understand psychedelics.

1954
02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:23.880
Psychedelics are a tool is Stanislav Grof said all those years ago.

1955
02:06:24.690 --> 02:06:29.690
They are a really powerful tool to understand the mind and potentially your

1956
02:06:30.781 --> 02:06:34.710
mind.
Um,
and so,
uh,
you know,

1957
02:06:34.711 --> 02:06:39.660
I think keep,
keep abreast of the research,
read some of these papers,

1958
02:06:39.661 --> 02:06:44.280
read some of Robin Carhart,
Harris has papers.
Um,
and uh,

1959
02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:46.820
and you know,
they're more books to be written about it to him.

1960
02:06:46.830 --> 02:06:48.240
I don't think you should give up on that idea.

1961
02:06:48.241 --> 02:06:52.920
I think you should just wait a little bit.
Uh,
there's so much to be said.

1962
02:06:52.921 --> 02:06:53.520
It is such,

1963
02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:58.150
I feel like I got every now and then as a writer you get lucky and you hit the

1964
02:06:58.380 --> 02:07:03.300
right type of topic at the right moment.
And I just felt like,
oh my God,

1965
02:07:03.301 --> 02:07:06.330
I'm a kid in a candy store.
I have this amazing subject.

1966
02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:11.280
I'm learning so many things I didn't know.
Um,
and uh,

1967
02:07:11.281 --> 02:07:15.630
it was the most exciting experiences I've had as a writer and a,
and I'm hoping,

1968
02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:17.460
you know,
that the reader feels the same way.

1969
02:07:18.230 --> 02:07:22.460
<v 1>Yeah.
You paddled,
you paddle for the wave at the right time.
Uh,
I think,
and,
uh,</v>

1970
02:07:22.461 --> 02:07:23.294
for,

1971
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.680
for everybody listening is I alluded to earlier,

1972
02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:32.410
I will include links to not only the book,
but,
uh,
some of the studies like the,

1973
02:07:32.411 --> 02:07:36.640
the entropic brain and everything that we talked about.

1974
02:07:36.670 --> 02:07:40.840
I will include links to the,
uh,
the international.
Absolutely.
I'll,

1975
02:07:40.841 --> 02:07:43.480
I'll include links to all of those things in the show notes,

Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

2003
02:09:20.610 --> 02:09:23.220
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2004
02:09:23.550 --> 02:09:26.490
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2005
02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:29.130
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday?

2006
02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:33.660
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

2007
02:09:33.661 --> 02:09:38.280
Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that

2008
02:09:38.281 --> 02:09:39.840
I've been pondering over the week.

2009
02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:42.870
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2010
02:09:42.871 --> 02:09:46.320
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2011
02:09:46.321 --> 02:09:50.610
somehow dug up in the other world of the esoteric as I do.

2012
02:09:50.910 --> 02:09:55.910
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2013
02:09:56.551 --> 02:09:59.280
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

2014
02:09:59.370 --> 02:10:04.350
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend,

2015
02:10:04.410 --> 02:10:06.600
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2016
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:11.520
Just go to a four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

2017
02:10:11.521 --> 02:10:15.660

This episode is brought to you by helix sleep.

2019
02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:24.840
Last year I committed to making sleep a top priority,

2020
02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:30.090
trying to fix onset insomnia or continuing to fix that depth of sleep,

2021
02:10:30.091 --> 02:10:32.100
quality of sleep.
I tracked a lot,

2022
02:10:32.101 --> 02:10:37.101
I tested a lot and I revisited really everything from daily routine to the

2023
02:10:37.761 --> 02:10:40.520
surfaces.
I slept on playing with the chilly pad,
whatever.

2024
02:10:40.730 --> 02:10:45.710
And when I moved to Austin I got all new beds including mattresses from Helix,

2025
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:49.460
working with the world's leading sleep experts.
Certainly some of them.

2026
02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:51.290
He looks sleep development mattresses,

2027
02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:54.980
personalized to your preferences and sleep style to make sure that you can have

2028
02:10:54.981 --> 02:10:59.420
the best sleep possible without costing thousands upon thousands of dollars.

2029
02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:01.910
Helix sleep has recently added a new layer,

2030
02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:04.160
customized sleep with the helix pillow,

2031
02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:07.940
you all new pillows are fully adjustable so you can achieve perfect comfort

2032
02:11:07.941 --> 02:11:11.870
regardless of sleep position or body type or if you're a shifty type like me,

2033
02:11:11.871 --> 02:11:13.370
I move around quite a bit when I sleep.

2034
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:17.840
Just take their simple two to three minutes sleep quiz to get started and that

2035
02:11:17.841 --> 02:11:22.220
will help ensure that they can build a mattress or pillow that you will love the

2036
02:11:22.221 --> 02:11:26.390
mattress,
whatever this be spoke mattresses that you arrive at.
Uh,

2037
02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:29.030
we'll get to you within a week and the shipping is completely free.

2038
02:11:29.031 --> 02:11:32.510
You can try the mattress for 100 nights and if you're not completely happy,

2039
02:11:32.511 --> 02:11:34.430
they'll pick it up and offer a full refund.

2040
02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:38.660
I tested that refund policy because I test all of these sponsors and kick the

2041
02:11:38.661 --> 02:11:39.231
tires a lot.

2042
02:11:39.231 --> 02:11:43.670
We tested it and they came through on making sure that we got ultimately the

2043
02:11:43.671 --> 02:11:48.050
right mattress for my body.

This episode is brought to you by teeter.

2049
02:12:06.770 --> 02:12:10.640
I am so thrilled to have connected with these guys because I've used teeter

2050
02:12:10.641 --> 02:12:12.710
products for many,
many years.

2051
02:12:12.711 --> 02:12:17.600
I've traveled around the country and the world with tea products and I'm sitting

2052
02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:23.020
about 15 feet in my home from one of their inversion tables and we're going to

2053
02:12:23.361 --> 02:12:24.770
talk more about all of that.

2054
02:12:25.130 --> 02:12:28.970
One of my rituals is hanging and I should say not really that it's a maintenance

2055
02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.750
and the performance program.
I hang not just in the morning potentially,

2056
02:12:32.751 --> 02:12:35.810
but particularly after a day of bearing weight,

2057
02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:38.960
whether that includes weight training and Jersey Greg Rec,

2058
02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:43.940
world record holder insists on this type of inversion therapy after training or

2059
02:12:43.941 --> 02:12:48.890
just wearing heavy backpack around a few minutes goes a long way towards better

2060
02:12:48.891 --> 02:12:52.490
sleep.
In my case,
less back pain,
neck pain,
leg pain.

2061
02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:54.590
It's not a panacea obviously,

2062
02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:58.520
but in version therapy would use gravity and your own body weight,

2063
02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:03.050
decompress the spine or the pressure on the discs and surrounding nerves seems

2064
02:13:03.051 --> 02:13:08.051
to help with a whole slew of conditions and just as a general maintenance

2065
02:13:08.301 --> 02:13:13.280
program,
it's one of my favorite things to do.
So what to say about that teeter?

2066
02:13:13.281 --> 02:13:17.600
Why teeter teeter is the best known name in inversion table since 1981 more than

2067
02:13:17.601 --> 02:13:20.690
3 million people have put their trust in teeter teeters.

2068
02:13:20.730 --> 02:13:25.010
Also the only inversion table brand that has been both safety certified by

2069
02:13:25.011 --> 02:13:28.670
underwriters laboratories.
That's a UL and the people in that industry,

2070
02:13:28.671 --> 02:13:33.450
you will recognize it and registered with the FDA as class one medical device

2071
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:38.040
and they're giving a very special offer just to you guys,
my listeners,

2072
02:13:38.070 --> 02:13:38.903
for a limited time,

2073
02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:41.550
you can get the teeter inversion table with bonus accessories,

2074
02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:46.590
which I have a bunch of again in the room next to me and a free pair of gravity

2075
02:13:46.591 --> 02:13:49.980
boots so that you can invert at home or take the boots with you to the gym.

2076
02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:51.060
So these gravity boots,

2077
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:56.510
I have three separate Paris of gravity goods bought with my own monies in three

2078
02:13:57.181 --> 02:13:59.070
different cities that I've had for a very,

2079
02:13:59.071 --> 02:14:01.320
very long time because I don't want to travel with them necessarily.

2080
02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:04.410
It looked kind of like ski boots,
but without the foot portion,

2081
02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:08.130
and they cook you upside down so you can take them really anywhere you want to

2082
02:14:08.131 --> 02:14:09.570
go to get this deal,

2083
