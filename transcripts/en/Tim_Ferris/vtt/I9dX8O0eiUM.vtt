Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.150
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.310
No question.
No,
it does seem

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.600
like I'm a cybernetic organism.

<v 1>this episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things</v>

6
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.970
graphic design related.

7
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.030
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

8
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.700
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

9
00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:41.690
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

10
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.540
the brainstorming.

11
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.860
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

12
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:50.060
works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,
a website,

13
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.610
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.360
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

15
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.000
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

16
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.690
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

17
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:04.400
money back.
It's that straight forward.

18
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.090
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

19
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:10.490
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,

20
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:12.230

<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,</v>

26
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:31.760
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

27
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.670
And my answer is inevitably Athletic Greens,

it is your all in one nutritional insurance.

29
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.900
I recommended it in the four hour body,

30
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.920
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

31
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.920
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

32
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.390
It just covers all my basis.

33
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.410
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

34
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.270
day,

This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

43
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.050
I've rerecorded the center like 17 times because I saw my brother last night

44
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:36.051
after a long hiatus apart and we drank I e Tim drank way,

45
00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:39.660
way,
way too much wine.
So I've had some caffeine,

46
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.700
I've had some coconut oil in poo,
air t and this one is going to make it happen.

47
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:45.990
Folks.
Magic.
Okay.
Honored.

48
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.740
This episode of the Tim Ferriss show is like many others.

49
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.500
It is my job to deconstruct world class performers,

50
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:55.440
whether they are chess prodigies,
hedge fund managers,
athletes,

51
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.470
actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger or anybody and everyone in between.

52
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.310
And what I mean by that is teasing out the,

53
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.060
the routines,
the morning rituals,
the favorite books,

54
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.300
the behaviors and habits that you can borrow to improve your own life and in a

55
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:16.630
professional sense and a personal sense.
This episode we have Phil Libin.

56
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.790
Phil Libin is a friend.

57
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.240
He is also the co founder and executive chairman of Evernote.

58
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.590
I use Evernote as you guys probably know every day,
I mean dozens of times a day.

59
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.630
I used it to handle all of the brain dumps and organization of information and

60
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:33.820
capture of information from my last few books.

61
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.510
I also use it to create a paperless life or as close to it as possible.

62
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.560
And I was introduced to Evernote by you guys on Twitter actually and I want to

63
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:49.561
say 2008 maybe 2009 when I was revising the four hour workweek and I ended up

64
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:53.110
recommending Evernote in that once I got hooked on the product then I got to

65
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:56.650
know Phil and then I became an advisor to the company,
which is super,
super cool.

66
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.680
So I've been an advisor since I want to say 2008 2009 and Evernote now has 150

67
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:06.931
or so million users and it is your external brain so you can use it to capture

68
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.570
things online so you can read them offline,

69
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:13.300
you can use it to capture voice notes,
photographs,

70
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.420
scanned documents with your iPhone for instance.

71
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.910
So that you can take a picture of a,

72
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.050
of a receipt of a menu of a contract and then have it [inaudible] so that you

73
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:29.410
can search the text that just took a photo of later.
Anyway,

74
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.740
I could go on and on about it because I love the product.
I can't,

75
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:34.600
it's like Uber for me.
I can't live without it.

76
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.320
But in this episode we cover so much more than just Evernote.

77
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.380
But we do dig in obviously to the lessons learned.

78
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.240
And speaking of lessons learned,

79
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.270
Phil shares his favorite lessons learned directly from Jeff Bezos of Amazon,

80
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.330
Reid Hoffman of Linkedin and Hiroshi Mikitani of Rakuten.

81
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.640
And if you don't know who he is,
then you should look them up.

82
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.440
We talk about philosophical and performance systems like stoicism,

83
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.040
electrical brain stimulation,
which I know you guys are into.

84
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:06.940
And if you want a ton on that,
you can also listen to my Adam Gazzaley episode.

85
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.870
But Phil is experimenting with a brain stimulation,
uh,

86
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:13.810
for performance enhancement and just general wellbeing.

87
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.040
And we'll talk about that.

88
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.940
Creating tech for yourself and the Evernote genesis story.

89
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:20.230
They're very closely tied together.

90
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.100
We have some frivolities like the best host in Singapore,

91
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:27.430
the best hamburger and Tokyo and why goat simulator is amazing.

92
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.850
And then we talk about a longterm thinking,

93
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:35.110
longterm meaning 10,000 year thinking and real versus imagined threats.

94
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:38.110
We talk about artificial intelligence and a bunch of others.
Now,

95
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.570
most importantly in general across this episode,

96
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:44.290
he digs into his aha moments and what he learned in some cases,

97
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:47.650
how they happened and how you can make that happen for yourself.

98
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.820
So Phil is an awesome guy,
hilarious and just an amazing,

99
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.500
amazing executive.
Now when we recorded this,
he was also CEO of Evernote,

100
00:05:56.501 --> 00:06:01.490
but he has been looking for his successor for some time now.

101
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.750
And uh,
in the meantime,
what between recording this and publishing it,

102
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.340
he found that CEO.

103
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:11.960
So you can just Google new Evernote CEO and you can get all the goods on that.

104
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.820
In any case,
uh,
you can find the show notes,
all the links,
the book links,

105
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:21.650
et Cetera,
at four hour workweek.com and just click podcasts.

106
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:25.730
So four hour work week.com click podcast.
And without further ado,

107
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.760
please enjoy Phil Libin and say hi to him on Twitter at [inaudible] live in Lib.

108
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.690
I N
Phil,

109
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:38.870
welcome to the show.
Eight.
Tim,
good to be here.
It's a,

110
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:43.871
it has been a while since we hung out and I've noticed the most conspicuous

111
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:49.130
change is that the trademark beard has vanished.

112
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.600
And I wanted to know how you decided to make that change because for as long as

113
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:58.430
I've known you,
I have sort of visualized in my head this beard that you have,

114
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:01.040
which is,
I guess it's not really a goatee.

115
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:05.750
It's not really a full years to chin beard.
It's more like a mouth frame.

116
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:08.620
I Dunno if there's a word for those mouth frame.
Yeah.

117
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.930
That I thought of it as a mouth frame would have shaved so much earlier.

118
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.950
You know,
that's,
that's probably due to my lack of caffeine.

119
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:22.940
But how did you decide to,
or why did you decide to shave it off?
Well,

120
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:26.830
I had it literally for 20 years.
Um,
I hadn't shaved in 20 years.
I had this,

121
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.950
had this beard and when I grew at 20 years ago,
I was,
um,

122
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.380
I was trying to look older and you know,

123
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:35.870
20 years later I figured it was time to start trying to look younger.

124
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.900
That works.
Yeah,
that makes sense.
And for,

125
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.590
for those people who are familiar with Evernote,

126
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.920
one of the questions that I've heard come up quite a bit is,

127
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.210
and we'll get to what Evernote is of course,
but why green for the logo?

128
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.400
The elephants,
people eventually figure out,
but why green?
Well,

129
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:03.140
so logos is gray.
It's been so it's an elephant,
right?
Because elephants,

130
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.830
elephants never forget,
elephants have great memories and the elephant is gray.

131
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.270
And people ask,
well,

132
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:13.070
why is he often gray and as well because that's the color elephants are.
And uh,

133
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.360
it's not a green background because that's the color that elephants are usually

134
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:21.420
on with our,
on grass.
So it's not super elaborate.
Got It.

135
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.640
Natural Habitat Natural.
It is.
It is.
Uh,

136
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.400
it is the iconic animal in its natural habitat.
And how,

137
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:34.490
speaking of of natural habitat,
I'm not going to say iconic animal,
uh,

138
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.610
for either of us,
but when did we first meet?

139
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:42.320
I want to say it was in a coffee shop,
but do you recall?
Yeah,

140
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:46.880
it was a,
it wasn't a coffee shop.
It was like a Filipino,

141
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.790
like a Chinese tapioca pearls slash college off Tapioca.
I remember,

142
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.160
I definitely remember those tapioca involved,
uh,
like

143
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.810
<v 3>in the outskirts of San Francisco.
Uh,
and it was like,
man,</v>

144
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:05.610
I want to say like 1854 or something.
It was a while ago.
Right.

145
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:10.440
I think you're using the right,
the Egyptian calendar is probably 2000,

146
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:14.550
I want to say 2007,
2008 it was early.
Yeah.
I mean I think we had,

147
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.410
we had only recently launched and um,
uh,
and I think,

148
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.890
I think I remember like you tweeted something to your followers about what you

149
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:27.120
should,
what app you should be using to maybe,
maybe it's to write your next book.

150
00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:30.750
And then I think a bunch of people tweeted back Evernote and then,
uh,

151
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.150
people in my office,
I can got super excited.

152
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:35.730
And then I think either you reached out to me or I reached out to you.

153
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:38.720
And then we got together for Tapioca.
So what,

154
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.020
what I remember is that I asked a number of questions.
I was,

155
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:48.050
I think I was updating the four hour work week and I was looking to replace some

156
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:50.910
of the tools.
And so I would ask my followers on Twitter,

157
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.450
what is the best tool for x?
What is the best tool for why?

158
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:58.110
What is the best tool for z?
And Evernote kept on coming up and I was like,

159
00:09:58.111 --> 00:10:01.800
that's impossible.
What is the Swiss army knife of software?

160
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:05.040
And I looked at it and I was like,
you know,
I really need an intro to this.

161
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:08.160
I'm having trouble figuring out where to start,
which I think is a common,

162
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.340
a common stumbling block or hurdle for people to get over it.

163
00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:17.341
And then we met up and I remember you took a photograph of the menu,

164
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.650
which was on the wall and shortly thereafter we're able to search all of the

165
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:25.110
text.
And I was like,
okay,
I get it.

166
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:30.170
And then I think I started with d paper filing a,

167
00:10:30.781 --> 00:10:35.130
or trying to remove the clutter of paper from my house at that time.

168
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:38.850
So it was all the business cards,
all of the legal paperwork,

169
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:39.840
accounting paperwork.

170
00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:43.770
I just scanned it because I knew I didn't have to really organize it per se,

171
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:47.850
if I could search by the texts that was scanned.
And for people who don't know,

172
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:50.010
I mean this is,
this was my first use case,

173
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:54.390
but how would you describe Evernote if you could just maybe give a brief

174
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:57.960
synopsis of Evernote for folks.
And now of course,

175
00:10:57.961 --> 00:11:01.350
I mean I use it 10 to 20 plus times a day,

176
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.070
but for those people who are not familiar with Evernote,
what is Evernote?
And,
uh,

177
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.413
how did,
uh,

178
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.860
how did you become involved or what is your involvement with Evernote?
Well,

179
00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:15.210
would,
we started out as a,
as wanting to build your,
your second brain.

180
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.800
Uh,
we wanted to make something that would just make people smarter.
Uh,

181
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.040
let you remember everything that you find,
all types of information,
uh,

182
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.830
take notes,
uh,
clip things from the web,
put in documents.
Um,

183
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.800
and it,
um,
it would just kind of refined it from there.

184
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.550
So we started out as this very general simple note taking tool.

185
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.940
Uh,
and we've evolved to be a,

186
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.290
what we think are the kind of the essential everyday pillars of,
of productivity.

187
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.970
Uh,
we ever known as,
you know,
is the workspace where you get all your stuff done.

188
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.600
And what are the,
what are the origins of Evernote?

189
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:58.240
The genesis story?
There's actually two teams that we're working on,
on,

190
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:01.210
on similar concepts.
So there's a team of people that,
uh,

191
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:04.840
were headed up by this guy named us stop on Pacheco who is this,
um,

192
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.710
sort of eccentric genius,
inventor,
entrepreneur,
uh,

193
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.280
Russian American guy.
And he had a team of people that uh,

194
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.570
go all the way back to the Apple Newton days.
I don't know if you remember that.

195
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.760
Uh,
this was actually the company that apple pulled out of Russia,
uh,

196
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:24.180
to do all the handwriting recognition and other cool stuff on the Newton,

197
00:12:24.181 --> 00:12:28.060
like back in the late eighties.
Um,
you know,
way ahead of their time and they've,

198
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.010
they sort of stayed together.
They sold that company.

199
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:32.170
And then they started another company and sold that company.

200
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.660
And then they weren't,
they'd stayed together as this group working on,
um,

201
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.090
this idea of photographic memory,
basically letting people remember,
uh,

202
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.910
everything,
capture all information in California.

203
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.510
I was in Boston at the time and,
uh,
we had,

204
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.690
I was just finishing up with my second startup,
uh,

205
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.780
and my core team started thinking about,
well,
what do we want to do next?

206
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.040
You know,
we need to start on at the company.

207
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:58.150
We don't want to have to go get jobs or anything.
Uh,
we're going to do.

208
00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:03.310
And we thought,
well,
um,
strategic unemployment.
Right,
exactly.
Yeah.

209
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:06.870
And,
and our whole insight was let's do something for us.
You know,

210
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.470
cause our first two companies,
we made a for other,
for other people,
you know,

211
00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:14.980
our first company,
we did a ecommerce software for big stores.

212
00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:19.120
And our second company,
we did a security software for governments and banks.

213
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:20.290
And that was all fine.
You know,

214
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:23.200
we were lucky enough to be able to sell both companies,
but like,
we're not,

215
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.070
we're not a big retailer,
we're not a government.
So like we didn't really,

216
00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:28.510
we have to wake up every morning thinking,
you know,
what does the customer want?

217
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:30.160
What does the customer want,
what does the market want?

218
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.150
And we've got tired of that.
We kind of said,
well,
screw with the market wants.

219
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:35.950
Like,
how about,
what do we want?
Let's just build that.

220
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.910
So we sat around thinking like,
what do we really want?
What do we love?

221
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.230
And we batted some ideas around and,
uh,
our first idea as we said,
well,
you know,

222
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.140
we love video games.
Like maybe we shouldn't make a video game studio.

223
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.800
And we thought,
well,
you know,
if there's already so many great video games,

224
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:53.800
if you don't have time to play it,
like there's already a giant stack of my desk.

225
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.490
Uh,
so,
you know,
we don't really,

226
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.270
the world doesn't really going to be that much better if we add more video games

227
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:01.810
to it.
So let's,
let's think of something else.
And this was 2007.

228
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.260
So we thought about,
well,
all this new social stuff is actually kind of cool.

229
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:08.740
Like,
we like that a lot.
Maybe we should build a social network.
And we thought,

230
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:12.360
uh,
not,
it's crazy cause you know,
you can't compete with my space.
Like my Smith,

231
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.570
uh,
you know,
we're too late to do anything meaningful there.

232
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:20.800
So we gave up on that and then we said,
well,
what about productivity?

233
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:25.420
Like all the productivity tools around us just feel old and crappy and out of

234
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:29.590
date and largely irrelevant.
What if we make the new version of that?
And,

235
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.450
and that we kind of fell in love with.

236
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.230
So we have two different teams working on the same problem and we,
I met Stefan,

237
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.200
um,
early 2007 and we decided to,
to join forces.

238
00:14:39.201 --> 00:14:42.290
So we actually combined the teams and then recreated the,
the,

239
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:47.140
the company kind of relaunched the company as a new entity in oh seven,
uh,

240
00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:48.670
and launched our first product and the weight.

241
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.970
And what was the first use case,

242
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:57.971
the first application of Evernote that really kind of made your eyes pop out

243
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.580
that,
uh,
the,
was there any,

244
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:07.150
do you have any memories of particular Aha moments with either applications that

245
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:12.941
you guys came up with internally or applications and uses that your fans and

246
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:16.100
users came up with?
Well,
it's funny,
you know,
we were,

247
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:19.280
we were getting going kind of right off Twitter was getting going.

248
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.740
And so for a while,
you know,

249
00:15:21.741 --> 00:15:24.890
I just had an alert for Evernote on Twitter and I could read every single time

250
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.390
at anytime anyone mentioned Evernote on Twitter.
I would see it because,
you know,

251
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.550
it was only like this,
that only happened like a few times a day.

252
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.300
It was a few hundred people on Twitter.
Yeah,
exactly.
So that was,
that was easy.

253
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.381
Uh,
it's,

254
00:15:36.381 --> 00:15:40.880
I literally knew every time anyone said anything on either the internet or

255
00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:45.320
Twitter.
Uh,
how about Evernote?
I wouldn't,
I would either get a Google alert or,

256
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.710
or I would get the tweet alert.
Uh,
so I kept for a while,

257
00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:51.890
I actually knew like every single thing that anyone ever said publicly about us.

258
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.050
Uh,
and it was,
and it was still only like a few things a day.
So it was,

259
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:59.730
it was kind of a humbling thing.
But I remember this one day pretty early on,
um,

260
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.020
where somebody tweeted to two totally different people tweeted,

261
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.980
one of them tweeted,
um,
uh,
that,
uh,

262
00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:11.270
they were a priest and they loved using Evernote to gather information to write

263
00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:12.770
their,
um,
their Sunday sermon.

264
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.410
And I remember seeing that and kind of thinking like,
ah,

265
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.350
that wasn't our intended use case at all.
Like,

266
00:16:18.351 --> 00:16:22.160
we didn't set out to make something that's good for the clergy,
but you know,

267
00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:23.960
it kind of makes sense when you think about it.
Like,
yeah,

268
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:28.020
if I was a priest and I had to come up with something relatively,
uh,

269
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.730
insightful and witty to say every week I'd probably spend time,
you know,

270
00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.940
researching and clipping and writing and like actual,
yeah,

271
00:16:34.941 --> 00:16:38.060
ever notice kind of the ideal thing for that.
So I remember thinking like,

272
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.630
that's kind of a cool,
unanticipated use case.
And then later that day,

273
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.370
some totally different person tweeted,
uh,
not,
not to the first person just,

274
00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:50.450
you know,
independently,
um,
that,
uh,
uh,

275
00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:54.650
he loved Evernote because it made it easy to keep track of all of his sins,
uh,

276
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:56.870
so that he could,
uh,
efficiently confess every Sunday.

277
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.220
And I remember thinking like,
yes,
like now we're on to something,

278
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.710
like we've got both ends of the spectrum.
We got,
we got the priests,

279
00:17:04.711 --> 00:17:07.880
we got the centers were like,
we were like fully horizontally integrated,

280
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.680
a theologically integrated,
the horizontal integration,
uh,

281
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.700
and uh,
that,
that was when I was first confident that like May,
maybe we were,

282
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.320
maybe we're onto something.
I,
how do you personally use Evernote?

283
00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:25.790
And I think that the reason I keep drilling into this is because I remember my

284
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.930
challenge was figuring out where to start.

285
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.130
And that's the hardest.
I mean,
that's still the,

286
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.340
the hardest thing for us is people don't know how to get started.

287
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.210
So I guess they're two questions,
right?
Like how do you personally use Evernote?

288
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:41.110
It'd be curious to hear how,
how you most frequently use Evernote.

289
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.400
And then secondly,
how do you solve that problem?

290
00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:46.700
Because this is not unique to just Evernote,
right?

291
00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:50.400
There are many different products.
Let's say sue grew for instance,
which is this

292
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:55.620
<v 1>kind of Plato that hardens into a rubber that you can use for repairing things,</v>

293
00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:56.860
has a similar challenge there.

294
00:17:56.861 --> 00:18:00.390
There are many different tools and products that have that face,
this conundrum.

295
00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:04.480
So the first is how do you like multiple tubes of that?
At my desk right now.

296
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.010
Yeah,
it's great stuff.
It's a,
yeah.
And like,

297
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:11.280
cause I remember reading about it somewhere and immediately being like,
oh,

298
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:13.180
that's awesome.
I need to get it right away.
And then I got it.

299
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.380
I got all these like packages that showed up at my desk.
I was like,
okay,

300
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:18.570
now what?
Like glasses aren't actually broken.

301
00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:22.740
So I don't need it to fix my glasses yet.
Right,
right.
My iPhone cases and broken.

302
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:26.400
So I have to break it to you as the Sioux grew or what else could I do?
Right.

303
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.330
Yeah.
So with,
with Evernote on a,
on a personal level,
how do you use it?

304
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.660
<v 3>You know,
I live in it.
Um,
I do everything in it.
Um,
mostly I,</v>

305
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.110
I use Evernote to run Evernote.
Uh,

306
00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.620
like we built it for ourselves and we're still building it for ourselves.

307
00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.730
So all of the day to day things that I need for my job aren't Evernote.

308
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.610
I primarily use Evernote for,
for work stuff,

309
00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.300
but I primarily only do work stuff.

310
00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.740
Like I don't really have a work life balance.
Uh,
so I used to have more,

311
00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.340
more hobbies and skills and,
and,
and I would use Evernote for them as well.

312
00:19:00.341 --> 00:19:04.570
Like I,
I,
I was,
I'm a plausibly okay.
Cook.

313
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.220
And so I had a whole bunch of,
you know,

314
00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:10.210
recipes and techniques and Evernote for that.
Uh,
I was,
uh,

315
00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.240
I was trying to learn Japanese at one point that I was using Evernote for that,

316
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.500
but more and more like everything that isn't work related has sort of fallen

317
00:19:17.501 --> 00:19:21.490
away.
Um,
and,
but I just use Evernote for everything work related.

318
00:19:21.491 --> 00:19:24.750
So everything I write,
I write an Evernote.
Uh,

319
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.060
all of our meetings are captured in Evernote.
Uh,

320
00:19:28.061 --> 00:19:32.410
when I want to know what people in,
in,
in the company are working on.
I,

321
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.380
I look at Evernote,
Evernote kind of gives me an update about a hero.

322
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.530
Here's what all my coworkers are doing that are relevant to,

323
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.280
that's relevant to my day.
Uh,
it's kind of become the,
the essential,
you know,

324
00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:46.480
multiple times a day.
Um,
productivity tool for me.

325
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.390
<v 1>Yeah.
I'm looking,
well,
I'm looking at questions for you in Evernote right now,</v>

326
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:56.170
which is very meta,
but,
uh,
and,
and so that actually happens a lot.
Okay.

327
00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.440
<v 3>The first time that I did a,
I remember the first time I talked to a reporter,</v>

328
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.430
um,
you know,
I,
I,
we did our very first like media tour.

329
00:20:04.431 --> 00:20:07.790
I went to like New York City to,
uh,
uh,
meet with some,

330
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.580
some journalists and reporters,
you know,
back in probably 2008.

331
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:12.800
And I remember the first meeting I had,

332
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.140
I don't even remember anymore who the reporter was.
Uh,
but,
um,

333
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.910
he was using Evernote to take notes.
Um,
and you know,

334
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.900
and he had been already kind of for a while.
And so that was a,
that was like,

335
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.280
that was actually the first time I saw it kind of in the wild was somebody using

336
00:20:28.281 --> 00:20:31.360
it to write down,
you know,
interview questions with me.
And so there's like,

337
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.220
there's all sorts of moments like that that I remember being just super cool.

338
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.000
The first time I actually really saw it in the wild,
like out in the street.

339
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.630
It was also in,

340
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.930
I think it was that same trip I was in that was in a Starbucks in Manhattan.

341
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.650
And um,

342
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.440
I was waiting in line to get a coffee and there was a guy in front of me in line

343
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.621
who was like,
I don't,

344
00:20:48.621 --> 00:20:50.920
he looked like an important lawyer or something he was wearing,

345
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.370
I was wearing a very nice suit and he was holding his phone.

346
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.440
He had a Bluetooth headset and uh,

347
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.830
he was holding his phone out in front of his face and he had Evernote on his,

348
00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:03.550
on his phone and he was like jabbing his finger into like something in Evernote

349
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:04.450
and he was yelling at

350
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:06.990
<v 1>over the Bluetooth headset,</v>

351
00:21:06.991 --> 00:21:09.930
like proving a point where like jabbing his finger into Evernote.

352
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.010
<v 3>And uh,
it was the first time I'd actually seen like somebody use Evernote that,</v>

353
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.250
you know,

354
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.490
he didn't know that I didn't have any connection with and I was going to,
like,

355
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:21.190
I was standing right behind him,
was kind of going to kind of introduce myself,

356
00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:22.300
but he looked really angry,

357
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:27.100
<v 1>decided we decided to just stand there meekly behind them.
So what did you,</v>

358
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.850
what did you think like what was the self talk when you saw that?

359
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.260
Did that trigger any,

360
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:37.030
any particular thought or feeling in you to see it in the wild for the first

361
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:37.660
time?

362
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.110
I felt like at some point I should like work on a product that just like make

363
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:43.000
people a bit more mellow.
But

364
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.500
I have built something that enables people to yell at each other.

365
00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:50.770
That doesn't feel great.
Maybe like maybe we should build some kind of a,

366
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.750
you should build something into the next version that chills people out on

367
00:21:53.751 --> 00:21:58.310
mindfulness.
Timeout.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Well there is that,
uh,

368
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.390
somewhat,
uh,
related feature in,

369
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:06.190
I think it's Siri if you shake the phone is if you're trying to sort of rattle

370
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:10.180
its brains,
it will,
it might be Google maps.
I don't know which it is,

371
00:22:10.181 --> 00:22:12.850
but it's built into the iPhone.
If you shake it,

372
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.240
it will actually like ask you in some,
in some way.
I can't recall offhand.

373
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.880
Like what is wrong.
Yeah.
I think,
I think,
I think Google maps may be,

374
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.920
that's like,
it asks you if you want to submit like a,

375
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.510
like a support request or something like that.
Yeah.
And it's Kinda neat.
Yeah.
So,

376
00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:29.480
but,
but men,

377
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.920
<v 3>so in other one is,
um,
uh,
uh,
I met,
um,</v>

378
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.390
I met a group of,
of,
of monks of Buddhist monks,
um,
at,
uh,

379
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:45.270
there with plum village.
This is a tick not Hahn's sure.
Monastery.
And uh,

380
00:22:45.271 --> 00:22:49.660
I that's right.
I went to,
I went to here to count Han speak a few years ago.
Uh,

381
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.610
and I don't know,
I didn't know anything about about zen at the time at all.

382
00:22:53.611 --> 00:22:56.190
It was just thought it would be interesting to kind of hear,
I'm sorry,

383
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:59.250
her and she can use it with a sort of his entourage of,
of,
of monks and nuns.

384
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.110
And uh,
it was all very,
very good,
very peaceful.
And then afterwards he,
you know,

385
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.300
as soon as he left,
I was surrounded by,

386
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.430
by the monks and nuns who are all saying how like they just run,
you know,

387
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.410
they run the monastery in Evernote,
uh,
and uh,
you know,

388
00:23:13.411 --> 00:23:15.780
swapping use cases and it was all really neat.

389
00:23:15.781 --> 00:23:19.740
And so that's when I actually thought we should send someone over there to

390
00:23:19.741 --> 00:23:22.740
record some of their belts.
So they had like these really beautiful,
you know,

391
00:23:22.741 --> 00:23:26.460
ancient,
uh,
mindfulness bells and I thought,
okay,
let's record them.

392
00:23:26.461 --> 00:23:30.030
And actually kind of put them into Evernote as some kind of a anti New York

393
00:23:30.031 --> 00:23:32.700
lawyer at a Starbucks yelling at somebody feature,

394
00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.200
but never got around to doing that yet

395
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.820
<v 1>any day.
Now.
That's amazing.
His first book,
uh,</v>

396
00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.280
and I'm blanking on the name,

397
00:23:40.281 --> 00:23:44.420
I want to say it was mindfulness is every step or something like that.

398
00:23:44.421 --> 00:23:45.770
Pieces every perhaps,

399
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.510
which was really intended almost like Marcus Aurelius is meditations to be a

400
00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:55.511
notebook for himself and also his close confidence and new attendees or teachers

401
00:23:57.351 --> 00:24:00.290
at Plum village,
which then later became a book.

402
00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:05.410
That was the first meditation book that really had a tangible concrete impact on

403
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:12.560
me because the storytelling and the narrative was so was so well done.

404
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.080
Um,
let's,

405
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.530
let's return back to the early days of,

406
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.650
of Evernote when it would be good.
Keep talking about Zen and stoicism to,

407
00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.950
cause we,
we,
I think we'll talk about both,
but what,
what I'd love to do,

408
00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:30.920
and maybe this is in between,
maybe it's a bridge between the two,

409
00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:32.960
is as a CEO,

410
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:38.050
what CEOs did you admire or hope to emulate when in the early days of Evernote?

411
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:45.430
Because you have roughly how many users at the moment are about 150 million.

412
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.330
Yeah.
So that's a big number.

413
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.620
That's a number that a lot of companies would aspire to.
Of course.
Uh,

414
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.340
and what we'll talk about maybe grow separately,
but as a CEO,
you know,

415
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.370
what types of leaders or CEO's did you

416
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.850
<v 3>Meyer and aspire to?
Well,
you know,</v>

417
00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:06.350
there's so many that have been really generous with their time,
uh,
with me.

418
00:25:06.351 --> 00:25:06.591
I mean,

419
00:25:06.591 --> 00:25:10.900
that's really kind of the amazing thing about silicon valley is just how kind
of,

420
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:12.610
how open everyone has been.
Um,

421
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:17.050
so I was able to spend quite a bit of time talking with,
you know,

422
00:25:17.051 --> 00:25:19.610
with people who are just,
we're just heroes of mine forever.
So,
you know,

423
00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:24.020
Jeff Bezos,
um,
as someone who's given me kind of fantastic,

424
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.920
fantastic advice and guidance.
Um,
Hiroshi Mikitani,

425
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.550
the founder and CEO of Braca 10 is one of the most amazing people ever.

426
00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:34.640
I have you,
have you ever talked to him?
I haven't.
I would lie.
You got to,

427
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:39.620
you should.
He's,
that guy is crazy and like in a really good way.
Like,
very,

428
00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:44.150
very,
very interesting.
I know,
I know you have,
uh,
a big Japan connection,
so I do.

429
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:49.330
Yeah,
that'd be a blast.
Um,
but,
you know,
but I,
I had a chance to,

430
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:54.380
to,
to very briefly need,
uh,
Steve Jobs.
Uh,
I had a chance to,

431
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.200
uh,
I've actually spent quite a bit of time with,
with Marc Benioff,

432
00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:02.250
who's been really excellent in terms of advice and guidance.
So it's been like,

433
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.360
it's been pretty impressive.
Um,

434
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:10.450
probably the person that I kind of most want to be like when I grow up is Reid

435
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.450
Hoffman.
Uh,
just a huge fan of,
of,

436
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.570
of read and kind of the way that he thinks about things and uh,
how,

437
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.020
how thoughtfully he's organized his life and his companies.

438
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.870
I'm just going to very cool.
So I'm lucky to,
uh,
to actually be able to,

439
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.640
you know,
spend some time with these people

440
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.250
<v 1>from time to time.
I do agree.</v>

441
00:26:31.251 --> 00:26:36.251
I was actually just chatting with someone about the differences between Say New

442
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.130
York and San Francisco,
La and San Francisco,

443
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:44.070
and their strengths and weaknesses to all of them,
but the,
the,

444
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:49.370
<v 3>the ability to wander into a coffee shop or otherwise just get in touch with</v>

445
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:55.650
the,
what you would think would be the untouchables,
the very,

446
00:26:55.651 --> 00:27:00.150
very well known iconic figures is something that I haven't seen in many other

447
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:02.400
places outside of Silicon Valley.
Just the,

448
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:07.170
the openness and availability that those people express,
even though they're ads,

449
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.090
the multibillion dollar in net worth mark,
it's,
uh,
it's very,

450
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:17.510
it's very unique.
Wa I don't know if you agree with that,
but,
uh,
what,

451
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.340
why do you think these people are so open to share?
What,

452
00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:27.341
what makes the environment of Silicon Valley different or what makes the people

453
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:31.290
who gravitate to at different,
well,
I don't know that it's,

454
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.050
I don't know that this is unique about silicon valley.

455
00:27:34.051 --> 00:27:37.100
I think we just have a larger concentration.
Maybe if people like this,
but,

456
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.410
but they probably exist everywhere.
I just think,
you know,

457
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.630
almost everyone here who is a,
you know,
who's successful,
who's made,

458
00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:47.340
who has made it quote unquote,
it was well known,

459
00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.440
like remembers doing it him or herself,
right?

460
00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:56.850
Like before they build this giant world changing multibillion dollar thing,

461
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:02.010
they haven't done it either.
Uh,
and it,
it isn't like,
it's not,

462
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.410
it's all like,
and sort of the recent past as well,

463
00:28:04.411 --> 00:28:07.860
like virtually everyone who you read,
who,
you know,
who I really admired,

464
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:13.120
like it has gone from just being a normal person to bending the universe in a

465
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:18.030
significant way in the last decade or two.
Yeah.
Um,

466
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.940
as opposed to,
you know,
in,
in,
in other places where a lot of,

467
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.700
a lot of wealth is concentrated in people who,
you know,

468
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:26.040
sort of maybe have inherited part of it or who have kind of been in those

469
00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:30.990
circles for longer.
This is very much a,
you know,
scrappy entrepreneurial,

470
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.550
you know,
a lot of,
a lot of immigrant led,
uh,
communities and,

471
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:39.150
and everyone remembers before,
before they were important,
they weren't.
Uh,

472
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:40.470
and that's,
that's kind of a healthy thing.

473
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I want to ask you a little bit about the folks that you interacted with.

474
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.750
So may Bayzos for instance,
he's a fascinating character on so many levels.

475
00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:55.110
I mean,
very methodically chose books,

476
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:58.980
pitched that within de Shaw,
had it turned down,

477
00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.630
uh,
and then turned it into the everything store.

478
00:29:03.631 --> 00:29:07.290
And when they started they had a,
as a,
as I understand it,
um,

479
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:11.900
basically doors from the equivalent of home depot across two file cabinets,

480
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:16.530
desks.
I mean,
that's how people started out.
What did you we did that.

481
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.590
And my first startup we had,
we made desks out of,
out of,

482
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.370
we made desks out of a unfinished doors and,
and,
and uh,

483
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.700
what do you call those little construction horses?
Oh,
the saw horses.

484
00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.130
So the horses,
yeah,
that was our first desks are all,
yeah,

485
00:29:29.131 --> 00:29:33.540
we just bought doors at home depot and put them on saw horses for no good
reason.

486
00:29:33.541 --> 00:29:35.310
It turns out that's like harder horse.

487
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:42.160
It was really funny.
I just built this a side note,

488
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.190
<v 1>pull up rig out of a galvanized steel piping and plumbing supplies and whatnot.</v>

489
00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.400
It's just at the end of the day it costs,

490
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.930
particularly if you factor in the labor,
it's like,
okay,
it was a fun project,

491
00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.960
but probably would have been better use of capital just to buy a cheap rig it.

492
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.480
But it's still fun in its own way.
One of these days,

493
00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.870
<v 3>Tim,
you have to like,
you have to like coach me to be able to do a pull up.</v>

494
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.150
Like I would like to do a pull up once in my life.

495
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.800
<v 1>I will absolutely help you do that.</v>

496
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:17.830
And maybe we can pull in pop by Pavel Tsatsouline who like yourself is

497
00:30:18.531 --> 00:30:22.620
originally from the former Soviet Union.
Uh,

498
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.870
now you were born in,
I want to say Saint Petersburg,
but am I getting that right?

499
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:31.070
Well,
it was called,
let me write it at the time,
but yeah.
Leningrad.
And uh,

500
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.920
do you spell,
I'm not going to quiz you,
but do you still speak Russian?

501
00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.940
I don't speak Russian.
Yes.
And with such a heavy,

502
00:30:37.941 --> 00:30:41.600
I'm not going to lose track of where we were with Bezos,
but with,
with such,

503
00:30:41.601 --> 00:30:45.950
I want to come back to that.
But with such a heavy Russian,
uh,

504
00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.270
component in Evernote from the early days,

505
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:55.300
how did that affect the company culture or growth or anything if it,

506
00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.830
if it did?
I don't know if it did.

507
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:02.230
<v 3>I don't,
I,
I'm not sure that it had that much.
I don't,
in fact,
you know,</v>

508
00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:07.150
the original team on Stefan side where we're mostly Russians.
Uh,
I,
you know,

509
00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:09.370
most of the people would meet weren't,
there's a couple,

510
00:31:09.371 --> 00:31:13.000
I don't really think of myself as particularly Russian.
I was,

511
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:15.910
I was eight years old when we came over.
You know,
I learned English by watching,

512
00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:19.390
uh,
what's happened in reruns and reading Thor comic books.

513
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.110
I would have loved to have heard your English and your early days.
Yeah.

514
00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:27.280
It turned out that my colloquial English came from Thor.
Uh,

515
00:31:27.281 --> 00:31:29.830
I wasn't the most popular kid in,
in,
in junior high school.

516
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.750
A lot of praise and talk,

517
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:37.300
but it was good for vocabulary development sorts of,
you know,
forsooth

518
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:39.663
<v 1>hence forth.</v>

519
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:47.780
<v 3>Um,
and um,
but you know,
we just,
we had a really great,</v>

520
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:48.860
we've had a really great team.

521
00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.340
I don't think there's anything particularly particularly Russian or not about

522
00:31:52.341 --> 00:31:57.260
the company and certainly in Silicon Valley there are,
I think,

523
00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:58.400
I'm sure this must be true,

524
00:31:58.401 --> 00:32:03.330
that most people who work at Evernote are from somewhere else.
Uh,
Eh,

525
00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:03.680
you know,

526
00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.420
I think we probably have more than 50% people born outside of this country.
Um,

527
00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:12.410
there's just such a heavy immigrant community.
Um,
and we just,

528
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.820
you know,
you pull people from all over.

529
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.640
We want to get the best people from everywhere in the world to,
uh,

530
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.750
to help us build a great product.

531
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:23.840
<v 1>Speaking of that process of building a great product,
uh,
or maybe not what,</v>

532
00:32:23.841 --> 00:32:28.841
what advice did you go to Bayzos for or what were some of the questions you

533
00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:32.670
asked him or pieces of advice that he gave you,
if you remember?

534
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:36.570
<v 3>Good.
I got it.
Okay.
The last thing he told me,</v>

535
00:32:36.571 --> 00:32:39.620
this was only just like a few days ago,
but it's changed my life again.

536
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.680
Like basically every time I talked to Bayzos it's like changes my life.

537
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.720
The last one was,
was just recently and it was kind of amazing,

538
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:51.830
not particularly relevant to the topic at hand,
but,
but super epically awesome.

539
00:32:51.831 --> 00:32:56.360
Anyway,
so I've spent my entire life thinking that,
uh,
I want to go to Mars,

540
00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.400
like Mars,
Mars,
Mars,
Mars.
It was like on the Brady Bunch.
Right?
Okay.

541
00:33:01.401 --> 00:33:05.240
Just want to go to Mars.
Um,
I thought this was like the best thing ever.

542
00:33:05.241 --> 00:33:08.270
At some point,
if I structured my life correctly,
maybe I'll get to go.

543
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.430
Like maybe like later on in life.
I would totally agree to go,
you know,

544
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.390
to go one way.
Cause I think it's just so important for humanity to,

545
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.730
to be able to do that.
I was just all into Mars and,
uh,
you know,

546
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:23.630
talk to Ilan a couple of times and just vastly inspired by everything that,

547
00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:27.460
that,
that,
that he's doing and what SpaceX is doing.
And,
um,

548
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.080
um,
I was listening to Ilan speak,
uh,

549
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.280
last week or two weeks ago or something talking about Mars and I was super

550
00:33:34.281 --> 00:33:37.250
inspired and um,
you know,

551
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.350
ran into Jeff Bezos a bit later and was kind of saying,

552
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.590
oh I just got to talk to Ilan and I'm super excited about Mars.

553
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:49.040
I'm really hope that one day I can go and,
and,
and Jesus looks at me and goes,

554
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:54.240
Mars is stupid.
And like what is that?

555
00:33:54.241 --> 00:33:58.280
Yeah,
once humanity,
once we get off of,
once we get off the planet,

556
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.610
the last thing we want to do is,
is go to another gravity.

557
00:34:01.611 --> 00:34:05.660
Well the whole point like the reason that this is so hard to get off the earth

558
00:34:05.661 --> 00:34:07.940
as dude like defeat gravity the first time.
Once we do that,

559
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.710
why would you want to go to Mars?

560
00:34:09.711 --> 00:34:12.950
We should just live on space stations and mine asteroids and everything is much

561
00:34:12.951 --> 00:34:17.360
better than being on Mars.
And in like 30 seconds,

562
00:34:17.361 --> 00:34:21.080
he had like completely changed the course of my life work cause he's totally

563
00:34:21.081 --> 00:34:23.570
right.
And I was like,
what

564
00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:31.180
mid day conversation?
It was like a late night after a few drinks conversation.

565
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.750
Um,
it was after a few drinks.
I'm not sure what time of day it was.

566
00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:38.850
<v 4>That's a great answer.
Anyway,
anyway,</v>

567
00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:39.390
<v 3>so now,</v>

568
00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:42.210
so now I know that the future of humanity is to live on space stations and mine

569
00:34:42.211 --> 00:34:46.840
asteroids and uh,
uh,
hopefully I'll get to do that at some point.
Um,
uh,

570
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:51.840
other advice that I've gotten from them has been a bit more practical.
All right,

571
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:56.220
well I'm not going to,
I'll bait.
What other advice?
Well,

572
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.950
I mean the best thing that he's been at in terms of like actually building the

573
00:34:58.951 --> 00:35:02.520
company is just,
you know,
it's just scaling issues.
It's like a,
you know,

574
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:05.100
how do you deal with things when you're a,
when you were 20 people,

575
00:35:05.101 --> 00:35:06.690
how does that change when you're a 200,

576
00:35:06.691 --> 00:35:11.110
how do you think about going from 200 to 2000 to 20,000?
Um,

577
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.650
it's all the kind of the,
the,
the,
the growing pains,

578
00:35:13.651 --> 00:35:15.160
the life stages of the company.
I mean that,

579
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:19.200
that's what's really occupies most of my attention professionally.
Now.
Um,

580
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.070
this is also what Hiroshi Mikitani is fantastic at,
like between,

581
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.430
between Mikitani [inaudible] and be Zos.
Those are like,

582
00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.570
you just get everything that you possibly want to know about,
uh,

583
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:34.840
about how to scale a company.
Uh,
and I've,
I've every chance I get to to,
to,

584
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:36.090
to actually pick their brain at it.

585
00:35:36.091 --> 00:35:38.510
That's usually what we're talking when we're not talking about space stations

586
00:35:38.511 --> 00:35:39.390
and Mars and things like that.

587
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:44.570
What are some of the biggest challenges that you've had in scaling Evernote?

588
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:49.890
Well,
uh,
make a tiny son says this really cool thing.
He's got this law,

589
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.650
it's like he's calls it like the law of three and 10 or something,

590
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:57.651
which is basically that every single thing in your company breaks every time you

591
00:35:58.351 --> 00:36:01.980
like roughly tripled in size.
So,
uh,
basically like,

592
00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.840
because he was the first employee at ragtime,
he was there,

593
00:36:03.841 --> 00:36:06.420
he was number one and now they've got an old 10,000 or something or more.

594
00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:09.810
They said when you were like the first person,
when you're just one person,

595
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.880
like everything kind of works,
you've sort of figured it out.

596
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:14.940
And then at some point you have three people and now things are kind of

597
00:36:14.941 --> 00:36:17.280
different,
like making decisions and everything with three people.

598
00:36:17.281 --> 00:36:17.761
It's like different,

599
00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:20.790
but you adjust to that and then you're fine for awhile and then you get to 10

600
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:23.220
people and everything kind of breaks.

601
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.830
But then you figure that out and then you get to 30 people and everything's

602
00:36:25.831 --> 00:36:30.630
different and then a hundred and then 300 and then a thousand.
Um,
so his,

603
00:36:30.631 --> 00:36:34.550
like,
his hypothesis is that everything breaks at roughly this like this,

604
00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.990
these points of three and 10 are roughly a tripling every size,
uh,

605
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.720
and buy everything.
It means like everything.
Like,
you know,
how you,
uh,

606
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:47.280
how you handle payroll,
uh,
hot,
how you schedule meetings.
Um,

607
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:51.450
what kind of communications do you use?
How you do budgeting,
you know,

608
00:36:51.451 --> 00:36:56.451
who actually makes decisions like every implicit and explicit part of the

609
00:36:56.611 --> 00:37:01.050
company just changes significantly when it triples.
Um,

610
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.770
and his,
his insight is,
um,

611
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.380
a lot of companies get into huge trouble because of this.
Um,

612
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:11.310
so when you're quickly growing startup,
you get into huge trouble because you,

613
00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:15.030
you,
you blow right through a few of these triplings without really realizing it.

614
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.620
And,
uh,
and then you turn around and you realize that like,
oh,
like,
like,
you know,

615
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:23.670
we're at 400 people now at Evernote and when I really think about it,
I'm like,

616
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.230
okay,
we were 400 people now,

617
00:37:25.231 --> 00:37:29.070
but some of our processes and systems are we set in place when we were 30.

618
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.810
So we kind of skipped like a few steps and everything is like creaky and broken

619
00:37:33.811 --> 00:37:36.810
because of it.
Whereas you really have to,
like,
you really have to try to adjust.

620
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.920
Uh,
so startups get in trouble because you,
you kind of blow through these,
these,

621
00:37:40.921 --> 00:37:42.990
these,
uh,
these break points really quickly.

622
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.130
And so you should constantly be thinking about perpetually be thinking about how

623
00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:51.420
to,
how to reinvent yourself,
uh,
and,
and,
and how to tweak the culture.

624
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:55.950
But then big companies get in trouble for exactly the opposite reason because,

625
00:37:56.010 --> 00:38:00.570
uh,
you know,
let's say you get to,
you know,
10,000 people in your company.
Like,

626
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.420
I'm theoretically,
you figured out how to run things at 10,000,

627
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.200
well your next big point isn't until 30,000 but you probably not going to get

628
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:10.770
the 30,000,
you know,
ever or certainly not within a few years.
Like it may take,

629
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:14.040
you know,
a decade or more for a company go from 10,000 to 30,000 people,

630
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.270
but no one feels like waiting around for a decade or more to like reinvent

631
00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:22.560
yourself.
And so companies are like constantly pushing all of this like bullshit,

632
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.950
like innovation initiatives because they feel like,
well we have to do something,

633
00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:26.790
we have to do something.

634
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.840
But they're not actually connected to any fundamental change in the company

635
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:33.120
there.
They're just kind of floating around by themselves.

636
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.010
So by having this mismatch,

637
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.440
like when things actually change and when you feel that you should actually redo

638
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:43.270
everything,
um,
small companies get in trouble,

639
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:46.960
the big company is going to trouble.
And just being mindful about that is,

640
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.650
is super eyeopening.
So that,

641
00:38:48.651 --> 00:38:51.490
that was maybe like one of the most actionable pieces of advice that I got.

642
00:38:51.491 --> 00:38:55.360
And this was from,
from Hiroshi Mikitani had written the,

643
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.650
this is very interesting,
the,
the law of three and 10.
Now the,

644
00:38:59.651 --> 00:39:02.320
the tripling I get,
where does the 10 come in?
Oh,

645
00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:05.020
it's because otherwise it'd be three and nine.
It'd be harder to do the math.

646
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.390
It's just,
Oh,
it's just rounding up.

647
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.830
He's basically saying IC three and then 10 and then 30 and then 100.

648
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:17.710
Otherwise you'd be,
you'd be nine and 27 and so on.
Yeah.
Who can,
who can do that?

649
00:39:17.711 --> 00:39:22.510
Man.
Oh Man.
The,

650
00:39:22.511 --> 00:39:27.040
um,
have you ever,
now I know you,
you like myself.

651
00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:28.690
I have a fondness for Japan.

652
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:33.990
Have you ever seen someone trained previously trained on an abacus as a kid do

653
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:39.040
mental mathematics?
Yeah.
It's so fascinating.
I mean,
you could say,
put their,

654
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:42.940
put their finger up in the air like they're moving beads.

655
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.840
And I remember there was this kid on my judo team when I was in Japan as an

656
00:39:46.841 --> 00:39:50.800
exchange student for a year.
Who could do,
you could multiply three digit numbers.

657
00:39:50.801 --> 00:39:55.210
He could do pretty much whatever basic arithmetic you would ask him to do by

658
00:39:55.211 --> 00:39:59.080
using this sort of imaginary advocates.
So fascinating.
Yeah,

659
00:39:59.081 --> 00:40:03.610
my grandmother was a,
was a,
was that a bookkeeper was an accountant,
uh,
in,

660
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:06.430
you know,
in the Soviet Union.
And,
um,
you know,
she was all,

661
00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.480
it was all Abacos training for her.
And I just remember,
uh,

662
00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:14.540
I remember when I was a kid,
like she would do math and I,
yeah,

663
00:40:14.541 --> 00:40:17.700
I completely remember just being blown away by like kind of how that work yet

664
00:40:17.701 --> 00:40:22.000
with the,
with the imaginary abacus,
with,
with,
uh,

665
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.560
Mikitani sons,

666
00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:29.020
law of three and 10 in pragmatic planning terms,

667
00:40:29.021 --> 00:40:34.021
does that mean that you is Phil at Evernote would try to look ahead to

668
00:40:36.341 --> 00:40:41.341
anticipate when you would hit that tripling point and then seek out the new

669
00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:47.020
tools and processes that you would need beforehand?
We've really tried to,

670
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.260
uh,
and,
but I also think like,

671
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:54.010
so there's the whole tripling aspect,
which I think is interesting.
Uh,

672
00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:55.810
obviously this is just,
you know,
it's just a framework.

673
00:40:55.811 --> 00:40:57.430
It doesn't really capture every nuance.

674
00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.730
But then it made me think about another thing,

675
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:04.540
which I think is maybe even more important as to like how the world is changing

676
00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:08.050
now.
Like important changes happen,

677
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:12.760
like App Times of,
of uh,

678
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.750
of change and it sounded like a fatality.
Um,
that's not how I meant to say it.
Um,

679
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.200
let me put it this way.
So people will often ask,

680
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:23.920
people will often say to a about a product like,
oh,
but that's you're,

681
00:41:23.921 --> 00:41:27.160
you're really asking people or companies to like change their ingrained
behavior.

682
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.370
Like how long does it take to change a green behavior?
Like we're saying,
okay,

683
00:41:30.371 --> 00:41:35.240
email socks,
like email's dead.
You have to get off of,
uh,
obviously.

684
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.760
And a lot of people say,
oh,
but that's such ingrained change.

685
00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:40.800
Like how long will it take a company to,
you know,
to,

686
00:41:40.801 --> 00:41:44.710
to fundamentally get off of email.
And,
um,

687
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:49.010
I've been thinking about it like this.
Um,
every time you change jobs,

688
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:53.390
it's like a very good opportunity to reevaluate,
sort of what works,

689
00:41:53.391 --> 00:41:55.430
what doesn't work and trying to be a little bit smarter the next time around.

690
00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.220
Every time you had like a major life change that could change jobs or you move

691
00:41:58.221 --> 00:42:02.150
into a new house or whatever,
uh,
you know,
you get married and like any,

692
00:42:02.151 --> 00:42:03.230
all of these stuff follow,

693
00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:05.660
all of these things kind of are a really good opportunity.

694
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:08.350
Sort of take stock mentally and be like,
ah,
okay,
we're going to,

695
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.250
I've always wanted to do this a little bit better,

696
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.450
now's the time I'm going to do that.

697
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:16.610
And so inside of companies that's basically people changing jobs and you can

698
00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:20.770
measure how long,
like a fundamental corporate,
um,

699
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.830
change will take based on just the number of job cycles that it requires.

700
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:29.240
So let's just say that like something as profound as like getting rid of email.

701
00:42:29.241 --> 00:42:33.440
It will take like three entire cycles of like people changing their,
their,
their,

702
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.950
their job.
Like,
um,
but,

703
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:42.010
and this explains like why things happen at such different paces in like in

704
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:46.220
silicon valley versus in,
on the east coast versus in like Europe,

705
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.570
because the tenure,

706
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:52.220
the average tenure of professionals of knowledge workers is really shrinking and

707
00:42:52.221 --> 00:42:54.650
as much shorter here than in lots of other places.
You know,

708
00:42:54.651 --> 00:42:59.270
the average tenure of a Google employee right now is something like 1.1 years.

709
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.930
Like the average person has only been in the job for a little over a year.

710
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.270
They're changing jobs all the time.
I mean,

711
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:07.420
and at apple it's only like two point something years.
And it Evernote,

712
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:08.870
it's a little bit longer but not much.

713
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.370
And so you constantly having like everyone is basically acting like a,

714
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.070
like a freelancer.
Like everyone is,
is doing a job.

715
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.650
They don't think they're going to do it forever or they think they can do it for

716
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:20.810
a couple of years and then they're moving on to the next one.

717
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:22.093
And that's happening.

718
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:25.160
That's happening like crazy here in silicon valley and it's starting to happen

719
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:29.720
everywhere.
And so if you,
if like a big change,
let's just say hypothetically,

720
00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:32.940
it takes three job cycles.
Well,
um,

721
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:37.040
if the average job cycle is like a year and a half,
then okay.
You know,

722
00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:37.970
within four or five years,

723
00:43:37.971 --> 00:43:40.400
the company is like completely change this fundamental thing.

724
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.610
Whereas if you're in Europe and the average job cycles like 10 years,

725
00:43:43.611 --> 00:43:45.290
it may take him 30 years to get there.

726
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:49.430
So like a change that's obvious here within a few years may take,
you know,

727
00:43:49.431 --> 00:43:52.280
may take decades in societies where that,

728
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:56.990
where people are just staying on board for much longer and,

729
00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:01.100
but something that takes like something that takes four to five years in Silicon

730
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.360
Valley probably takes 20 years in Europe,
probably takes like a year in China,

731
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:11.440
that cycle and China's crazy fast and compressed.
Yeah.
Really,
um,
so hot.

732
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:14.240
Like how do you plan that?
And more importantly,

733
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.880
we at Evernote are building software.

734
00:44:16.881 --> 00:44:20.570
We're building products for modern knowledge workers.
How do we embrace this?

735
00:44:20.571 --> 00:44:25.000
Like how do we build products for these types of people?
Uh,

736
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:29.570
and that's a very different idea then,
you know,
then Microsoft office,

737
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.750
like how do you build something that is meant for people who are,

738
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:37.980
have a really compressed job cycle,
who think of themselves as,

739
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.250
as freelancers,
even if they're part of a company.
Uh,

740
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:42.420
and how do you make that great,

741
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.020
like instead of trying to pass judgement on this and saying that's a bad thing

742
00:44:46.021 --> 00:44:46.860
and trying to hold it back,

743
00:44:46.861 --> 00:44:49.230
how do you actually embrace it and how do you try to make it more awesome?

744
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.530
And that's,
that's a big animating force of power.
We're thinking about things.

745
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:57.590
How different is the current Chinese version of Evernote compared to,

746
00:44:58.621 --> 00:45:02.640
say the US version?
It's the same.

747
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.730
Yeah.
I mean there's,
there's minor differences and,
you know,

748
00:45:05.731 --> 00:45:07.770
like payment methods and stuff like that.
So we run,

749
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.800
China's the only place where we would run a totally separate version.
So we,

750
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:13.920
you know,
we have a version of a,
of Evernote,
they'd be called a inch on BG,

751
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.620
which basically we kind of cloned ourselves in China.
Everyone told us like,
oh,

752
00:45:17.621 --> 00:45:20.610
you,
you know,
if you go to China,
you're just gonna get cloned.
So he said,

753
00:45:20.611 --> 00:45:21.750
all right,
let's just clone ourselves.

754
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:25.120
So we made a full clone of Evernote that we run ourselves,
that's,
you know,

755
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.160
separate data centers,
separate servers.
And,
uh,

756
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:31.560
other than some minor things around how we interact with payment methods and

757
00:45:31.561 --> 00:45:34.050
stuff like that,
it's exactly the same.
I appreciate it.

758
00:45:34.051 --> 00:45:38.790
The separate data centers that that's important,
that's important for,
you know,

759
00:45:38.791 --> 00:45:39.780
for a bunch of reasons,
for both,

760
00:45:39.781 --> 00:45:42.750
for performance as well as for just sort of giving people the choice as to where

761
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:46.140
they keep their data.
So yeah,
that,
let's,

762
00:45:46.141 --> 00:45:51.141
let's talk for a second about a Reid Hoffman and then I want to come back to

763
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:55.620
some of your personal productivity habits.

764
00:45:56.010 --> 00:46:00.450
But Reid Reid is a very interesting,

765
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.460
that's my laziest adjective I can use here.
He's a,
uh,
interesting.

766
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.700
He's a compelling character.
Uh,
I've,

767
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.600
I've had the opportunity to spend a little bit of time with him and we're both

768
00:46:12.601 --> 00:46:16.640
involved in a nonprofit called questbridge and,
uh,
he is,

769
00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:21.900
he is such a cool,
as a cucumber,

770
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:26.340
sort of philosopher king in the minds of so many people in Silicon Valley.

771
00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.590
Uh,
what makes read unique?
What are the things that make him,

772
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:36.870
that draw you to him or that,
uh,
that,
that you find fascinating about him?

773
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.270
Well,
uh,
you know,

774
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.620
well before I like actually got to know him.
I was,

775
00:46:43.621 --> 00:46:46.290
I was listening to them and I was reading,
you know,
his stuff.

776
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:50.850
So I mean I was just attracted to the,
to the ideas.
Like he just has a very,

777
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:56.040
to me it's,
it's the exactly the right balance of kind of big picture,

778
00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.360
philosophically oriented ideas that are really grounded and practical and that

779
00:47:02.971 --> 00:47:06.120
you can,
you know,
that,
that,
that you can apply.
Uh,

780
00:47:06.121 --> 00:47:10.800
I really liked the thinking behind linkedin and kind of what it represented.
Um,

781
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:14.470
so it was the,
it was the,
it was the strength of the ideas and,
and,

782
00:47:14.471 --> 00:47:18.510
and having the exactly,
the right mixture of kind of lofty and,
and practical.

783
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:22.060
What else?
These,

784
00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:27.120
are there any or any particular examples that jump out at you or any advice that

785
00:47:27.121 --> 00:47:31.200
he's given you or questions that you've asked of him?
Well,
you know,

786
00:47:31.201 --> 00:47:36.000
we talk a lot about,
about,
um,
companies scaling and we talked a lot,
you know,

787
00:47:36.001 --> 00:47:40.830
he made a decision fairly early on that he didn't want to be the CEO of,
of,

788
00:47:40.831 --> 00:47:44.070
of,
uh,
of the company.
And he brought in actually a couple of people,

789
00:47:44.071 --> 00:47:45.490
Jeff as the second person that,
that,

790
00:47:45.491 --> 00:47:47.760
that he wound up bringing on and that worked out great.

791
00:47:47.761 --> 00:47:50.250
And so I've talked to him a lot about,
you know,
what does,
like,

792
00:47:50.251 --> 00:47:53.640
what does that like,
like how do you,
what's the right amount of letting go?

793
00:47:53.641 --> 00:47:57.300
What is the,
what is the,
you know,
the right amount of,
of,
of staying involved.

794
00:47:57.301 --> 00:48:02.070
How do you really think about that?
And he's been kind of my main,
uh,

795
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.090
guide through this.
I mean,

796
00:48:03.091 --> 00:48:04.710
there's been a lot of other people I've talked to as well,

797
00:48:04.711 --> 00:48:07.900
but read is kind of the person that I'm most looking to emulate.
Um,

798
00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:11.190
his thoughts around,
you know,
really starting with paypal.

799
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:16.650
They have been super influential.
The the best I think,
I'm sorry,

800
00:48:16.651 --> 00:48:18.390
go ahead.
I think the best thing that I've,

801
00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:23.520
that I've read from him is actually more recent.
It was his,
his uh,
Le last book,

802
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.050
the Alliance,
uh,

803
00:48:25.051 --> 00:48:29.790
which really like us sharpen my thinking significantly around this exact idea

804
00:48:29.791 --> 00:48:30.601
that we just talked about,

805
00:48:30.601 --> 00:48:34.890
this idea of having a relationship between companies and employees.

806
00:48:34.891 --> 00:48:35.850
That's more honest.

807
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.160
And that's about recognizing what the actual new realities of the world are and

808
00:48:40.161 --> 00:48:41.040
trying to embrace them.

809
00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:44.430
And he's writing this book really from a kind of an HR perspective.

810
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.050
I really read it as a,
as a product design perspective.
I read it out,

811
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:52.830
that's interesting.
We make products for this reality and that,
and that's been,

812
00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:56.160
that's been really usually influential.
Plus he's just a super nice guy.

813
00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:00.050
<v 1>Yeah.
He,
uh,
he is,</v>

814
00:49:00.051 --> 00:49:03.980
he is a very different energy from almost all the other folks in the paypal

815
00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:08.990
Mafia.
Uh,
and that's not to in any way denigrate them,
but he,
he has,

816
00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:14.440
he doesn't seem to have the same sharp edge that a lot of those other guys do.

817
00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:20.260
Obviously he's very intelligent and has an extremely incisive intellect,

818
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.360
but when you sit down with them,
he has a much more relaxed energy,

819
00:49:23.361 --> 00:49:27.950
if that makes sense too.
What would you attribute that?
I mean,

820
00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.700
and
I mean,
he does have,

821
00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:38.020
<v 3>I would attribute that to like the extreme edginess and sharpness of the rest of</v>

822
00:49:38.251 --> 00:49:42.750
those guys.
I think you,
you put anyone in contrast with,
uh,

823
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:43.900
uh,
you know,

824
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.690
with the rest of the well known people there and like everyone's going to see

825
00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:51.450
him,
anyone's going to see
Tim Ferriss like in a room next to,

826
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.840
you know,

827
00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:56.460
Ilan and Roelof and Max and the people like that are going to seem super mellow

828
00:49:56.461 --> 00:49:57.294
and chill.

829
00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:01.540
<v 1>All right,
that's a good point.
That's how that works.</v>

830
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:07.040
Now you,
you mentioned philosophy a bit earlier and you,
and you,

831
00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:11.740
you mentioned stoicism read.
Did I?
Maybe I am.
Okay.

832
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:15.400
Maybe I just sort of recursively incepted myself.
Uh,

833
00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:20.390
the Reid has quite a philosophy background as I understand it.
I think he,

834
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:24.340
he studied philosophy at Oxford after his Stanford and experience.

835
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.070
Uh,
are you religious or philosophical?
I mean,

836
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.480
<v 3>are there any particular schools of philosophy or trains of thought in religion</v>

837
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:37.040
that you have,
is uses a framework in your life?
Um,

838
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:42.490
I'm not,
I'm not particularly religious,
uh,
in the fence.
I'm not,
you know,

839
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.920
I'm not the ethic.
Uh,
I,

840
00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:49.970
I am very interested in having a coherent philosophy of life,

841
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:54.690
like a coherent structure that basically says like,
here is,
you know,

842
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:59.150
here is why you should bother living in here is what you should try to

843
00:50:59.151 --> 00:51:03.080
accomplish.
And here is,
uh,
uh,
here's what it all means.

844
00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.510
And I think a lot of people,
a lot of people come,

845
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:07.660
come to that from a religious backgrounds.

846
00:51:07.661 --> 00:51:10.490
Some people come to it from a philosophical background or practical background,

847
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.730
but I think it's important,
at least for me to just to,

848
00:51:13.731 --> 00:51:17.540
to think about overall structure and to have a coherent philosophy of life.

849
00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:20.900
So I've been,
uh,
I've been looking for that for,
for awhile.

850
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:25.640
How do you go about looking for it and what have you found?
Any pieces of it?

851
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:29.720
A little bit?
Um,
uh,
you know,
mostly I just,
you know,

852
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:32.480
I read a lot and I kind of have been,
I was a,
um,

853
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:34.280
you couldn't tell those by talking to me now,

854
00:51:34.281 --> 00:51:38.360
but I was kind of a strange kid growing up.
Uh,
I,

855
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:43.970
I sort of became fixated by,
um,

856
00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:49.200
by the end of the world as,
as a,
as a kid.
Uh,
I remember,
um,
I don't know why,
uh,

857
00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:53.250
I remember the first,
like I was really,
really intrigued and kind of obsessed.

858
00:51:53.251 --> 00:51:57.710
There's a little kid with this idea of,
of how the world's going to end.
And,
um,

859
00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:01.190
my,
the first movie I ever saw,
um,
I was six,

860
00:52:01.191 --> 00:52:04.940
it was in Russia and my father took me to see this movie in a movie theater that

861
00:52:04.941 --> 00:52:08.930
was a,
I was just like little,
like super nerdy,
impressionable,
you know,

862
00:52:08.931 --> 00:52:12.050
six year old kid.
And My,
my dad took me to see,
um,

863
00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:15.350
this Japanese horror movie called legend of the dinosaur,

864
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:17.480
which was about like dinosaurs,
like coming back to life.

865
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:21.770
It's the most Japanese title ever.
I love the legend of dinosaur.

866
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:26.510
And uh,
this was just like extremely bad parenting.
Like seriously,

867
00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:29.240
I don't know what he was thinking and uh,
you know,

868
00:52:29.241 --> 00:52:31.280
and I couldn't sleep for like for like a month afterwards.

869
00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:32.890
It was like too terrified to sleep cause I was like,

870
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:35.550
I thought the world was going to end cause dinosaurs are going to come back and

871
00:52:35.551 --> 00:52:36.470
fight all of us in half.

872
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:41.360
That's what Beetlejuice did to my brother as a settlement.
Yeah.
Uh,
and uh,

873
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:44.660
I remember one day,
one day,
like I just one night I was lying in bed,

874
00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:48.130
I couldn't sleep and I think my dad kind of got tired of me not sleeping and so

875
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:50.330
he came over and I remember he's,
you know,
he sat on my bed and he's like,
Hey,

876
00:52:50.331 --> 00:52:52.940
what,
you know,
what are you afraid of?
What?
Like what,
what are you worried about?

877
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.310
And I said,
well dad,
uh,
to be honest with you,

878
00:52:55.311 --> 00:52:57.140
I'm afraid that the world's going to end because you know,

879
00:52:57.141 --> 00:53:01.430
dinosaurs are going to come back and bite all of us and half.
Um,
and he said,

880
00:53:01.431 --> 00:53:05.510
look,
uh,
like in hindsight I shouldn't have taken you to see that movie.
Um,

881
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:08.690
you don't have to worry about it.
Dinosaur to definitely not going to come back.

882
00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:12.690
The world is definitely not going to end with dinosaurs coming back and,

883
00:53:12.691 --> 00:53:17.420
and eating us.
You know,
the world's going to end the nuclear war.
Um,
and dead.

884
00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:20.480
It was that,
you know,
that's what everyone thought.
I mean this was like,
this was,

885
00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:24.860
I don't know,
late seventies and in the Soviet Union.
Um,

886
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:26.250
and that's kind of what everyone thought.

887
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:28.410
And then we moved to the u s and that's what everyone thought here.

888
00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.360
And so I've been kind of thinking about like,

889
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:35.230
what is the meaning of life and what is like,

890
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:38.610
what happens when things end and if things are going to end,
like what,

891
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:42.870
what's the purpose of having a purpose?
Uh,
and I just,
you know,

892
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:46.560
read a lot of Thor comics and then went on to maybe,
you know,

893
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:51.750
somewhat more serious things and in high school and in college and got into
that.

894
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:53.640
And I,
I think I'm starting to piece things together.

895
00:53:53.641 --> 00:53:56.460
I think I have a generally sunnier disposition towards life.

896
00:53:56.461 --> 00:54:00.100
And I think I have inklings of,
of what meaning is,
but I'm not sure I understand.

897
00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:02.820
I know completely.
I am.
More recently,

898
00:54:02.821 --> 00:54:04.800
I've been reading a lot of of stoicism stuff.

899
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:06.530
So you said Marcus Aurelius and a few others.

900
00:54:06.531 --> 00:54:08.670
So I think that's like that's going to be the new trend.
The,

901
00:54:08.671 --> 00:54:09.630
I'm calling it right here.

902
00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:13.560
This is going to be the new trendy thing and silicon valley like zen was sort of

903
00:54:13.561 --> 00:54:18.120
like last year's thing.
The new,
the new zen is going to be stoicism.

904
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:19.783
Um,

905
00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:24.720
it would have gone like Zen and then macrons and then stoicism.

906
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:28.740
There was like a diversion macaroons.
What was the second one?
Macrons yeah,

907
00:54:28.741 --> 00:54:33.210
fancy macaroons.
Oh Wow.
Macro runs that's taken the wrong.
Maybe like toast,

908
00:54:33.211 --> 00:54:34.650
like artisanal toasts is also big.

909
00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:39.240
So maybe it goes like Zen and then artismal toast and then stoicism.

910
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.450
But you're going to hear more and more about stoicism and being like the hip new

911
00:54:42.451 --> 00:54:44.730
philosophy coming out of here.
I agree.
I agree.

912
00:54:44.731 --> 00:54:48.930
I've been trying to do my part with the proselytizing of Stoicism,

913
00:54:48.931 --> 00:54:53.130
which in and of itself is kind of ironic.
But the artisanal test,

914
00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:56.430
if you ever go to,
you know,
cause she'd a park in Tokyo,

915
00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:01.460
they have an artisanal toast coffee shop set up in the park where they have

916
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:07.250
panda faces burnt into the sides of the toast that you can buy.

917
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.800
It's,
it's fantastic panda faces in artisanal or not,

918
00:55:10.801 --> 00:55:13.630
not to concepts that go together usually,
but what's the weight one?

919
00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:17.190
They can pull it off.
Hold on a second.
What image would it have to be,

920
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:19.740
if not pandas or is it image lists?

921
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:23.340
Does it have to have some type of like brand on it or how do you,

922
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:26.770
how do you envision artisanal toast?
I think it just has to be,
you know,

923
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:30.180
like perfectly toasted.
I don't,
you know,
it shouldn't be,
it should be a no logo.

924
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:34.140
It's like the 15 minute pour over of toast.
That's right.
Well,

925
00:55:34.141 --> 00:55:37.890
the best toast best folks in the world is in Singapore.
Uh,
it's Kaia toast.

926
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:42.990
So you get like,
you get these thick slabs of,
of,
of toast,
um,

927
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.120
spread with a butter and Kaia.

928
00:55:45.121 --> 00:55:49.050
Kaia is like this like sweet coconut spread and then you dip it into really

929
00:55:49.051 --> 00:55:53.010
runny,
soft boiled eggs and you have a pulled coffee.

930
00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:56.520
So this coffee that they pour over like six feet in front of you,

931
00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.980
it's the best over 600 feet.

932
00:55:58.981 --> 00:56:03.420
Is it like a game of Thrones poor from across the room?
Like Chinese style?

933
00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:07.140
That's,
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you get this like really air rated coffee,

934
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:11.760
uh,
sweet toast dipped into runny eggs.

935
00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:16.050
Best thing ever.
I'm just imagining this Willy Wonka like chocolate,

936
00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:21.300
a chocolate colored coffee waterfall that you put stick your Mcginn too.

937
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:25.240
I'm not sure that's the proper image,
but it does give me some ideas.

938
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:29.750
So the uh,
let's step outside of Evernote for a second.
Um,

939
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:35.760
what are the most used apps on your phone besides Evernote?

940
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.050
Um,
well,
so basically,

941
00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.790
so to me Evernote doesn't really feel like an APP.
Like I use,
you know,

942
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.000
I use like,
I think of,
you know,

943
00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:51.550
email messaging web and Evernote.

944
00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:56.020
That's kind of like the same order of things.
Uh,
so like it doesn't,

945
00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:58.660
it doesn't even feel like I'm using an app when I use it.
I'm just,
you know,

946
00:56:58.661 --> 00:57:02.700
I'm just using it.
I use,
you know,
so I use a bunch of the messaging apps,
um,

947
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.980
really kind of to test them out to sort of see,
see how things are going,

948
00:57:05.981 --> 00:57:10.720
see what's,
see what's impressive,
where the good ideas coming from.
But again,

949
00:57:10.721 --> 00:57:13.330
even there they don't really feel like,
like apps.
In fact,

950
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.560
this is probably the thing,

951
00:57:14.561 --> 00:57:17.170
it was like things that I use all the time I don't think of as apps.

952
00:57:17.171 --> 00:57:20.340
Like I don't think of Uber is an APP.
Like I use Uber quite a bit.
Um,

953
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:24.380
it doesn't really feel like an APP to me.
Is it a utility or what is the wood?

954
00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.310
How do you compartmentalize APP?
What does that,

955
00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:31.330
what does that feel like when you do use in that it's like a service I guess.
Um,

956
00:57:31.331 --> 00:57:32.650
so I,
one of my,

957
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.700
one of my product hypotheses is that apps are like apps are going away.

958
00:57:36.701 --> 00:57:40.630
The concept of an APP is going to become a lot less important than a few years.

959
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:42.420
And it is now.
So like this,

960
00:57:42.421 --> 00:57:46.600
this whole idea that your like page through screens of stuff to pick something

961
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:49.570
you want to use like that,
that that's a short term concept.
That's only,

962
00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:50.351
it's only going to be,

963
00:57:50.351 --> 00:57:53.890
have been with us for a decade or so and then it will vanish and there'll be

964
00:57:53.891 --> 00:57:57.940
replaced with this concept of just,
you know,
experience of services.
So,
you know,

965
00:57:57.941 --> 00:58:02.650
Amazon,
I mean I use the Amazon App,
we don't think of it as an APP.
I use Netflix,

966
00:58:02.651 --> 00:58:04.670
but if that's not an APP,
uh,

967
00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:09.100
one things that had just become these like permanent fixtures in my life,

968
00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:12.280
their fixtures,
but they're not,
they're not apps and I use them.

969
00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:14.950
I'll use them everywhere.
I'll use them on a phone,
I'll use them on the web,

970
00:58:14.951 --> 00:58:19.090
I'll use them on my watch,
you know,
at some point in my glasses,
whatever.
Um,

971
00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:24.030
in terms of like discreet apps that I use on the phone,
um,
a lot of games.
I,

972
00:58:24.031 --> 00:58:28.360
I,
I,
I mostly just the,
like all of the specific small things on my phone.

973
00:58:28.361 --> 00:58:32.020
She sent to be games that I'm trying out.
What are your favorite games?
Uh,

974
00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:35.380
I go through them pretty fast.
Like right now,
like,
you know,

975
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:39.910
for the past couple of days I've been playing a radical repelling,
which is,

976
00:58:39.911 --> 00:58:41.560
you know what it sounds like

977
00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:47.860
repelling like rappelling down the side of a rock face.
Yeah.

978
00:58:47.861 --> 00:58:52.060
You like to repel down the side of a rock face and you get power ups and tried

979
00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:55.840
drawing or avoid running into spikes and like drink cans of highly caffeinated

980
00:58:55.841 --> 00:58:58.870
beverages that give you a burst of energy.
It's,
it's very,

981
00:58:58.871 --> 00:58:59.920
it's very much like real life.

982
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.420
Before that I was kind of into goat simulator.

983
00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:07.300
So of goat simulator on iPhone is pretty good.
It's the best.

984
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.900
It's definitely the best goat simulation that you can get on your iPhone.

985
00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:16.630
And do you use these games to decompress?
Have you always been a Gamer?

986
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:22.240
Yeah,
I have.
Um,
I usually play,
I used to play a lot more like computer games.
Uh,

987
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.370
now I don't have quite as much time.
Um,

988
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.460
although I did recently start playing elite dangerous,

989
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.030
which is dangerous.
Elite,
dangerous.
Yeah.
It's,

990
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:36.630
it's probably the greatest game,
maybe thing ever made.
Okay.

991
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.760
<v 1>Uh,
elite and like elite force,
but then dangerous the adjective.</v>

992
00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:44.220
<v 3>Yes.
I guess that's a space game.
Uh,</v>

993
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.950
just came out and amazing and,
and,
and like,

994
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:51.360
like Jeff Bezos is basically envisions a world where humans are everywhere in

995
00:59:51.361 --> 00:59:54.000
space but,
but mostly living on space stations,
mining asteroids,

996
00:59:54.001 --> 00:59:58.290
not really going down to planets.
So sort of to two factors for that.

997
00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:03.650
<v 1>How,
how long,
how far away are we,
do you think from mining asteroids?</v>

998
01:00:03.651 --> 01:00:06.230
Because I know there's,
for instance,
planetary resources,

999
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:10.580
which Peter Diamandis is involved with.
Brian Johnson is an investor,

1000
01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:13.870
couple of other folks,
a lot of the uh,
uh,

1001
01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:18.650
sort of zero gravity guys are involved,
um,
with planetary resources,

1002
01:00:18.651 --> 01:00:23.600
which is focused specifically on mining precious materials off of asteroids.

1003
01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.180
We,
when do you think will will actually be,

1004
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.540
<v 3>you know,
I in full swing,
it's really hard to say.</v>

1005
01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:35.160
I think the most important thing to nail first is the reusable,

1006
01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:37.980
like repeatable,
uh,
launch vehicles.

1007
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.850
And that tourism was probably going to get us there before,
before mining does.

1008
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:45.660
Um,
so I'm actually kind of a big fan of a lot of the,

1009
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:49.350
a lot of the space tourism efforts like virgin galactic and a few others just

1010
01:00:49.351 --> 01:00:53.120
because I think not because I think it's particularly great to send people into

1011
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.410
Lord,
but I mean that's fine.
But I think like we need to,

1012
01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:00.980
we need to get the reusable rockets and launch vehicles going as much as

1013
01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:03.090
possible and that'll really unlock everything else.

1014
01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.910
And I think so I think we will have pretty good repeatable,

1015
01:01:05.911 --> 01:01:09.090
reusable launch vehicles within,
you know,
five years.

1016
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:13.500
But then how long does it go from there to asteroid mining?
Uh,
I dunno,

1017
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:15.100
that could be decades.
Um,

1018
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:18.990
especially since it doesn't really make sense to mine asteroids and then ship

1019
01:01:18.991 --> 01:01:20.220
the results back to Earth.

1020
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.910
Like it probably makes sense to actually just move industry into space.

1021
01:01:23.911 --> 01:01:26.940
So you should be mining asteroids and building things in space stations.

1022
01:01:26.941 --> 01:01:29.460
And the only things that should be coming back to earth is basically,
you know,

1023
01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:34.170
data like we should be getting,
you know,
fast internet connectivity from space.

1024
01:01:34.171 --> 01:01:37.410
And that's about it.
Like everything else should be just be being made,
you know,

1025
01:01:37.411 --> 01:01:41.120
up there.
So that's,
but that's,
you know,
a above my pay grade B,

1026
01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:44.130
I have no idea what I'm talking about and see probably a few decades away.

1027
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:49.080
<v 1>So,
uh,
let's,
let's continue talking about things,
at least above my pay grade.
Uh,</v>

1028
01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:52.620
but,
uh,
still might be within yours.
I think the,

1029
01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:55.710
if you were looking at the end of the world,

1030
01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.580
the things that could eradicate the human race from the face of earth,

1031
01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:04.290
aside from us leaving and some Elysium type fashion,
uh,

1032
01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:05.030
what would you,

1033
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:09.840
where would you put in the top sort of three positions as probable causes of

1034
01:02:09.841 --> 01:02:14.270
human extinction and would AIB anywhere in that list?
Well,

1035
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.610
so probably not dinosaurs.
So I think that like

1036
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:20.880
<v 3>over that,
um,
um,
I,
you know,</v>

1037
01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:27.210
so I'm not afraid of Ai.
I really think the AI debate is a little bit,

1038
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:29.220
uh,
it's,

1039
01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.870
it's kind of overdramatized and to be honest with you kind of find it weird and

1040
01:02:33.871 --> 01:02:37.230
I find that weird for several reasons,
but including this one,
and it's like,

1041
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:38.700
this is hypothesis.
Like,
okay,

1042
01:02:38.701 --> 01:02:41.880
we're going to build super intelligent machines and,

1043
01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:44.640
and they're going to get exponentially smarter and smarter and like,

1044
01:02:44.641 --> 01:02:48.690
so they're going to be basically be much smarter than us and these like super

1045
01:02:48.691 --> 01:02:51.990
smart machines are going to make the logical decision that like the best thing

1046
01:02:51.991 --> 01:02:54.570
to do is to kill us.
And that just doesn't like,

1047
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:58.080
I feel like there's a couple of steps missing in that like in that chain of

1048
01:02:58.081 --> 01:02:58.914
events,

1049
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:03.090
like I don't understand why the obviously smart thing to do would be to kill all

1050
01:03:03.091 --> 01:03:05.990
the humans.
Um,
you know,

1051
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.600
like the smarter I get the less I want to kill all the humans.

1052
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:15.750
Why wouldn't these like really smart machines not want to be helpful?

1053
01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:16.584
Like what is it,

1054
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:21.480
what is it about our guilt as a species that makes us think that like the smart

1055
01:03:21.481 --> 01:03:24.270
thing to do would be to kill all the humans.

1056
01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:28.130
I think that actually says more about like what we feel guilty about then.

1057
01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:29.220
Then what's actually gonna happen.

1058
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:35.240
And if we really think that like a smart decision would be to wipe out humanity,

1059
01:03:35.281 --> 01:03:38.940
like it's maybe more useful to instead of like trying to like prevent AI,

1060
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:41.310
maybe it's more useful to think about like,
okay,

1061
01:03:41.311 --> 01:03:44.250
what are we so guilty about and let's like,
let's fix that.
Can we,

1062
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:49.320
can we maybe get to a point where we feel proud of our species and say like,

1063
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:51.600
maybe the smart thing to do isn't,
wouldn't be to wipe it out.

1064
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:56.670
I think there's a lot of like important issues that are being,
I dunno,

1065
01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.380
sublimated into the,
uh,

1066
01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:02.130
into the AI will kill all humans discussion that are probably worth pulling

1067
01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:06.240
apart in tackling independently.
Um,
so yeah,
I'm just like,
I'm not,

1068
01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.940
I'm not overly concerned about it.
Um,

1069
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:13.140
I do think that it's worth taking seriously.
Um,

1070
01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:18.890
I think AI is going to be one of the greatest forces for good in,

1071
01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:19.230
you know,

1072
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:22.740
in the universe and the universe is ever seen and it's pretty exciting that we

1073
01:04:22.741 --> 01:04:27.570
are actually making progress towards it.
And what,

1074
01:04:27.571 --> 01:04:30.930
uh,
if not AI and what would you put at the top of list?

1075
01:04:30.931 --> 01:04:35.931
Does anything come to mind is as if the human race were to extinguish itself or

1076
01:04:36.631 --> 01:04:39.660
been extinguished in the next say 20 years,

1077
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:44.550
what are the most likely causes in your mind?
Well,
you know,
there's,

1078
01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:47.010
there's interesting groups,
right,
that work on this.

1079
01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.360
There's all those sort of the existential threats groups and you know,

1080
01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:52.410
they've got all sorts of,
all sorts of good theories.

1081
01:04:52.411 --> 01:04:56.910
I think it's extremely unlikely that the human race gets extinguished in the

1082
01:04:56.911 --> 01:05:00.150
next 20 years.
Uh,
I think,
I think there's like,

1083
01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:03.900
you can basically isolate this into short term risks,

1084
01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:07.920
which are all self inflicted.
Like there's a bunch of self inflicted risks,
like,

1085
01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.660
you know,
nuclear war,
which is probably still a risk.

1086
01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:14.160
I know it's not going to wipe out all humanity,
but it could,
it could,

1087
01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:19.240
it could set us back,
uh,
you know,
quite a bit.
Um,
and there's other,

1088
01:05:19.241 --> 01:05:21.820
you know,
there's like climate change is a serious issue,

1089
01:05:21.821 --> 01:05:24.460
but it's not going to result in wiping out humanity.

1090
01:05:24.461 --> 01:05:29.410
It might result in a lot of displacement than a lot of economic costs.
Um,

1091
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:32.950
you know,
there's,
there's global pandemics,
which again,

1092
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:34.870
kind of by their definition,
you know,
a,

1093
01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:38.650
a super flew isn't going to wipe out humanity,
but it could be really bad.

1094
01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:40.490
It could kill a lot of people.
Uh,

1095
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.210
so there's a lot of these like sort of self inflicted risks,

1096
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:46.390
which I think it's important to get a lot better at,
uh,
at uh,
dealing with.

1097
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.550
And then there's the real long term stuff,

1098
01:05:48.551 --> 01:05:52.480
which obviously at some point we'll wipe out everything on earth.

1099
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:56.590
We were talking about,
you know,
millions of years,
uh,
or even billions of years,

1100
01:05:56.591 --> 01:06:01.570
you know,
asteroid impacts,
uh,
you know,
the sun exploding,
Supernova,

1101
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.080
that kind of stuff.
Uh,
and the only real solution there is to,

1102
01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:08.960
at some point we do need to become a multi planet species.
So,
you know,
no,

1103
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:11.710
no big rush.
We don't all need to like rush towards the exits,
but it is,

1104
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.490
it is kind of neat to actually be working on things that will enable us at some

1105
01:06:15.491 --> 01:06:18.190
point to,
you know,
spread out a bit.

1106
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:21.520
<v 1>Steve Wilson,
I think a among other people,
I mean,</v>

1107
01:06:21.521 --> 01:06:26.480
Stephen Hawking has said pretty clearly as I understand it,
that,
uh,

1108
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:31.770
for us to survive we have to become multiplanetary,
uh,

1109
01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:34.660
or extra planetary maybe at the very least.
Yeah,

1110
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:37.170
<v 3>I think,
I think that's right.
And,
but you know,
it's also an engine.</v>

1111
01:06:37.171 --> 01:06:39.670
The question is,
is what,
what does,
what does the US,
right?

1112
01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:43.000
So it's plausible that like things that,
that are,

1113
01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:46.630
that look like biological human beings actually never live at scale outside of

1114
01:06:46.631 --> 01:06:51.330
the planet.
But other things we create,
um,
you know,

1115
01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.850
other intelligences and consciousness that,
that,
that we create.
Actually my,

1116
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.070
my actually won't be able to spread among the stars.

1117
01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:01.570
And that's kind of cool to like,
I,
I think it's an elegant idea.
Um,

1118
01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.820
<v 1>there's a very cool science fiction short.
It's an animated short,</v>

1119
01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:08.120
which is actually also very funny.
Uh,
I think it's,

1120
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:12.840
that's 16 minutes called the world of tomorrow,
which is worth checking out.

1121
01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.610
It digs into a lot of this.
So as a,
as a side note,
that's a,

1122
01:07:17.611 --> 01:07:22.230
that's a fun watch.
You mentioned Netflix.
Do you have any favorite documentaries?

1123
01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:29.100
<v 3>Oh yeah.
Uh,
I have a bunch.
Um,
you know,</v>

1124
01:07:29.101 --> 01:07:32.940
I really liked,
uh,
those one that I just saw a couple of weeks ago.

1125
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:37.530
Um,
that was really good.
I think it was called the gatekeepers.
It was like,

1126
01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.740
it was all the living heads of the Shin Bet,
the Israeli secret service.

1127
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:46.680
Just going to talking very frankly about,
um,
you know,
about life,

1128
01:07:46.681 --> 01:07:51.330
about,
about,
about war,
about peace.
Uh,
and it was just kind of kind of startling.

1129
01:07:51.331 --> 01:07:54.300
You have these,
you know,
I think it was like eight of them who wound up running,

1130
01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:57.600
you know,
they were the top kind of military spend,

1131
01:07:57.601 --> 01:08:01.880
spy people in Israel and all of them like have had,

1132
01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:05.460
have gone,
like all of them were saying things that I think later in life,
uh,

1133
01:08:05.461 --> 01:08:05.730
they've,

1134
01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:10.020
they've all like moved much more towards reconciliation and peace and dialogue.

1135
01:08:10.021 --> 01:08:14.340
And it was just as fascinating,
fascinating to hear.
Uh,

1136
01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:17.990
I watch a lot.
Um,
I watch a lot of science documentary,

1137
01:08:17.991 --> 01:08:22.970
so it was a big fan of the Neil degrasse Tyson's cosmos.
She boot.
That was great.

1138
01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:26.390
I watched all of the Carl Sagan version,
uh,
a while ago.

1139
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.510
The thing that I just saw yesterday,
which I didn't actually watch,
I just,

1140
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:30.500
I logged in,

1141
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:34.750
I signed into Netflix yesterday and saw them promoting this,

1142
01:08:34.751 --> 01:08:35.720
that she didn't even know they made it.

1143
01:08:35.721 --> 01:08:39.710
But I guess there's a new documentary about James Randy called like an honest

1144
01:08:39.711 --> 01:08:41.750
liar or something,
which I've now got queued up.

1145
01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:46.340
I think I'm probably going to watch that tonight.
I'm a huge James Randy Fam.
Uh,

1146
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:48.290
and I didn't even know they made a movie about him.

1147
01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.900
So I'm really looking forward to that.
In fact,
the very first,

1148
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:54.920
the very first things that I ever bought on the Internet,

1149
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.740
like my first ecommerce transaction,
I have a screenshot on it.

1150
01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:02.060
It was on Amazon who was in 1996 and it was a two books by James Randy.

1151
01:09:02.061 --> 01:09:05.250
So like the,
the first things I ever bought online where my,

1152
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:09.500
the first two James Randy books I ever read was also the first time I ever used

1153
01:09:09.501 --> 01:09:13.370
Amazon.
So it was like,
it was like several important first for me that I've got,

1154
01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:16.730
I've got a screenshot in Evernote and I actually met James Randy afterwards and

1155
01:09:16.731 --> 01:09:19.640
I had him sign my screenshot in Evernote.

1156
01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:23.930
So this sort of a five levels of dorkiness in there,
but I'm pretty proud of it.

1157
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:28.340
Yeah.
This,
this James,
Randy the magician or which James?
Randy.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1158
01:09:28.341 --> 01:09:29.540
the amazing Randi James.

1159
01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:34.541
Randy the magician slash you know debunker slash skeptic in the same vein is

1160
01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:41.020
Penn and teller,
would you say?
Yeah,
he's sort of like,
he's kind of maybe the,

1161
01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:42.170
the,
the father of,
of,

1162
01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.440
of all this other sort of like the modern sort of pro science and skeptical

1163
01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:50.000
movement.
Um,
but yeah,
so,
so a little bit,

1164
01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:52.970
a little similar dependent Telstra follow James.

1165
01:09:52.971 --> 01:09:56.060
Randy doesn't do a whole lot of like magic debunking.

1166
01:09:56.061 --> 01:10:00.470
It's more about science teaching and the quackery.
I'm looking at it online here.

1167
01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:05.120
It says he has a Ted talk called that it's Randy ran Dai and the title of his

1168
01:10:05.121 --> 01:10:09.110
talk is homeopathy,
quackery and fraud.
Yeah,
yeah.
A lot.

1169
01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.930
So a lot of stuff like that.
And,
uh,
and haven't actually seen the documentary.

1170
01:10:11.931 --> 01:10:16.880
So I don't know if it's any good.
I probably is.
Uh,
I just,
I remember seeing,
uh,

1171
01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.580
yesterday that it was on Netflix and going on.

1172
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:22.250
As soon as I have a spare two hours,
I'm going to watch it.

1173
01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:26.810
We should probably be tonight.
Do you have any favorite non documentary movies?

1174
01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:30.110
Um,
well,
you know,

1175
01:10:30.111 --> 01:10:32.840
the best movie ever made us as the empire strikes back.

1176
01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:38.750
I noticed your mug.
So that's that.
Is that your favorite of the Star Wars series?

1177
01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.430
Yeah.
Well that's objectively the best one really up for debate.

1178
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:48.980
Was it the ton tons that pushed it over?
What?
Oh so much.
It was so much stuff.

1179
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.600
Uh,
it's just,
uh,
it's just,

1180
01:10:50.670 --> 01:10:54.050
it's just a really good one that actually I've seen it.
I just,

1181
01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.990
I watched it again,
uh,
recently,
right,
because they just released like the,

1182
01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:59.960
the digital versions of all,
all six movies.

1183
01:10:59.961 --> 01:11:04.610
And so I just watched the good three again.
Uh,

1184
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:08.660
yeah,
it's just,
it's just great.
Can we think about it?
All right.
The middle,

1185
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:12.470
the middle movies of trilogies are usually the best ones cause they think like

1186
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:16.970
the first movie,
you know,
the director is still like trying to,
you know,
there's,

1187
01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:18.570
they're trying a little bit too hard,
you know,

1188
01:11:18.571 --> 01:11:19.800
they have to like prove themselves.

1189
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:23.550
And then by the third one they've got to wrap things up.

1190
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.170
But the second one is like the pacing is different and sort of the intermediate

1191
01:11:28.171 --> 01:11:32.010
thing,
if it has this like sense of continuity but also more to come.

1192
01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:34.830
Like just everything about like that the middle part usually is good.

1193
01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:38.460
Like I think the two towers was the best Lord of the rings movie and so on.
But,

1194
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:41.670
but,
but return,
but empire strikes back in particular,

1195
01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:46.620
it was just like super strong.
So,
uh,
but I also watch,
you know,

1196
01:11:46.621 --> 01:11:51.360
I don't,
I don't watch too much TV.
Um,
I uh,
I used to watch top gear.

1197
01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:56.340
I'm sorry.
I got you canceled.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
and then,
um,

1198
01:11:57.590 --> 01:12:01.230
you know,
I binge watched house of cards and game of Thrones,
although I haven't,

1199
01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.330
I haven't watched the last season of game of Thrones yet.

1200
01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:07.430
<v 1>Well and just binge watched it,
uh,
this last week.
It's good.
I won't,</v>

1201
01:12:07.431 --> 01:12:09.390
I won't give any spoilers.
It's,
it's,

1202
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:13.610
it has a very much has a herky Jerky,

1203
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:16.640
upper and Downer effect,
which I think is very intentional.

1204
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:20.040
<v 3>Yeah.
I think the series is really good.
Uh,</v>

1205
01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:22.340
I've read all the books and I know that last,

1206
01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.160
the last season supposedly the parts from some of the books a little bit.

1207
01:12:25.161 --> 01:12:26.750
So I'm interested to see,

1208
01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.210
<v 1>uh,
how that goes.
Do you,
uh,</v>

1209
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:34.870
well actually before I give the the notebook question,
um,

1210
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:39.290
not about the movie with that very beautiful woman.
I'm blanking on her name.

1211
01:12:39.291 --> 01:12:43.450
Not that one,
but actual physical notebooks.
Yeah.
Uh,
what do you,

1212
01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:46.160
are you attracted to Ryan Gosling?
No,
that's my real question.
Now.

1213
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:49.370
The a tier three me,
he is dreaming.

1214
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:54.910
What book have you gifted most to other people or books?

1215
01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:59.560
<v 3>Um,
probably,
um,</v>

1216
01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:04.620
the clock of the long now by a steward brand is maybe the most influential

1217
01:13:07.691 --> 01:13:12.220
books,
maybe the most influential book on me.
So it's,
this is,
um,
so I,
you know,

1218
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:13.103
the long now

1219
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:15.800
<v 1>actually with Denny,
a about the clock and Danny Hillis.</v>

1220
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.510
<v 3>Yeah.
Danny Hillis and Stewart brand,
um,</v>

1221
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:20.820
are kind of the co founders and then there's,
you know,

1222
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:22.720
there's a lot of other people involved.
And so this is the,

1223
01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:26.410
this is the organization that's building a 10,000 year clock in like in,

1224
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:30.870
in the middle of the mountain.
And then also preserving like all human languages.

1225
01:13:30.871 --> 01:13:34.760
It's,
it's an organization is dedicated to longterm thinking.
Um,

1226
01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.830
like how do you actually make plans for,
you know,
10,000 years,

1227
01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.620
which sort of sounds crazy,
but you know,
but it isn't,

1228
01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:45.150
and if we can't make plans for 10,000 years and no one else is going to,

1229
01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:50.700
um,
and so,
uh,
Stewart brand who is just amazing guy,

1230
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.810
I was lucky enough to actually,

1231
01:13:51.811 --> 01:13:54.510
I invited him to speak at our last conference and he,
you know,
he agreed.

1232
01:13:54.511 --> 01:13:57.890
So it's kind of amazing just to introduce them onstage.
Um,

1233
01:13:58.030 --> 01:14:01.060
<v 1>incredible guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's creator,</v>

1234
01:14:01.061 --> 01:14:03.940
a cocreator of the whole earth catalog way back in the day for those people who

1235
01:14:03.941 --> 01:14:04.840
remember.
Yep.

1236
01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.540
<v 3>Whole Earth Catalog and,
and the well look,</v>

1237
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.380
one of the first Internet discussion sites and all sorts stuff.

1238
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.170
Uh,
and so his book is the,
the clock of the long now.
And it just talks about,

1239
01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:20.470
you know,
the principles and the foundation and it's,
it's a very short read,

1240
01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:22.480
but in particular there's one chapter of it,

1241
01:14:22.481 --> 01:14:25.840
which is for me it was really like sort of life changing.
Um,

1242
01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:28.240
I think it's called like the layers of civilization.

1243
01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:33.000
And it basically just talks about,
um,
the six or seven layers of,

1244
01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:36.580
of society and kind of how they interact with each other.
And,
uh,

1245
01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.020
it kind of explains like,

1246
01:14:38.021 --> 01:14:43.021
it puts the structure of explaining almost everything that you'd ever wondered

1247
01:14:43.151 --> 01:14:47.340
about and like just a few pages.
And so,
uh,

1248
01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:51.070
it's really effected me.
I read it,
I read them,
I was pretty young and,
and,

1249
01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:53.470
and like I've been kind of going back to it every so often.

1250
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:58.330
So the clock of the long now,
uh,
I've given it lots of times,

1251
01:14:58.331 --> 01:15:01.030
definitely couldn't recommend it more highly that.

1252
01:15:01.031 --> 01:15:04.970
And I would also highly recommend people check out the long now foundation.
It's,

1253
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.610
it's an incredible group of people.
Kevin Kelly's very involved as well.

1254
01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:15.120
And it is a way to telescope out and even do thought experiments Solo,

1255
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.120
uh,
related to 10,000 year thinking.
For instance,

1256
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:26.590
it's a really fascinating website to check out.
They also have a,
uh,

1257
01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:31.980
a bar at a in San Francisco that I contributed to for their Kickstarter campaign

1258
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:37.480
go bottles.
Oh,
you did?
I haven't yet.
I haven't been there yet.

1259
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:43.000
The interval then?
Yeah,
exactly.
The interval as the Fort Mason.
Super Nice.
Yeah,

1260
01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:45.370
I've heard it.
It's just gorgeous up now.

1261
01:15:45.371 --> 01:15:48.700
When I go to whether it's a coffee shop or a bar,

1262
01:15:48.701 --> 01:15:52.800
I almost always have a small mole skin or moleskine there.

1263
01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.080
I don't know how to say it properly.
Notebook with me.

1264
01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.160
I have a lot of trouble separating myself from physical notetaking.

1265
01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:05.470
Uh,
do you use personally physical notebooks?

1266
01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.800
I do.
Yeah.
That was weird.
Intonation on the question.
Sorry.

1267
01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:13.410
It sounded more like a steel.
Do you use physical notebooks as a statement?
Uh,

1268
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:16.520
but uh,
sorry to interrupt.
I do,
yeah.

1269
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:20.420
What do you use them for and why don't you do everything digitally?
Um,

1270
01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.330
well it is digital.
So,
um,
our,
our partnership with mole skin is,

1271
01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:27.560
is you know,
we can use uh,

1272
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.370
well any notebook or most good noble just worked strictly well since we've

1273
01:16:30.371 --> 01:16:32.880
optimized our software for it.
And uh,

1274
01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:35.530
he just right and then take a picture of an Evernote of the page and it

1275
01:16:35.531 --> 01:16:39.070
automatically gets cleaned up and index and scans and kind of put in context

1276
01:16:39.071 --> 01:16:41.320
with everything else.
And so just the best of both worlds,

1277
01:16:41.321 --> 01:16:44.740
like it lets you be discreet and unintrusive and,
and,

1278
01:16:44.741 --> 01:16:47.200
and kind of take notes and uh,

1279
01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:50.920
and then immediately have them available digitally for searching and in

1280
01:16:50.921 --> 01:16:54.850
reference in sharing.
So it,
it,
it's um,
um,
you know,

1281
01:16:54.851 --> 01:16:56.590
we're trying to combine the best of,

1282
01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:00.520
we're trying to give people great experiences without being pedantic about,

1283
01:17:01.230 --> 01:17:03.640
you know,
what has to be digital with the physical.
We really want,

1284
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.660
we really want to blend those two things.
I think I'm,

1285
01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:11.540
the best products are made when you take into account the physical world.

1286
01:17:11.541 --> 01:17:12.830
When you take into account,
you know,

1287
01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:17.240
how things feel like and how heavy they are and where you put your hands.

1288
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:20.630
And it's kind of the same if you're designing iPad software or if you're

1289
01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.410
actually designing a physical notebook.

1290
01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:26.300
You have to think about these things and it's important for us to think about

1291
01:17:26.301 --> 01:17:29.180
them and to,
to try and make beautiful experiences that combine those things.

1292
01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:30.350
What,

1293
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:35.350
what types of things do you personally put into your physical notebook before

1294
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.200
scanning them into Evernote?
So there's a,
there's a little trick.
Um,

1295
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:44.240
I guess I haven't actually told us anyone before.
So here's how this works.

1296
01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:47.230
You know how if you're in a meeting and,
um,

1297
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:50.300
you've got your laptop open and you're like taking notes on your laptop,

1298
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:54.560
it's like the like that's a little depth sort of creates a barrier between you

1299
01:17:54.561 --> 01:17:56.510
and,
and,
and uh,
and the other people.

1300
01:17:56.511 --> 01:17:59.240
And it sometimes feels like a little bit like a little bit distant,

1301
01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:03.140
a little bit intimidating.
Definitely.
We actually make stickers that say,
um,

1302
01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:05.270
I am like,
I'm not being rude.

1303
01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:07.820
I'm taking notes in Evernote that you can stick on the back of your laptop to,

1304
01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.970
to solve that problem.
Uh,

1305
01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:15.140
so or you can use a phone,
but if you use a phone in a meeting with someone,

1306
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.840
then it just kind of looks like you're not paying attention to them.

1307
01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:21.770
Like all of the dynamics are that you're like texting distracted.
Yeah.

1308
01:18:21.771 --> 01:18:24.320
Even if you're taking notes,
but if you use a notebook,

1309
01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:28.790
if you like write in a notebook while you're talking to someone,
they feel like,

1310
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:30.650
man,
this person really cares about me.

1311
01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:33.860
Like it totally flips the odometer or the other way,

1312
01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:37.160
like you are signaling like deep caring and interest.

1313
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:40.920
If you just like scribble in a notebook while talking to someone.
Uh,

1314
01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:44.960
and so like even if you're like,
even if you're just like drawing,
you know,

1315
01:18:44.961 --> 01:18:49.910
houses and clouds and Unicorns,
but yeah,
big Lebowski style.
Yeah,
exactly.

1316
01:18:49.911 --> 01:18:53.960
So it's like the key to like making it look like you are really like paying

1317
01:18:53.961 --> 01:18:56.840
attention and connecting with someone and just to like have an open notebook and

1318
01:18:56.841 --> 01:19:01.730
occasionally like nod and like write something down.
Um,
so that's,

1319
01:19:01.731 --> 01:19:06.290
you know,
that works super well.
So I would say when I'm in meetings,

1320
01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:11.810
maybe like a third of the time I'm actually like,
you know,
taking notes.

1321
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.220
Um,
and uh,

1322
01:19:13.221 --> 01:19:17.850
what I'll do is I'll just write specific words or phrases that a,

1323
01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:21.830
I know if I see later will actually like pop the whole meeting into my head.

1324
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:25.590
Yeah.
You're writing down to the keys.
Yeah,
exactly.
Cues and,
and,

1325
01:19:25.591 --> 01:19:28.700
and they're not even like necessarily the most important words.
They're just,

1326
01:19:28.701 --> 01:19:32.570
yeah,
they're just cues.
Uh,
so like I made that I may write down,

1327
01:19:32.571 --> 01:19:35.390
like in this conversation I may have,
I may have like write down like,
you know,

1328
01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:38.450
Lebowski,
look,
that was important,
but like that will,

1329
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:42.550
I know that if I saw that later and I saw that that was like on my timeline and

1330
01:19:42.610 --> 01:19:46.520
Evernote at the same time that I had this conversation with Tim and you know,

1331
01:19:46.521 --> 01:19:48.170
it's linked to you and all of our other stuff,

1332
01:19:48.171 --> 01:19:51.200
like that word will just trigger this,
this memory and it'll,
it'll come out.

1333
01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.980
So I use it for that.
I use it for,

1334
01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:56.930
for queuing in a way that doesn't create this barrier between me and the other

1335
01:19:56.931 --> 01:20:00.770
person.
And in fact not just doesn't create the barrier.
It actually like,

1336
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:05.300
it actually makes us feel closer and it makes people think that,
uh,
that uh,

1337
01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:08.520
I'm really paying attention.
Which you are right.
Which I am.
Yeah,
all the time.

1338
01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:13.080
And the process after that,

1339
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:18.110
I'd love to ask about how often do you then scan those into your Evernote?

1340
01:20:18.571 --> 01:20:21.490
Do you use your phone to take the photograph?
Do you tear them out and,

1341
01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:26.310
and put them through machine?
Uh,
I eat normal people call a scanner.

1342
01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:30.470
Yeah.
You always use your phone?
Use my phone.
Yeah.
Uh,
well I use the,

1343
01:20:30.490 --> 01:20:31.241
I use the scanner,

1344
01:20:31.241 --> 01:20:36.230
I use the Evernote scanner when I have like a stack of documents.
Um,
but um,

1345
01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:40.140
if I'm for business cards and for,
and for a handwritten notes,

1346
01:20:40.141 --> 01:20:40.974
I always use my phone.

1347
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:44.670
And it's important to do it as close as possible to the time and,

1348
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.390
and place of the meeting.
Cause then you get all the,
all the association.

1349
01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.510
So basically before,
before I get up,

1350
01:20:51.511 --> 01:20:54.660
I'll just take a picture and then I know I have it.
I know it's timestamped,
it's,

1351
01:20:54.661 --> 01:20:58.320
it's,
it's,
it's Geo stamped,
it's associated with a calendar entry.

1352
01:20:58.321 --> 01:21:00.900
Like basically everything works great if you do it right there,

1353
01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:04.890
a business card and handwritten notes.
Uh,
if you wait,

1354
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:08.100
if you wait until you get to the office like you,
you lose all that context.

1355
01:21:08.101 --> 01:21:09.640
It's just I never,
I,

1356
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.030
I'm embarrassed to say I never even thought about that because you're,

1357
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.010
you're not only losing the context,

1358
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:19.400
you are creating false signals because you could be throwing it off and if you

1359
01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:22.620
look into your calendar to see why that was associated with a given time,

1360
01:21:22.621 --> 01:21:27.570
then you're actually creating a conflict.
Like if I,
if I'm meeting with you,

1361
01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:32.070
especially if it's in my calendar and I take a picture of a,

1362
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.290
let's say I get your business card and take a picture of that in Evernote,

1363
01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:36.960
that will automatically get all your contact info and look you up on Linkedin

1364
01:21:36.961 --> 01:21:37.770
and whatever.

1365
01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:40.320
And then let's say I take some handwritten notes and I take a picture of that.

1366
01:21:41.050 --> 01:21:45.810
The,
the,
the,
the handwritten notes will be automatically titled in Evernote,

1367
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:50.750
you know,
node from meeting with Tim Ferriss and your business card.
We'll have,

1368
01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.980
we'll have your name and everything associated with it.

1369
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:56.430
So if I did it right there,
I've got all of the stuff.

1370
01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.510
And so the next time I searched for,
you know,
the next time I,
I,
I,

1371
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.750
you know,
write something about you or search for you.

1372
01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:06.540
I'm going to get all that stuff coming up and I'm going to see,

1373
01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:08.730
I'm going to see my note,
I'm going to see your contact info,

1374
01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:10.830
and then I'm going to see all of the,
you know,

1375
01:22:10.831 --> 01:22:14.340
any like business articles that have come out about you and any of our publisher

1376
01:22:14.341 --> 01:22:18.570
partners.
So it's like,
if you do it,
if you do it right away,
you're just,
you're,

1377
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:23.010
you're really capturing a very strong signal that not only will you use like

1378
01:22:23.011 --> 01:22:23.791
right there,
but it'll,

1379
01:22:23.791 --> 01:22:27.930
it'll make every subsequent access of this information richer.

1380
01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:33.170
When you think,
you mentioned a couple of names earlier,
obviously basis,
uh,

1381
01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:36.480
Mikitani,
Benioff Hoffman.

1382
01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.830
When you think of the word successful,
who's the first person who comes to mind?

1383
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:48.390
Oh,
I,
uh,
I don't know.
I don't know if my mind works like that.

1384
01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:53.910
Uh,
would he mean I,
I you just as successful and I just like I did,

1385
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:57.600
I didn't,
I didn't like pop into a,
into a person.

1386
01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:02.430
Uh,
I think I,
like,
I,
I immediately flashed on product,
like the first thing,

1387
01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.770
the first thing that popped into mind when you say successful was,
was,

1388
01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.500
was iPhone kind of crazy.
But yeah,
I guess I don't really,

1389
01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:13.570
I guess I don't really think of people as successful.
That's a very,

1390
01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.520
that's a new answer and like this,
so let's explore that.
Why,
why the iPhone?

1391
01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:21.580
Well,
maybe it's more like,
why not people?

1392
01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:25.000
Because I guess I don't really think of success being as being like the most

1393
01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:26.770
interesting characteristic of a person.

1394
01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:32.410
I like a lot of success is luck,
right?
I agree.
In fact,

1395
01:23:32.411 --> 01:23:34.360
I think that like anyone who's been successful,

1396
01:23:34.361 --> 01:23:39.040
even a little bit has also been lucky.
Um,
I,
you know,
luck is not,

1397
01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.800
and,
and,
and,
and,
and like when I say,
look,
I need look,

1398
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:44.980
I mean like random occurrence.
I don't mean like something like Mr Goal,
you know,

1399
01:23:44.981 --> 01:23:49.960
you make your own luck.
Anything.
Like there's a strong element of,
of,

1400
01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:52.810
of fortune of random chance to,
to personal success.

1401
01:23:52.811 --> 01:23:55.810
And then of course there's also a ton of hard work and really having to,

1402
01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:58.330
you know,
maximize it.
Um,

1403
01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:03.310
and so tons of people deserve to be successful because they're super smart and

1404
01:24:03.311 --> 01:24:07.450
interesting and work hard and you just haven't had the luck.
So to me,

1405
01:24:07.451 --> 01:24:09.910
like whether or not a person accessible,
not isn't,

1406
01:24:09.970 --> 01:24:11.740
isn't the most interesting thing about that person.

1407
01:24:11.741 --> 01:24:15.730
I really care much more about their ideas and,
and you know,
how much,

1408
01:24:15.731 --> 01:24:20.470
how interesting or fun they are.
Um,
so I guess I,
I tend,

1409
01:24:20.471 --> 01:24:24.430
I tend to think more about like,
about things about products that are successful.

1410
01:24:24.431 --> 01:24:26.380
Like,
you know,
like iPhone and that's,

1411
01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:28.480
that also has an element of luck but much less.

1412
01:24:28.481 --> 01:24:33.070
I think that's much more about really great design and smart planning and great

1413
01:24:33.071 --> 01:24:36.610
execution.
And,
and you know,
things that are,
that are more PR,

1414
01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:40.480
more predictive and more interesting than applying that measure to people.

1415
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.970
Let's make it more general,
and maybe this is,

1416
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000
this will be an equally difficult or misdirected question,

1417
01:24:48.071 --> 01:24:52.180
but which historical figure do you most identify with,

1418
01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:58.360
if any?
Historical figure.

1419
01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.650
Uh,
wow.

1420
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:09.640
I Dunno.
Um,
you know,
I don't,
okay.
So

1421
01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:15.710
I'm conscious I want to be sensitive to not like sounding like I have,

1422
01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:19.180
like I don't want this to come across as false modesty.

1423
01:25:21.670 --> 01:25:25.840
Gimme Winnie the Pooh or what or what to wear.
So the thing is like,

1424
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:31.240
I actually don't think about myself that much and,
and I mean serious about this.

1425
01:25:31.241 --> 01:25:34.170
I get an in,
in a very specific way.
Like I think,
okay.

1426
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:36.850
So we've already established,
I play a lot of video games.
I don't know.

1427
01:25:36.851 --> 01:25:39.670
I actually don't know if you do a,
I'm actually getting,

1428
01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:43.900
I'm reinvigorating my game playing as of a few weeks ago.
Okay.

1429
01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:48.670
So I stayed a lot of,
I played a lot of dungeons and dragons as,
oh,

1430
01:25:48.671 --> 01:25:52.300
I played,
I was all dungeon dragons growing up.
Yeah.
That was,

1431
01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:55.630
that was fundamental for me.
Um,
okay,

1432
01:25:55.631 --> 01:25:58.570
so there's like basically two types of games and you're like,

1433
01:25:58.571 --> 01:26:02.960
I'm like pcs and consoles.
There's um,
kind of first,
first person games,

1434
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.920
Third Person Games,
right?

1435
01:26:03.921 --> 01:26:07.010
It was like first person shooters and third person shooters,
whatever.
Uh,

1436
01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:10.600
and like a first person game is,
uh,
you know,
you're,

1437
01:26:10.601 --> 01:26:14.750
you are seeing the game world through the eyes of your character.
So you know,

1438
01:26:14.751 --> 01:26:19.250
you're running around and shooting or whatever and then a third person game,
uh,

1439
01:26:19.251 --> 01:26:21.410
you know,
and be like,
like grand theft auto or something.

1440
01:26:21.411 --> 01:26:24.440
It's like you're kind of the cameras usually like in back of you.
So you're,

1441
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:27.740
you're seeing yourself moving around and interacting in the world.

1442
01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:33.340
So in one game you kind of in one genre you sort of see how you look like in the

1443
01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:35.870
world and another genre,

1444
01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:38.660
you just see the world but you don't really see yourself in it.
Right.

1445
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:42.320
And I think like a lot of people play,

1446
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:45.410
like they go through life either like playing a first player game,

1447
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:46.910
a first person game where third person game.

1448
01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:50.600
And I don't think there's like any one of those is right or wrong.

1449
01:26:51.230 --> 01:26:53.540
I just think if you look at,
you know,
for example,

1450
01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:57.050
if you look at like most politicians like Bill Clinton,

1451
01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:00.320
whatever you think of him.
Like he's clearly playing a third person game,
right?

1452
01:27:00.321 --> 01:27:03.680
Like he is aware of what he looks like.
Like in any scene,

1453
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:07.370
any sort of optimizing for that and optimizing for,
you know,

1454
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:12.080
how to like do everything correctly cause he's seeing himself and a lot of

1455
01:27:12.081 --> 01:27:14.570
people are like that.
And then there's other people who are clearly playing,

1456
01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:15.351
you know,

1457
01:27:15.351 --> 01:27:19.130
the first person game where they're kind of oblivious about themselves in the

1458
01:27:19.131 --> 01:27:21.560
world.
They just like,
they have things they want to accomplish,

1459
01:27:21.561 --> 01:27:23.780
they know the way that they want the world to,
to bend,

1460
01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.910
but they don't really have a perception of them for better or for worse.
Like,

1461
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.600
I don't know,
it always felt like just,
you know,

1462
01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:33.140
going out with the u s presidents again,
like it always felt like,
like George W.

1463
01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:34.400
Bush was probably playing a first person game,

1464
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:39.740
but he's like a little bit less like actual visibility in his own head about

1465
01:27:39.741 --> 01:27:43.100
what he looked like interacting with,
with the world.
And again,

1466
01:27:43.101 --> 01:27:46.190
that's like obviously not a judgment that all about their political styles or

1467
01:27:46.191 --> 01:27:49.550
who you like or don't like or whatever.
Just more of a personality.

1468
01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:53.780
And I really think that like,
I'm fundamentally a first,

1469
01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.740
first person a Gamer.
Like I don't,
I don't think about like,
well,

1470
01:27:57.741 --> 01:28:01.490
who do identify with who,
who am I most?
Like,
what do I look like in this scene?

1471
01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:04.730
You know,
what do I like?
W W what do I look like from here?
Like,

1472
01:28:04.731 --> 01:28:08.180
how do I change my outfit?
Like those were the things that,
that,

1473
01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:12.590
that interests me less than what's the world around me.
Uh,
and that,

1474
01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:16.160
that probably makes me weak at all sorts of things where I should have better

1475
01:28:16.161 --> 01:28:20.700
self awareness.
Uh,
and it probably makes me stronger at other things.
Hmm.

1476
01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.030
Do you meditate or have meditated?
Practice?
Uh,
you know,
I,

1477
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:30.760
I used to a lot more,
so I went through a phase,
uh,
you know,
it's,

1478
01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:34.100
it's required if you're going to live in silicon valley,
that thing.

1479
01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:38.770
So I went through a zen phase several years ago.
Ben ocular baptism.

1480
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:43.850
Yeah.
Benioff actually got me into it.
A TM or what type of meditation?
No,

1481
01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:46.130
you know,
I've never done,
I've never done transcendental stuff.

1482
01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:49.760
I'm actually kind of interested in the whole like mantra,
uh,
idea.

1483
01:28:49.761 --> 01:28:54.470
I've never done that a sudden just then,
uh,
you know,
mindfulness and Zen and,
um,

1484
01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:59.510
now I did it fairly actively for about a year or so.
Um,

1485
01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:02.370
and uh,
but I,
you know,
I mastered it.
I won,

1486
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:07.230
I think like I DMC thing is to try really hard to,
you know,

1487
01:29:07.231 --> 01:29:10.960
have a goal,
set your mind to it.
And,
and you know,
in Youtube and master,
uh,

1488
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:15.900
can master a Zen Buddhism.
So,
so I became a zen master and,

1489
01:29:15.901 --> 01:29:20.290
and uh,
you know,
now I'm on to other things.
Now I'm onto stoicism simulator.

1490
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:25.100
Yeah.
Not,
yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,
I'm done.
I've reached,
you know,
level 13 at,
at,

1491
01:29:25.101 --> 01:29:29.550
at being a zen monk and the announcement,
the goat simulator.
Why did you stop?

1492
01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:33.660
What was the reason for stopping?
Um,
I didn't,
I didn't really stop.

1493
01:29:33.661 --> 01:29:36.690
I just sort of,
uh,
uh,
I think my,
my,

1494
01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.760
my commitment to it kind of waned.

1495
01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:43.390
So for while was meditating about 20 minutes a day,
um,
and it was good.

1496
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:48.210
It was a very,
very clarifying.
Um,
I then became interested in,
in,

1497
01:29:48.211 --> 01:29:52.230
um,
like what could we learn from that and what could we apply to different

1498
01:29:52.231 --> 01:29:56.130
products.
Uh,
and then I realized that like as I was meditating,

1499
01:29:56.131 --> 01:29:57.930
I was actually just spending more and more of my time,

1500
01:29:57.931 --> 01:30:01.140
like thinking about the meditating,
which sort of defeats the whole purpose.

1501
01:30:01.141 --> 01:30:01.974
Like I was,

1502
01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:06.690
I was treating zen meditation as like a very goal oriented thing,

1503
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:10.980
kind of the opposite of what it's supposed to be.
Right.
Uh,
and then,
um,
and then,

1504
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:15.090
so then I started reading more broadly and gone on to other things.
Um,

1505
01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.790
there's actually a product that a,
I don't know if you've tried,

1506
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:21.360
have you seen the,
the the think no one does that.

1507
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:25.720
T h y n C.
Okay.
Uh,

1508
01:30:26.110 --> 01:30:30.380
I see what they're doing there.
Yeah,
it's SORTA super awesome.
And um,

1509
01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.820
if it works and I've,
you know,

1510
01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:36.900
it's so it's so it's basically doing like direct brain stimulation through

1511
01:30:36.930 --> 01:30:40.920
ultrasounds.
You wear this device on your head and it would beams,
uh,

1512
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:43.780
vibes into your brain and,
um,

1513
01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:48.480
gives you energy or focus or calmness.
And this totally trip,

1514
01:30:48.481 --> 01:30:51.210
like every bullshit filter I had when I first saw this like got tripped.

1515
01:30:51.211 --> 01:30:54.690
I was like,
yeah,
nonsense.
Um,
but I actually,
like I read into it,

1516
01:30:54.691 --> 01:30:56.850
I looked at the science and it seem plausible.
I was like,
oh,

1517
01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:58.530
this actually like this,

1518
01:30:58.531 --> 01:31:01.050
this isn't setting off like red flags for me in terms of just being

1519
01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:05.730
pseudoscience.
Uh,
and so I thought,
okay,
this seems okay.
Um,

1520
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:06.451
and then actually got the,

1521
01:31:06.451 --> 01:31:10.200
try it a couple of weeks ago and my personal experience of it was great.

1522
01:31:10.410 --> 01:31:12.150
Like I know it was just one person's experience.

1523
01:31:12.151 --> 01:31:15.870
It's impossible to really say like what suggestion,
what's placebo,
what's real,

1524
01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.570
but at a really good experience with it.
So I just,

1525
01:31:18.571 --> 01:31:21.840
I just ordered it and it should be getting mine in the next couple of days.
And,

1526
01:31:21.841 --> 01:31:23.450
uh,
I'm actually really interested in this and the,

1527
01:31:23.451 --> 01:31:28.020
and this idea that like you can actually have significant impact and how you

1528
01:31:28.021 --> 01:31:31.860
think through meditation.
Uh,
and,

1529
01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:35.670
but you might actually actually be able to have very similar impact in the way

1530
01:31:35.671 --> 01:31:38.490
you think.
They're just much more direct application and technology.
Uh,

1531
01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:42.900
which would be cool.
So like if I was a robot,
you know,
I would robots meditate.

1532
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:46.930
It'd be something like this.
If you,
I'm looking at it now and,
uh,

1533
01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:50.310
the placement,
it looks like there's one,

1534
01:31:51.690 --> 01:31:56.690
there's one risk or sensor or stimulator right where I would think it to be,

1535
01:31:57.061 --> 01:32:00.100
which is kind of over the right eyebrow.

1536
01:32:00.101 --> 01:32:04.240
So the dorsolateral prefrontal contact
cortex,

1537
01:32:04.241 --> 01:32:06.880
is there another at the back or is that the only place in point?
Yeah,

1538
01:32:06.881 --> 01:32:09.510
so you have the,
so,
so what you're seeing in those pictures is,
um,

1539
01:32:09.670 --> 01:32:11.700
the hair's covering up the antenna.
So we should do is you,
you,

1540
01:32:11.710 --> 01:32:14.680
you attach to this,
like this flexible antenna would,

1541
01:32:14.681 --> 01:32:17.770
you can kind of see like there's like super hot models on the website.

1542
01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:21.250
You can like always helps,
right?
Yeah.
You can see the,
the,

1543
01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:26.210
so there's two and there's a whole different look like lego Ulises cousin.
Very,

1544
01:32:26.211 --> 01:32:30.730
yeah.
Very Elvin.
They're very Elvin.
Yeah.
Uh,
and uh,
so there's,
uh,

1545
01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.730
there's a contact point.
Uh,
there's,

1546
01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:36.820
so there's two different attendance depending on if you're running the calming

1547
01:32:36.821 --> 01:32:39.130
one or the,
the energy one.
Uh,

1548
01:32:39.190 --> 01:32:41.590
and they go into two different places in the back of your head and yeah,

1549
01:32:41.591 --> 01:32:44.560
they kind of aim,
they triangulate that way.
And like I said,

1550
01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:46.600
I am so I'm actually super interested in this.

1551
01:32:46.601 --> 01:32:49.660
I've talked to the CEO of the company.
I talked to their chief scientist.

1552
01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:53.770
I think it like Mike current inclination is that it's legit,

1553
01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.010
which is kind of amazing.
Yeah.
And uh,
but we'll see.
I'll,

1554
01:32:57.011 --> 01:32:59.710
I will do a lot more playing around with it.
Oh,
I should get my into it though.

1555
01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.810
Let's next time,
next time we're in at the same time zone.

1556
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:05.110
I can bring it over and uh,
you can tell me what you think.
Yeah,
that'd be great.

1557
01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:07.220
I'd love to play with it.
There is,
um,

1558
01:33:07.690 --> 01:33:11.940
it looks like transcranial direct current stimulation,
which uh,

1559
01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:15.310
there is,
um,
friend of mine,
if you don't know him,

1560
01:33:15.311 --> 01:33:19.270
I should introduce you guys named Adam Gazzaley who runs the galley neuroscience

1561
01:33:19.271 --> 01:33:24.010
lab at Ucla and they do a lot of work with this type of technology.
So I've,

1562
01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:29.040
I've actually been a subject and an experimenter in some of their research

1563
01:33:29.111 --> 01:33:32.830
studies for tdcs.
So yeah,
I think there's,

1564
01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:34.120
I think there's a lot of promise.

1565
01:33:34.121 --> 01:33:36.640
You just have to make sure you don't fry your brain into scrambled eggs

1566
01:33:36.641 --> 01:33:41.380
accidentally.
Yeah.
You know,
details.
Well,

1567
01:33:41.381 --> 01:33:41.950
I think that,

1568
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:46.950
I think the tdcs could be this type of brain stimulation could be very

1569
01:33:47.711 --> 01:33:52.300
interesting also,
not just for the direct impact on say,

1570
01:33:52.301 --> 01:33:55.720
performance or subjective state of mind or emotion,

1571
01:33:55.721 --> 01:34:00.721
but also for showing people what might be possible through meditative practice

1572
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:05.560
in the same way that there's a neuroscience phd and a friend of mine named Sam

1573
01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:10.330
Harris,
who's also on this podcast who no longer uses psychedelics.

1574
01:34:10.331 --> 01:34:11.030
But his,

1575
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:16.030
his early formative psychedelic experiences showed him what could be possible

1576
01:34:17.471 --> 01:34:20.860
with dedicated meditative practice.
And that's,

1577
01:34:20.890 --> 01:34:25.360
that's the tool that he now uses.
So the interplay of all of those,

1578
01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:26.260
uh,

1579
01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:31.260
all of these different tools for expanding or honing consciousness is very

1580
01:34:31.690 --> 01:34:33.730
interesting to me.
Uh,

1581
01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:38.790
which do you use a think mostly for calming or stimulating or both?

1582
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:44.090
So I,
I've only actually used that one,
so I don't,
I don't own one yet.
I'm,
I'm,

1583
01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:46.780
you know,
I've,
I've put in,
my order should be showing up soon.

1584
01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.900
So I've had one direct experience with it,
um,

1585
01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:54.160
which was in London a few weeks ago and I did the calming Vibe,

1586
01:34:54.490 --> 01:34:57.460
uh,
and it was great.
Now basically,
I mean,
like the,
the,

1587
01:34:57.461 --> 01:35:01.010
the woman that was putting it on me says,
um,
uh,
you know,
you should,

1588
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:02.090
as you're using it,
you should,

1589
01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:05.030
she said you should look for signs to see whether or not it's working.

1590
01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.920
And it's like,
okay,
like what?
She goes like,
wow,
for example,
um,
you know,

1591
01:35:09.921 --> 01:35:12.440
can you think of some things that like right now,
if you think of them,

1592
01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:15.410
they just kind of cause you to get like,
anxious or stressed out or angry.

1593
01:35:15.411 --> 01:35:20.150
And I'm like,
Yep.
Done as a CEO,
pretty easy.
She's like,

1594
01:35:20.151 --> 01:35:22.430
okay,
good.
Uh,
so I can five minutes,

1595
01:35:22.431 --> 01:35:24.560
like think of those things again and see how you make me feel,

1596
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:25.880
see how they make you feel.
And it's okay.

1597
01:35:26.210 --> 01:35:28.970
So I put this thing on and controlling with my iPhone and I'm feeling relatively

1598
01:35:28.971 --> 01:35:32.510
calm and then like five minutes go by and I start thinking about these things.

1599
01:35:32.511 --> 01:35:36.620
It just causes me this like fundamental stress and anxiety five minutes earlier.

1600
01:35:36.621 --> 01:35:41.540
And I was like,
yeah,
I'm cool with that.
That's okay.
I can,

1601
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.820
I can live with that.
That,
that,
that seems normal I think.

1602
01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:47.000
I think like that's not a problem.
And yeah,
I'm comfortable with that.

1603
01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:52.300
And it was just like,
it was really impressive to me.
And,
and I know,

1604
01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:56.550
I know that could be like 100% suggestion or placebo.
Um,

1605
01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:00.350
but like what I've read about it combined with,

1606
01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:02.840
with talking to the people that I know combined with direct experience,

1607
01:36:02.841 --> 01:36:07.841
like it's definitely making me relatively sanguine about the possibilities.

1608
01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:08.850
Ooh,
goodness.

1609
01:36:08.850 --> 01:36:10.650
<v 1>Where it sanguine,</v>

1610
01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:14.130
I always get out juried by my guests on this podcast.

1611
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:17.590
It's an issue I need to really need to get some flashcards.
Uh,

1612
01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:22.830
so speaking of purchases in the last,
say six to 12 months,

1613
01:36:22.890 --> 01:36:24.090
it could be whatever comes to mind,

1614
01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:29.340
what $100 or less purchase has most positively impacted your life?

1615
01:36:31.130 --> 01:36:35.380
<v 3>Hmm.
$100 or less.</v>

1616
01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:38.020
<v 1>Yes.
It's a start.
It's a starting point.</v>

1617
01:36:38.050 --> 01:36:41.760
If any purchase comes to mind that isn't completely out of reach of most people,

1618
01:36:41.761 --> 01:36:42.594
then that's fine.

1619
01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:48.390
<v 3>Um,
hmm.
No,
let me,
when you think about it,</v>

1620
01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.910
um,
we've definitely,

1621
01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:54.870
like for some reason my mind like goes to food.

1622
01:36:57.510 --> 01:37:01.530
That's fine.
Um,
so I have a,

1623
01:37:02.250 --> 01:37:05.310
um,
like,
yeah,
I dunno.
I don't know if that's weird.

1624
01:37:05.311 --> 01:37:07.500
Maybe it's just cause I'm hungry.
It's like getting close to lunchtime.

1625
01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:13.020
So like I'm thinking about,
uh,
uh,
I'm thinking about this amazing,

1626
01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:16.980
um,
a hamburger that I hadn't Tokyo,

1627
01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:21.960
uh,
which was,
but anyway,
I can't really say those,
those,
those,
those life changing

1628
01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:24.730
<v 1>or just,
I mean it positive.
It does.</v>

1629
01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:27.690
It does sound like it positively impacted your life.
What was,

1630
01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:30.590
was there anything special about the hamburger that comes to mind?

1631
01:37:30.710 --> 01:37:31.480
So there's this place

1632
01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:36.250
<v 3>gins up that uh,
uh,
makes a smoked stuff,
which is kind of unusual in Japan.</v>

1633
01:37:36.251 --> 01:37:37.580
They don't really have smoked food culture,

1634
01:37:37.581 --> 01:37:39.350
but this place just makes like smoked everything,

1635
01:37:39.351 --> 01:37:43.760
like smoked hamburgers and smoked olive oil and smoke soy sauce and smoke rice

1636
01:37:43.761 --> 01:37:47.720
and eggs and just amazingly good.
And they make the world's best hamburger.

1637
01:37:47.721 --> 01:37:49.460
Like my favorite hamburger in the world is in this place.

1638
01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:53.860
And they also make amazing eggs.
They've got these like beautiful,
you know,

1639
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:58.350
orange in color,
like totally fresh,
you know,
eggs that they can put on stuff.

1640
01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:00.180
And last night I was there,

1641
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:05.340
I'm actually about a year ago I decided I would try to get them to put a fried

1642
01:38:05.341 --> 01:38:06.690
egg on my hamburger.

1643
01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:11.640
And this took like 45 minutes of like intense negotiation.
And they were like,

1644
01:38:11.641 --> 01:38:14.430
they were very skeptical about putting this egg and the hamburger,

1645
01:38:14.431 --> 01:38:16.440
like it had never been done before.
And I was like,
come on.

1646
01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.110
And then they were like really kind of nervous about disappointing me,

1647
01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:22.340
like show how to do it.
So it was like about a minute,

1648
01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:25.860
so Japanese,

1649
01:38:25.861 --> 01:38:29.850
a lot about 45 minutes of like convincing them and then like exactly how to fry

1650
01:38:29.851 --> 01:38:33.060
the egg and put on top.
And so they finally did it and I had it and was like,

1651
01:38:33.090 --> 01:38:34.110
it was amazing cause I was like,

1652
01:38:34.111 --> 01:38:36.260
the only way that you can improve like the best of worlds,

1653
01:38:36.330 --> 01:38:40.800
best smoked hamburgers to put like a perfectly fried,
runny egg on it.
Uh,

1654
01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:42.540
it was great,
but they were very,

1655
01:38:42.541 --> 01:38:45.450
like you could tell they were deeply uncomfortable with this whole experience.

1656
01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:49.650
And then I went back there,
um,
a year later and it's on the menu.

1657
01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.130
Oh Wow.
So I was like,
my contribution to,

1658
01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:57.090
to Japanese cuisine is it called the Libon now.
They didn't name it after me.

1659
01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:57.933
I was kind of

1660
01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:02.830
<v 1>Kinda Kinda bummed the,
uh,
I don't think they know my name.
So what is,</v>

1661
01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:05.050
what is the,
the man with no name that's the,

1662
01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:09.030
that's probably how you're listed on the reservation.
D they don't want to,

1663
01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:11.340
they don't want to summon you to,

1664
01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:15.600
to to put them into more uncomfortable culinary situations.
What,

1665
01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:18.720
what was the name of the place do you recall?
Uh,

1666
01:39:18.721 --> 01:39:23.721
it's called Ginza ng Ginza in g and G.

1667
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:28.250
E.
N.
J.
I.
N.
G.
A I cool.
And a good Ginza in GE.

1668
01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:31.840
Very cool.
Uh,
yeah,
that was probably the best,

1669
01:39:31.930 --> 01:39:35.710
the best sub hundred dollars purchase in the past past year or so.
Wow.

1670
01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:39.820
Well next time I'm there I'll have to check out [inaudible].
It's a very,
uh,

1671
01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:44.540
it's a very rundown sheet part of Tokyo for those people wondering,
Hey,

1672
01:39:45.250 --> 01:39:48.610
it was significantly less than a hundred dollars.
Even in Ginza you can get here.

1673
01:39:49.690 --> 01:39:54.690
Literally means like the golden throne or the golden seat button to,

1674
01:39:55.570 --> 01:39:59.980
it's a fancy neighborhood.
The easy to get to.
And I think that is also,

1675
01:40:00.010 --> 01:40:02.020
correct me if I'm wrong,
I might be getting this totally wrong,

1676
01:40:02.021 --> 01:40:06.760
but the Jiro dreams of Sushi,
it's same thing.

1677
01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:11.380
Yeah.
It's in the same subway station building.
Right?
It's all the same building.

1678
01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:13.690
Yeah,
that's right.
It's like the same.
Yeah,
it's right there.
Yeah.

1679
01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:17.470
If anyone listening hasn't seen Jiro dreams of Sushi,
very well worth watching.

1680
01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:22.750
Uh,
what are your now just to,
it's actually a good segway.

1681
01:40:22.751 --> 01:40:26.860
So that movie is chock full of routines,
right?

1682
01:40:26.861 --> 01:40:31.360
It's very methodical in that restaurant.
What are your morning rituals?
What does,

1683
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:36.390
what does the first 60 minutes of your day look like on a day that that is one

1684
01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.920
that you're free to design sort of your ideal for 60 minutes?

1685
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:48.260
<v 3>Oh,
well,
I don't know if I've had an ideal day in a,
in a long time.
I mean,</v>

1686
01:40:48.261 --> 01:40:53.261
my actual day is I wake up and I grabbed my phone and uh,

1687
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:57.760
you know,
I see like I see if there's any emergencies and usually,
you know,

1688
01:40:57.761 --> 01:41:01.510
usually there aren't any.
And then I,
what time do you wake up?
Um,
you know,

1689
01:41:01.511 --> 01:41:05.120
I don't really have a fixed schedule,
so I,
um,
I don't have kids,
so it's,

1690
01:41:05.121 --> 01:41:09.640
it's fairly easy to,
you know,
not,
not wake up at any particular time.

1691
01:41:09.641 --> 01:41:14.620
So I usually wake up like a couple of hours before my first meeting,
uh,

1692
01:41:14.650 --> 01:41:15.280
maybe,

1693
01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.980
maybe two to three hours before my first meeting just so I have time to like

1694
01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:20.920
catch up on a little bit of work before,
you know,
before it hit to the office.

1695
01:41:20.921 --> 01:41:24.670
So if my,
if my first meeting,
you know,
my first meeting is up nine,

1696
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:28.240
I'll wake up at six,
six 30.
Uh,

1697
01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:31.600
but usually I try to schedule meetings.
I tried to,
I'm not like a morning person,

1698
01:41:31.601 --> 01:41:34.810
so I try to schedule my meetings a little bit later so sometimes they'll sleep

1699
01:41:34.811 --> 01:41:36.670
late or something.
And then,
uh,

1700
01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.700
I'll kind of walk around the house for four 45 minutes,
you know,

1701
01:41:39.730 --> 01:41:41.770
drinking coffee and usually,
you know,

1702
01:41:41.771 --> 01:41:44.870
with my phone or my hand checking on various things and,

1703
01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:49.150
and it gets started slowly.
What I would like is,
um,

1704
01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:50.973
um,

1705
01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:56.580
I'd like maybe like I would like to have my digest of the day be more automatic.

1706
01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:01.270
Like I would like to hear about like what's going to happen,

1707
01:42:01.271 --> 01:42:04.750
what do I need to know about?
Um,
I'd kind of like,

1708
01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:08.140
I've experimented with setting up various ways where I can maybe like have an

1709
01:42:08.141 --> 01:42:11.230
RSS fee that I could have read to me or like something like that.
And there's,

1710
01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:14.590
there's,
you know,
I've had mixed success with that,
but it'd be cool to like,

1711
01:42:14.591 --> 01:42:17.170
it'd be cool to work on something like that.
And that's the digest,

1712
01:42:17.171 --> 01:42:20.920
like your primer for the day to come.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Though that'll be,

1713
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:23.530
that'll be kind of cool cause I find like at that time in the morning,

1714
01:42:23.531 --> 01:42:25.990
like I don't really want to be making decisions,

1715
01:42:26.290 --> 01:42:30.220
but it's a good time and I definitely want to be like talking to people.
Uh,

1716
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:31.660
but it's a good time too.

1717
01:42:31.690 --> 01:42:34.960
It's like my brain is still spongy at that point is a good time to like soak in

1718
01:42:34.961 --> 01:42:36.730
like,
okay,
here's what's going to happen.

1719
01:42:36.731 --> 01:42:39.910
Here's what I'm going to need to start thinking about.
Uh,
that's,

1720
01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:43.000
that's productive.
I hate,
like,
I hate early morning meetings.

1721
01:42:43.001 --> 01:42:47.650
Those are those done not to go well for me.
Yeah,
I know the feeling.

1722
01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:51.010
And um,
do you,

1723
01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:56.970
do you have any particular evening rituals or ways that you prep for the next

1724
01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:00.850
day that help you get off to a good start?

1725
01:43:03.490 --> 01:43:06.310
I don't anymore.
I used to,
so I used to back.

1726
01:43:06.311 --> 01:43:08.200
So when I was meditating for about a year or so,

1727
01:43:08.201 --> 01:43:12.370
I would try to meditate for 20 minutes every day in the evening.

1728
01:43:12.730 --> 01:43:14.230
And then I just started like being too tired,

1729
01:43:14.231 --> 01:43:17.230
so I would just fall asleep in the middle of it.
Uh,
which,
you know,
isn't,

1730
01:43:17.890 --> 01:43:21.400
isn't super good.
Um,
and so this one,
I don't really have any particular thing.
I,

1731
01:43:21.401 --> 01:43:23.000
I've,
I've gone back and forth.
Like I,

1732
01:43:23.001 --> 01:43:27.040
I tend to try out a lot of the sort of faddish things.
I've tried out the,
okay,

1733
01:43:27.041 --> 01:43:29.410
don't look at a screen for the last few hours,
you know,

1734
01:43:29.411 --> 01:43:33.160
just like read a physical book or,
you know,
don't watch TV or look at a laptops.

1735
01:43:33.161 --> 01:43:36.100
I've done that,
but that didn't really seem to make much of a difference.

1736
01:43:36.101 --> 01:43:38.890
Plus they don't,
I don't really have trouble sleeping,
like I sleep pretty well.

1737
01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:42.190
Um,
so I don't like,
I don't,
I think I'm just lucky,

1738
01:43:42.191 --> 01:43:44.080
I'm just sort of wired up where,
you know,

1739
01:43:44.081 --> 01:43:46.540
when I go to bed I fall asleep regardless of kind of what else I was doing.

1740
01:43:47.050 --> 01:43:50.860
I'm looking forward to getting the machine and maybe using that to calm down a

1741
01:43:50.861 --> 01:43:54.950
little bit before sleep.
Um,
but at this point I don't have any,
any kind of fixed,

1742
01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:57.620
uh,
routine.
Got It.

1743
01:43:58.910 --> 01:44:03.910
For people interested in exploring the paths that you've explored for thinking

1744
01:44:05.871 --> 01:44:10.750
about meaning,
why we're here,
purpose,
et cetera.

1745
01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:15.320
Uh,
we touched on stoicism briefly,

1746
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:18.420
but if you had to recommend or yeah,

1747
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:22.640
if you had to recommend one to three books that you have found very thought

1748
01:44:22.641 --> 01:44:27.200
provoking,
what would you recommend?
So I would say,

1749
01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:32.030
so the clock of the long now.
Definitely.
Yeah.
That's just like as,
as sort of a,

1750
01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:36.440
the set the stage for like how to think about things.
It's,
it's great.
Um,

1751
01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:41.300
excuse me.
Um,
I think,
um,

1752
01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:45.920
a book that really had a profound influence on me pretty early on was,
um,

1753
01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:50.340
uh,
the selfish gene,
uh,
by,
by Dawkins.
Yup.

1754
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:54.260
And I think that was just reissued in like some like 25th anniversary edition or

1755
01:44:54.261 --> 01:44:55.460
something that I just saw,

1756
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:58.510
which is sort of sad that it was 25 years ago that I read it.
Um,

1757
01:44:58.910 --> 01:45:02.360
so that's definitely worth reading for just all sorts of like brain expanding

1758
01:45:02.361 --> 01:45:07.130
ideas.
And then,
um,
you know,

1759
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:12.010
for,
in terms of philosophy,
uh,
there's a really a good introduction to,

1760
01:45:12.011 --> 01:45:13.790
to Stoicism,
um,

1761
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:17.150
that I read about a year ago when I first started looking into this.

1762
01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:22.220
I forget the author,
but the title is a,
a good life.
Yeah.
That is a good synopsis.

1763
01:45:22.330 --> 01:45:25.760
Uh,
and yeah,
it was pretty good.
Like it wasn't like the writing itself,

1764
01:45:25.761 --> 01:45:29.540
I think it wasn't particularly,
you know,
shining,
but like it,

1765
01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:33.330
it captured the ideas and presented them in a fairly modern way,
you know,

1766
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:36.500
pretty elegantly.
So that was a good jumping off point to a bunch of other stops.

1767
01:45:36.501 --> 01:45:39.620
I would like if I,
if I had to give three,
I would say,
you know,
let's say those,

1768
01:45:39.650 --> 01:45:44.350
those three.
Um,
but,
you know,

1769
01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.530
really I think the important thing for me is to really try to have a coherent

1770
01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:52.310
philosophy of life.
And I think a lot of people,

1771
01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:54.740
like a lot of people don't,
they,

1772
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:59.270
they sort of think it's like pretentious to pretend that you can have a coherent

1773
01:45:59.271 --> 01:46:01.580
philosophy.
Why is that important to you?

1774
01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:05.480
What does it allow you to do or help you do?
Um,

1775
01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:09.170
just kind of frames everything and gives,
it,
gives a reason for things.
Like,

1776
01:46:09.171 --> 01:46:12.440
I think this is well understood,
right?
Motivation.
So if you're trying to just,

1777
01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:15.230
you know,
philosophy aside,
right?
You're just trying to communicate with people,

1778
01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:15.940
you know,
you're,

1779
01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:19.040
you're a CEO and you're trying to get people to do what you want.

1780
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:23.720
It's like proven that people,
it's much more effective to give people a reason.

1781
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:26.330
Uh,
and actually it turns out that like,

1782
01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:28.640
the reason it doesn't really matter that much,

1783
01:46:28.730 --> 01:46:33.590
what matters is that there is a reason.
Yeah.
So if you say like,

1784
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:38.720
Hey,
you should do this.
And it's like far more effective to say,
hey,

1785
01:46:38.721 --> 01:46:41.630
you should do this because you know,
x,
y,
and Z.

1786
01:46:42.650 --> 01:46:46.160
And it turns out that even if like the people don't,
don't even understand the x,

1787
01:46:46.161 --> 01:46:48.890
Y and Z,
as long as they,
they've like heard a,

1788
01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:52.300
it just like fits much more neatly into the brain.
Yeah.

1789
01:46:52.450 --> 01:46:53.490
Then then if they have it.

1790
01:46:53.670 --> 01:46:58.670
So like having a reason just make smart people far more productive and

1791
01:46:58.831 --> 01:47:02.460
effective.
Um,
and that's just very true of me.

1792
01:47:02.461 --> 01:47:04.710
Like I want to have a reason for,
for things.

1793
01:47:04.711 --> 01:47:08.430
I don't want to feel like I am doing things.
Um,
you know,

1794
01:47:08.431 --> 01:47:11.880
so shrouded by this existential mystery.
I want to thank that.

1795
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.260
Like I want to have a structure to think about why I am making certain decisions

1796
01:47:16.261 --> 01:47:20.910
and,
and,
and uh,
having like having a career in philosophy makes up,

1797
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:21.960
you know,
it makes that possible

1798
01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:23.560
<v 1>philosophy is,</v>

1799
01:47:23.650 --> 01:47:28.330
would it be comparable in some ways to the 10 commandments where it's like,

1800
01:47:28.331 --> 01:47:30.940
if you're like,
should I covet thy neighbor's wife or not?
I'm not sure.
It's like,

1801
01:47:30.941 --> 01:47:33.700
well,
no,
it says do not covet thy neighbor's wife.
Therefore,

1802
01:47:33.701 --> 01:47:37.830
decision made and like that's the reason.
Is it sort of a,
a,

1803
01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:41.680
do you view it as a set of guidelines and a framework for kind of decision

1804
01:47:41.681 --> 01:47:44.830
making in life for simplifying things?
Or is it more than that?

1805
01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:49.610
<v 3>So the 10 commandments wouldn't serve this purpose for me just because they</v>

1806
01:47:49.611 --> 01:47:50.870
don't actually answer the why.

1807
01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:53.720
Like they're actually like the way the 10 commandments are afraid to have the

1808
01:47:53.721 --> 01:47:56.130
because,
right.
Or that's exactly it.

1809
01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:59.100
Sort of like exactly the cognitively wrong way to do it though.

1810
01:47:59.110 --> 01:48:01.210
Those are just commandments.
They're not,
they're not explanations.

1811
01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:05.390
Now there's a lot of religious theory and thought about about the why.

1812
01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.270
So if you're a religious person that you want to base your life around the 10

1813
01:48:08.271 --> 01:48:10.520
commandments,
it's probably possible.

1814
01:48:10.521 --> 01:48:14.170
And it's probably possible to actually read quite a bit of,
of,
you know,

1815
01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:18.140
other commentary that actually give,
you know,
compelling reasons.

1816
01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:23.410
Um,
you know,
if that's,
if,
if,
if that's the,
the most appealing thing.
Uh,

1817
01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.040
so I,
I kind of prefer to have the why rather than just the,
you know,
the what,

1818
01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:32.180
um,
and uh,
I don't,
you know,
I don't have the exact answers obviously,
but I have,

1819
01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:35.090
you know,
I think,
I think I'm getting,
I'm getting like a better,

1820
01:48:35.091 --> 01:48:37.850
a better feeling that things aren't random.

1821
01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:41.540
There is a purpose and I'm like,
I can,

1822
01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:46.430
I can work towards like making the world better in this specific way in which I

1823
01:48:46.431 --> 01:48:49.700
wanted to be made better and,
and that feels great.
And that's,
that's,

1824
01:48:49.701 --> 01:48:54.650
that's much more motivating than kind of getting up and following orders or

1825
01:48:54.651 --> 01:48:56.570
getting up and not understanding why.

1826
01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:03.140
<v 1>So is your intention then to communicate this to employees or partners or is</v>

1827
01:49:03.541 --> 01:49:06.540
this really something for your own internal use?

1828
01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:09.780
<v 3>Oh,
well,
I'm definitely,
I'm pretty,
you know,</v>

1829
01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:14.190
apprehensive about talking about anything that sounds like this to,
you know,

1830
01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:14.790
to employees.

1831
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:18.360
Like the last thing I want as you know it to be imposing any kind of

1832
01:49:18.361 --> 01:49:22.020
philosophical worldview,
uh,
uh,
on people.
So,
you know,

1833
01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:25.860
if we were having a off the record conversations over a few drinks,

1834
01:49:25.861 --> 01:49:28.390
I'm always happy to talk about it.
But yeah,
this is not a,
my,

1835
01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:31.500
my mission in life is not to to convince anybody of anything.

1836
01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.480
I just want to have a structure for myself,

1837
01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.910
<v 1>be like fill over the branch Davidians.
It's not the book that you mentioned,</v>

1838
01:49:37.911 --> 01:49:40.490
I looked up,
uh,
the,
uh,

1839
01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:46.330
the stoic overview is by William Irvine and it's a guide to the good life.

1840
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:48.160
And then the subtitle is the ancient art

1841
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.830
<v 3>of stoic joy.
Yeah.
Which is a good overview.
It is.
Then it's not,</v>

1842
01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.250
it's not what I thought it was like,
you know,

1843
01:49:54.251 --> 01:49:58.680
I remember studying stoicism in high school or whatever and uh,
you know,

1844
01:49:58.690 --> 01:50:00.970
I think I had all the wrong ideas about,
about,
about what it is.

1845
01:50:00.971 --> 01:50:03.230
So it was actually,
it was a very interesting read.
Yeah.
It's,

1846
01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:07.510
it's helpful because it disabuse people of the notion that stoics are,

1847
01:50:07.890 --> 01:50:10.420
I remember the description I heard at one point was,
um,

1848
01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:16.120
being a stoic is like being a cow standing in the rain.
And it's like,
no,

1849
01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.430
it's not quite that.
Not Quite,

1850
01:50:18.431 --> 01:50:22.690
that's that serious or devoid of positive emotion.

1851
01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:28.750
Uh,
if you could have a,
I know we have just a few minutes left.

1852
01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.630
If you could have a billboard anywhere,

1853
01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:36.600
what would it say and where would you put it?
Well,
you know,
this is like,

1854
01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:39.850
what are we talking about this as like one of my main goals in life?
Oh No,

1855
01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:43.250
I don't think we have,
oh yeah.
Like one of the main things that I want to,

1856
01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:48.250
that I want to do is I want to be on a billboard advertising whiskey in,

1857
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:51.580
in Japan.
I want to be in a giant Japanese whiskey billboard,

1858
01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:56.260
like totally Bill Murray style.
And,
but this is like a serious goal of mine.

1859
01:50:56.261 --> 01:50:58.990
I've been like,
sort of like working towards it for a while.
I've,
like,

1860
01:50:58.991 --> 01:51:02.440
I've talked to the right distillers and like,
yeah,

1861
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:04.840
I think it was a chance that'll happen.
We should make,

1862
01:51:04.841 --> 01:51:06.700
we should make this happen.
Yeah.
Let me know,

1863
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:11.770
like giant billboard of me like holding a glass of Whiskey,

1864
01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:16.510
um,
in,
you know,
in Tokyo,
it's kind of an uncle.
I even,

1865
01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:18.940
I've even figured out what it's going to say.
What is it going to say?

1866
01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:20.770
There's going to be just,
you know,
so just imagine,
you know,

1867
01:51:20.771 --> 01:51:24.950
it's me with a big glass of whisky and a,
the caption will say,
um,

1868
01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:29.290
um,
Evernote helps you remember,
Suntory helps you forget

1869
01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:36.760
that is fantastic.
It's Kinda,
it kinda feels like it needs to happen,
right?
Yeah.

1870
01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:38.680
Yeah.
Or You could have,
you know,

1871
01:51:38.681 --> 01:51:40.990
I just thought of another one you could say Evernote is forever.

1872
01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:45.010
Suntory is for tonight and also good.
Yeah.

1873
01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:49.390
I'm a whole series of things you could,
that's amazing.

1874
01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:52.360
It makes me,
it makes me think of the,
the,
the,

1875
01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:55.680
the commercial shoot from lost in translation when he's,

1876
01:51:56.170 --> 01:52:00.790
when the director talks for like three minutes and the guy's like more energy or

1877
01:52:00.791 --> 01:52:05.440
whatever.
And he's like,
I think he said more than that.
Uh,

1878
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:08.890
one of my favorite movies.
Uh,
so good.
What's,
um,

1879
01:52:10.210 --> 01:52:13.060
one of my favorite parts is actually an improvised part in that movie when he's

1880
01:52:13.061 --> 01:52:17.470
waiting in the hospital waiting room.
And those ladies are all cracking up.
Right.

1881
01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:20.270
I'm just such a good movie.
Uh,

1882
01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:22.840
advice to your 30 year old self.

1883
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:25.450
If you had to give advice to your 30 year old self,
what would it be?

1884
01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:31.870
Uh,
if I had a time machine or something.
Yeah,
yeah.

1885
01:52:31.871 --> 01:52:33.280
If you had a time machine and could deliver,

1886
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:37.240
deliver advice to your 30 year old self that if I had a time machine I can go

1887
01:52:37.241 --> 01:52:37.601
back.

1888
01:52:37.601 --> 01:52:41.550
So I'm 43 now so I can go back 13 years and talked to him a third years off.

1889
01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:45.040
I would be like a,
that'd be like,
dude,

1890
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:49.040
don't worry about anything because in 13 years you're gonna have a time machine.

1891
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:54.660
<v 1>Nothing,
nothing else really matters.</v>

1892
01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:00.390
That is a good answer.
Uh,
I think I would say it.

1893
01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.990
<v 3>So when I was 30,
I was working on stuff that I didn't,</v>

1894
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:06.830
I was working on my second company and I didn't,
like,
I wasn't in love with it.

1895
01:53:06.831 --> 01:53:09.050
I wasn't,
I wasn't building it for my,
for myself.

1896
01:53:09.051 --> 01:53:11.090
It was building it for somebody else.
And,
um,

1897
01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:12.560
I think what I would have said is like,

1898
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:16.940
stop taking people seriously when they say you have to like worry about what,

1899
01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:19.820
what the market wants.
And just like build what you want.

1900
01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:21.230
And I kind of wish I had,

1901
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:25.070
I had gotten started with that and my twenties rather than in my mid thirties

1902
01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:32.460
<v 1>so any other parting advice or do you have an ask or suggestion for everybody</v>

1903
01:53:34.631 --> 01:53:35.464
listening?

1904
01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:39.950
<v 3>Well,
um,
you know,
everyone should,</v>

1905
01:53:40.190 --> 01:53:42.490
everyone listening should obviously read every word

1906
01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:46.760
<v 1>word of a,
of all of your books,
you know,
insight forward and back inside and out.</v>

1907
01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:50.210
Especially especially the chapter in the four hour body.
That's about me.

1908
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:53.150
That's right.
The Excel spreadsheet.
That's right.

1909
01:53:53.190 --> 01:53:56.360
Cause it just makes sense because obviously you can't write a book about

1910
01:53:56.361 --> 01:53:58.640
attaining the perfect body without having a chapter about me.

1911
01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:03.110
And in the updated edition that will be published in a year or two.

1912
01:54:03.111 --> 01:54:06.650
We'll talk about your,
your pull up quest.
My pool quest is good.

1913
01:54:06.651 --> 01:54:08.960
And I know there's actually a bunch of more to say.
You know,
I've,
I've lost,

1914
01:54:08.961 --> 01:54:12.770
I think since the last time we've seen each other.
I've lost about 50 pounds.
Wow.

1915
01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:16.130
Congratulations.
That's a very,
that's a sturdy,

1916
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:21.300
robust toddler right there.
Yeah.
I actually,

1917
01:54:21.301 --> 01:54:24.470
I just saw one time like Getty images.

1918
01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:28.470
<v 3>Sure.
Whatever.
I need to search for myself on Getty images and there's like,</v>

1919
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:29.900
there was like eight years of like,
you know,

1920
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:34.050
pictures of me and it's like I'm aging in reverse.
That's great actually.
Like,

1921
01:54:34.051 --> 01:54:37.780
it's kind of cool,
like eight years ago,
I'm like,
I'm like,
you know,

1922
01:54:38.250 --> 01:54:41.880
250 pounds and I'm wearing a suit and tie and I have a beard.

1923
01:54:41.881 --> 01:54:45.630
And then just like slowly over eight years,
like first the suit disappears,

1924
01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:49.560
you know,
then the color and I'm like,
you know,
the tie the beer,
you know,

1925
01:54:49.561 --> 01:54:50.580
50 pounds.
It's like,

1926
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:54.800
I'm definitely in this localized minimize the kind of looks like a majoring

1927
01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:55.920
universe,
which is kind of cool.

1928
01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:58.290
So I'm just going to assume that that's going to continue forever.
I don't,

1929
01:54:58.350 --> 01:55:01.260
I don't see why it wouldn't.
Um,
but we'll see how it goes.

1930
01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:06.410
<v 1>Benjamin Button.
But in real life,
exactly.
The curious case of Phil Libin,</v>

1931
01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:11.600
but that could be your mom,
your memoir,
uh,

1932
01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.370
where can people find you online?

1933
01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:19.050
Where can people connect with you on the social media?
Yeah.

1934
01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:23.610
And where can they of course find out more about Evernote and give it a spin?

1935
01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:28.200
<v 3>Well,
uh,
so Evernote is just that evernote.com or your favorite APP store.</v>

1936
01:55:28.890 --> 01:55:32.310
And I am a on Twitter,
I'm p libbing and uh,

1937
01:55:32.311 --> 01:55:35.310
also happy to chat with anyone via email or anything else.

1938
01:55:35.311 --> 01:55:39.200
I'm Phil that Evernote.
Um,
my policy is a,

1939
01:55:39.210 --> 01:55:44.010
I've been super lucky in um,
uh,
just being

1940
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.260
<v 1>able to get great advice from people when,
when I ask.</v>

1941
01:55:46.261 --> 01:55:49.230
So if anyone actually wants to talk to me and my policy is I have to eat lunch

1942
01:55:49.231 --> 01:55:52.200
anyway,
so anytime anyone wants to come over for lunch,
I'm happy to do that.

1943
01:55:52.201 --> 01:55:55.530
So if anyone's in the area,
send me a note and a come on by for lunch.

1944
01:55:55.531 --> 01:55:57.150
If you're actually,
if you actually want to talk,

1945
01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:02.720
your lunches may just become very exciting from this point forward.

1946
01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:07.110
We'll fill,
you're always very generous with your time.

1947
01:56:07.230 --> 01:56:09.570
You're always fun to hang out with.
And uh,

1948
01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:11.790
there are many more topics we could discuss.

1949
01:56:11.791 --> 01:56:15.810
So perhaps sometime we'll do around two people can let us know what other

1950
01:56:15.811 --> 01:56:18.240
questions they might have for us to explore.

1951
01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:21.750
And I'm looking at these questions in Evernote.

1952
01:56:21.751 --> 01:56:26.700
I'm thankful for the product.
I've used it for all of my books since we met.

1953
01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:29.280
I've used it for planning the TV show,

1954
01:56:29.281 --> 01:56:33.170
I've used it for all of the planning around the podcast is a,

1955
01:56:33.210 --> 01:56:36.510
it is my go to sort of central repository for everything.

1956
01:56:36.511 --> 01:56:40.790
So I want to thank you for that.
And of course and uh,

1957
01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:45.000
I think we should have some whiskey soon and plan that billboard.
Let's do it.

1958
01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:50.670
All right man.
Thanks so much.
I will talk to you soon.
Take care of him.

1959
01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:00.750
Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.

1960
01:57:01.110 --> 01:57:03.720
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1961
01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:07.020
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1962
01:57:07.021 --> 01:57:09.630
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday?

1963
01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:14.160
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

1964
01:57:14.161 --> 01:57:18.780
Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that

1965
01:57:18.781 --> 01:57:20.370
I've been pondering over the week.

1966
01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:23.340
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1967
01:57:23.341 --> 01:57:26.820
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1968
01:57:26.821 --> 01:57:31.110
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1969
01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:36.410
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1970
01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:39.780
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1971
01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:44.850
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1972
01:57:44.910 --> 01:57:47.070
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1973
01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:52.020

This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,

1977
01:58:05.171 --> 01:58:07.360
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

1978
01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:10.270
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

1979
01:58:10.271 --> 01:58:12.760
It is your all in one nutritional insurance.

1980
01:58:12.761 --> 01:58:14.470
I recommended it in the four hour body,

1981
01:58:14.530 --> 01:58:18.460
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

1982
01:58:18.730 --> 01:58:21.520
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

1983
01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:22.990
It just covers all my basis.

1984
01:58:23.050 --> 01:58:27.010
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

1985
01:58:27.010 --> 01:58:31.870
day,
and you can get 50 oh my gosh,
50% off.
Yes,
50% off.

1986
01:58:31.871 --> 01:58:36.871

Tim,
check it out.
It's tasty,
but more important.

1988
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:45.940
It will help you not screw up when you're doing your nutritional plannings.

1989
01:58:45.941 --> 01:58:49.450
For me,
just covers the basis,
takes a load off my mind,

1990
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:54.190
puts a lot in my body and check it out.

this episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things

1992
01:59:01.451 --> 01:59:03.010
graphic design related.

1993
01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:08.020
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers,

1994
01:59:08.021 --> 01:59:11.740
including sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

1995
01:59:11.741 --> 01:59:14.980
which later became number one New York Times Number One,
Wall Street Journal,

1996
01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:16.530
and the brainstorming.

1997
01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:19.900
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

1998
01:59:19.901 --> 01:59:24.070
works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,
a website,

1999
01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:26.650
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

2000
01:59:26.890 --> 01:59:30.400
you submit that project and designers from around the world,

2001
01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:33.040
we'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

2002
01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:36.730
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

2003
01:59:36.731 --> 01:59:38.410
money back.
It's that straightforward.

2004
01:59:38.770 --> 01:59:42.130
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

2005
01:59:42.131 --> 01:59:44.530
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,

2006
01:59:44.531 --> 01:59:46.300
if you want to see some of my competitions,

and until next time,

2010
01:59:58.300 --> 01:59:59.170
thank you for listening.

2011
02:00:18.050 --> 02:00:22.270
<v 5>Okay.
Okay.</v>

2012

Okay.
