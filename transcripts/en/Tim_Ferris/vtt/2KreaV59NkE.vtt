To kind of optimal at this altitude,

I'm a cybernetic organism.

recognize among their customers,
airbnb,

graphic design related.

25
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.240
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers,

26
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:45.930
including sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

27
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:49.920
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

28
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.160
the brainstorming and a lot of it took place with designers from around the

29
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:57.360
world and here's how it works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

30
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.870
a website,
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

31
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.620
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

32
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.230
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

33
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.920
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

34
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:12.630
money back.
It's that straight forward.

35
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.350
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

36
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:17.850
things that I'll be sharing it in the future,

37
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.490

<v 1>Hello Ladies and germs.</v>

43
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:37.380
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

44
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.680
I am recording this from my secret hideout in the mountains of Utah and

45
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:47.220
undisclosed location doing undisclosed things for perhaps future book

46
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.110
experimentation.
In any case,

47
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.610
this is the Tim Ferriss show where ID construct or attempt to deconstruct world

48
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:56.730
class performers of all types,
hedge fund managers,
chess prodigies,

49
00:02:56.731 --> 00:03:00.070
military strategists,
you name it and we do

50
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.900
<v 3>have a very exciting episode.</v>

51
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.850
We have a lot of the baton as a guest and I'm going to describe him and explain

52
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:07.870
why you should stick around.

53
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.710
But first some house cleaning real fast or house keeping I suppose.

54
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.030
And that is a giveaway a,

55
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.710
it's been a long time since I give away a trip and I've been thinking about

56
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:19.900
escaping to Australia for instance and other places.

57
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.700
So I thought maybe you'd like to do the same.

58
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.140
And by that I mean I'm giving away a vacation anywhere in the world.

59
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.890

Trip.
It's pretty sweet.

67
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.610
The guest that we have today is along the baton,
a.

68

L A.

O.
N.
He is many things,

69
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:07.030
but I think of him as a philosopher of the most practical breed and as I've

70
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.340
mentioned before and written about quite extensively,

71
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.610
I view pragmatic philosophy as a set of rules for making better decisions in

72
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:19.090
life,
ideally in high stress environments.
So as you know,

73
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.890
probably I'm a huge fan of stoic philosophy alone.
In 1997,

74
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:28.480
he turned away from writing novels and instead wrote an extended essay with the

75
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:31.300
funny title how Proust can change your life,

76
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.750
which became an unlikely blockbuster in self help genre.

77
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.590
No one expected it to happen.
And Bang,
suddenly he was on the map.

78
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.210
His subsequent books take on all sorts of fundamental worries of modern life and

79
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:46.180
my happy,
uh,
what do I do with status,
anxiety,

80
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.510
etc. And this is informed by his deep reading and philosophy,

81
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:52.870
but also by his novelist's eye for small,
perfect moments.

82
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:56.590
It's a very cool combination.
His books had been described as quote,

83
00:04:56.591 --> 00:05:00.880
philosophy of everyday life and are on a diverse range of subjects including

84
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:04.000
love,
travel,
architecture,
religion and work.

85
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:08.110
His bestsellers include essays and love,
how Proust can change your life status,

86
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:08.771
anxiety.

87
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:13.240
And the architecture of happiness and I'm going to include links to all of these

88
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:17.740
in the show notes@fourhourworkweek.com forward slash podcast so everything we

89
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:19.360
mentioned in the episode,

90
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.280
all of the goodies will be there for our work week.com forward slash podcast in

91
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:28.990
2008 the Bhutan also helped start the school of life,
which is awesome.

92
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.530
He's this began in London and it's a social enterprise determined to make

93
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.380
learning in therapy relevant in today's uptight culture.

94
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.800
His goal through any in all of his mediums is to help clients learn how to live

95
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:44.800
wisely and well and since I am also a student in that realm,

96
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.670
I wanted to get him on the phone.
Many of you asked for this conversation,

97
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:53.200
this interview,
I loved it and I hope you do as well.
Say Hi to him on Twitter.

98
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.580
Let him know what you thought of the interview.

99
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.980
If you have any followup questions,
it's at alarm,
the baton,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.670
a l a I n d e B o t t.
O.

101
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.440
N on the twitters.
Please enjoy our conversation.
Thanks for listening.

102
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.110
Good sir.
Welcome to the show.
Thank you so much.

103
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.560
I appreciate you making the time to have a conversation from the other side of

104
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:22.880
the pond.
And I will admit something very embarrassing.
The good sir,
the kind,

105
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:26.600
sir.
The uh,
the so on and so forth is because I've,

106
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.490
I've searched far and wide to discover how to say your name correctly and didn't

107
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:35.820
want to say it incorrectly because I've had guests on like Maria Popova Popplet

108
00:06:35.821 --> 00:06:40.670
sought Sulan who have had their names massacred every time that I've actually

109
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:43.040
heard it said.
So how do you pronounce your name properly,

110
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.070
<v 4>Tim?
You're so lucky to be called Tim.</v>

111
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.800
I was born on this earth with the name of Allah to bottle to bottle.
So I mean,

112
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:54.280
anything you can manage it.
Don't call me a lame,
you can call me out on.
Um,

113
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.860
but I don't,
I don't care.
It's just one of those things that happened.

114
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.730
<v 3>When you're speaking with native English speakers,
how do you introduce yourself</v>

115
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.520
<v 4>by just saying I'm onto the bottle and you know,
see what they say,</v>

116
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.170
see how they're responding.
But you know,
every,

117
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.380
every schoolkid in England has,
has done,
you know,

118
00:07:13.381 --> 00:07:18.100
four or five years of reluctant French.
And there's always a,
there's always a,
uh,

119
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.060
a French teaching book with,
with a character called allow.

120
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.090
So they can just about Matt.
But I mean,

121
00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:28.350
it's really all my fault and I'm deeply apologetic and what can I say?

122
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.990
It's one of those things,
that's what globalization brings us.

123
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.010
<v 3>It's like palpable when he orders coffee at Starbucks,
he just says Pablo,</v>

124
00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:39.020
because that's what they're going to come up with anyway.
Uh,
well,
well,
that,

125
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.760
that also leads me to ask it and of course we'll dig into a lot in this

126
00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:44.850
conversation and I'm very excited to finally be chatting.

127
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.530
This has been a long time in the making.
When people ask you what do you do?

128
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.790
How do you answer that?

129
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.620
<v 4>Well,
look,
the easiest thing is to say is that I'm a writer,
but,</v>

130
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.120
but that doesn't really cover it because,
um,

131
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.870
writers come in all shapes and sizes.

132
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.660
If the conversation is allowed to go on a little longer.

133
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:06.460
What I tend to tell them is I'm interested in emotional intelligence and

134
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:09.470
emotional health.
Um,
it's,

135
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.350
it's a kind of topic that broadly pertains to all the things that make life

136
00:08:14.351 --> 00:08:15.184
difficult,

137
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.900
that are coming from the kind of emotional centers of our brain and functioning.

138
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.760
Um,
you know,
sometimes people joke about first world problems,
right?
They kind of,

139
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.510
they laugh at how we are in the United States or the UK and they say,
you know,

140
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:31.990
you guys just,
uh,
I've got first of all problems and it's supposed to be a joke.

141
00:08:31.991 --> 00:08:35.560
It's,
it's like people who are,
you know,
quibbling because the,
uh,
you know,

142
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:38.010
the Chardonnay is not chilled enough or whatever.
Um,

143
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.260
I actually think that that is such a thing as first of all problems,

144
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:43.930
not seen as a joke,
but seemed genuinely,

145
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.580
which is really the problems of advanced civilization that we're living in now

146
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.020
when the majority of people have got enough food,
they've got a,

147
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.760
a secure shelter,
but life is very tough in all sorts of ways.

148
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.390
So it's not the old kind of toughness.
When it was really about survival,

149
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.730
it's toughness of a different salt.
It's about,
uh,
trying to,

150
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.330
um,
make sure that your brief time on earth is well spent,

151
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.510
that your talents have been properly explored,

152
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.650
that you're in a satisfying relationship,
that you understand yourself,

153
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.130
that you have a purpose,
et cetera.
Now,
in many parts of the world,
these towns,

154
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.560
these things sound like luxuries and indeed they are,

155
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.510
but they are daily realities in,
in countries like the United States,

156
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:32.040
they're about 20 countries in the world where these kinds of concerns are
active.

157
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.050
Um,
and these are the concerns that interest me,
you know,
um,
their concerns,

158
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:41.400
as I say around,
uh,
relationships,
workplace satisfaction,

159
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:45.870
ambition,
community meaning,
I mean,
these words,
we can go into them.

160
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.880
They sound a little nebulous when you first mentioned them,

161
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.380
but it's the kind of higher order questions that people start to ask themselves.

162
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.620
What's the basic supply of food and shelter have been assured.

163
00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.060
<v 3>Right?
And it seems like,
uh,
when I look at,
for instance,</v>

164
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.640
the cases of suicide that I've encountered in my own life,
uh,

165
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:08.760
friends who've committed suicide in,
in every case,

166
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.790
they're far enough up Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

167
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:15.930
that they have satisfied shelter,
hunger or food,
et cetera.

168
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.250
And they,

169
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:22.410
I think one of the challenges perhaps is that when people get to a certain point

170
00:10:22.411 --> 00:10:26.400
and they're grappling with self actualization and so on,
there are,
there are few,

171
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.260
uh,
so flies in the ointment.

172
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:33.261
And I'd love to hear your thoughts on this and feel free obviously to strike me

173
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:35.040
down with a sharp blow.

174
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:39.360
But the number one is that many of the terms that are grappling with,

175
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:43.050
like you pointed out,
are in some ways nebulous.

176
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:48.420
They don't have the topics or challenges don't necessarily have clean,
clear,

177
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.740
uh,
evolutionary answers.
Uh,

178
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.500
like I am hungry,
therefore I should find food.

179
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.100
And in some cases we realized that what we thought would,

180
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.160
would address the angst or anxiety that we have,

181
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:05.550
such as a status or money,
in fact,

182
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.440
a appears not to provide any type of lasting relief from those types of

183
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:14.850
dilemmas.
Um,
how did you become interested in these questions?
I of course,

184
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.530
I mean your,
your books for instance,

185
00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:20.880
had been described as a philosophy of everyday life and you've written about all

186
00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:24.150
sorts of things across the board.
But how did you,

187
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:29.210
how did you fall into or become attracted to these types of questions and the

188
00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:34.110
philosophy of everyday life,
if you think that's a fair description?
Um,

189
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.100
in the first show.

190
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.690
<v 4>Sure.
Well,
I tend to,
um,
start always with myself,</v>

191
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.550
so I'm a very personal rights.
I'm not,
I'm the opposite of an academic.
Um,

192
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.850
I'm looking for answers to the problems that I experienced.

193
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.400
I start with myself as the first case study.

194
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:53.800
And I think if I'm getting myself right,
if I'm understanding myself right,

195
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.180
by definition,
I'll be getting lots of other people,
right.
As well.
So,
you know,

196
00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.080
I'm a,
I'm a laboratory.
If one,
of course I step out of that,
I read a lot,

197
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.930
I meet a lot of people,
I talk,
et Cetera.
But as it were,

198
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:09.100
I tend to start the emotional and the energy comes from,
you know,

199
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:12.420
the first patient me.
Um,
and,
uh,
you know,

200
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.620
I'm the one with all the problems and um,

201
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.680
they tend to also just happen to be problems that other people have as well.

202
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.330
So quite early on in my life,

203
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.420
I realized that there were two things which are deeply problematic for me.

204
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.000
The first one was the area of love and relationships.

205
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.660
And the second was the area of work that these were things that were giving me

206
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.240
real trouble.
Um,
I think,
you know,

207
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:35.500
I've come to see with age that these are things that there wasn't a coincidence,

208
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:40.450
that these are the two areas of massive insecurity,

209
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.950
doubt and most important,
the lack of guidance.
You know,
we,
we,

210
00:12:43.951 --> 00:12:48.951
we live in a society where we very much believe in freedom and individual,

211
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.370
um,
self realization,

212
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.170
which is fantastic from one point of view and leaves us desperately searching

213
00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.280
for guidance,
clues,
et cetera.
And we left very much alone.
You know,

214
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:04.570
I had a so called elite education.
I went to Cambridge University in the UK.

215
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.370
I got a good degree,
et cetera.

216
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.660
So I was it kind of well educated citizen of the modern world.
And yet,
boy,

217
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:14.140
oh boy,
I was so lost.
Um,
I just didn't know,
you know,

218
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:16.900
I hadn't had enough of the right sort of conversations.

219
00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:19.210
I hadn't met the right sort of people.
Broadly speaking,

220
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:22.870
I wasn't living in a therapeutic environment.
I don't mean Oprah.

221
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:26.000
I don't mean a psychoanalyst.
I mean,
uh,

222
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.750
it literally in the ancient Greek sense therapy,

223
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:32.230
which is the kind of nourishment and nurture of the soul,
the inner bit,

224
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:36.880
the precious bit of you.
Um,
there just wasn't any support.

225
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.160
Uh,
I was,
I felt very cut off from that.

226
00:13:39.161 --> 00:13:43.220
And gradually I felt my way through books,
through conversations,
um,

227
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.200
to a kind of way of living where I could just begin to understand some of the

228
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:50.500
things that I was suffering from.
But if I were to diagnose my younger self,

229
00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:55.380
I was a classic example of,
you know,
somebody living in a,
you know,

230
00:13:55.381 --> 00:14:00.160
a prosperous world city in the middle of a kind of heyday of capitalism.

231
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.970
Um,
uh,
suffering from all the anx that comes with that.

232
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.740
I'd been taught that happiness,
personal happiness came from war.

233
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:09.760
Finding one very,

234
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:14.690
very special person with whom there would be an ecstatic sense of communion.
Um,

235
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.580
and uh,
she happened to be,
and I would meet,

236
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.540
it would be wonderful.
My all sense of loneliness,

237
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.430
loss and drift would be healed.
They would be,
it would be like a,

238
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:30.520
a sort of secularized version of a meeting with the deity.

239
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.740
And I was on the lookout in bars,
clubs,
dinner parties for this person,
this,

240
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:39.220
this angelic datey who'd,
who'd graciously come down to earth.

241
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.280
And that that was going to solve my love from that.

242
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:45.620
I also was facing a work problem.
And the,

243
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.840
the kind of ideology I'd grown up with was,
you're going to work very,
very hard.

244
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.870
Uh,
and then you will find a precious bit of you and you will put that on a

245
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:57.230
commercial basis.
Whatever it is,
that inner precious core,

246
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.670
you will turn into money in,
in good time.
Uh,
you know,

247
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:06.530
you will be both creative and also financially productive,

248
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.530
et cetera.
Now,
I'm not saying that either of these things is impossible,

249
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:14.600
but they're very hard and were very alone with them alone.
Indeed.

250
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.920
Um,

251
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.920
and this struck me and my career in many ways was designed to try and find some

252
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:27.170
answers that would work for me and would work for others.
And by answers,

253
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:30.740
I don't only mean solutions.
I also mean interpretations.
You know,
when you're,

254
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.520
when you're suffering from something you don't necessarily always want or expect

255
00:15:34.521 --> 00:15:35.660
there to be a fixed,

256
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.740
but at least just understanding what it is that's the problem.
Uh,
and,

257
00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:42.590
and express kind of eloquently,
that's at least half the battle.

258
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.150
And I didn't have any of that.

259
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.600
And that's what my career has been spent trying to do.

260
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.950
<v 3>What did you study in Undergrad where it was it your undergraduate studies?</v>

261
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:58.230
<v 4>I studied,
uh,
what they called over the history of ideas,</v>

262
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.400
which was a wonderful course that really looks at the evolution of big concepts

263
00:16:02.401 --> 00:16:06.910
through time and how attitudes to different things that change.

264
00:16:06.911 --> 00:16:10.470
So we were studying word like freedom and look at all the different ways in

265
00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:15.360
which that word has changed and how differently it was interpreted,

266
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.340
say in the fifth century,
a d two the way it was interpreting the 18th century,

267
00:16:20.341 --> 00:16:23.010
the way it was interpreted in America versus in China,
et Cetera.

268
00:16:23.011 --> 00:16:25.770
So that was really fun and,
and,
and really good.

269
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.810
<v 3>And from,
from that point,</v>

270
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.470
grappling with all of these issues as many people do.

271
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.730
What put you on the,
the uh,
the map,
so to speak,

272
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.740
as a,
as a discusser,
a explorer of these ideas.

273
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.400
You have of course a very well known extended essay called how Proust can change

274
00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:56.360
your life.
That's another one I had to look up before this interview.

275
00:16:56.361 --> 00:17:01.361
I'm going to admit I had to look up p r o u s e to double check and make sure

276
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:05.280
that I would be pronouncing it somewhat close to correct,
thick.

277
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.500
How Proust can change your life.

278
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:11.530
Is that the essay that kind of put you into the mainstream or slipstream or,

279
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.290
or were there other ways that you were able to test your ideas on a,

280
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.480
on a large public scale before that?

281
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.720
<v 4>So when I graduated,
um,</v>

282
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.990
I was very aware the time was short and that are immense pressures on young

283
00:17:29.721 --> 00:17:32.180
people to prove themselves pretty early on.

284
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.480
And I felt that very much like I'd come from a family of high achievers and I

285
00:17:37.761 --> 00:17:42.230
was born with a sort of sense of like,
you know,
you've got to prove yourself.
And,

286
00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:46.070
um,
it was a kind of madness.
I now recognize it.
It was,

287
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.620
it was not easy or the best thing.
I don't think that's a,

288
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.300
a great ideology to have,
but,
but there we have it.

289
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:56.540
So no sooner did I graduate that I really started asking him as of the biggest

290
00:17:56.881 --> 00:18:00.870
questions.
Like,
where do I want my life to go?
I applied for various jobs,

291
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:04.310
but I'd graduated in the midst of a recession and it was very hard to find what

292
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.230
when was,
this was one,
this was the summer of 1991.
And,
um,

293
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.700
a lot of my friends would just,
you know,
finding things to do,

294
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.010
taking jobs in bars,
et cetera.
And I asked myself,
what do I really want to do?

295
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:19.670
And I thought what I really want to do is write books.
Um,

296
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:23.820
and I dare to admit that to myself in a kind of late nights session of,

297
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.140
of self honesty.
And I thought will,
I wanted,

298
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:32.180
I just start now and I've been thinking a lot about writing and self expression

299
00:18:32.371 --> 00:18:33.330
and all the rest of it.

300
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:37.290
And so I kind of gradually felt my way to writing my first book,

301
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.050
which was published when I was just 22.
Um,

302
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.960
and it was a book of essays in laugh in the u s it was title on love.
And um,

303
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:51.510
I put my heart and soul into it.
It's a very intimate dissection of a love story.

304
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:56.070
And the book did very well.
I mean,
very well,
certainly for a 22,

305
00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:57.060
23 year old.

306
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:02.420
And it gave me the confidence and the courage to carry on and relatively soon

307
00:19:02.581 --> 00:19:05.640
after I then wrote what turned out to be my breakthrough book,

308
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:11.030
which was called how Proust can change your life and thanks to American readers

309
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.540
and reviewers.

310
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:17.410
That book did extremely well and it was an unlikely moment,
um,

311
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:21.390
because he was a book written about,
uh,
early 20th century,

312
00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:25.320
great French writer that was at the same time it's self help book.
Um,

313
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.540
and I deliberately chose to kind of mash up these two jars are kind of scholarly

314
00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:34.450
essay and a self help book.
It wasn't just a,
a kind of um,

315
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.800
slide commercial trick.
There was serious intent,

316
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.420
which is that I always felt that high culture,
by which I mean,
you know,

317
00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:45.840
literature,
philosophy,
uh,
you know,
plays,
et cetera.

318
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.900
These things do not just belong in the ivory tower.

319
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:53.220
They have a richness to them which can be absorbed and should be transmitted to

320
00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:54.660
the widest possible public.

321
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:59.930
This is heresy among the universities that believe partly for economic reasons,

322
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.070
but only if you enroll in that sacred a fraternity.

323
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:10.050
Do you really have the right tools to be able to interpret an enjoy the

324
00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:13.950
masterpieces of civilization?
I passionately disagreed with that.

325
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:18.540
I am by nature a popularizer and a Democrat of the mind.

326
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.800
And I did not appreciate that kind of cloistered vision of knowledge.

327
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.540
So I took a lot of what I'd been thinking and reading and really tried to

328
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:28.830
express it so clearly,

329
00:20:28.831 --> 00:20:32.940
and I would write sentences 20 times to make sure that they could be understood

330
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:34.620
by everyone.
Um,

331
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:39.180
I would try material out on people who've been educated and people who had been

332
00:20:39.181 --> 00:20:43.560
educated at all and I wanted to make sure that it would work at all levels.

333
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.663
And so that was,
uh,

334
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:49.700
an extra layer of work and I'm really proud and happy to say it did work and the

335
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:52.120
book proved itself around the world.

336
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:56.080
And so I was in the very Auden fortunate position that come the age of 27.

337
00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.640
I'd had this book that had worked,
um,
and,

338
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:05.050
and I was kind of,
uh,
you know,
I was a loft,
um,
at least,
you know,

339
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:09.880
for a time.
So that's yeah,
that's how we ended up doing what I do.

340
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.790
And,
and for people who have not read,
uh,

341
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.850
let's just take on love and how Proust can change your life.
Was on love,

342
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.380
autobiographical.
Was it a novel?
Was it a mix of the two?
Neither.
It,

343
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.030
it was a mix of the two.
Cause Tim,

344
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:29.560
you know what I love about novels is the local color of the intimacy of

345
00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:30.191
language.

346
00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:33.520
The kind of the sense that you're suddenly in a real place and you know what the

347
00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:34.720
weather's like and et cetera.

348
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.940
We're drives me crazy about novels is that sometimes you feel that the novelist

349
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.570
is cleverer than they're allowing their characters to be.

350
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.950
You feel that there's all sorts of stuff that is discussed in nonfiction ways

351
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.190
that somehow just doesn't find its way into the novel where it's all supposed to

352
00:21:51.191 --> 00:21:55.030
be about showing,
not telling.
And I didn't like those rules.

353
00:21:55.031 --> 00:22:00.031
So my novel was explicitly and attempt to tell a love story as well as show it

354
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.140
to have a mixture of analysis and also more sensory descriptive bits.

355
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:07.570
Cause I wanted to touch the reader and make them think,

356
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.970
I didn't want to tell just another ordinary love story.

357
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:15.180
I wanted to analyze love in the course of a love story so that the kind of the

358
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:20.320
knowledge bits would be well wrapped up some of the excitement of a love story.

359
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.460
So it was,
it was kind of trying out a genre and then all my works,

360
00:22:24.461 --> 00:22:26.800
I've always been a little impatient by the,

361
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.080
the kind of models out there for how to write like a classic novel must be,

362
00:22:32.081 --> 00:22:34.820
you know,
x pages long must feature that.
I,

363
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.790
I've always been provoked to slightly pool at those rules.
And um,

364
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.110
so just as I read a self help book,
but you know,

365
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.860
it was half about this great 20th century writer and that's not normal.

366
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.300
So I was writing a novel,

367
00:22:46.301 --> 00:22:48.910
but that wasn't quite the normal way of writing the novel.

368
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:53.890
So I was impatient with some of the,
the rules that writers get.
Given what,

369
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:54.850
um,
which,

370
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.880
which writers or books most influenced your approach?

371
00:23:00.411 --> 00:23:04.540
You're thinking about those two books on love or we get focused on how Proust

372
00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:06.130
can change your life.
Um,
look,

373
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:09.610
the books that I always most enjoyed with the books,
first of all,

374
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.540
where you feel the presence of an author in the text,

375
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:17.620
who feels like a nice person.
I know that could sound kind of trivial,
but,
um,

376
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.670
it just sounds like someone that you could kind of get to know and have a,

377
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.350
have a chat with.
I mean,
if we think of someone like Thoreau,
um,

378
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:30.010
thorough sounds like a really great guy.
Uh,
he's friendly,

379
00:23:30.011 --> 00:23:34.540
he's sometimes sarcastic,
but he's always witty,
he's humane,
he's generous,

380
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:39.310
he's sometimes impatient,
et cetera.
But you kind of get a sense of a person.

381
00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:43.180
Um,
you get that sometimes reading great writers letters,
you know,
if you read,

382
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.710
I don't know,
the journals of Nathaniel Hawthorne for example,
um,
you can,

383
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.130
you get a flavor of,
of a person.
So,
um,

384
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.530
someone like the French philosopher Martinia was a great influence.

385
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.440
He was a man writing in the 16th century.
Again,

386
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.340
just spoken this wonderfully direct,
intimate way.
So,
yes,

387
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:04.490
he was telling you about Plato and he was telling you about history,
et cetera.

388
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:09.350
But you always felt I'm actually with someone and I've always really appreciated

389
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.470
the personal voice and um,

390
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.660
and that really influenced how I wanted to,

391
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.720
to write and be with my readers.

392
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.330
<v 3>And I will admit when it comes to,
uh,</v>

393
00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.470
most philosophy,
I'm kind of a one trick pony.
Uh,
I've,

394
00:24:26.471 --> 00:24:30.220
I've really read a lot of stoic philosophy,
but outside of that,
uh,

395
00:24:30.221 --> 00:24:31.600
I'm woefully inadequate.

396
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.050
So I'm going to ask a question that you've no doubt been asked before that maybe

397
00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:40.360
really irritating,
but how can Proust change your life?
What is the,

398
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:44.930
uh,
what is the structure of the book or what is the,
um,

399
00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.400
what,
what are some of the theses or concepts?

400
00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.230
<v 4>So,
um,
Proust is really a philosopher more than a novelist.</v>

401
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.320
And his book is about such for how you can stop wasting your life and start to

402
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.050
appreciate life and live fully.
So the title is very accurate.

403
00:25:04.051 --> 00:25:09.051
The title of his long book is in search of lost time and it's literally one man

404
00:25:09.551 --> 00:25:12.510
search for how you can stop wasting your life.

405
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.520
And it follows the uh,
the rater hero as he tries out.

406
00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:21.870
Three things that he thinks may turn out to be the meaning of life.

407
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.943
The first things he,

408
00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:28.010
first thing he tries his social status position in society and a lot of the book

409
00:25:30.121 --> 00:25:33.180
follows how he tries to get in with the top people in Paris.

410
00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.870
He wants to get in with,
uh,
nowadays they would be the celebrities,

411
00:25:36.871 --> 00:25:37.950
the business people,
et cetera.

412
00:25:37.951 --> 00:25:41.520
But in those days they were the aristocrats and so he's trying to get in with

413
00:25:41.521 --> 00:25:44.670
them.
He's trying to make a name for himself,
et Cetera.
And it follows,

414
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.820
it's very funny,
it's warm,
it's self deprecating,

415
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.040
but essentially the search for the journey,

416
00:25:50.041 --> 00:25:52.680
he does manage to get into the inner sanctum,

417
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:57.120
but he discovers that actually these people are often brutal,
brutish,

418
00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.780
not that interesting and not really interested in him properly.

419
00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:05.810
And he has a kind of moment of existential despair around this goal of social

420
00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:10.830
status.
He then moves on to another possible goal of life,

421
00:26:10.831 --> 00:26:12.060
which is romantic love.

422
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.890
And a lot of the novel is spent tracing the love affair of the narrator for a

423
00:26:16.891 --> 00:26:21.270
beautiful late teenage girl called Albertine who's charming,

424
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:26.330
had strong gammy mean the kind of boyish a charmer and um,

425
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.750
brought to there are all sorts of disappointments and he realizes some of the

426
00:26:30.751 --> 00:26:32.220
real limitations of love,

427
00:26:32.221 --> 00:26:36.840
which is that we go to love because we think that someone will understand this

428
00:26:36.841 --> 00:26:37.674
fully,

429
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:41.030
that we can be fulfilled totally in the arms of another persons that are and

430
00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.900
gently and with humor and Proust unpicks some of these hopes.

431
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.170
And again,
gradually we realized that love,

432
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.610
like social status is perhaps not the meaning of life.
So what is well,

433
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:57.870
Proust ends up like many writers defending his own art and craft.

434
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.690
He defends art as the meaning of life.

435
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:05.130
And what he means by art is it's going to be,

436
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:09.590
don't ask a barber if you need a haircut,
kind of fit.
It's a big,
big PDR job on,

437
00:27:09.591 --> 00:27:11.940
on,
on art,
but he's more generous.

438
00:27:11.941 --> 00:27:15.570
You can certainly read him in ways that are more generous than merely art.
As An,

439
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:18.810
you know,
you've got to immediately enroll on a fine arts degree or something.

440
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.950
He's not saying that he is seeing the great works of art,

441
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.060
not all art,

442
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:29.090
but the great works of art as examples of life as it's lived to the full.

443
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.340
And he's interested in,
in particular in certain artists.

444
00:27:32.341 --> 00:27:34.240
So he talks a lot about the painter,
the Dutch painter,

445
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.250
Vermeer who he thinks are rising.
That's right.

446
00:27:38.251 --> 00:27:41.850
And what he appreciates is that Vermeer painted daily life,

447
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:46.290
but he saw in daily life an extraordinary richness,
uh,

448
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:50.310
and uh,
and,
and,
and,
you know,
level of kind of psychological involvement,

449
00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:54.760
et Cetera,
that he was,
he was living life to the full.
So he,

450
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.350
another painter he really liked was a French 18th century painter Sharda who

451
00:27:58.351 --> 00:28:01.730
rather like Vermeer painted modest interiors,
um,

452
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.100
families around the kitchen table,
loaves of bread,

453
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.620
the painted about 20 loaves of bread.
Um,

454
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.450
one of the first mentors to kind of spend so long with bread.

455
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.600
And really it's a kind of,
you know,
it's very fresh.

456
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.120
It's also a kind of secularized Christian message,

457
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.520
which is really that ordinary,

458
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.690
modest life has grace has,

459
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:29.980
is in contact with the glory and dignity of the universe kind of thing to put it

460
00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.860
in a sacred and exactly.
Exactly.
And,
um,
and,

461
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.410
and this is what makes Preuss such an enchanting writer that he,

462
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:42.650
he is so interested in daily life and he wants to make daily life magical.

463
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.870
And that's what he resents and hates about snobbery because snobbery constantly

464
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.950
makes you think that there's a group of people out there who are special,

465
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:57.490
more special than the ordinary people,
um,
et cetera.
And Proust,
you know,

466
00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:01.440
the son of a kind of ought bourgeois,
wealthy family,
et Cetera,

467
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.920
has this tremendously,
deeply,
profoundly democratic vision,
um,

468
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:11.180
about the value of each individual and the capacity of an artistic gaze to tease

469
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:16.380
out that value and therefore thereby make life meaningful.

470
00:29:16.381 --> 00:29:20.100
So that's some of what I discovered.

471
00:29:20.101 --> 00:29:24.830
And that provided the spine for my own,
uh,
a study of Proust,
uh,

472
00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:29.580
that I wrote.
So I have to,
uh,

473
00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.280
immediate responses.
The first is,

474
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.320
have you seen a documentary called Tim's Vermeer by any chat?
I haven't.

475
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:42.250
Oh,
it is spectacular.
It is about a computer scientists and

476
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.340
<v 3>a very famous entrepreneur in these desktop editing world who is an incredible</v>

477
00:29:48.971 --> 00:29:51.040
inventor also,
uh,

478
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:56.070
outside of those fields and decides he wants to determine how Vermeer painted

479
00:29:56.501 --> 00:30:01.240
the way he painted and goes through many different attempts,
uh,

480
00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:05.730
builds many different tools to try to replicate Vermeer paintings.
It's,

481
00:30:05.731 --> 00:30:10.270
it's a very fascinating,
hilarious,
uh,

482
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:14.890
and insightful look at yet another obsessive,

483
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.160
not saying you're obsessive,
but the world is full of interesting.

484
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.880
Obsessives the second,
uh,
is,
uh,

485
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:25.950
how did reading Proust or writing this book as you're really dug into it,

486
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.710
uh,
affect how you prioritized or lived your life?
How did you,

487
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.600
how did you incorporate that into your decisions?

488
00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:38.434
Priorities are,

489
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.320
<v 4>um,
look,</v>

490
00:30:40.321 --> 00:30:44.640
I think the liberation of that book for me was,
um,

491
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:50.090
going up to a really big name and authority that was spoken off by professors in

492
00:30:50.911 --> 00:30:52.110
reverential tones.

493
00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:57.530
And what I did with that is to fire some pretty naive questions at this kind of

494
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.650
colossus of kind of western culture.

495
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.040
And I really asked the most essential but the most naive question,

496
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.730
which is how can you help me to live?
Uh,

497
00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:13.500
and I think in a way this is the best question to ask anyone.

498
00:31:13.501 --> 00:31:17.920
One meets in many ways that's what you tend to ask in your podcasts.
Um,

499
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:22.470
it's such a valuable question to ask very often.
We're too shy.
We,

500
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.180
we're were reserved.

501
00:31:24.181 --> 00:31:29.181
We think that other people are going to be bored by that question or um,

502
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.080
you know,
everyone else knows it already,
et cetera.

503
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:36.350
The book liberated me to be a kind of person who would be able to go up to works

504
00:31:36.991 --> 00:31:41.991
of high culture and culture generally and kind of shake down on the tree and see

505
00:31:42.301 --> 00:31:46.530
what there was for all of us.
Uh,
and um,
uh,
so that's,

506
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.500
that that was the kind of personal discovery

507
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.140
<v 3>and that,</v>

508
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:57.200
so in sort of knocking at the door of this colossus and daring to ask these

509
00:31:59.941 --> 00:32:04.020
questions about practicality that opened the door to then your career as a

510
00:32:04.021 --> 00:32:08.300
writer and exploration of that in,
in,

511
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.900
in that sense.
Is that what you mean?
Or is there,
are there ways that,

512
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:14.040
uh,

513
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:19.040
Proust impacted in the answers that you got back in your exploration your data?

514
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.550
<v 4>Yes.
I mean,
I guess both,
um,
uh,
to,</v>

515
00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.700
to address the kind of the second very good point.

516
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.760
I think that there were many attitudes that I found improvs that were incredibly

517
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:37.160
seductive and charming in the,
in the best sense.
So Preuss,
um,

518
00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:40.670
anti romanticism,
but,
but I mean by romanticism,

519
00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.230
mmm Preuss was reacting against many of the things that he saw in the 19th

520
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:49.880
century that he disagreed with the idea of the individual as a hero.

521
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:55.150
The idea of love is the answer to everything.
The idea of,
um,

522
00:32:55.430 --> 00:33:00.170
certain kinds of career success as being,
you know,
the only way to live,

523
00:33:00.171 --> 00:33:04.640
et cetera.
He,
he,
he took a kind of a skeptical position,

524
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:06.620
visa vi a lot of these things.
Um,

525
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:10.760
it wasn't a pretty rejected them wholeheartedly,
but he was a little skeptical,

526
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:15.080
beautifully skeptical.
And,
um,
and I found in him a kind of,

527
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:19.940
you could say you're kind of maturity that I didn't necessarily possess at that

528
00:33:19.941 --> 00:33:24.500
age.
I was 26,
25,
26.
And,
um,
and I learned from him,

529
00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:28.310
it was like sitting at the feet of a kind of wise person who's seen a few things

530
00:33:28.311 --> 00:33:33.170
and who says,
you know,
steady on,
calm down,
maybe,
you know,
look at it this way.
Um,

531
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.720
and uh,
he,
he,
yeah,
he,

532
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:40.610
he gracefully prized me from certain of my more immature positions.

533
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.400
Uh,
in relation to a number of things,

534
00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.250
<v 3>could you give some examples?</v>

535
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.300
<v 4>Well,
for example,
you know,
I had mentioned love,</v>

536
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.620
but it's not that I am now cynical about love,

537
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.970
but um,
in a way he,

538
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:04.180
he rather dark Proust rather darkly says all of us cannot be understood by

539
00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:07.730
another human being perfectly.

540
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.240
That there is an area of loneliness inside everybody.

541
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:16.010
And to blame someone for not understanding you fully,

542
00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:21.260
um,
is deeply unfair because first of all,
we don't understand ourselves.

543
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:22.980
And even if we do understand ourselves,

544
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:27.440
we have such a hard time communicating ourselves to other people and therefore

545
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:32.410
to be furious and enraged and bitter that people don't get all of,

546
00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:35.750
you know,
all of who we are is,
is a real,

547
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.210
is a really kind of crucial piece of immaturity.

548
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:41.120
And that came as a real shock to me,
you know,
as a,
as a,

549
00:34:41.121 --> 00:34:43.970
as a guy in his twenties who,
who really thought,
no,
no,

550
00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:48.510
love is this sort of magical communion where,
um,
you know,

551
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.690
I see into their soul,
they see into mine,

552
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.790
there are no secrets and there is no more loneliness.
Um,

553
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:59.810
and I've realized that there's a kind of beautiful intolerance,

554
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.210
so both beautiful but really kind of negative.
It's,
it's,

555
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.530
it's the breeding ground of a certain kind of impatience and that's kind of

556
00:35:06.531 --> 00:35:09.800
dangerous and that helped me a lot in my personal relationships.

557
00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:13.520
I think it made me a slightly more,
more,
more patient,

558
00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:16.520
more humble kind of person to be around.

559
00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:23.080
<v 3>And uh,
I have so many questions for you.
The,
uh,</v>

560
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:24.910
the,
uh,
this is mostly just a,

561
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.610
a therapy session for myself disguised as a podcast.
But the,
um,
the,

562
00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.850
the first question that,

563
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.790
that I'd love to ask is building on that.

564
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.140
I remember one point,
um,

565
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.910
there was a poll or a,
some type of research done.

566
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:48.790
I don't know how well it was put together and it said that,
uh,
you know,
the,

567
00:35:48.791 --> 00:35:51.390
the happiest country in the world is Denmark.

568
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:56.160
So based on these various surveys and the data that's been gathered,

569
00:35:56.161 --> 00:35:57.570
the Danish are the happiest people.

570
00:35:57.571 --> 00:36:02.010
And I got a comment on a post I put up about this from a Danish person who said,

571
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.920
the secret to happiness is low expectations.

572
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:07.020
That's a pretty common belief here in Denmark.

573
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.190
And I thought it was very funny.
And then I,
I then I,

574
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:16.500
upon looking at it a second time,
began to ask,
is there actually something there?

575
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.980
Right.
And if there is,
how do you,

576
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.640
how do you combine ideally low expectations so you're not constantly

577
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:28.710
disappointed,
I.
E the,

578
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:33.240
the opposite of expecting your loved one to solve all of your loneliness and

579
00:36:33.241 --> 00:36:37.980
Abcd,
you F and g while still striving,

580
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:39.750
uh,
or,
or,

581
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.800
or doing great things for yourself or other people.
Um,

582
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.810
and you,
of course,
I've written a lot since and done many things and,

583
00:36:47.811 --> 00:36:50.760
and we'll dig into some of them.
But how do you think about that?

584
00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.470
<v 4>Um,
I think it's such a key question.
Um,
I think you're,</v>

585
00:36:55.471 --> 00:36:57.430
you're putting your finger on,
on a key thing,

586
00:36:57.431 --> 00:37:02.431
which is that very often people think that having sure we could call a mature

587
00:37:03.041 --> 00:37:06.890
expectations or slightly low expectations in some areas,
um,

588
00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.260
is going to mean that you lose ambition,

589
00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:15.310
that you cannot have ambition and realism.

590
00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:20.700
You cannot be sober in some areas and still deeply excited to get out of bed in

591
00:37:21.491 --> 00:37:26.200
the morning.
Um,
I think that's not really true.
I think there is,

592
00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:31.770
you could have these what you could call paradoxical positions on issues.

593
00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.840
For example,
you know,

594
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:37.390
I like to explore the idea of being a cheerful pessimists or you go,
hang on,

595
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.560
how can you be a cashier for past,
right?
But,
but if you explore that,
you know,

596
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:45.640
if you're a little pessimistic but about how a lot of things go,

597
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.670
it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be gloomy all the time.

598
00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:53.260
You may encounter moments of pure ecstasy as you realize,

599
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.220
um,

600
00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:59.050
that there are some very fine things in a world which is otherwise very dark.

601
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.160
Um,

602
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.160
I don't think a backdrop of stock realism slash pessimism about all sorts of

603
00:38:06.911 --> 00:38:08.050
things that,
you know,

604
00:38:08.051 --> 00:38:11.410
death and illness can visit us very suddenly without warning.

605
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.680
But all our granters plans can be undone by a blood clot in under a minute.

606
00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:18.520
Um,

607
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:23.200
that some of the finest ambitions fall prey to,

608
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.760
you know,
the meanest realities,
et Cetera,
that,
that many of us,

609
00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:32.290
perhaps all of us are going to go to our deathbeds with some very important

610
00:38:32.291 --> 00:38:34.750
parts of us still unexplored.
Um,

611
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:40.260
I think it's because things are so dark because we are operating against a

612
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:44.050
backdrop of,
of darkness that,
you know,

613
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:49.320
a glass of beautiful lemon juice or a sincere conversation with a friend or a

614
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:52.990
moment when yes,
things do go right and everything.
It does go right.

615
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:57.550
Why these things matter so much and perhaps much more intensely.
It's,

616
00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:02.320
it's like the joy of the convalescent who's come out of the hospital and they

617
00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:05.890
are seeing the sunlight strike,
you know,
the leaves of a Daffodil.

618
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:09.820
And that Daffodil seems more beautiful than it's ever done to the robust,

619
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:14.360
you know,
football player who hasn't ever,
you know,
pause to,
uh,

620
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:18.680
to appreciate these things.
So I,
as I say,
um,
I think it's,

621
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:23.200
it should be utterly compatible with ambition,
appreciation,

622
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.810
uh,
tenderness,
et Cetera,
to,

623
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:30.370
to keep the really grim things not far from the top of consciousness,

624
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.690
kind of pretty much every day.

625
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.850
<v 3>The who are some philosophers or thinkers,
uh,</v>

626
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.380
that for those people who have,
uh,

627
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:47.580
a lifelong aversion to the word philosophy in the concept of philosophy,

628
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.863
uh,

629
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:54.360
for just from a utilitarian standpoint,

630
00:39:54.361 --> 00:39:57.920
a readability standpoint,
maybe they're not the same,
but who,
who are,

631
00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:03.060
who are some names that come to mind that you would recommend to folks as a

632
00:40:03.061 --> 00:40:06.900
gateway drug to,
uh,
to philosophy?

633
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.160
<v 4>Well,
that's such a good question.
I mean,
first of all,</v>

634
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:13.780
I'd like to apologize on path of philosophy.
It's not my role,

635
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.060
but I'll do it anyway.
Playfully.
Um,

636
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:21.400
the general public's disinterest and suspicion of philosophy is,

637
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.863
well,

638
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:27.010
it's does the general public hasn't just forgotten about philosophy by mistake?

639
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:32.270
Philosophers operating today have on the whole forgotten about the public.
Um,

640
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.300
insofar my point of view as philosophy is interesting.
Um,
I think it's,

641
00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.570
it's most interesting at,
it's very in,
it's very opening moves.

642
00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:43.910
When philosophy begins in ancient Greece and Rome,
uh,

643
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:47.080
it sets out to be therapy for the soul.

644
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.910
It sets out to be a practical tool that can help you to live and die.

645
00:40:51.911 --> 00:40:56.290
Well,
philosophers in those days are interested in finding out how families were,

646
00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:01.270
how money works,
how status works,
what we should do about public opinion,

647
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:05.050
what we should do about death and illness and ambition and all of these things

648
00:41:05.051 --> 00:41:07.960
that trouble us every day.
That was,
you know,

649
00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:13.360
that centrally what philosophers were interested in and discussed and the great

650
00:41:13.361 --> 00:41:17.500
philosophers of those days,
people like Epicurus,
like Seneca,

651
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.680
Marcus are really us.
Plato,
you know,

652
00:41:20.681 --> 00:41:25.100
these people are all very much worth reading.
Um,

653
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.780
philosophy continues to be interesting for many centuries.

654
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:33.260
I mentioned the name of mortality early on.
He's fantastic.
Uh,

655
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:36.950
in the 19th century,
you've got a great German philosopher Schopenhauer.

656
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.930
He's fantastic.
You get nature.
We can be read with a very rewarding,
uh,

657
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.420
results when we hit the 20th century.

658
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.720
The number of interesting philosophers tails off because something happens to

659
00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:50.270
philosophy that is not often remarked upon,

660
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:53.720
which is basically it splits into and for my money.

661
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.880
The interesting stuff goes into psychology.

662
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:59.970
Freud says that he is a philosopher.
Um,

663
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:04.070
and you know,
the whole tradition that comes out of fraud,
not just like analysis,

664
00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:07.040
but,
but psychology more generally.
Um,
the,

665
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:10.130
the interesting stuff about how to live,
how our minds work,

666
00:42:10.131 --> 00:42:11.960
how to actualize ourselves,

667
00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:16.160
how to relate to others as these things become the province of psychology.

668
00:42:16.161 --> 00:42:17.120
And throughout it,

669
00:42:17.121 --> 00:42:21.410
his street philosophies had a habit of casting off bits of itself and kind of

670
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.980
that spurn the,
the,
the spur on sort of sub genres.

671
00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:29.000
It used to be that the study of the stars was what philosophies did,
uh,

672
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.000
now you know,
that's astrophysics.
So,
um,

673
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:36.440
philosophy has this split in the 20th century and nowadays philosophers tend to

674
00:42:36.441 --> 00:42:40.100
be really only ever employed by universities or was it danger sign when your,

675
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:42.560
when your subject,
your subject matter,

676
00:42:42.561 --> 00:42:44.990
when no one will pay directly for your subject matter,

677
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.340
that's often a sign that something's gone wrong.
Um,

678
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:51.650
the canary in the coal mine is getting a little wobbly.
That's right.

679
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.150
That's right.
So,
and,
and,
and,

680
00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.660
and that's deserved because philosophers don't tell us how to live and die

681
00:42:56.661 --> 00:42:57.680
anymore.
There are a few,

682
00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.920
there's a great philosopher who was at Princeton called Martha Nussbaum.

683
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:04.100
She's terrific.
There are a few others out there who are doing good work,

684
00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:07.430
but really not very many,
not very many that you would recommend.
Let's see.

685
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:07.761
I don't know.

686
00:43:07.761 --> 00:43:10.850
You had a friend who was interested in philosophy and was having a little hard

687
00:43:10.851 --> 00:43:14.660
time in life.
There's very few names that you would recommend.
Nevertheless,

688
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:18.650
what philosophy really is,
is a discipline that's distinct from say,

689
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:21.590
poetry or religion,
but like poetry.

690
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.760
It wants to talk about the things that are meaningful.
Um,
and like religion,

691
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:28.400
it wants to give us guidance.
But unlike religion,

692
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:33.070
it's not using the supernatural.
It's no appeal to supernatural or,

693
00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:37.940
or,
um,
you know,
mysterious forces,
forces you can't define.

694
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:42.840
Um,
it's,
it's based on anything that you can kind of reason with.
Um,
and,

695
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:47.000
and unlike poetry,
it's not merely interested in kind of beautiful phenomena.

696
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:51.410
It wants to take those somewhere.
It wants to inform and,
and reform us.

697
00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.490
So the book I wrote after I wrote half Bruce can change your life,

698
00:43:55.491 --> 00:43:58.370
was a book called the constellations of philosophy.
And in that book,

699
00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:03.230
I looked at sixth grade philosophers,
I looked at Socrates,
Epicurus,

700
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:07.640
Seneca,
Martain,
Schopenhauer,
uh,
nature.

701
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.600
And,
um,
I,

702
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:13.340
I looked at these guys as for very practical guidance.

703
00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:17.360
It was an attempt to say to these great names,

704
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:22.130
how can you show us,
you know,
what to do and,
and how to live.
Uh,

705
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.690
and,
um,
uh,
you know,

706
00:44:23.691 --> 00:44:28.370
so that was a kind of classic style that I was developing.
And,
um,

707
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.190
and then I was getting good results from,
and uh,
you know,
that's,

708
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.810
that's a book of mine that,
that one,

709
00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:36.540
many readers around the world and it's still probably the book of mine that

710
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:39.900
sells the best.
Um,
and it,
it's,
you know,

711
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:42.600
it does what it says on the tin,

712
00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:47.601
which is to look for constellations among the work of some great philosophers.

713
00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:54.250
<v 3>Do you consider Bertrand Russell a philosopher?
Absolutely.</v>

714
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.580
Um,
he,
I was,
I was always very impressed.

715
00:44:57.581 --> 00:45:02.290
I was introduced to Bertrand Russell before I was introduced to Seneca and then

716
00:45:02.291 --> 00:45:06.160
visa vi Seneca in delving into stoicism.

717
00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.940
Uh,
of course he has a very interesting,
uh,

718
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.450
he is a very interesting style of prose and discourse.

719
00:45:13.451 --> 00:45:17.200
So he throws in his company his competition,
right?

720
00:45:17.201 --> 00:45:21.490
He throws in Epicurus quite a bit as a way to pull in defectors,

721
00:45:21.491 --> 00:45:25.150
which is very clever of him and not too surprising if you look at his political

722
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.550
hardwiring,
but Burke.

723
00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:32.530
But Bertrand Russell was the first one and I'm not sure if it was a,
there's a,

724
00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.900
there's uh,
I've read several of his books,

725
00:45:34.901 --> 00:45:37.930
but you know why I am not a Christian was one of the secrets of happiness,

726
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.890
the secrets of happiness also.
Yes.
That may have been the first.

727
00:45:41.891 --> 00:45:45.990
And now I was struck by how much it,
uh,

728
00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:50.950
how strongly it contrast it to most of the philosophy I had been exposed to.

729
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:55.060
I went to Princeton undergraduate,
I did take one philosophy class that was very,

730
00:45:55.061 --> 00:45:59.850
very,
very good with the Professor Rosen and I'm blanking on the,

731
00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.900
uh,
I think it was metaphysics and epistemology one-on-one,

732
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:05.980
which I probably couldn't define either of those terms at this point,

733
00:46:05.981 --> 00:46:07.690
but professor Rosen was very good.

734
00:46:07.691 --> 00:46:12.040
And then the rest that I ran into release seemed like a lot of intellectual

735
00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:15.040
masturbation,
um,
where

736
00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:21.570
a vast majority of it seemed to focus on a semantic tail,

737
00:46:22.451 --> 00:46:26.260
chasing the sort of,
the,
the like what does is really mean?

738
00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:30.940
And then they'd go on for 600 pages of rhetoric and at the end you're like,

739
00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.730
I don't think that added any value.
Yep.

740
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.811
<v 4>You mean to my,</v>

741
00:46:34.811 --> 00:46:39.730
I so sympathize that was my experience as well and it enrages me and saddens me.

742
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.010
And I think that,
um,
look,
I'm,
you know,

743
00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:44.861
the older I get,

744
00:46:44.861 --> 00:46:49.861
the more I realized that the great challenge of our own age is to take the good

745
00:46:50.351 --> 00:46:54.340
ideas and make them available to a wide public.

746
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.910
And the universities often weirdly the opposite.
I mean,
they,

747
00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:02.230
they inform a kind of narrow coterie of students,
but there are,

748
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.860
they stand outside the kind of democratic project.

749
00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:09.250
And that's critical because we live in a mass culture.
We live,

750
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.890
we live in a world where ideas have to have followings in the millions if that

751
00:47:13.891 --> 00:47:17.000
ever to get traction.
And when people,
you know,
uh,

752
00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.600
wring their hands and despair and go,
why don't we do this?

753
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.710
Why don't we do that a wise,
the world,
et Cetera.

754
00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:26.560
A lot of the reason is that the good ideas are not on network TV.

755
00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:30.010
They're not on the mass channels communication.

756
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.820
So that a few people in the Ivy League universities,

757
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.180
I've got full command of,
you know,
if it can Stein's later philosophy,

758
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.630
but out in the street that isn't,
you know,

759
00:47:40.631 --> 00:47:43.600
that democratic pool of knowledge.
And you know,

760
00:47:43.601 --> 00:47:46.570
I've always been attracted to the Great Democrats of knowledge.

761
00:47:46.571 --> 00:47:49.540
So someone like Voltaire in 18th Century France,

762
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:54.010
he wanted to write for everybody.
Um,
uh,
you know,

763
00:47:54.011 --> 00:47:56.980
someone like Emerson in the American tradition,
again,

764
00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:02.130
he was a man who toured the country and gave impassioned speeches about the

765
00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:06.470
highest and most meaningful things,
but he was,
you know,
in,

766
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.700
in the church hall talking,
you know,

767
00:48:09.701 --> 00:48:13.330
the language of ordinary people to get his message across.
And that seem,

768
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:17.740
that seems to have been so hard for many 20th century philosophers.

769
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:22.690
And Bertrand Russell is,
you know,
in a company of almost just one in,
in,

770
00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:27.640
in his decision that he was a guy who he,
he wrote a,
he had a column in,

771
00:48:27.641 --> 00:48:30.220
in,
in a,
in a,
in a daily newspaper in England.

772
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:34.330
He wrote articles for American vogue.
He appeared on television.

773
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.560
He had a regular radio program.
Many philosophers attacked him for this.

774
00:48:38.561 --> 00:48:41.830
They said that he was cheapening and deadening his son Jay,

775
00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:44.230
but it was a man who knew his stuff.

776
00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:46.660
He wasn't going to be bullied and patronized.

777
00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:51.930
And he understood that the things he cared about would only live if he managed

778
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:56.200
to get ordinary people properly engage.
So he was a wonderful,

779
00:48:56.201 --> 00:48:58.570
wonderful vulgarized.
Ah,
in the best sense.

780
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:01.350
<v 3>No,
I,
I,
uh,</v>

781
00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:06.240
I agree and I think that one of the challenges is that when you had,

782
00:49:06.241 --> 00:49:10.230
say the Stoics,
right?
Steaua as I understand it,

783
00:49:10.231 --> 00:49:14.310
referring to porch and they would sit in these informal classrooms and talk.

784
00:49:14.311 --> 00:49:17.340
I mean there are other forms of course fora.
Maybe,
I dunno,

785
00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:20.970
I'm not up to speed with my etymology,
but the,

786
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.800
when that translated into a more structured academic setting,
uh,

787
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:30.600
and say the hard sciences had a progression in difficulty,
right?

788
00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:35.520
Where you,
if you're willing to study at the graduate level,
uh,
in mathematics,

789
00:49:35.521 --> 00:49:36.960
you need to master the Prereq,

790
00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:41.040
the prerequisites and undergraduate and then Algebra and so on before that.

791
00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:46.610
And when you take philosophy and force fit it into that type of progression,

792
00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:51.630
you go from,
uh,
not striving to make something useful,

793
00:49:51.631 --> 00:49:56.010
but striving to make something difficult.
And I think when it becomes difficult,

794
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:59.340
it's inversely correlated to its usefulness.
Does that make sense?
It's like,
well,

795
00:49:59.341 --> 00:50:04.341
you can't be a phd in philosophy until you've made it sufficiently arcane and

796
00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:09.480
made the rhetoric so convoluted that only five people at this university are

797
00:50:09.481 --> 00:50:12.330
willing to sit down and talk about it for three hours.
And it's,
uh,

798
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:17.280
it becomes this very unfortunate,
uh,
sort of self,
uh,

799
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:20.750
cauterizing structure.

800
00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:24.480
<v 4>You know,
the unfortunate thing is that the humanities,</v>

801
00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:28.970
so all the great wisdom of the,
at a professional level,

802
00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:33.971
they started to have to compete in the 20th century with the sciences for money

803
00:50:34.101 --> 00:50:35.540
and attention and universities.

804
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:39.410
And the way that they decided to take the battle is that they sort of tried to

805
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:44.411
turn themselves into pseudo sciences so that they suggested that you would study

806
00:50:45.471 --> 00:50:49.040
them,
like a scientist would,
would start it.
So you would do things like research,

807
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:53.570
you would find a poet and you would research the poet and you would do some kind

808
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:57.940
of complicated weird stuff in the,
in the back engine room around that.
They're,

809
00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:02.210
this person.
Previously the humanities was,
wasn't the handle.

810
00:51:02.211 --> 00:51:04.580
They weren't handled like this.
They were handled by,

811
00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:08.120
by ordinary lay people who would spend half an hour in the evening dipping into,

812
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.780
you know,
have a volume of philosophy,
all poetry.
Um,

813
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:15.460
suddenly this stuff became the subject of kind of,
you know,

814
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:19.740
study that was akin to studying nuclear physics.
Um,

815
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:23.360
and that was all to make sure that the professors would get tenure and that

816
00:51:23.361 --> 00:51:26.780
departments would get funding and that governments would be suitably impressed.

817
00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:31.460
I can understand and sympathize with,
you know,
people's needs to,
you know,

818
00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:32.870
progress up the career ladder.

819
00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.850
But it's been a complete disaster for the rest of us because it's meant that

820
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:41.660
wisdom that was supposed to circulate freely and democratically around the

821
00:51:41.661 --> 00:51:44.830
nation has become,
you know,

822
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:49.760
bunched up in some kind of centers,
um,
uh,
in the universities and,

823
00:51:49.761 --> 00:51:54.350
and is not doing its job.
And meanwhile,
you know,
well we know,

824
00:51:54.351 --> 00:51:57.620
we know what happens on TV and down the down the airwaves,

825
00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.300
<v 3>how I'm not how,</v>

826
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:07.130
who do you think the contemporary thinkers who are doing a good job of

827
00:52:07.131 --> 00:52:10.470
popularizing,
what you might consider philosophy,
um,

828
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:12.770
who are names that come to mind?
Of course you're,

829
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.850
you are one of the first names that come to mind for most people,

830
00:52:16.851 --> 00:52:19.250
but who else would you put on that list?

831
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:20.080
<v 4>Um,</v>

832
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.500
well I have a colleague that I like very much called John Armstrong who operates

833
00:52:23.501 --> 00:52:27.070
out of Australia and he's,
he's,
he writes some wonderful things.
Um,

834
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:30.970
there are also,
as I mentioned,
she smuggled Martha Nussbaum who's,

835
00:52:30.971 --> 00:52:35.410
who's doing a really nice job.
Um,
you know,
they've been,

836
00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:40.060
they've been Arthur's.
Um,
but it's,
you know,
it,
it,
it is hard.

837
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:43.960
Um,
popularization is,
is hard.
Um,

838
00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:47.560
one of my favorite popularizes is Jamie Oliver,
the cook chef.

839
00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:52.580
And what I love about the guys that he's taught the UK how to cook,
um,

840
00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:57.100
and the way he's done that is to speak in the language of ordinary people about

841
00:52:57.101 --> 00:53:00.730
some pretty unordinary things like how to cook a duck,
Allah,
Raj or something.

842
00:53:00.731 --> 00:53:05.731
And he's got working class English males to kind of put on an apron and do some

843
00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:09.670
weird stuff.
And I think that's what a good teacher is.

844
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:13.720
A good teacher is the person who takes your fear.

845
00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:17.680
And we tend to have these fears like,
I'm a woman so I can't,

846
00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:21.760
or I come from a working class background,
so I can't,
or you know,

847
00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.870
I'm uh,
you know,
an elite person.
So I can't,

848
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.850
we have these kind of blocks.
I can't do this because of that in my past.

849
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.990
And a good teacher says,
no,

850
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.500
how do you mean you can't do engineering and be a woman?
Of course you can,

851
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:35.500
or you know,
you,

852
00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:40.420
you can't be a working class guy and read poetry course you can,
et cetera.

853
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:41.760
And that's what a good teacher does,

854
00:53:41.761 --> 00:53:46.350
shakes you free from some of these kinds of dichotomies.
And,
uh,
so for me,
uh,

855
00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:46.561
you know,

856
00:53:46.561 --> 00:53:49.980
a good teacher of philosophy is that someone who comes down the audience,
like,

857
00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.290
you know,
you thought that because you're a busy dentist,

858
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:55.950
you can't read philosophy.
It has no place in your life.
Of course you can.
Uh,

859
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:58.260
so that's,
that's what a good teacher does.
And,

860
00:53:58.261 --> 00:54:01.110
and you know that those are some out there.
And,
and,
and we need more.

861
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.830
<v 3>I agree on Jamie Oliver.
I have,
uh,</v>

862
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:09.910
one of his books cook with Jamie about 15 feet in front of me on a shelf next to

863
00:54:09.921 --> 00:54:14.450
a couple of other people.
I would put in that same category of teacher.
Uh,

864
00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:19.130
you have,
uh,
seven fires,
which is one many people probably haven't heard of,

865
00:54:19.131 --> 00:54:23.260
which is by a Patagonian chef trained in France about how to use fire to us.

866
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.800
But the,
the underlying,
the underlying principles are the same.

867
00:54:27.801 --> 00:54:30.950
Whether it's Richard Feynman,
the physicist,
one of my favorite books.

868
00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:35.720
Surely you must be joking,
Mr Feinman or seven fires or Jamie Oliver.

869
00:54:35.721 --> 00:54:39.950
I mean they're,
they are making the,
the,

870
00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:45.100
the potentially complex simple to encourage the free flow of,

871
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:46.640
of ideas and action.

872
00:54:46.641 --> 00:54:51.641
And it's the opposite of making the potentially simple complicated to constrain

873
00:54:52.581 --> 00:54:56.810
the flow because you have a scarcity mindset,
you have a defensive mindset,

874
00:54:56.811 --> 00:54:58.080
which would be the case I think for,

875
00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.390
for many people at the highest levels of academia,
which is unfortunate.

876
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.840
They feel like if they were to popularize,
it would,

877
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:06.890
uh,

878
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:11.360
it would sort of loosen the soil beneath their feet and remove some stability in

879
00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:15.560
some way,
uh,
or,
or cheapen it.
And I'm not sure when that happened.

880
00:55:15.561 --> 00:55:19.160
I mean in the day of say,
um,
I,
I,
there's,

881
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.700
there's a book I really need to read call.
I think it's dying every day.

882
00:55:22.701 --> 00:55:27.350
It's a book about Seneca in the Court of narrow,
but was set up.
It was a very,

883
00:55:27.351 --> 00:55:29.030
very popular writer.
Uh,

884
00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:34.090
do you have any idea if he was ridiculed and scoffed at by the highbrow

885
00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:41.600
philosophers of his day or did that,
is that a recent develop?

886
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:45.170
<v 4>Um,
well,
he,
he was ridiculed not for,
not for that issue,</v>

887
00:55:45.171 --> 00:55:49.580
but he was ridiculed for making a lot of money,
uh,
which he did,

888
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.470
um,
in,
in politics and business.
And also,
um,

889
00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:56.720
having a pretty luxurious lifestyle.
And people said,
how do you mean,
hang on,

890
00:55:56.721 --> 00:55:58.880
I had him,
you're supposed to be a stoic philosopher.

891
00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:01.990
You're supposed to have one cloak and,
and live in a thing,
and your,
your,

892
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.320
you know,
your house is pretty nice.

893
00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:07.640
And so there was some mockery and he has some funny answers to that.
I mean,
he,

894
00:56:07.641 --> 00:56:08.000
he,

895
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.830
he rebuts the judge's head on and he says the true philosopher,

896
00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:16.100
it's not the true philosopher,
must have no money.

897
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:20.720
It's just that he must be ready to lose it.
That he must is,
hold on.

898
00:56:20.721 --> 00:56:25.000
It must be relaxed and,
um,
right.
And in fact,
you know,
this could sound like,

899
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:28.750
oh yeah,
you know,
pull the other leg.
But,
but in fact,

900
00:56:28.751 --> 00:56:32.260
he did practice what he preached because twice in his life he did lose

901
00:56:32.261 --> 00:56:37.010
everything.
He was exiled,
he fell into political disgrace,
et cetera.
And,
um,

902
00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:42.010
he,
he behaves pretty well.
Um,
and so stoicism is not necessarily,

903
00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:46.480
stoicism attracted a lot of support on the very wealthy and the very successful

904
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.580
because it taught them that they could survive without their wealth and their

905
00:56:51.581 --> 00:56:55.120
success.
And very often when people get wealthy and successful,

906
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:59.200
they become very scared of what would happen and they feel the need for ever

907
00:56:59.201 --> 00:57:03.340
more success and have a more wealth from a fear that if they would have to go

908
00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:05.080
backwards,
it would be catastrophic.

909
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:10.000
And what's very relaxing and nice about stoicism is that it partly says,
will,

910
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:13.150
you know,
uh,
it's survivable.
Of course it is.

911
00:57:13.151 --> 00:57:16.780
And one of the favorite stoic exercises that they would perform was that once a

912
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:18.280
month or so,
um,

913
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:23.530
a stoic was advised to wear the dirtiest cloak and sleep on the kitchen floor.

914
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.680
Santa Clara advised in the dog basket.
Uh,

915
00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:29.770
I don't know how big that that might be.
And you would drink the dog's water.

916
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:33.160
And the idea was that for,
for,
for a few days,

917
00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:36.730
you live like a dog and you realize that that's possible and it's fine.

918
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:41.260
And that removes,
um,
fear.
And as they understood,

919
00:57:41.261 --> 00:57:43.240
he coming back to your earlier issue about ambition,

920
00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:48.130
they realize that often what stops us from realizing our ambitions is fear and

921
00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:52.360
therefore if we make ourselves totally at home with failure totally at home with

922
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:53.620
utter disgrace,

923
00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:57.700
we will feel a curious lightness and sense of possibility because we weren't

924
00:57:57.701 --> 00:57:59.740
held back by the constant thought.

925
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:03.610
What happens if we will have fully explored the question?

926
00:58:03.611 --> 00:58:07.720
What happens if we'll have made ourselves so at home and seen that there is

927
00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:12.721
nothing so bad about failure and that will free us to advance more likely and

928
00:58:15.551 --> 00:58:18.520
with greater courage towards some of our goals.

929
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:23.690
<v 3>I couldn't agree more.
And you're retching pessimism earlier.</v>

930
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:28.720
I give a presentation I think in 2008 2009 it's only five or six minutes long

931
00:58:28.821 --> 00:58:33.821
called a practical pessimism and it made the point like,

932
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:36.380
like you just did very eloquently,

933
00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.010
that if you practice the worst case scenario,

934
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:45.130
and even if you were to view that as pessimism but a very practical version of

935
00:58:45.291 --> 00:58:48.110
it,
it actually frees you to be more ambitious.

936
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:51.560
It doesn't teach you to drop your expectations.

937
00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:55.430
It just teaches you not to be attached to the expectation of a best case

938
00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:56.120
scenario.

939
00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.840
So it frees you up to swing for the fences because you're not afraid of striking

940
00:58:59.841 --> 00:59:03.830
out.
At least I've found that to be true for myself.
And there's a,

941
00:59:03.831 --> 00:59:07.730
there's a great essay also out there on the,
uh,
the,

942
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:12.440
the discussion and the Aha,
the stone throwing,
uh,

943
00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.020
related to Seneca and as well,
I mean,

944
00:59:15.021 --> 00:59:18.070
he was very well known for being wealthy and,
uh,

945
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:22.580
had his ivory legged tables and so on.
There's an essay called the,

946
00:59:22.581 --> 00:59:24.560
the case of the opulent Stoic,

947
00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:29.590
which is a very interesting read on how that controversy evolved and where it

948
00:59:31.971 --> 00:59:36.950
may be a fair accusation at where it may be an unfair accusation.
Um,
but,
uh,

949
00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:40.790
what a wonderful essay.
Oh yeah.
It's a great,
great name too.

950
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:45.860
Just like the in search of lost time.
Um,
the,
uh,

951
00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.720
where did all this come from?
I'm,
so,
I've been in so much as,

952
00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.740
where did you grow up?
What did your parents do?

953
00:59:54.741 --> 00:59:59.530
Could you give us some color as to your,
your upbringing?
The Pre k the pre k?

954
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.840
<v 4>Yeah.
So I came from a family of very displaced,</v>

955
01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:10.120
very neurotic and anxious immigrants.
My father was born in Egypt.

956
01:00:10.121 --> 01:00:13.600
He was part of the Jewish community in Alexandria that got kicked out in the
50s.

957
01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.320
From one day to the next.
He then drifted around the Middle East.

958
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:21.070
He eventually wound up as a,
as an immigrant,
as a refugee,

959
01:00:21.071 --> 01:00:25.630
more or less in Switzerland.
Um,
was utterly penniless and desperate.

960
01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.960
Met My mother who was a part of the Swiss Jewish community and for all her own

961
01:00:31.781 --> 01:00:36.160
reasons to have a family,
had our father had recently died.

962
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:39.310
The family had lost everything for having come from quite a privileged

963
01:00:39.311 --> 01:00:42.330
background.
They then lost everything and she was living,
um,

964
01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.460
in very humble second.
And where they found each other,

965
01:00:45.461 --> 01:00:50.110
they clung to each other and they were United in their desire to make it in life

966
01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:54.390
and to be ambitious and achieve great things.
Um,

967
01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:58.830
they did manage to achieve great things together.
They built up a business.
Um,
uh,

968
01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:02.260
my father made it big in the world of finance.

969
01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:07.270
He always retained a kind of immigrant panic mentality.

970
01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:11.470
Um,
he got,
he had us with having not had a passport for long periods of his life.

971
01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:16.270
He eventually got a famous Swiss passport and he would treasure that item like

972
01:01:16.271 --> 01:01:19.060
nothing else.
And every time he crossed a border,

973
01:01:19.061 --> 01:01:21.160
every time he went in and out of a country,

974
01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.250
they would be panic in his eyes as he just thought,

975
01:01:24.251 --> 01:01:27.250
is this going to be the moment when they grabbed me and put me somewhere else,

976
01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:30.310
et cetera.
So that was kind of part of his DNA.
So it was a foul,

977
01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:34.000
I was growing up in a family that was at one level a comfortable and you know

978
01:01:34.001 --> 01:01:35.350
how to add all the things in life.

979
01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:39.730
At another level there was a deep psychological kind of disturbance and fear.

980
01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:44.110
I would say that the dominant mood of my parents was anxiety.
And you know,

981
01:01:44.111 --> 01:01:46.900
if I returned home in the evening,
they would sort of think,
oh,

982
01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:49.900
you're still alive.
And I would go,
yeah,
sure,
I'm,
I'm still alive.

983
01:01:49.901 --> 01:01:53.890
And they were amazed and they believe above all in hard work,

984
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:58.030
but to a slightly crazy degree.
And I as a child,
I observe them.

985
01:01:58.031 --> 01:02:02.080
And I observed both their successes and their strengths and also some of their

986
01:02:02.081 --> 01:02:03.160
vulnerabilities.

987
01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:07.330
I realized that these were people who didn't have a very good grasp of their own

988
01:02:07.331 --> 01:02:11.950
psychology.
And,
um,
they did love the arts.

989
01:02:11.951 --> 01:02:14.300
Both of them loved the arts very much.
Um,

990
01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:17.800
and that I inherited from them anyway.
I inherited a,
you know,

991
01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:22.160
various things when always,
every,
every childhood is such as a mixed bag of,
uh,

992
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:23.380
things.
But,
um,

993
01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:27.540
I came out of that childhood thinking success is important,

994
01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:28.680
but at the same time,

995
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:34.670
aware enough of the limitations of success to not swallow uncritically some of

996
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:39.540
the messages about what it means to kind of make it in this world.
And so,

997
01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:40.471
you know,

998
01:02:40.471 --> 01:02:45.471
a lot of my work has been kind of exploring and probing what we mean by success

999
01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:49.470
and the challenges it brings,
et Cetera.
So,
yeah.

1000
01:02:49.471 --> 01:02:51.360
I don't know if that explains some of it.

1001
01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:55.750
<v 3>No,
no.
Does,
it adds a lot of very helpful context.
I mean,
you've written,</v>

1002
01:02:56.230 --> 01:03:00.130
of course,
status anxiety,
the architecture of happiness,
the news,

1003
01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:05.080
a user's manual.
You,
you're prolific.
Uh,
certainly compared to me.

1004
01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.870
Uh,
and,
uh,
have you,

1005
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:13.470
have you developed any practices or reminders that help you to mitigate or

1006
01:03:16.391 --> 01:03:18.640
minimize status,
anxiety,

1007
01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.990
the keeping up with the Joneses or the fear of missing out all of these issues

1008
01:03:22.991 --> 01:03:27.050
that seem to really plague at least a lot of my friends and I know I,

1009
01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:28.120
I grappled with these,
right?

1010
01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.360
<v 4>Sure.
I mean,
um,
I think,
you know,</v>

1011
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.100
30 vital kind of realization was it's not just me,
it's,

1012
01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.600
it's part of being alive today that we,
we,
you know,
we,
we,

1013
01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:44.490
we've got this ideology of individualism,
you know,
what,

1014
01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:46.870
what historians of ideas called individualism,

1015
01:03:46.871 --> 01:03:51.340
which is a kind of new idea because we've come from collective societies where

1016
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:56.470
your sense of wellbeing did not depend on anything that you particularly did.

1017
01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.460
You,
you will first and foremost part of a tribe,
part of a village.

1018
01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.560
You were part of a family.
It,

1019
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:06.730
your own achievements was only one part and perhaps even don't need the most

1020
01:04:06.731 --> 01:04:09.100
minor part of that other,

1021
01:04:09.101 --> 01:04:13.660
those other sources of identity and sense of self.
We've done away with that.

1022
01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.770
Everybody is meant to reinvent themselves.
Um,

1023
01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:22.910
and that's wonderful and liberating.
And,
and,
and was part of,
you know,

1024
01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.020
the European and American story in the 18th century.

1025
01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.290
But it's also deeply troubling for many of us.

1026
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:34.270
It crushes us because what a burden to bear.
You know,
what,

1027
01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:37.540
in a way,
what unwitting cruelty to say to everyone.

1028
01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:40.180
You can't rely on where you have come from.

1029
01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.320
You can't define yourself by your group,
by your family,

1030
01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:49.060
by your ancestors,
by the nation.
You can't believe in nationalism.

1031
01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:54.040
It isn't enough for you to feel proud of,
you know,
your group.

1032
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:59.020
You have to be proud only of yourself and what you've achieved in the years

1033
01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:01.960
since you finished your college education or whatever.

1034
01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:06.690
That is a heavy and sometimes just overwhelming button.
It's,

1035
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:10.330
it's good to realize that we are under this pressure.

1036
01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.480
It's not that that will magically make that pressure disappear,
but just to,

1037
01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:14.750
to be able to know,
hmm,

1038
01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:19.740
no wonder I'm a little twitchy on evenings as the sun goes down.
No wonder that.

1039
01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.180
Get that Sunday feeling when I'm thinking my God,

1040
01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:26.410
I've got my dreams on the one hand and my reality on the other and the gap is

1041
01:05:26.411 --> 01:05:29.020
too large.
And I feel desperate,
you know,

1042
01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:34.110
no wonder we feel that because that is what the whole system helps us and makes

1043
01:05:35.771 --> 01:05:39.790
us feel,
and I don't want to say that it's all wrong,
um,

1044
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:44.650
but it is certainly very demonic.
Look,
my experience of envy and status,
anxiety,

1045
01:05:44.651 --> 01:05:46.600
et cetera.
It's a very simple idea.

1046
01:05:46.601 --> 01:05:51.550
The more you know what you really want and where you're really going,

1047
01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:55.900
the more what everybody else is doing starts to diminish.

1048
01:05:55.930 --> 01:06:00.930
It's at the moments when your own path is that it's most ambiguous that the

1049
01:06:02.021 --> 01:06:06.430
voices of others,
the distracting chaos in which we live,
that kind of,
you know,

1050
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:07.200
the,
the,

1051
01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:12.070
the social media static that starts to loom large and become very threatening.

1052
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:16.060
Um,
the thing about ourselves is,
as you know,

1053
01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:21.400
we're not very good at understanding what it is that we really want.

1054
01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:26.460
We're extremely prone to latch on to suggestions from the outside world.

1055
01:06:26.471 --> 01:06:30.110
You know,
like,
you know,
when every,
when everybody was saying,
you know,

1056
01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.180
tech was big,

1057
01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:35.330
a lot of people who never thought about it thought tech was really for them.
Uh,

1058
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:38.380
when banking was big,
people thought banking's you know,
for me,

1059
01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:42.280
when people tell you,
telling you that,
you know,
romantic love is perfect,

1060
01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.420
you think,
well,
I must be finding an perhaps even feeling romantic love,

1061
01:06:46.421 --> 01:06:46.990
et cetera.

1062
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:51.990
So we've got a lot of models out there that don't necessarily suit us but a

1063
01:06:52.071 --> 01:06:56.740
deeply powerful and I think that could to calm down.

1064
01:06:56.770 --> 01:06:58.090
First of all,
you know,

1065
01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:02.080
you have to realize that your ultimate responsibility is to yourself,

1066
01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:04.090
not the neighbors,
not your parents.

1067
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:08.200
I'm not the expectations that were put upon you.

1068
01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:12.250
This is where the thought of death is tremendously releasing that your only real

1069
01:07:12.251 --> 01:07:16.780
responsibility is to,
uh,
you know,
yourself as a kind of mortal,

1070
01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:20.350
very temporary being a constellation of,
uh,
you know,

1071
01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:24.280
particles and proteins that are hanging together in a particular shape for a few

1072
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.280
years before disappearing forever.
That's you.
Um,

1073
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:31.900
and there are more ways to be then you know,

1074
01:07:31.901 --> 01:07:36.610
your college,
um,
you know,
graduation,
speech led you to think.
Um,

1075
01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:41.680
so yeah,
these are some of the tensions of the modern,
modern soul.

1076
01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:47.230
<v 3>And I,
I found a lot of,
this is something I sometimes have trouble,</v>

1077
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.890
uh,
verbalizing to people,

1078
01:07:50.891 --> 01:07:55.891
but I find that a lot of Buddhist thought has parallels with,

1079
01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.420
with stoic thought in terms of whether it's Marcus really a saying at the end

1080
01:08:01.421 --> 01:08:03.670
of,
uh,
at the end of a very short period of time,

1081
01:08:03.671 --> 01:08:07.390
I will be bones and dust on the ground and that's is like upload lifting note to

1082
01:08:07.391 --> 01:08:09.940
himself in his journal before he goes off to battle.

1083
01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:15.620
Or it's like a Musashi Miyamoto who is one of the one of,

1084
01:08:15.621 --> 01:08:18.920
if not the most famous swordsmen and Japanese history who would say probably

1085
01:08:18.921 --> 01:08:22.580
more or less the exact same thing before setting off on his day.

1086
01:08:22.581 --> 01:08:27.110
And it sounds very depressing and it sounds like a downer,
but it's,

1087
01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:32.050
it for me has been such a helpful reminder and it's,
it's,
um,

1088
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.200
sad circumstances,

1089
01:08:33.201 --> 01:08:38.201
but I've had two friends die of unexpected causes very suddenly in the last

1090
01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.610
month.
And it just,
it,

1091
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:47.650
it seems to be all the more important that we have some type of Memento Mori,

1092
01:08:47.961 --> 01:08:51.260
right?
Some type of reminder of death that,
uh,

1093
01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:55.580
and in fact I have a friend who is in finance.
Don't hold that against him.

1094
01:08:55.581 --> 01:08:59.960
He's a good guy.
Uh,
but uh,
he has a,

1095
01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:03.890
an excel spreadsheet that calculates and display is on his desk,

1096
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:09.170
the number of expected hours he has left in his life so that he sees that

1097
01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:12.410
everyday.
I don't have that.
But in the,
for instance,

1098
01:09:12.411 --> 01:09:14.380
the four hour chef and the author photograph,

1099
01:09:14.381 --> 01:09:17.480
I've put a small skull in the very bottom corner.
It's kind of hard to see,

1100
01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:21.320
but that's what a lot of artists use to do.
Not to say that I'm an artist,

1101
01:09:21.321 --> 01:09:26.321
but that was one of the ways I wanted to constantly remind myself that time is

1102
01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.270
of time can be very short.
You don't,
you don't know how much,

1103
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:36.590
how many hours you have left on the planet.
Um,
where do you,

1104
01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.130
I'm sorry,
I was just going to ask and feel free to,

1105
01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:43.940
to take this in a different direction,
but with the,

1106
01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:49.330
the recognizing that the clearer you have defined what you want,

1107
01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.480
the less fear of missing out,
the less status anxiety,

1108
01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:58.100
the less suggestive you will be to the,
the,
the madness of the mob.

1109
01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:02.750
Uh,
where would,
what do you,
where do you want to be in three years time,

1110
01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:04.430
for instance?
Like what,
uh,

1111
01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:08.360
what would you like your sort of day to day existence to be like,

1112
01:10:08.361 --> 01:10:11.980
or what would you like to have achieved?
It doesn't have to be professional,
uh,

1113
01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.033
in the next [inaudible].

1114
01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:15.820
<v 4>Well,
I mean,
if I can mention that the professional,</v>

1115
01:10:15.821 --> 01:10:19.890
one of the things that's been really absorbing me in the last few years is,
um,

1116
01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:24.960
well I was a writer for most of my professional life and then I always had a

1117
01:10:25.301 --> 01:10:29.950
sense that writing books wasn't quite enough.
And what I mean by an office,

1118
01:10:29.951 --> 01:10:34.630
I didn't feel that sending people,

1119
01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:35.321
you know,

1120
01:10:35.321 --> 01:10:40.321
200 pages glued together was necessarily always going to be the solution to many

1121
01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:42.310
of the issues that I cared about.

1122
01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:46.260
I felt I sort of crisis of the soul where I realized that,
you know,

1123
01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.700
this idea of being a writer that I'd want it so badly when I was younger,

1124
01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.900
um,
was no longer fully satisfying me because I realized that so many problems,

1125
01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:01.450
um,
we're not going to be amenable to treatment by books that you needed other

1126
01:11:01.451 --> 01:11:06.280
things.
Um,
and that led me to begin an organization,

1127
01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.710
um,
which I called the school of life,

1128
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.160
which was very much in line with things that,
uh,

1129
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:16.590
I've been caring about it in my books for a long time.

1130
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:21.330
But there were a few differences for a start.
It wasn't just about me.
Um,

1131
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:25.800
it was actually about gathering,
gathering together with a group of likeminded,

1132
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:26.010
but,

1133
01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:30.210
but different people with different talents and different skills and starting

1134
01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.840
something that,
um,
you know,

1135
01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:35.700
could be a proper collective and an institution.

1136
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:41.370
The reason I started where I did was that I read a lot about religion because at

1137
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:43.990
a certain point in my kind of crisis about,
you know,

1138
01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.720
the meaning of being a writer,
et cetera.

1139
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:50.760
I got very interested in religions cause I thought religion,
I'm an atheist,

1140
01:11:50.761 --> 01:11:51.594
I don't believe,

1141
01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:54.630
but I'm very interested in religions and very sympathetic to many of the things

1142
01:11:54.631 --> 01:11:55.500
you find in religion.

1143
01:11:55.820 --> 01:12:00.510
And what I realized that you find in religion is a machine organization.

1144
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:04.320
Religions don't just believe in writing their deepest thoughts down in a book

1145
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:05.490
and that's it.

1146
01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.200
They support things by having communal activities,

1147
01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:11.250
group activities.

1148
01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.730
I'm getting very involved in the arts getting involved in this thing which we

1149
01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:15.750
call ritual.

1150
01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:19.620
I mean we can talk more about that and what is a ritual but ritualized actions,

1151
01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.560
repetition,
the repetition of ideas,
not just,

1152
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:27.230
you don't just read them once you repeat them,
maybe with other people.
Um,
uh,
you,

1153
01:12:27.231 --> 01:12:29.790
you,
you might use music to,
to get a point across.

1154
01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:31.980
All of these things fascinated me.

1155
01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:36.390
And I realized that as religion declined in,

1156
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:40.470
you know,
in Europe in the 19th century,
in many parts of the United States,

1157
01:12:40.471 --> 01:12:44.580
even now,
et Cetera,
um,
as religion disappeared,
it was in many places,

1158
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.120
uh,
replaced by culture that,
you know,

1159
01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:49.800
people who in previous agents would have been religious.

1160
01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:53.430
I've got very interested in music and literature and philosophy and all these

1161
01:12:53.431 --> 01:12:57.060
sort of things.
Um,
but I realized that those things were missing.

1162
01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.900
One thing that religion really did well,
which was the kind of the group bit,

1163
01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.430
the institutional bet,
the embedding in daily life bit.

1164
01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:10.470
And I thought,
couldn't we do some of that now?

1165
01:13:10.471 --> 01:13:14.190
And I also look backwards to ancient Greece and I realized that philosophers,

1166
01:13:14.191 --> 01:13:15.690
many of them,
it started up schools.

1167
01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.530
Epicurus it started a school called the garden.
The stoics have,
you know,

1168
01:13:19.531 --> 01:13:23.900
the stower Plato,
uh,
had,
uh,
the,
the,
um,
uh,

1169
01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.320
at his school,
the academy,
et Cetera.
And um,

1170
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:30.000
it's not that I wanted to directly imitate that,
but I thought,

1171
01:13:30.001 --> 01:13:33.960
how interesting that these were people who thought you,

1172
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.570
it isn't enough just to be you.
And a book.
Anyway,

1173
01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.390
many of these sorts of contributed to my beginning,

1174
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:44.160
this thing that I called the school of life and it's been the focus of a lot of

1175
01:13:44.161 --> 01:13:48.720
my energy in the last four years.
Um,
it's give you just a sense of it.

1176
01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:53.100
This thing has its HQ in London,
but we now have 10 branches around the world,

1177
01:13:53.101 --> 01:13:55.950
including in Australia and the far east and Europe,
et Cetera.

1178
01:13:56.490 --> 01:14:00.600
I'm not in the United States yet,
but what we do is,
um,
we don't,

1179
01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:03.940
we don't care about that.
No,
we just want a big,

1180
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.790
bigger cars cause you can't so much.

1181
01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:08.990
But know I can explain why we're not in the United States.
Cause I did,

1182
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.610
I tell you,
I love,
love to be one day,
but we're not.
Anyway,
we um,
uh,

1183
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:16.890
we run classes,
we publish books,
we put on a fence,
uh,

1184
01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:21.660
we run a youtube channel.
Uh,
we do all sorts of things and um,

1185
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.870
and it's just,
you have some great,
great videos on these.
I highly recommend it.

1186
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.320
Thank you.
And you know,
really what will,

1187
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.360
what we're trying to do is to take a lot of the stuff that I care about but,

1188
01:14:30.361 --> 01:14:34.720
but try and find other channels stanwich to distributed,
I mean,

1189
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:37.170
your career more than anyone shows you know,

1190
01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:41.410
how that can be done and that is done.
And so I felt a kind of restlessness,

1191
01:14:41.411 --> 01:14:44.890
which perhaps you felt as well as at a certain point about,
you know,

1192
01:14:44.891 --> 01:14:48.070
what it means to be a writer and,
um,

1193
01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.680
and it's perhaps an intersection of writing and business for me and,
and,
uh,

1194
01:14:52.930 --> 01:14:56.530
learning how to create a business out of something that might previously have

1195
01:14:56.531 --> 01:15:01.090
just been seen as a kind of romantic inspiration of the kind of lone artist.
Um,

1196
01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.100
and all of that's been very interesting.
And,
and you know,

1197
01:15:03.101 --> 01:15:05.530
you ask about the goals in the next few years.

1198
01:15:05.531 --> 01:15:10.531
I really hope to continue to make a contribution there and to make school of

1199
01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:17.131
life as good as it can be for us to touch as many lives as we can in as diverse

1200
01:15:17.721 --> 01:15:20.760
away as we can,
um,
to,

1201
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:25.210
to invite more and more people into this kind of little whom we built.

1202
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:31.840
<v 3>And,
uh,
that was started in 2008.
Just that,
right?</v>

1203
01:15:31.841 --> 01:15:36.730
Or was it 2008?
Yes,
yes.
That's,
that is around the time 2008,

1204
01:15:36.731 --> 01:15:39.430
2009,
uh,
after,

1205
01:15:39.431 --> 01:15:44.431
I think partially instigated by the cultural,

1206
01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.630
uh,
well I shouldn't say cultural existential and financial insecurity caused by

1207
01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:50.740
the,
uh,

1208
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:55.930
mortgage backed securities crisis of that time.

1209
01:15:56.290 --> 01:16:01.060
But I developed a quite a high degree of restlessness about being an author,

1210
01:16:01.061 --> 01:16:06.061
which led to starting the angel investing and looking at startups as a way to,

1211
01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:10.810
um,
using as a means of leverage.

1212
01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.840
So using startups as an Archimedes lever of sorts to translate some of these

1213
01:16:16.481 --> 01:16:21.130
concepts into the real world in a way that could scale at a very high level.

1214
01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:21.580
Uh,

1215
01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:26.260
but let me ask you a slightly more personal question.

1216
01:16:26.261 --> 01:16:28.720
So what's,
for instance,

1217
01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:34.320
bad habits are you working to overcome at the moment where I hope to work on?

1218
01:16:34.721 --> 01:16:36.670
Let them,
let's look at the present day.

1219
01:16:36.671 --> 01:16:41.140
I have a million of my own that I usually overshare in Facebook Q and A's and

1220
01:16:41.141 --> 01:16:44.440
things like that,
especially if wine is involved.
But uh,
what,

1221
01:16:44.441 --> 01:16:46.720
what bad habits are you currently working on?

1222
01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:51.490
<v 4>Um,
look,
it's a very classic one that,
that you know,
so many people,</v>

1223
01:16:51.491 --> 01:16:55.480
so many of us are guilty of which is not properly communicating.

1224
01:16:55.510 --> 01:17:00.510
And what I mean by properly is not properly teaching others about myself,

1225
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:06.070
what I'm feeling,
what I would like,
what bothers me.

1226
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:08.380
And instead of properly communicating,

1227
01:17:08.381 --> 01:17:13.381
merely acting out and symbolizing things and expecting to be understood.

1228
01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:18.470
And this is a constant effort really to,
um,

1229
01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:22.610
to not imagine that those around me should mind read.

1230
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:26.090
They can't know what I feel unless I tell them.

1231
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:31.300
And also they won't hear me unless I speak in a certain way.

1232
01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:36.950
Um,
if I'm agitated and get annoyed quickly,

1233
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:40.220
that immediately shuts off communication.
If I blame them,

1234
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:41.660
that shuts off communication.

1235
01:17:41.661 --> 01:17:46.661
They will not hear if I humiliate anyone that that message will get lost.

1236
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:50.120
So if you're trying to get something across in a resist,

1237
01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:53.510
all those bad habits that we all have around communication,

1238
01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:57.830
I think it's trying to learn how to be a better teacher and a better student.

1239
01:17:58.170 --> 01:18:00.560
You know,
teaching has these sort of weird connotations.

1240
01:18:00.561 --> 01:18:04.340
You think of like some guy teaching history in a high school or something of

1241
01:18:04.341 --> 01:18:07.430
that.
But in order to have a good life,

1242
01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:11.450
all of us need to learn how to be good teachers and good students of one
another.

1243
01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:15.410
Because every day creates moments when we need to teach something,

1244
01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:19.790
we need to give somebody a lesson.
It may be in,
you know,

1245
01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:24.020
what time we're going to be home tonight or how we're feeling about,
um,
you know,

1246
01:18:24.021 --> 01:18:26.030
some events on the horizon or whatever it is.

1247
01:18:26.031 --> 01:18:27.950
But we're going to need to get something across.

1248
01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.400
And that requires kind of rules and disciplines and just simply blurting it out

1249
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:38.300
simply kind of exploding in some way or emoting in some way is normally the

1250
01:18:38.301 --> 01:18:41.900
worst way.
And at the same time we have to learn to become students,

1251
01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.810
which is to listen properly,
to interpret.

1252
01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.470
It may be somebody who's making a bit of a mess of trying to tell you something,

1253
01:18:48.471 --> 01:18:52.910
but try and listen to what they might be telling you beneath the surface.

1254
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:57.860
I've got relatively small kids.
They very often don't tell you what they feel.

1255
01:18:58.010 --> 01:19:00.770
They can't tell you directly what they feel.

1256
01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:05.710
You have to do some guesswork and a lot of what you have to deduce the juice.

1257
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:09.800
But I think,
I think you have to deduce from everybody's,
uh,
say and you know,

1258
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:13.790
very few of us learn on the spot.
You know,
if,

1259
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:18.530
if somebody told me or told you a big central truth about you,
you know,

1260
01:19:18.531 --> 01:19:22.350
the thing about you,
he is the editor.
Or the thing about you,
us is that data.

1261
01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:26.930
If that was said even just vaguely,
brutally,
or,

1262
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:30.890
or just even with the little whatever,
we would shut down.
We get defensive.
We go,

1263
01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:33.950
no,
that's not true.
How do you know?
What are you trying to do?
Et cetera.

1264
01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:38.990
We shut down quickly.
We don't absorb that information.
And we should,

1265
01:19:38.991 --> 01:19:40.610
we should try and get less defensive.

1266
01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:44.330
And at the same time when we're in the kind of giving feedback role,

1267
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.310
we should really think carefully.

1268
01:19:46.311 --> 01:19:49.740
So I think this whole business of listening and feedback is a,

1269
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:53.300
is a key issue that I'm,
I'm,
I'm always trying to work on,

1270
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:56.930
I'm trying to do the same thing.
And that was,

1271
01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:01.300
that was my newly adopted puppy off to try to make his feelings known,

1272
01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:05.170
to dry,
to trying to communicate a,

1273
01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.100
I've taught her to kick the bells on the door.
But aside from

1274
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.400
<v 3>that,
I'm so far failing it at speaking dog,
but the,
uh,</v>

1275
01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:14.740
I'm trying to do the same thing.
And I think that,
uh,

1276
01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:17.430
you mentioned the young children.
I think if you,
if you could,

1277
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:22.950
you can recognize that if you,
uh,
if you were to keep someone from having lunch,

1278
01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:27.930
keep anyone from having lunch for three or four hours and uh,
give them,
uh,

1279
01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:32.550
an argument with a spouse or loved one,
our coworker 60 minutes earlier,

1280
01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:37.770
that their emotional state will probably be closer to your children than

1281
01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:38.693
anything else.

1282
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:44.460
And if you assume that when you read their email as opposed to a reading

1283
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.390
malicious intent?
I was always,
uh,
I shouldn't say always.

1284
01:20:48.391 --> 01:20:51.240
I was told quite some time ago something that I've,

1285
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:55.830
I've enjoyed trying to remind myself up so I don't respond in kind so I don't

1286
01:20:55.831 --> 01:20:59.400
volley back something nasty with something nasty that uh,

1287
01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:04.710
don't attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence.
Nice.

1288
01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:07.320
And a close,
a close cousin of that,

1289
01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:09.960
which I've had to add to it is don't attribute to malice what you can attribute

1290
01:21:09.961 --> 01:21:11.640
to in competence or,

1291
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.260
<v 4>yes,
I often think someone wants to this to me and I,</v>

1292
01:21:16.261 --> 01:21:21.000
it's really stuck in my mind that when people seem like they are mean,

1293
01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.480
that almost never mean that anxious.
That's what,

1294
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:28.500
that's what inspires the behavior.
That's good.
Read as meanness.

1295
01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:30.870
But it very frequently is not meanness.

1296
01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:35.550
And these are very basic bits of psychology.
But you know,
I should say it again.

1297
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:36.151
The older I get,

1298
01:21:36.151 --> 01:21:39.780
the more I think we are relatively simple creatures just as you know,

1299
01:21:39.781 --> 01:21:44.100
to nourish us physically.
We need basic things,
some breads or you know,

1300
01:21:44.101 --> 01:21:47.160
an all level to some water.
And off we go.

1301
01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:51.050
So when it comes to our kind of inner psyches,
um,

1302
01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:55.860
many of the things that we need have an almost breathtaking simplicity.

1303
01:21:55.861 --> 01:22:00.090
It is things like the person is mean not worthy,
almost mantras.

1304
01:22:00.091 --> 01:22:02.400
They are simple things.

1305
01:22:02.401 --> 01:22:05.190
And I think we are so highly educated.

1306
01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:10.240
We overeducate ourselves out of connection with these simple truths.

1307
01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:15.090
Um,
and they are so key.
And this is something you mentioned Buddhism,

1308
01:22:15.091 --> 01:22:19.590
this is something the Zen Buddhists are very keen on is Zen Buddhist philosophy.

1309
01:22:19.591 --> 01:22:22.500
And poetry is often unbelievably simple.

1310
01:22:22.670 --> 01:22:27.060
[inaudible] you ear rather than seeing that as an argument against it.

1311
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:32.430
Um,
you know,
the great masters will ponder a sentence,
turn it over,

1312
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:36.450
write it down in ever more,
you know,
beautiful,
refined,

1313
01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:40.320
but simple ways on a piece of paper,
et Cetera.
And,
and I think that we've got,

1314
01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:43.980
unfortunately,
because of science and the Glamor of science,

1315
01:22:43.981 --> 01:22:47.910
this addiction to the idea that the most valuable things must be very

1316
01:22:47.911 --> 01:22:52.911
complicated and constantly new rather than perhaps very simple and repetitions

1317
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:55.470
of some basic,
quite old truths.

1318
01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.450
And it's just what I think we're mixing up a,

1319
01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:03.120
a kind of source of wisdom in one area,
which is,
you know,
flying rockets with,

1320
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:06.670
uh,
a source of wisdom in and other is like how to get through your day.

1321
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:10.540
And we're,
we've misinterpreting what we need for both realms.

1322
01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:14.830
We're thinking we need to kind of scientific version in personal life where

1323
01:23:14.831 --> 01:23:18.790
actually it's really super unhelpful.
Yeah.

1324
01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:20.440
I think also we tend to,

1325
01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:25.610
as a higher primates with big prefrontal cortex is,

1326
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:30.670
uh,
cortices.
I have no idea.
In any case,
we want to,

1327
01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:32.830
uh,
if we're having a bad day,

1328
01:23:32.831 --> 01:23:36.160
we look at these big existential questions as opposed to,

1329
01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:39.590
did I have five alos or should I have $5?

1330
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:43.020
Maybe my blood sugar is just low or just right.
I mean,
I,
you know,

1331
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:46.450
I love that it wasn't it Clinton who said that,
uh,
you know,

1332
01:23:46.451 --> 01:23:50.530
before when dealing with anyone who upset,
he always asks,
has this person slept?

1333
01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.800
Have they eaten?
You know,
it's somebody else bugging them.

1334
01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:57.850
He goes through this kind of simple checklists.
But we are,
you know,

1335
01:23:57.851 --> 01:24:01.870
we know so much when we're handling babies and the baby is kicking and crying.

1336
01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.260
We almost never,
one never does one say,
you know,

1337
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:10.450
that babies out to get me or you know,
she's got evil intentions.
We go,
you know,

1338
01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.610
she's probably tired or he's,
you know,

1339
01:24:12.611 --> 01:24:16.630
he hasn't had enough sleep or maybe it's too tight around his collar or
whatever.

1340
01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.460
We look for pretty benevolent,

1341
01:24:18.490 --> 01:24:22.870
often pretty basic explanations when once we reach adulthood,

1342
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:24.370
we almost never,
I mean,

1343
01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.670
when have we been in a situation with an angry person who's,
you know,
whatever,

1344
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:33.550
we always look at it at the intellectual level.
We very rarely go,
wow,

1345
01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:37.520
this is probably someone who's really pretty tired or,
you know,
it's uh,
you know,

1346
01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:39.340
it's one o'clock and they've not had anything to eat.

1347
01:24:39.370 --> 01:24:43.060
So that's where the explanation of it,
it offends ourself knowledge.

1348
01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:46.870
It offends or a sense of dignity,
but it really shouldn't.

1349
01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.450
And as you say,
we are a,
you know,

1350
01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:54.250
an amazing computer sitting on some very,
very basic bits of,
of,

1351
01:24:54.370 --> 01:24:59.370
of software and not to accept how basic we are is its own version of kind of

1352
01:24:59.651 --> 01:25:04.450
pretension and,
and,
and we should resist it.
And self sabotage.

1353
01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.790
Uh,
for sure.
Uh,

1354
01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:12.330
I would love to shift gears a little bit and a lob some rapid fire questions

1355
01:25:13.001 --> 01:25:15.700
your way.
The answers don't need to be rapid,
but,
uh,

1356
01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:17.890
when you think of the word successful,

1357
01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:20.410
who is the first person who comes to mind and why?

1358
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:25.270
I didn't want it,
but,
um,

1359
01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:28.660
but unfortunately the Steve jobs came to mind and I'm really annoyed about that

1360
01:25:28.661 --> 01:25:33.430
because I don't actually see,
see him as,
as the quintessence of,
of success.

1361
01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:34.563
Um,
look,

1362
01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:39.570
I think a successful person is somebody who has taken hold and fathoms that

1363
01:25:42.431 --> 01:25:47.210
talent made the most out of those talents and reconcile themselves to their

1364
01:25:47.211 --> 01:25:51.250
weaknesses.
They're not ranting and raving about their weaknesses.

1365
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:53.320
They have a sense of what those weaknesses are.

1366
01:25:53.321 --> 01:25:55.870
They're not blaming the world for them.
They know them,

1367
01:25:55.871 --> 01:25:58.540
they own them at the same time.
Uh,
they,

1368
01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:02.770
they've had a sense of their strengths and they've been able to make something

1369
01:26:02.771 --> 01:26:05.330
off those strengths and maybe that things relatively modest,

1370
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:08.960
but they've still managed to externalize those strengths.

1371
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:11.570
That's asking a lot that is a successful life.

1372
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:16.640
Very few of us are lucky enough to get there.
Um,

1373
01:26:17.150 --> 01:26:18.680
but I think that's what it might be.

1374
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:24.150
<v 3>Who,
who would be a someone not Steve Jobs,</v>

1375
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:28.500
who certainly was Brenda ranting and raving and I'm not sure how aware he was of

1376
01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:33.630
any of his weaknesses,
but uh,
who,
who would be an exemplar of that for you?

1377
01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:35.750
<v 4>It's funny,
I've,
I've,
I was recently in,</v>

1378
01:26:35.751 --> 01:26:40.740
in Switzerland where I come from and when I was little I was partly brought up

1379
01:26:40.741 --> 01:26:45.741
by my parents but also pop also partly brought up by very kindly lady who lived

1380
01:26:46.381 --> 01:26:48.960
with us in the,
in the family.
She was helping the family.
It's a trend.

1381
01:26:48.961 --> 01:26:52.410
She was almost like a second mother to me and she's now 83 years old.

1382
01:26:52.411 --> 01:26:55.230
And lives in an isolated Swiss village.

1383
01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:58.800
She's in amazing health for her age.

1384
01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:03.960
And she is a true saint in,
she's not religious.

1385
01:27:03.961 --> 01:27:04.710
But you know,

1386
01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:08.790
if you wanted to offer somebody up to science as somebody who is well balanced,

1387
01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:12.890
you weren't read about or in the newspaper,
you won't,
you know,
sea bass,
cetera.

1388
01:27:13.050 --> 01:27:16.680
But you actually sit in her kitchen and you talk about politics with her.

1389
01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:19.620
You talk about child raising,
you talk about the meaning of life.

1390
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:23.850
This is a person with an inherent ballast who's no nonsense,

1391
01:27:23.970 --> 01:27:27.570
who knows how to be kind,
who knows how to laugh,
who knows.
It's such a,

1392
01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:31.620
and you know,
the world is full of such people,

1393
01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:35.550
people who represent what you might call an ordinary genius,

1394
01:27:35.610 --> 01:27:39.210
an ordinary genius or the business of living like that.
And,
and we,
we,

1395
01:27:39.211 --> 01:27:44.020
we walk past these people because they don't star in any of our,
you know,
uh,

1396
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:47.970
calendars I had to go so far as to say that perhaps a few more of them are women

1397
01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:52.800
than men.
Um,
and,
uh,
they are utterly unheralded.

1398
01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:56.080
Uh,
but,
but they are out there and they are the true philosophers.

1399
01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:57.811
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1400
01:27:57.811 --> 01:28:01.500
I guess that can be contrasted with the extra ordinary hubris that we seem to

1401
01:28:01.501 --> 01:28:04.090
worship.
Uh,
oftentimes sensory.

1402
01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:06.710
<v 4>That's right.
I mean that,
that,
that's why I was kicking myself when,
you know,</v>

1403
01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:12.210
the very word successes become contaminated by our ideas off someone

1404
01:28:12.211 --> 01:28:16.560
extraordinary,
very rich cetera.
And,
um,
and that's really unhelpful,

1405
01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:20.730
that ultimately to be properly successful is,
you know,

1406
01:28:20.731 --> 01:28:22.620
to be at peace as well.
You know,

1407
01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:26.940
I've seen too many people who were circled successful who are not at peace and,

1408
01:28:26.941 --> 01:28:28.980
um,
you know,
that's a problem.

1409
01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.180
<v 3>Well then,
and not to be too cliched about it,</v>

1410
01:28:32.181 --> 01:28:36.750
but I think that it's easy to define success as a,

1411
01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:39.950
is getting what you want.

1412
01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:44.210
But for those people you mentioned with that internal ballast,

1413
01:28:44.211 --> 01:28:47.720
that ordinary genius,
they also want what they have.
Right.

1414
01:28:47.721 --> 01:28:49.100
They appreciate what they have,

1415
01:28:49.101 --> 01:28:54.101
which I think is a not nearly as taught or studied as the achieving of what we

1416
01:28:57.261 --> 01:28:58.094
want.

1417
01:28:58.130 --> 01:29:01.560
<v 4>Absolutely.
And I,
you know,
you say taught,
I mean,
we need reminders of this.</v>

1418
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.610
That's,
you know,
we're otherwise people go,
oh yeah,
you know,

1419
01:29:05.611 --> 01:29:08.160
when you tell someone that they go,
Oh yeah,
that's office.
I knew that.
And you go,

1420
01:29:08.161 --> 01:29:08.341
yeah,

1421
01:29:08.341 --> 01:29:13.341
but is it alive is such a difference between an idea being in theory in your

1422
01:29:13.471 --> 01:29:15.750
brain and alive in your brain.

1423
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:20.400
And those kinds of ideas about appreciating everyday such are generally not

1424
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:24.330
alive in our brains.
And that's a problem of art really.

1425
01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:28.590
They're not artistically alive.
And,
um,
that's something to bear in mind.

1426
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:34.880
<v 3>What is the book that you've given most as a gift aside from your own?</v>

1427
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:38.540
<v 4>Well,
there was a stage,
um,</v>

1428
01:29:38.630 --> 01:29:42.570
before I got married and when I was on the dating scene,
um,

1429
01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:45.020
when I gave a lot of copies,
this was the 90s,

1430
01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.380
I gave a lot of copies of Milan Kundera to people.
It,

1431
01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:51.420
it suggested the unbearable lightness of being was a,

1432
01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:55.400
a book that I gave out a lot.
Um,
I don't know if I still would,

1433
01:29:55.580 --> 01:30:00.110
but I do admire this check writer very much and um,

1434
01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.540
and,
and,
and it has all kinds of wisdom and um,

1435
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:06.740
and it's beautifully written and impactful as well.

1436
01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:11.180
I've given quite a lot of copies of Martine's essays to people down the years.

1437
01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:14.090
Um,
and um,

1438
01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:18.580
I've not given Proust cause it's a little heavy.
Um,
but yes,
that,

1439
01:30:18.581 --> 01:30:19.414
that kind of thing.

1440
01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:24.970
<v 3>Thank you.
And for those people,
we're,
his name has come up a bit,
uh,
or,</v>

1441
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:28.800
or several times in this conversation Montaine there's a,

1442
01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:30.770
there's a post by Ryan holiday,

1443
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:33.540
then introduction to Monte [inaudible] on the blog.

1444
01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:38.130
For those of you want to check it out@fourhourworkweek.com and I'm sure that

1445
01:30:38.131 --> 01:30:40.260
will be linked to in the show notes as well as everything that we've talked

1446
01:30:40.261 --> 01:30:44.490
about so far.
What is something you believe that other people think is insane

1447
01:30:46.170 --> 01:30:48.210
or many other people?
Doesn't have to be everyone,

1448
01:30:48.211 --> 01:30:51.390
but what is something you think that most other people think?

1449
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:56.400
<v 4>Yeah,
I believe in the nanny state.
We live in a very,
you have to,</v>

1450
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:59.110
you have that expression in the states,
right?
The nanny state?
Yes.
Yes.

1451
01:30:59.270 --> 01:31:01.580
So I believe in the nanny state.
Um,

1452
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:04.750
I'm not coming at it from the left or the right.
It's almost,
you know,

1453
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:09.210
irrespective of that.
But I believe in essentially in a public sphere,

1454
01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.710
which should offer guidance.

1455
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:15.330
I think the idea of the neutral public sphere where,

1456
01:31:15.331 --> 01:31:20.310
for example,
um,
it's just completely left to the market to decide,

1457
01:31:20.610 --> 01:31:24.140
you know,
and if you've got the money,
you buy an advertisement,
you know,
if,

1458
01:31:24.141 --> 01:31:28.230
if you,
if you want to pay for a billboard,
pay for a billboard,
et Cetera.
Um,

1459
01:31:28.890 --> 01:31:32.460
and I think that,
you know,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

1460
01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.910
I'm interested in the way that we went from religious societies,

1461
01:31:35.911 --> 01:31:40.440
which guided people towards important truths to assist to societies that have

1462
01:31:40.441 --> 01:31:44.490
just left everyone completely alone.
So in my utopia,
um,

1463
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:47.250
there would be a lot more guidance.
Um,
I,

1464
01:31:47.251 --> 01:31:52.180
I am a believer in because I've needed so much guidance.
Um,

1465
01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:56.880
I would,
I would be really,
I would pay real attention to what's on the airwaves,

1466
01:31:56.970 --> 01:32:01.690
for example.
Um,
in UK at the moment where I'm based,
um,

1467
01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:05.350
the government is thinking hard about what it should do with it's gigantic

1468
01:32:05.351 --> 01:32:09.040
television station,
the BBC,
that it gives millions,
in fact,

1469
01:32:09.041 --> 01:32:13.780
billions of pounds to every year.
And it's wondering what it should do with it.

1470
01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:18.580
And the argument seems to be,
seems to be quite a sterile one,

1471
01:32:18.581 --> 01:32:23.320
but my view should be on the national broadcaster,

1472
01:32:23.650 --> 01:32:28.650
should be programs that systematically address all the largest failings and

1473
01:32:29.951 --> 01:32:31.180
dilemmas of the nation,

1474
01:32:31.630 --> 01:32:35.680
including for the failures of pet around parenting,

1475
01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:40.540
around a family,
breakdowns,
around violence,
around anxiety,

1476
01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:43.180
around a loneliness,
et cetera.

1477
01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:48.660
We know government statistician's know what the problems are in,

1478
01:32:50.210 --> 01:32:53.380
you know,
large populations,
but we,

1479
01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:58.410
they refuse the tools that they have like say the BBC and the idea is we'll,

1480
01:33:00.011 --> 01:33:04.390
no one should tell anyone how to live as such a fear of fascism,

1481
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:09.640
communism.
Um,
and I can't help thinking that we have made a bogey man here,

1482
01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.980
that that isn't really the threat.

1483
01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:17.760
The real threat is that we are drowning in chaotic noise and unable to find a

1484
01:33:19.031 --> 01:33:23.350
kind of balance.
Um,
and I think that,

1485
01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.750
um,
you know,

1486
01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:29.740
I'd be up for a little bit more vigilant about that and a little bit more

1487
01:33:29.741 --> 01:33:31.060
nannying of the best kind.

1488
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:34.030
So that's the kind of thing that I'm very careful not to tell you.

1489
01:33:34.031 --> 01:33:37.210
I don't know why I've told you and your millions of listeners now,
but,
but,
but I,

1490
01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:39.610
you know,
I,
I'm aware,
you know,
cause I,

1491
01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:41.680
I use youtube a lot and I'm aware that if you,

1492
01:33:41.710 --> 01:33:46.710
if you put anything out there that says even anything like that and unbelievable

1493
01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:51.010
turn of messages come through along the lines of you're a communist or you're a

1494
01:33:51.011 --> 01:33:53.290
fascist or um,

1495
01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.440
you're trying to infantilize me or blah blah,
blah.

1496
01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.840
And my view was always hang on a minute,
you know,

1497
01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:01.180
we're all adults and when you know you're an adult,

1498
01:34:01.181 --> 01:34:04.990
you can also admit that actually seeking help,

1499
01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:09.250
therapeutic help in a broader sense is part of adult life.

1500
01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:12.190
That saying,
you know,
no one teaches me anything.

1501
01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:15.290
I'm just my own person totally.
Uh,

1502
01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:20.200
is a kind of slightly brittle version of maturity.

1503
01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:25.090
And I'm interested in a more dependent relationship on others where we can seek

1504
01:34:25.091 --> 01:34:28.690
help where we're not offended if someone offers help to us because we can turn

1505
01:34:28.691 --> 01:34:31.780
it away.
But we're not offended by the offer of help.

1506
01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:34.900
And so these are some of the things that I think about late at night.

1507
01:34:34.901 --> 01:34:36.490
And it would offend and frighten everybody.

1508
01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:42.250
<v 3>So a couple of,
a couple of thoughts.
The first is,
uh,</v>

1509
01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.280
on the art of asking,
I think Amanda Palmer,

1510
01:34:45.281 --> 01:34:48.490
the musician has a lot of interesting things to say that,
uh,

1511
01:34:48.610 --> 01:34:52.880
people could benefit from,
from checking out.
The second is on the,
uh,

1512
01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:57.710
being called a fascist.
I think that Youtube,
I love,
God bless it,

1513
01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:02.740
but if you scroll to page four or five of comments,

1514
01:35:02.781 --> 01:35:05.900
I think on any video,
even if it's kitten playing the piano,

1515
01:35:05.901 --> 01:35:10.730
you're going to have Hitler and fascism in there somewhere.
Uh,
the,
the,
uh,

1516
01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:15.650
then the third piece I would say is in terms of this,

1517
01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:16.130
the,

1518
01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:21.130
the state or the government offering guidance or maybe even differing positions

1519
01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:27.080
on some of these bigger moral questions in life questions,

1520
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:31.700
I think that there might be a forcing function and that forcing function,

1521
01:35:32.010 --> 01:35:32.843
uh,

1522
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:37.580
could be artificial intelligence and things like autonomous cars.

1523
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:39.290
I think technology,
oddly enough,

1524
01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:44.320
the most cutting edge technology is going to drive a reversion in some ways or

1525
01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:50.080
return to some of the oldest philosophical quandaries and thought experiments,

1526
01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.850
uh,
that,
that we have that we,

1527
01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:56.180
that we visit and say a freshmen seminar.

1528
01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.640
And to think of as irrelevant like a,
you know,

1529
01:35:58.641 --> 01:36:02.540
the trolley scenario or the fat man blocking the cave with four people inside

1530
01:36:02.541 --> 01:36:06.800
who are going to starve.
But when you translate that to modern day,

1531
01:36:06.801 --> 01:36:11.360
I mean even right now there are tech companies hiring,
uh,

1532
01:36:11.361 --> 01:36:14.770
what they might consider utilitarian philosophers like the,
um,

1533
01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.260
along the lines of Saint Peter Singer,
uh,

1534
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:20.900
to advise them on some of these questions.
For instance,

1535
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:26.710
if you have to program a car that is going to make decisions in a disaster

1536
01:36:29.481 --> 01:36:32.540
scenarios like,
uh,
there's,

1537
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:36.020
there is something in the middle of the road I have to swerve.

1538
01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:41.380
Do I choose to hit the six old ladies on the right hand side or the to school

1539
01:36:41.831 --> 01:36:44.990
children on the left side?
How do you make that calculus?

1540
01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:50.280
And so I think that in in some ways technology might force the states,

1541
01:36:50.610 --> 01:36:51.250
uh,
or,

1542
01:36:51.250 --> 01:36:55.790
or governments of various types to take a more active role in this type of,
yeah,

1543
01:36:55.791 --> 01:36:56.100
I

1544
01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:58.730
<v 4>say should because I think that's absolutely right and fascinating.</v>

1545
01:36:58.731 --> 01:37:02.690
And I too have been very interested in,
in artificial intelligence of late,

1546
01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:04.650
and I think that,
um,

1547
01:37:05.210 --> 01:37:10.210
what we're talking about is the broad recognition that we are not very good at

1548
01:37:10.761 --> 01:37:14.330
making decisions.
That our brains are extremely faulty and all sorts of ways.

1549
01:37:14.630 --> 01:37:18.740
At the same time we have this idea that no one should tell us how to live and

1550
01:37:18.741 --> 01:37:22.940
what can slightly break the log jam is big data,

1551
01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:26.960
scientific information.
So that in the Google of,
you know,

1552
01:37:26.961 --> 01:37:30.470
in 50 years time you will say,
you know,
who should I marry?

1553
01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:35.540
And the answers will really be quite accurate and personally attuned to you and

1554
01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:40.900
akin to having gone to psychotherapy for 10 years in their level of awareness

1555
01:37:41.001 --> 01:37:44.210
of,
you know,
the issues facing you.
Um,

1556
01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:48.560
so I think you're absolutely right that artificial intelligence will,

1557
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:53.900
um,
breakthrough many people's resistance to insights,
which currently,

1558
01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:57.940
because they're not based on science and hard data seem,

1559
01:37:58.370 --> 01:38:02.760
I just too vulnerable to being shot down by the,
by the kind of line of,
you know,

1560
01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:07.350
who are you to say it doesn't have any fact behind it.
Uh,
they may be right,

1561
01:38:07.351 --> 01:38:08.470
but because,
because we,

1562
01:38:08.471 --> 01:38:13.471
we live in a society that's quite obsessed by science and facts and won't accept

1563
01:38:14.821 --> 01:38:16.650
things unless they're backed up by facts and says,

1564
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:20.100
we may just need to wait a little until some of these more humanistic truths and

1565
01:38:20.101 --> 01:38:24.580
insights of got the backing that is required to,

1566
01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:26.910
to allow them to have sort of mass uptake.

1567
01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:32.600
<v 3>Oh,
agreed.
And I think that,
uh,
another,
uh,</v>

1568
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:36.770
another factor will,
will sort of drive together in confluence,

1569
01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:41.420
certainly with other things,
uh,
to AI or incorporating AI.

1570
01:38:41.810 --> 01:38:44.390
And that is virtual reality.
I just had a,

1571
01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:49.000
I was not a true believer until,
uh,

1572
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:50.300
less than a week ago.

1573
01:38:50.301 --> 01:38:54.740
I had a virtual reality demo that I can't go into too many details about because

1574
01:38:54.741 --> 01:38:59.270
it's not hugely public.
That completely blew my mind.
I mean,

1575
01:38:59.271 --> 01:39:04.271
the experience was so lifelike and so compelling that it made me wonder,

1576
01:39:07.330 --> 01:39:11.510
uh,
more than ever if we're in a Similac room of our own,
of some type,

1577
01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:15.470
but it will raise questions such as,
I mean,

1578
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:21.010
when you are in a three dimensional immersive photorealistic environment and

1579
01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:27.350
most certainly there will be a tactile components and so on all factory

1580
01:39:27.351 --> 01:39:28.091
components,
the,

1581
01:39:28.091 --> 01:39:33.091
those will come at some point when we'll gains the permitted for instance,

1582
01:39:35.541 --> 01:39:39.080
that rather than being relegated to a two d surface on the television,

1583
01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:43.880
allow you to kill someone,
blood bludgeon,
someone to death,
uh,

1584
01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:47.030
or I mean much worse,
right?
The,

1585
01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:50.630
are those going to be in any way regulated or are those going to be allowed,

1586
01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:50.901
you know,

1587
01:39:50.901 --> 01:39:55.901
and what effect does that have versus a more video game asking the traditional

1588
01:39:57.831 --> 01:40:02.450
sense experience,
right.
Said it's scary,
it's very terrifying,

1589
01:40:02.451 --> 01:40:06.770
but at the same time I think holds a lot of promise.
Um,
let me,

1590
01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:11.780
I'm completely abruptly transition to another short question,

1591
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:17.810
which is,
uh,
what is your favorite dot documentary or movie?
Well,
what are,

1592
01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:20.480
what are,
what are some of your favorite document?

1593
01:40:21.130 --> 01:40:22.660
<v 4>Well,
I very much enjoyed the documentary,</v>

1594
01:40:22.661 --> 01:40:27.230
which I don't know if you'll Nichols seven up,
which was done in the UK.
Um,

1595
01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:32.490
and what it did is it followed a group of children every seven years starting

1596
01:40:34.841 --> 01:40:38.610
from their seventh birthday.
And these children were,
um,

1597
01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:43.060
picked deliberately from wide variety of social backgrounds,

1598
01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.070
different kinds of families,
et cetera.

1599
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:50.430
And every seven years these kids were revisited and we traced their lives.

1600
01:40:51.461 --> 01:40:55.420
And of course know this is one of the things that art can do for us.

1601
01:40:55.450 --> 01:41:00.450
It kind of traces lives over time spans that we normally can't have access to.

1602
01:41:03.130 --> 01:41:04.390
So,
um,

1603
01:41:04.570 --> 01:41:09.570
now these people are in their 50s and they're still making the documentary.

1604
01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:14.920
Um,
and uh,
and it gets updated every seven years,
every seven years.

1605
01:41:14.921 --> 01:41:19.450
There's a new thing and it's a kind of,
it's a weird feature of British life,

1606
01:41:19.451 --> 01:41:21.910
like everyone knows [inaudible] sort of thing.
Uh,

1607
01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:24.040
and it just comes along every year,
every seven years.

1608
01:41:24.190 --> 01:41:28.870
And we know these people and their lives show such a variation,

1609
01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:32.200
ups and downs and sometimes,
you know,
sometimes things are going really well,

1610
01:41:32.201 --> 01:41:35.830
are the times getting terribly et cetera.
And again,

1611
01:41:35.850 --> 01:41:38.920
it's so much the art I like,
it's,

1612
01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:44.220
it's very much a tune to the every day it's concerned with broadly speaking with

1613
01:41:44.291 --> 01:41:49.291
wisdom and how we can live and very undramatic but quiet be so powerful.

1614
01:41:49.901 --> 01:41:53.440
It's for my money.
It's probably the best documentary that exists.

1615
01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:56.740
I've very much recommended.
Um,
so the house

1616
01:41:56.790 --> 01:42:00.680
<v 3>it comes to mind is a strong endorsement and I'll have to,
I will,
uh,</v>

1617
01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.850
I'm on a tear with doc,
so I'll have to check this out.
The,
uh,

1618
01:42:05.190 --> 01:42:10.190
what is a purchase of $100 or less that has positively impacted your life in the

1619
01:42:13.111 --> 01:42:14.070
last six months?

1620
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:17.900
<v 4>Um,
I've really discovered that pomegranate and the pop pop,</v>

1621
01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:21.780
it's just a weird thing.
I never even knew they existed.
Really.
I knew the word.

1622
01:42:21.781 --> 01:42:24.390
I just know what it was.
Anyway.
Uh,

1623
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:27.900
someone told me about pomegranates and that they could be really interesting

1624
01:42:27.901 --> 01:42:32.100
thing to eat and make part of one's diet.
And,
um,
it's,

1625
01:42:32.101 --> 01:42:36.540
it's a thing I now regularly have a,
they're not cheap.
Each one is,

1626
01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.900
it's a few pounds and,
um,
but the,
the delicious,

1627
01:42:39.901 --> 01:42:44.810
the weird and um,
you know,
you'd think,
wow,
you know,
it's,

1628
01:42:45.150 --> 01:42:48.750
it's great.
This kind of thing exists on this,
on this little blue dot.
Um,

1629
01:42:49.210 --> 01:42:52.290
this app,
this thing grows.
So that's,
that's brought me constant,

1630
01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:54.600
constant pleasure upon the life of pomegranates.

1631
01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:57.910
<v 3>How do you,
how do you consume your pelvic granites?</v>

1632
01:42:57.911 --> 01:43:00.930
What is your preferred sort of method and,
and,
uh,

1633
01:43:01.490 --> 01:43:03.010
time for politics

1634
01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:04.043
<v 4>them in half.</v>

1635
01:43:04.190 --> 01:43:08.600
And then while you've got your hand with your fingers slightly open over the

1636
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:11.210
pomegranate face,
down into the palm of your hand,

1637
01:43:11.450 --> 01:43:14.330
you then strike the primer granite hard with a wooden spoon,

1638
01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:18.720
which gets the seeds to shake out.
They go into a little bowl.
Um,

1639
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:24.080
that's a good trick.
Yeah.
You hit it a few times and now they fall.
And,
um,

1640
01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:27.260
and it's just a,
it makes a delicious kind of snack.
And,

1641
01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.310
and you feel good and you feel virtuous,
but it's,
it's nice as well.
Um,

1642
01:43:31.970 --> 01:43:36.710
so I really recommend that I'd,
I think all in my ideal nanny states,
um,

1643
01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:39.590
you know,
there would be pomegranates in every poll,

1644
01:43:39.591 --> 01:43:42.920
every pomegranate rat ranch and right.
They would,

1645
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:46.880
they would be forcibly on sale in every gas station across the United States.

1646
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:50.180
And I think,
I think genuinely the health,
but more importantly,

1647
01:43:50.181 --> 01:43:52.550
the happiness of would rise exponentially.

1648
01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:55.810
<v 3>I love it.
Uh,</v>

1649
01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:00.280
what I used to love eating grapefruits in the morning.

1650
01:44:00.281 --> 01:44:05.281
My grandmother used to use to use brown sugar on sort of precut grapefruits that

1651
01:44:06.701 --> 01:44:10.120
we could scoop out with special grapefruit spoons.
So that,
that,
that this is,

1652
01:44:10.150 --> 01:44:15.100
this is making me long DNA.
Uh,
what's,

1653
01:44:15.101 --> 01:44:19.540
um,
what rituals,
you mentioned rituals earlier,
what rituals are important,

1654
01:44:19.970 --> 01:44:23.500
uh,
for you on a daily basis.
Um,
my,

1655
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:27.370
the listeners often like evening,
I'm sorry,
morning routines,

1656
01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:28.840
but it doesn't have to be morning.
What,

1657
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:33.850
what rituals or routines do you find very valuable,

1658
01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.233
important?

1659
01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.290
<v 4>Well,
you know,</v>

1660
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:40.220
there was a lot of talk a few years ago and still now for meditation and

1661
01:44:40.221 --> 01:44:44.260
mindfulness and getting into a southern state.
And um,
and I,

1662
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:45.770
I thought a lot about this and I thought,

1663
01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:50.540
why is it that it's not quite working for me as it's defined,

1664
01:44:50.541 --> 01:44:55.541
but that there's something here that I really like and I realized that what I

1665
01:44:55.671 --> 01:44:57.080
love doing at the end of the day,

1666
01:44:57.081 --> 01:44:59.930
or the beginning of the day is to kind of download my brain,

1667
01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:05.210
is to just download those thoughts that are buzzing around slightly,

1668
01:45:05.211 --> 01:45:08.840
shapeless,
slightly directionless,
and they need a little help.

1669
01:45:09.110 --> 01:45:13.340
And if I don't get to grips with them,
they will disturb my sleep will,

1670
01:45:13.341 --> 01:45:14.510
they'll wake me up early.

1671
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:19.810
So what I like to do is just sit with a pad and paper and write down in very

1672
01:45:19.971 --> 01:45:23.270
small,
slightly scrolly,
illegible handwriting,
lots of things.

1673
01:45:23.271 --> 01:45:24.440
It could just be a word,

1674
01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:30.160
an image of something and they will be the starting points of things.

1675
01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:33.830
You know,
books have began out of one word that I'd sort of caught in my,

1676
01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:38.330
and it's a,
it's a kind of housekeeping,
it's a kind of intellectual housekeeping.

1677
01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.320
I'd like to call it a kind of philosophical meditation where you just,
yeah,

1678
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:47.210
you just turn over what's going on in your mind.
And I think insomnia,

1679
01:45:47.211 --> 01:45:50.960
I went through a stage of having insomnia and I think that insomnia is a kind of

1680
01:45:50.961 --> 01:45:51.794
revenge.

1681
01:45:52.190 --> 01:45:57.190
All the stuff that you haven't thought about enough that's demands to be thought

1682
01:45:57.201 --> 01:46:01.460
about.
And we'll wake you up in order that it gets it's Fascia of,

1683
01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:05.600
of thought.
And if you can do that before bed,
um,

1684
01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:10.160
with a pattern paper,
it can be,
you know,
the best,
uh,
uh,
you know,

1685
01:46:10.161 --> 01:46:11.840
sleeping pill you've,
you've ever had.

1686
01:46:13.010 --> 01:46:16.520
<v 3>Do you have a particular type of journal or pad that you'd like to,</v>

1687
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:21.770
<v 4>I'm unfussy,
I'm pretty unfussy about what I write on all kinds of,</v>

1688
01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:26.270
of pads.
Um,
I have a,
a wonderful Japanese pen call,

1689
01:46:26.271 --> 01:46:30.570
a pilot,
you know,
there's pilot pens and it's called a g tech c four.

1690
01:46:30.810 --> 01:46:34.560
And I write religiously only with those.
I'm also very,

1691
01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:39.680
I'm the last person on the planet to work with a blackberry and I write all

1692
01:46:40.321 --> 01:46:44.030
sorts of thoughts down on a blackberry.
Um,
uh,
and,

1693
01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:47.250
and that's very helpful too.
So those are my tools.

1694
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:50.100
<v 3>So you share the,
the</v>

1695
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:55.100
<v 4>sort of this digital blackberry in common with a friend of mine named Neil</v>

1696
01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:58.600
Strauss is written seven or eight times best sell on it.

1697
01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:00.780
It's an odd feeling.

1698
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:05.870
You feel very left out and there should be a support group started because it's

1699
01:47:06.451 --> 01:47:10.040
a,
it's a very isolated position to be in.
And one questions,
one,
so insanity.

1700
01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:13.470
Sometimes one thinks one we'll go over to the light side soon,

1701
01:47:13.471 --> 01:47:16.740
but one just can't do it.
And,
and yeah,
and we are,

1702
01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:21.060
uh,
if you could have just a few more questions,

1703
01:47:21.061 --> 01:47:25.680
if you could have one billboard anywhere with anything on it,
what would it say?

1704
01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:29.520
Um,
well I think it would,

1705
01:47:29.521 --> 01:47:34.521
it would probably pick up on the need to appreciate the need to be kind.

1706
01:47:35.490 --> 01:47:39.060
Um,
I mean it could be,
it could be something stock.
I mean,

1707
01:47:39.061 --> 01:47:42.890
it sums up what we were saying.
It could,
it could say you have only,
you know,

1708
01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:46.020
an average life is however,
how many,
how many hundred thousands of hours,

1709
01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:49.450
you know,
there's bigger,
oh,
I,
I,
you know,

1710
01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:51.170
I maybe if I were a better caffeinated,

1711
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:53.620
well what if he is that good life is okay.

1712
01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:58.820
It would say life is only 400,000 hours long be kind or something like that.

1713
01:47:59.010 --> 01:48:04.010
Just to grab the motorist as that speeding down the highway at insane speed up.

1714
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:08.070
I like it.

1715
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:12.390
And what advice would you give your 30 year old self?

1716
01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.360
Um,
calm down and [inaudible] where would you be at 30.

1717
01:48:18.361 --> 01:48:21.720
What uh,
what's the sort of surrounding context?
Um,

1718
01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:26.730
what was it or what should it be?
No,
no,
no.
Where were you,
where were,

1719
01:48:26.731 --> 01:48:29.390
where were you in,
I mean 30 was a,
it was a weird year.
Um,

1720
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:34.500
my father died when I was 30,
very surprisingly.
So I was suddenly in a,

1721
01:48:34.501 --> 01:48:37.650
in a kind of different,
different place and that was very shocking.

1722
01:48:37.651 --> 01:48:39.660
At the same time.
It was a very successful year.

1723
01:48:39.661 --> 01:48:44.640
Might my book the constellations for us,
we came out,
um,
I,
I met my wife,

1724
01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:48.990
my,
my,
she wasn't then my wife,
but I met the person who became my wife that year.

1725
01:48:49.230 --> 01:48:52.590
So it was a kind of,
um,
a year of many things.
I mean,
I think,

1726
01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:54.820
I think I would have also said,
you know,

1727
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:57.360
appreciate what's good about this moment.
Um,

1728
01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.630
don't always think that you're,
you know,

1729
01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:04.770
you're on a permanent journey in a stop and enjoy the view.
Um,

1730
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:06.690
this is life too.
I think it,

1731
01:49:07.110 --> 01:49:12.110
it took me a long time to kind of dare to appreciate the moment because I always

1732
01:49:12.571 --> 01:49:16.200
had this assumption that if you appreciate the moment you're weakening your

1733
01:49:16.201 --> 01:49:19.500
resolve to improve your circumstances,

1734
01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:24.840
that's not true.
But I think when you're young,
it's sort of associated with that.

1735
01:49:24.841 --> 01:49:28.180
And even I think,
I like flowers.
You see,
I had people around me,

1736
01:49:28.181 --> 01:49:30.480
he would say things like,
well,
isn't that flour nice?

1737
01:49:30.810 --> 01:49:33.690
And a little part of me was thinking,
you absolute loser.

1738
01:49:33.870 --> 01:49:38.340
You've taken time to appreciate a flower.
Do you not have bigger plans?
I mean,

1739
01:49:38.341 --> 01:49:42.180
is this,
is this the limit of your ambition?
Um,
and it's,
you know,

1740
01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:43.800
when life knocked you around a bit,

1741
01:49:43.801 --> 01:49:46.920
when you've seen a few things and it's time has happened and you've got some

1742
01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:50.200
under your belt,
you think you start to think more highly of,

1743
01:49:50.230 --> 01:49:54.070
of modest things like,
like flowers and pretty sky and well,

1744
01:49:54.071 --> 01:49:57.310
just a morning when nothing's gone wrong and everyone's been pretty nice to

1745
01:49:57.311 --> 01:49:59.800
everyone else and things are pretty nice and it's,
you know,

1746
01:49:59.801 --> 01:50:02.560
it's coming up to 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock and things,

1747
01:50:02.561 --> 01:50:05.920
things are going well and you think that's nice.
No one's died.
No one,

1748
01:50:05.921 --> 01:50:09.730
everyone's okay.
Um,
it makes you a little bit more modest.

1749
01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:14.260
And I didn't have that at all at 30 and I think it was a kind of,

1750
01:50:14.261 --> 01:50:17.230
when people talk about their young people being ungrateful,
you often go low.

1751
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:20.620
How do you mean that ungrateful?
It's not an,
it's not in gratitude.

1752
01:50:20.621 --> 01:50:25.450
It's anxiety again,
but,
but I wished that I could have reassured my,

1753
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:28.000
my anxious self and,
and,
and just said,
you know,

1754
01:50:28.001 --> 01:50:31.360
that there is time to look out of the window.
And,
and spotters flowers.

1755
01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:37.210
<v 3>That's great advice.
It's advice I need to take to heart.
Also.
I think I've,</v>

1756
01:50:37.211 --> 01:50:38.540
I've done better.
Uh,

1757
01:50:38.670 --> 01:50:41.410
it's funny you mentioned flowers because specifically when I go on walks,

1758
01:50:41.411 --> 01:50:42.340
I make a point,

1759
01:50:42.650 --> 01:50:46.870
says thanks to my girlfriend to stop and smell flowers,

1760
01:50:46.930 --> 01:50:50.250
whether it's with the dog or otherwise,
just as a brief pause.
But,
um,

1761
01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:54.350
I think that,
you know,
ambition can be a wonderful tool,

1762
01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:58.270
but it's a terrible master and it's also something that for the most part,

1763
01:50:58.271 --> 01:50:59.051
you cash in,

1764
01:50:59.051 --> 01:51:03.670
in the future and the future may not come as we know the exactly,

1765
01:51:03.671 --> 01:51:04.480
exactly.
It.

1766
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:09.480
And it reminds me of this story that a Neil Gaiman the writer tells,

1767
01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:13.660
I think it might've been in his commencement speech making good art,

1768
01:51:13.661 --> 01:51:18.160
which everyone should watch.
You just Google it.
But,
uh,
he said he,

1769
01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:23.190
he was reflecting on a signing books for Sandman,

1770
01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:24.671
which was his,

1771
01:51:24.671 --> 01:51:29.500
his first real huge hit and signing comic books in this case.

1772
01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:34.150
And,
uh,
Stephen King,
I believe it was said,
you know,

1773
01:51:34.151 --> 01:51:38.110
enjoy this moment.
And he did.
He was,
he was,

1774
01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:42.820
he was wrapped up in,
I can only imagine looking two years in the future,

1775
01:51:42.821 --> 01:51:44.740
three years in the future,
striking while the iron is hot,

1776
01:51:44.741 --> 01:51:47.370
whatever it might've been.
And I think that's something that,
uh,

1777
01:51:47.410 --> 01:51:50.650
that I need a constant reminder of.
Uh,
and the journaling,
as you mentioned,

1778
01:51:50.651 --> 01:51:51.520
I think also helps with

1779
01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:53.190
<v 4>if there's a funny thing,
my wife and I,</v>

1780
01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:57.780
she spotted that I kept talking about cancer and you know,

1781
01:51:57.781 --> 01:52:01.310
kept saying things like,
well,
I don't have cancer yet.
And you know,
I'm,

1782
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:03.300
if one day I get cancer,

1783
01:52:03.301 --> 01:52:07.890
and so when we now have this joke between us,
because this,

1784
01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:09.990
I kept putting it like this.
And so now she goes,

1785
01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:14.080
remember we're in the years before your bowel cancer.
And it's just,

1786
01:52:14.150 --> 01:52:17.640
that's just partly teasing me and she's kind of a,
but really what we're saying,

1787
01:52:17.641 --> 01:52:21.300
you know,
she goes,
remember it's before the bowel cancer.
Um,

1788
01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:24.240
and it's really a way of saying kind of my God,
you know,

1789
01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:28.260
things can get very miserable,
um,
very quickly.

1790
01:52:28.261 --> 01:52:32.490
It only takes a very few cells to sub divide in the wrong way.

1791
01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:36.900
And a lot of what seems important now,
we'll just no longer be.

1792
01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:41.970
And yeah,
we just have to keep that in mind all the time.
These today,

1793
01:52:41.971 --> 01:52:45.140
which seems so incomplete from so many ways and you know,

1794
01:52:45.141 --> 01:52:49.100
maybe frustrating and this and that way today may be the day that,
you know,

1795
01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:52.580
in a week you will look back on as paradise.
Um,

1796
01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:56.390
because we are so it could always get so much worse.

1797
01:52:56.391 --> 01:52:59.300
And I think partly it's having children as well.
You know,

1798
01:52:59.330 --> 01:53:01.490
we're very much at the mercy of fortune,
you know,

1799
01:53:01.491 --> 01:53:05.450
stoics talked a lot about fortune,
fortune can do anything with us.
You know,

1800
01:53:05.451 --> 01:53:07.160
we are very fragile creatures.

1801
01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:11.180
Yearning is a tap us or hit us in slightly the wrong place and we are done for,

1802
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:15.950
and the kind of levels of tragedy that can be,
you know,
all of us,
you only,

1803
01:53:15.951 --> 01:53:20.360
you'd have to push us a little bit and we crack very easily,
whether that's,

1804
01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:20.760
you know,

1805
01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:25.130
the pressure of disgrace or physical illness or financial pressure that it

1806
01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:28.340
doesn't take very much.
And,
um,
yeah.

1807
01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:32.720
So we do have to appreciate every day that goes by without a major disaster.

1808
01:53:34.610 --> 01:53:38.600
I think that's a great,
great place to wrap up.
Uh,
I love your work.

1809
01:53:38.630 --> 01:53:43.400
Where can people find out about what you're up to online,

1810
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:46.190
find you on social,
et Cetera?
How can they say hello?

1811
01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:49.160
What would you like them to check out of yours first,
Brian,

1812
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:52.490
if they're unfamiliar with your work?
Well,
they can come and see my website,

1813
01:53:52.491 --> 01:53:53.324
which is my name,

1814
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:57.200
[inaudible] dot com they can come and see me at [inaudible] on Twitter,

1815
01:53:57.230 --> 01:54:02.130
just at Orlando bottle.
Um,
I run a youtube channel via the school of life.

1816
01:54:02.131 --> 01:54:06.290
So come and check out the school of life@schooloflife.com and come and look at

1817
01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:09.920
some of the films that I make that I make.
I make three films a week,

1818
01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:13.370
so there's a lot of stuff out there.
I write a blog,

1819
01:54:13.371 --> 01:54:16.310
it's something called the book of life.org.
Um,

1820
01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:20.150
so you'll see a lot of my pieces on all sorts of things.
So take a look around.

1821
01:54:20.151 --> 01:54:22.370
There's quite a lot in the,
in the digital space.

1822
01:54:22.610 --> 01:54:23.840
And it's quite a lot that's free.

1823
01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:27.090
And if you want to buy a book while Amazon has them all and all the big,

1824
01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:31.490
big stores too.
So,
um,
yeah,
that's,
that's me.
And out there in the world.

1825
01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:37.480
If you could recommend a one video and one piece of writing of yours to start

1826
01:54:39.141 --> 01:54:42.300
with,
what would you suggest?
Um,

1827
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:45.740
well if we're talking about,
uh,
um,

1828
01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:50.480
we were talking a lot about Proust.
Um,
actually no,

1829
01:54:50.481 --> 01:54:51.500
now let me recommend something else.

1830
01:54:51.650 --> 01:54:54.320
There's a film on my youtube channel called higher consciousness.

1831
01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:57.230
Is there any discussion of this strange terms and has got about higher

1832
01:54:57.231 --> 01:54:59.930
consciousness?
What is it,
what does it mean to achieve higher consciousness?

1833
01:55:00.230 --> 01:55:04.910
So Punch into,
uh,
to,
um,
to the school of life,
Youtube Channel,

1834
01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:08.710
punch in higher consciousness and you'll get this film about,
I dunno,

1835
01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:12.110
how to look at the world in,
you know,
with a higher consciousness.

1836
01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:13.310
And then if you want to read something,

1837
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:17.480
go and check out how Proust can change your life.
Um,
I think it's still,

1838
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:21.390
it's a book that's still holds up after all these years and um,

1839
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:24.530
it's got a lot of things that I deeply believe in,
so,
so check that out.

1840
01:55:26.210 --> 01:55:29.990

Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1859
01:56:42.930 --> 01:56:45.960
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1860
01:56:45.961 --> 01:56:50.100
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

1861
01:56:50.101 --> 01:56:53.640
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1862
01:56:53.641 --> 01:56:57.990
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

1863
01:56:57.991 --> 01:56:59.310
pondering over the week.

1864
01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:02.280
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1865
01:57:02.281 --> 01:57:05.730
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1866
01:57:05.731 --> 01:57:10.080
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1867
01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:15.320
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1868
01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:18.720
close friends for instance.
And it's very short,

1869
01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:23.780
it's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1876
01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:50.760
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

1877
01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:54.460
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

1878
01:57:54.461 --> 01:57:58.420
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

1879
01:57:58.450 --> 01:57:59.261
the brainstorming.

1880
01:57:59.261 --> 01:58:02.590

1881
01:58:02.591 --> 01:58:06.790
works.

whatever it might be,

1883
01:58:09.610 --> 01:58:13.120

01:58:19.451 --> 01:58:20.110
money back.

1887
01:58:20.110 --> 01:58:23.890
It's that straightforward and many of you who are listening have already used it

1888
01:58:23.891 --> 01:58:26.350
and created some amazing things that I'll be sharing in the future,

1889
