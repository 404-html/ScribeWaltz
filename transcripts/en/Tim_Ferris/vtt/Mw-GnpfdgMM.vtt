1
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.220
Frank,
welcome to the show.
It's great to be here.
Thank you.

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.180
I am so thrilled to have you here to help me solve the riddles of life.

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.190
And I thought I would start with maybe some,

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.220
some common ground and it relates to a book called built to scratch so that the

5
00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:22.330
background personally speaking is that built a scratch along with a few other

6
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:23.164
books,

7
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.170
have traveled with me for more than 30 years now.

8
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.510
So they helped set me on my first entrepreneurial journey step and have traveled

9
00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:37.600
from house to house,
apartment to apartment,
country to country ever since.

10
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.330
And in the course of doing research,

11
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.860
I had read that when you became the CEO of Home Depot,

12
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:48.340
that you had read passages from built a scratch.
Right.

13
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.020
And I was curious if you recalled any of that,
why you chose to do that.

14
00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:55.210
If you could walk us through it,
that would be fantastic.

15
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.280
<v 1>First,
your research is great.
Absolutely right.
Uh,</v>

16
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.080
that's very exciting that the book is important to you.
Go here.

17
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.360
It's hugely important to me.
First,
the book is,
uh,

18
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.640
the story of Home Depot.

19
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.540
It was written by Bernie Marcus and Arthur blank and about Bernie and Arthur and

20
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.550
Ken Lang gone and they're finding of home depot.

21
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.060
It's one of the great entrepreneurial stories of our century,

22
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:27.641
of our times because Bernie and Arthur had been fired from their prior job,

23
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.060
can lank own,
said to them when they got five,

24
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:36.080
you just got hit by a golden horseshoe in the ass.
You're so lucky.

25
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.940
And then they went and established the home depot,
which was,
uh,

26
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.770
the most successful retail concept of its time,
fastest to 10 billion,

27
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:48.650
20 billion,
30 billion,
40 billion.
Uh,

28
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.770
my connection with the book is,

29
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.710
is it's very meaningful to me,

30
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:58.160
not only because it's the story of the founding of the home depot,

31
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.190
but also because of my start as the CEO of Home Depot.

32
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.880
Uh,

33
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.530
I did not have a background that would lead anyone to think that I'd ever be the

34
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:11.900
CEO of the Home Depot.
In fact,

35
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:14.960
when the board called me and said,

36
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.830
we want you to be the CEO,
I said,

37
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.440
you ought to take a day and think about this because I have,

38
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.860
while I had been at home depot for a few years,

39
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.070
I had not been really doing a lot of the retail work.

40
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:31.460
I've been doing m and a activity in real estate and that kind of thing and I

41
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:31.701
said,

42
00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:36.020
you ought to spend a day think about it and think about hiring a real retailer

43
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.190
and I need to think about it.
Obviously they called back at the end of the day,

44
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:44.180
they still offered me the job and I obviously took the job,

45
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.780
but I can honestly say that a nanosecond before the call,

46
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.690
I was not thinking I'm going to be the CEO of this company.

47
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.490
There were no moments of driving along and the darker night thinking,
oh,

48
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:00.520
what would I do if I were running this place?

49
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.580
I was completely unprepared.

50
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.240
And then like a lot of retailers,
you know,

51
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.180
we have a way of communicating to our associates at the time,

52
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:14.440
home depot at around 350,000 associates,
we have little,
uh,

53
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.650
TV that we beam in messages to the break rooms and I have to go and address the

54
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:23.930
350,000 associates.
Um,

55
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.020
being singularly unprepared at the time.
My,

56
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.820
my son,
uh,
Home Depot as a program of returning veterans,
uh,

57
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.110
giving them jobs in the store.
My son was an attorney returning Iraq veteran,

58
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.800
rocky board veteran had come back.
He'd been an assistant store manager,

59
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:46.090
was now a store manager at home depot.
And so I gave him a call and I said,
frank,

60
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.420
he's the same name as I.
Uh,
I said,
frank,

61
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.770
do you have any thoughts on what I should say?
And first she said,
wow,

62
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.100
good luck.
And then the second,
the second thing he said was,

63
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:59.650
I don't know what you should say,

64
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:04.600
but I can tell you how I start every store meeting in my store.

65
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.000
I said,
great,
what do you do?
And he said,

66
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.500
I take bill from scratch and I read from it,
I'll read a passage from it.

67
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.820
I go,
this is brilliant.
And so I pick up the book,

68
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:20.500
I flipped madly through it to find something that's I think is relevant.

69
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.300
And in the book they talk about the inverted pyramid and the leadership concept

70
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:29.260
where the CEO is at the bottom and the customers and the front line associates

71
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:34.090
are at the top.
And so I use that a reading from built from scratch.

72
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:38.320
And then inverted pyramid is my first communication to our associates.

73
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.580
And then for the next eight years as CEO,
uh,

74
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.820
I spent time figuring out what does that actually mean?
Uh,

75
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.030
how do you lead from an inverted pyramid,
um,

76
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.220
perspective and what are the leadership lessons that you pull from that?
So yes,

77
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.900
a hugely important book.
It's a great book.
Uh,
unfortunately it's out of print,

78
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.060
but I'm sure I could get it for anybody who wants it.

79
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.490
<v 0>Yeah.
Maybe we could get the publisher to do it.
Yeah,
that would be great.</v>

80
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.430
That would be great.
Give them a heads up when this is going to land,
right?
Yeah,

81
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.373
exactly.

82
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.360
So I'd like to start right in the middle of the action kind of in media rests

83
00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:16.160
with something like that.
And then rewind the clock.

84
00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:18.290
So if we go back to your childhood,

85
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:22.700
could you tell us a bit about where you grew up and how you would describe your

86
00:05:22.701 --> 00:05:23.534
childhood?

87
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.760
<v 1>Uh,
I grew up in right outside of Boston,
Massachusetts,</v>

88
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.800
a family of five.
Uh,
I was the fourth of five.

89
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.740
Uh,
unfortunately my three older siblings have died.

90
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.800
My mom though just had her 100th birthday and still lives in the house I grew up

91
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:47.140
in,
uh,
had a great,
very family oriented experience growing up.

92
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.230
Very close family and we have a lot of relatives in the area.

93
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:54.370
So New England sort of home still.
What did your mom do for a hundredth birthday?

94
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.550
Uh,
so we had a big party and we had lots of relatives,

95
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.330
lots of her friends.
Uh,
she,
um,

96
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.640
she's the kind of person who,
if you say,
uh,

97
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.670
mention any name,

98
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.320
she will know exactly what that person's father did,

99
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.640
what their sister did.

100
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:18.470
She'll have a backstory that will go on for 15 or 20 minutes.
Uh,

101
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.540
she works the phone constantly.

102
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.860
She did that growing up and she's done that even to the age of a hundred.

103
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:29.780
She's sharp as a tack weld what recall very well and very storytelling.

104
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.300
So you just,
you go,
wow.

105
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:36.890
I had no idea that there was that much interesting going on in their life.

106
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:37.131
You know,

107
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:41.120
they had a twin sister and the twin sister ran away with the grocery man and you

108
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:44.210
know,
it was just all that kind of detail.
Fascinating stuff.

109
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.780
<v 0>What did you think you were going to grow up to be when you were in,
say,</v>

110
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:50.630
high school or when you were younger?

111
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.300
<v 1>I,
I was interested in politics,
so,
so,
um,</v>

112
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.890
I worked on campaigns.
Uh,
when I got out of college,

113
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.700
I worked in the state legislature in Massachusetts.
Uh,

114
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.170
after I went to law school,
I then ended up in Washington DC.

115
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.270
I had a very traditional,
uh,
Washington DC lawyer,

116
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.750
government career move back and forth,
uh,

117
00:07:16.751 --> 00:07:21.610
from private practice and into the government.
So the I politics fascinate me.

118
00:07:21.611 --> 00:07:22.810
I was interested in politics.

119
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.930
<v 0>Fascinating.
What,
what led to that?</v>

120
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.850
<v 1>Uh,
or what about it?
I think you start,
you start by by,</v>

121
00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:32.740
uh,
the issues are so interesting.
Uh,

122
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.650
you think you can impact people's lives.
Um,
there,

123
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.380
uh,
it,
you know,
power is a fascinating thing and yeah,

124
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.760
so politics is a source of power and it's fascinating because of it.

125
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.780
<v 0>Did you experience conversations about politics over the dinner table or how</v>

126
00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:50.680
were you introduced to it?

127
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.570
<v 1>Not a bit,
no,
not a bit.
Uh,
it was entirely,
um,</v>

128
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.080
I self generated,
I don't know where it came from,
but it,
yeah,

129
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.530
no one else in my family was remotely interested in politics.
That was my thing

130
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.060
<v 0>is,
so as I was mentioning before we started recording,</v>

131
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.410
I've had a hell of a time trying to figure out what path to take with this

132
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:20.120
conversation because you have such an eclectic background and people will have

133
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:23.420
heard certainly a fair amount of this in the introduction.

134
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:28.421
But I'll just mention a few things and then I'll get to the question.

135
00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:32.450
So you have law clerk for Supreme Court justice,
General Counsel for Ge.

136
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.980
I'm skipping a lot.
Deputy Secretary.
Now,

137
00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:38.690
why do you say deputy secretary of the Department of energy or is it better to

138
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:40.640
just say deputy secretary of energy,

139
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:46.510
Department of Energy and then CEO of Home Depot and then certainly at least as

140
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:50.360
one of our mutual friends has put it,
you are the least retired,
retired person.

141
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:51.194
He knows

142
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.880
I have a lot of friends who are lawyers look into her lawyers.
Yeah.

143
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.910
A former lawyers and they tend to be very uh,

144
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.620
certainty focused and uh,
averse to entrepreneurship.

145
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.700
So how have you,
and if this is even accurate,

146
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.570
ended up with this combination of very strong legal background and ability to

147
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.270
manage in amidst uncertainty and combine those two.

148
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.840
It's really unusual from my experience at least.

149
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.730
<v 1>Uh,
I'm probably an awful lot accidental.
Uh,</v>

150
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.090
so the first part accidental was a group of us set up our own law firm.

151
00:09:37.091 --> 00:09:40.590
So there are 12 of us who set up our own law firm and that was kind of my first

152
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:44.850
experience with entrepreneurial activity.
I could say I was singularly bad.

153
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.150
I feel affirmed it great.
Uh,

154
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.460
most of my instincts about how to do it actually looking back are pretty funny

155
00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:54.870
cause I was wrong.
Uh,

156
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.300
so that was an introduction to entrepreneurial activity.
Uh,

157
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.200
I left Washington,
uh,

158
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.740
to go to Ge to be the general counsel of a business in Schenectady,

159
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:11.790
New York.
And everybody thought that's the stupidest thing we've ever heard.

160
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:15.480
Why would you leave Washington and a great legal practice and go to Schenectady?

161
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:16.763
And mostly it was,

162
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:21.540
by that time I was kind of sick of politics and sick of Washington and,

163
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.553
uh,

164
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.270
I was the beneficiary of the way Ge did HR.

165
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.920
So the basically they move people around every 18 months,

166
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.400
but they never bothered to move the lawyers because who,
you know,

167
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.620
they're not going to bother to move the lawyers.

168
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.440
So after about five or six years,

169
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.660
I'm the person around the table who sort of knows how the business works.

170
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:50.460
And I've listened to this and I've observed over time and,
uh,

171
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.140
they offered me a job going onto the business side and then the rest of it,
um,

172
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.210
being a lawyer is great.
Uh,
having been a lawyer is even better.

173
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.380
So I really,
I really enjoyed the business side and found it much,

174
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:06.330
much more fascinating than the legal side.

175
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.720
<v 0>Uh,
how did you make the decision,</v>

176
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:14.750
walk us through making the decision to leave the law practice and take the job

177
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:18.960
at GE because that's a skill or it could be a scary step.

178
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:23.961
And I know certainly looking around myself at my friends who have what most

179
00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:28.150
people would consider a successful legal careers,
uh,

180
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.620
they often pine after these types of changes,

181
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:35.280
but very few of them actually take the leap.
So how did you,
uh,

182
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.420
how did you make that decision?

183
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.410
<v 1>I,
there were two things.
The first,</v>

184
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.250
the first just as a scene setter is it is the case.

185
00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:46.810
I have never made as a salary,
more money than I made as a lawyer.

186
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.960
So I did more with my draw from the law firm than through to being CEO of the

187
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.180
Home Depot.
So it was,
it was a very good legal practice.

188
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.370
The problem with legal practice after a while that you realize is,

189
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:06.100
um,
there's such a disincentive for any kind of efficiency,
right?

190
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.740
Somebody comes in with a problem and you go,
I know this prominent,

191
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.040
I can name this tune in three notes.
Well,
no,

192
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:16.930
actually that's not what you,
that's not the business model.
You want to say,

193
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.850
Oh boy,
that's a complex symphony.
That's going to be 3000 notes.

194
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:27.030
And so the idea of trying to do something that's cumulative rather than a

195
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.830
billing your time by the hours,
really what appealed to me.
And so,
and,

196
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.550
and Washington's a very,
um,

197
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.190
Washington's very close little culture and I want to just get out of,

198
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.040
out of that closed culture and it's connected in New York,

199
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:47.950
sounded like the far end of the earth.

200
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.990
<v 0>Now at the time,
were you single married when you're married,
married?</v>

201
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.710
How did that,
uh,

202
00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.000
how did you deliver the news or how did you discuss the possibility of that

203
00:12:59.001 --> 00:12:59.834
switch?

204
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.500
<v 1>I,
you know,
after you're comfortable saying I don't,
I don't,</v>

205
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.410
I don't know that we had a lot of discussion around it,

206
00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:09.090
but it was clear that I was not,

207
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.190
I just was becoming increasingly unhappy,
uh,
on the legal side.

208
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.970
And while I'm not sure everybody was thrilled.

209
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.460
I knew my family was thrilled to be moving to a it,

210
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.650
you know,
we lived in Albany,
but to be moving to upstate New York,

211
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.440
they wrote him with,
it gets chilly.
I grew up in New York,

212
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:32.010
but on long island upstate gets chilly for people who haven't been there.

213
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.540
Upstate is Chile and um,
yeah,
it's very chilly.

214
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:42.760
<v 0>Uh,
Ge,
uh,
Ge is another company in addition to Home Depot,</v>

215
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:46.990
even though I've never done anything myself in any industries related to either.

216
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.760
That is fascinating.
Yes.
Uh,
when did you first meet Jack Welch?

217
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:57.160
<v 1>Oh,
early,
early on.
Um,
and,
and,</v>

218
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.570
and then I ended up as a direct report for Jack.
Uh,
I,

219
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.610
Jack Welch's.
I mean the founders of Home Depot,
uh,
Bernie Marcus,

220
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:09.880
Ken Lang,
bone Arthur blank.
They're extraordinary people.

221
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.270
Jack Welch's and extraordinary,
extraordinary human being.

222
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.720
One of the ways I would describe it is I would never take a phone call from him

223
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.960
sitting down the energy just immediately you stood up to provide an answer to

224
00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:30.130
Jack.
And,
uh,
just I've got a lot of,

225
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:34.150
he was hugely helpful to me while I was the CEO at home depot.

226
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.710
Got a lot of stories around Jack Trilly a hero.
Yeah,
let's get into it.

227
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:42.340
This is a long form podcast,
so we have the luxury of time.
So,
so,

228
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:44.860
so this is an arc.
This is,
uh,
uh,

229
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.980
so I become CEO,
the Home Depot,
I think.
Uh,
all right,

230
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.950
I'm going to call Jack and I'm going to ask him for some time and kind of give

231
00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:58.790
me CEO one on one lessons and which I did.

232
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.630
And he was very nice.
He was down in Florida at the time.
I said,
Jack,

233
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:06.530
can I spend a day with you and you know,
kind of pick your brains?

234
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.980
And he said,
great.
And my do.

235
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:15.040
I have done hundreds of pitches to Jack in my time at Ge and I prepared so hard

236
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.620
for this meeting with him.

237
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.020
I could tell you the margin rate of an ant trap.
I mean,

238
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:28.040
I was just into all the details,
all the numbers,

239
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.400
and I go down and the first thing he says is,
um,

240
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.500
draw me your org chart and we spend a day going through people and it was

241
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:46.430
probably one of the most helpful days of my time because you know,

242
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.120
and I recommend this for anybody anywhere.

243
00:15:50.121 --> 00:15:52.550
If you find somebody that you really respect,

244
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.050
who will ask you questions and then you just listen to what you're saying.

245
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.440
And in effect,
he did that,
uh,

246
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.720
for me on the organization and the people.

247
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.170
And then every year I do the same thing.

248
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:09.350
I'd spend a day with Jack every single year and this is jumping ahead,

249
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:13.580
but I loved the story.
So,
so the eighth year,

250
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.610
so my last time I get to ask the question that's sort of the moron,

251
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.210
stupid question that you wouldn't dare ask earlier cause you wouldn't be able to

252
00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:26.090
get the next meeting with Jack.
So I go,
okay Jacques,

253
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.330
all of the attributes of leadership,

254
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.860
if you had to weigh them all and pick one,

255
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.520
what is the single most important attribute of leadership?

256
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.570
And His answer shocked me.
Uh,

257
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.230
he said generosity and I wouldn't have predicted it.

258
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.590
It kind of took me by surprise when he said it.

259
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:53.591
And then when he explained it and explained how as leaders you need to be fueled

260
00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:59.420
by the success of others and how that's really got to be the driving force.

261
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:04.330
And I could see that as true for how he ran GE,
um,

262
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.510
made a lot of sense.
And it stuck with me ever since I was a great lesson.

263
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.990
Why was it important in that first meeting that he shifted the focus to the org

264
00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:18.140
chart?
What happened?
What were the questions he asked?
What were the important?

265
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:22.670
So the great questions were,
uh,
first,
how are you organized?
I mean,

266
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.840
cause you know,

267
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:29.240
that tells a lot about what your priorities are.
And second,

268
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.193
uh,

269
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.120
he'd be asking about people and I'd be,

270
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:37.700
I'd find myself in some instances,

271
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.560
it kind of making excuses and saying,
well,
you know,
blah,
blah blah,

272
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:46.310
but not really.
And then he'd just say,
I mean,

273
00:17:46.311 --> 00:17:48.980
did you hear what you just said?
Where are you going to do about it?

274
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.760
And it wasn't his commentary on these people and he didn't even know them.

275
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.760
But listening to his,
you know,

276
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.100
feeding back to me what I was saying and then say,
hey look,
you know,

277
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.310
you're not smart enough to do this on your own.

278
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.770
So if you're going to do this and be successful,

279
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:09.900
you gotta you gotta get the right team with you

280
00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.910
<v 0>as well.
For people who don't know,
Jack,
what would you say he is best known for?</v>

281
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.560
Uh,
it's something that stuck with me and I have great respect for Jack and I've

282
00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:20.730
read a lot about him,

283
00:18:20.731 --> 00:18:24.450
but I might be getting the details wrong because it's been a while.
Uh,

284
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:26.700
I mean he said the nickname neutron Jack,
he,

285
00:18:26.701 --> 00:18:31.530
I think it was what the bottom 10% of performers and Ge were let go on an annual

286
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:32.540
basis and basis.

287
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.820
And was he then asking you about strongest weakest performers and then asking

288
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:42.060
you why you are keeping or why the weakest performers were continuing to be

289
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:42.894
employed?

290
00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:47.000
<v 1>Wasn't doing it on a kind of percentage.
Tell me who you know,</v>

291
00:18:47.001 --> 00:18:51.320
who lags and who's a head.
It was more individual by individual.
Tell me,

292
00:18:51.321 --> 00:18:55.130
describe for me the strengths and weaknesses go through it.
Um,

293
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.890
and what I would say that what Jack did that,

294
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.033
um,

295
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:06.380
particularly impresses me in retrospect because it's so hard to do.

296
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.180
Um,
so I'm,
I go into GE as a lawyer.
Uh,

297
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.500
GE is a finance engineering firm.
Lawyers are not,
I mean,
you know,

298
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.150
we had a great legal team,
uh,
but it still,

299
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.070
the lawyers are not at the top of the organizational pecking order.

300
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.700
Somehow.
Jack Gut,

301
00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:33.701
the sense within me that the path to success and the company was actually to

302
00:19:34.461 --> 00:19:35.870
disagree with him and be right.

303
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.330
And that's huge because,

304
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:46.130
and he would say this,
uh,
you know,
I,
I express,
wow,
that's so amazing.
You know,

305
00:19:46.131 --> 00:19:48.560
in retrospect,
Jack,
that's so amazing.
And he'd say,
well,

306
00:19:48.561 --> 00:19:50.990
I really don't need to pay people to tell me I'm right.

307
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.410
I need to pay people who are going to tell me where I'm wrong.

308
00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:00.190
But organizations are such echo chambers.

309
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.070
And Bernie Marcus gave me a great piece of advice.

310
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.010
He gave me tons of pieces of advice that were terrific.

311
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.840
But I remember one of them at the start of becoming CEO,
Bernie said,

312
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.090
okay,
let me tell you how this works.

313
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:19.280
You're going to be sitting around a table and you're going to tell a joke and

314
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.010
all the folks are going to laugh.

315
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.990
<v 0>And he said,
let me tell you you're not fun.</v>

316
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.740
And the port at the point of that is people are just going to respond to you the

317
00:20:30.741 --> 00:20:32.000
way they think.
You want

318
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.010
<v 1>them to respond.</v>

319
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:39.230
So eliciting the kind of reaction that Jack did for me,
which was,
hey,

320
00:20:39.231 --> 00:20:42.710
it's okay actually to disagree with the boss.
You damn well better be right.

321
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.830
But it's a good thing to disagree with the bosses.
Huge.

322
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.010
<v 0>So on that point a,
and</v>

323
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.510
<v 1>I may get the pronunciation wrong,
Carol to me.
Yeah.
So at the time home depot,</v>

324
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:56.560
the CFO said that when you arrived still,
and this is a compliment,

325
00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.490
you invited conflict into the decision making process.
Uh,

326
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:04.780
and I'll quote here is from a fortune article,
we were conflict hesitant.

327
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.120
Frank asked a ton of questions that make you say,

328
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:11.310
what is working and not working?
So this is interesting to me.
Uh,

329
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.040
how do you encourage people and to disagree and elicit the bad news or whatever

330
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:18.821
it might be?

331
00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:23.821
How do you do that without also simultaneously or dissipating the fear of

332
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:29.310
getting punished for that?
Uh,
I think it's one of the most important thing.

333
00:21:29.311 --> 00:21:29.670
So,

334
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:34.590
so I have a long discussion around what the inverted pyramid means,

335
00:21:34.591 --> 00:21:39.450
but one of the things it means is that everything that's important as the CEO,

336
00:21:39.451 --> 00:21:44.451
everything that's important is happening above you with the customers and the

337
00:21:44.641 --> 00:21:48.780
front line associates and the folks who,
you know,
work in the organization.

338
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:53.700
So you've got to figure out a way to effectively listen and effectively get them

339
00:21:53.701 --> 00:21:54.930
to communicate to you.

340
00:21:55.470 --> 00:22:00.390
I learned actually from a board member at home depot at this may be more unique

341
00:22:00.391 --> 00:22:04.240
to retail to doing this,
but it worked.
Uh,
the,

342
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.490
the best way to do that is if I was walking in a store and we had a particular

343
00:22:08.491 --> 00:22:11.430
project,
my comment would be,

344
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:16.650
why isn't project x working?
And then they'd go,

345
00:22:16.651 --> 00:22:19.290
oh my gosh,
frank knows that the project isn't working.

346
00:22:19.291 --> 00:22:21.480
I guess we better say something.

347
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:26.190
And so that would actually prompt a conversation while if you said,

348
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.930
how's everything going in any organization of any size?

349
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.070
There's only one right answer.
When the boss says,
how's everything going?

350
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.160
The answer is it's going great.
You're awesome.
Please go.

351
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.410
And you need to kind of pull out from people,
you know,

352
00:22:43.411 --> 00:22:46.170
every once in a while somebody would say,
why did you say it's not working?

353
00:22:46.171 --> 00:22:49.530
It's working great.
But more often than not it would be,
oh well here's,

354
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.030
here's what you're missing.
Here's what's not happening.
Here are the issues.
So,

355
00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.990
<v 0>so there are so many pieces of paper as you can see.</v>

356
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:02.160
So many questions that I want to ask.
And uh,
the next,

357
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.230
the next one is really closely related to this.

358
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.230
And something that I think about a lot,

359
00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.810
and I'll lead into it in a somewhat confusing way,

360
00:23:09.811 --> 00:23:12.420
but the internet is almost all negative feedback.

361
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:17.010
People get punished and attacked.
However,
if you look at say,

362
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.070
opera and classical conditioning,
dog training,
mammal training,
human training,

363
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:25.320
positive reinforcement is actually critically important.
Uh,

364
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:31.530
so this is a,
as a quote,
and please correct me if I'm wrong,

365
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:37.250
but I'd love to get some examples of how you have celebrated people's successes

366
00:23:39.211 --> 00:23:43.520
and wins,
whether within home depot or elsewhere.
And,
uh,

367
00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.660
the quote is,
I'm a lawyer.
Lawyers don't celebrate shit.

368
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:49.913
<v 1>MMM.</v>

369
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.190
<v 0>Or actually,
furthermore,</v>

370
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.280
the only way people know what you want is that you celebrate when they get it.

371
00:23:55.281 --> 00:23:59.000
Right.
I'm a lawyer.
Lawyers don't celebrate shit.
So how,
how,

372
00:23:59.001 --> 00:24:01.280
what are concrete examples of how you would do that?

373
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.560
<v 1>I,</v>

374
00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.560
that was actually one of my biggest learnings of the time as CEO was the

375
00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:12.520
importance of celebration.
In fact,
what I tell people now is,

376
00:24:12.521 --> 00:24:12.790
you know,

377
00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:17.590
every business person knows the saying that you get what you measure.

378
00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.180
I'd say there's an important,
maybe even more important corollary.

379
00:24:22.181 --> 00:24:26.510
You get what you celebrate.
People just as you say,
uh,

380
00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:31.620
they reference off of the stories they reference off of when you reward someone

381
00:24:33.461 --> 00:24:35.470
and make a point of it.
Uh,

382
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:39.550
that actually sticks in the mind long after other things have forgotten.

383
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:44.380
And at,
uh,
at depot we did a lot,

384
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.230
in fact,
spent a lot of time on this.
Uh,

385
00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:52.740
personally I would spend every Sunday afternoon writing notes to hourly

386
00:24:54.581 --> 00:24:58.780
associates.
So for us,
customer service was what we were after.

387
00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:03.130
Customer service is such a vague right,
such a vague term.

388
00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:08.220
And I would write a hundred to 200 notes every Sunday and we had a whole process

389
00:25:10.811 --> 00:25:12.070
for rolling up,
you know,

390
00:25:12.071 --> 00:25:17.071
the Joan Jane Jack did blank and it would roll up from the store to the district

391
00:25:18.911 --> 00:25:21.250
to the region and I would write notes,
st gear,

392
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:26.080
Joe or Jane and it wouldn't just be you're awesome.
Thank you very much frank.

393
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:30.790
It would be,
I heard you did blank and I'd write out what it was.

394
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.010
Thank you very much.
And uh,
send the note out and signed my name.

395
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:40.600
And as a I,
I does a long,

396
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:44.800
I have a long thing about note writing and why note writing important.
Okay.

397
00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.960
But so I wondered about the power of that.

398
00:25:49.961 --> 00:25:54.961
But early on I was walking a store and associate came up to me and said,

399
00:25:55.450 --> 00:26:00.250
um,
gee,
would you mind rewriting the note that you sent me?

400
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.810
And I said,
no,
sure,
no problem,
but why?
And he said,
well,

401
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.930
we were all convinced that it was a rowboat pen note.

402
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.730
And so we put it under water and it leaked.
It ran.

403
00:26:12.731 --> 00:26:15.520
And so would you like me another,
uh,

404
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:20.470
people people respond to being recognized?

405
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.390
I learned this from,
so I,

406
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.380
early in my career I worked for George Bush Dad when he was vice president.

407
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:31.090
And it's a great thing to work.
I mean,
he's a wonderful human being.

408
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.470
Working for the vice president is great because it's a very small staff so you

409
00:26:35.471 --> 00:26:38.050
can actually see what he does.
And at the time,

410
00:26:38.051 --> 00:26:41.110
so this is in 1981 ages and ages ago,
no computers.

411
00:26:41.111 --> 00:26:46.111
But he would come into the office and type out notes and you knew that he was

412
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:48.430
typing the notes because you know,
the,

413
00:26:48.431 --> 00:26:53.280
he would be slightly off and the be white out.
But as a staff member,

414
00:26:53.281 --> 00:26:55.620
when you got a note from the vice president,

415
00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.050
you know you're walking home will water.

416
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:03.110
I mean if you just felt like everything was great and uh,

417
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.740
I believe that we learn more from those positive stories and recognition than

418
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.120
anything else.
In addition,
I mean the notes were kind of my thing,

419
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:20.070
but we also did a video every single week of great customer service and we put

420
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:23.820
it in that same break room TV and you'd videotape the actual,

421
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.490
the associates who we rebate highlight the story.

422
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.520
We'd retell the story with the associates.
I mean,

423
00:27:29.521 --> 00:27:32.670
so there'd be one of these every single week.

424
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
We did little books of great associate customer service stories.

425
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.610
We have,
if you go into stores,

426
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:46.320
you'll see people with badges and recognition and it's um,

427
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:51.300
it is,
you just don't communicate.

428
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.530
You can write a memo to someone and think it gets down to an organization,

429
00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.210
but it doesn't,
it's when you pull people out and say,
here,

430
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.120
this is what this person did that was extraordinary.

431
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.830
You tell a story around it and everyone remembers that story.

432
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:10.560
That person's thrilled and everybody else is going,

433
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:12.480
I want a story told about me too.

434
00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.410
I'm doing that kind of stuff as well and it builds on itself.

435
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.593
<v 0>So if you have,</v>

436
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.660
I think the number that you mentioned was 350,000 or a few hundred thousand or

437
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.530
350,000 now there are over four,
right?

438
00:28:24.531 --> 00:28:28.970
So if you have 350,000 associates and you're doing this every week,
how,

439
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.800
what are the check boxes or the process for selecting those 200 I'd love to

440
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.980
learn more about that because I had no doubt there are people listening to this.

441
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.850
I know there are people listening to this who run very large organizations and

442
00:28:40.851 --> 00:28:43.580
the the at that,
that's going to be one of the questions top of mind.

443
00:28:43.581 --> 00:28:44.010
I would imagine.

444
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.610
<v 1>So the great thing about it is you take,
so you take that,</v>

445
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.950
so you say frank wants to send a note out.

446
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:55.380
Then this is where having an organization is great because then you say,
okay,

447
00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:56.430
here's how we're going to do it.

448
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.780
The stores are going to submit stories of great customer service in the store.

449
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:04.530
We'll submit that to the district and the district will take its best stories

450
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:07.980
and the district's best stories go to the regions and then the regions all

451
00:29:07.981 --> 00:29:08.880
submit them to me.

452
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:13.020
So beyond the note writing itself,

453
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.710
there's actually a process for recognition.

454
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:21.030
So I hope the better store managers,

455
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:25.560
we're recognizing every single story that they forwarded onto the district and

456
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:28.560
we're making a celebration with their associates in that store.

457
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:33.180
Same with the districts and same with the region so that it reinforced itself.

458
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:38.550
Uh,
so it's not just the one note,

459
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.130
it's the entire process.
It's why as I say,

460
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.190
the people just should spend time thinking about what they're recognizing and

461
00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:50.830
celebrating.
They should do it intentionally.

462
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:55.120
They should have a process around it.
They should do it consistently.

463
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:59.260
Because you know,
we talk a lot about company culture,

464
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.730
but that's what really sets the culture.
It's what everybody is saying.

465
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.720
You want to know,
you want to see the story.
We want to see what this looks like.

466
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.220
This is what it looks like.

467
00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.430
<v 0>And so if,
if these letters are going out and people want to receive a letter,</v>

468
00:30:14.431 --> 00:30:17.430
they want to be in the video.
Right.
Uh,

469
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.900
what were the criteria for good stories?
In other words,

470
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.610
these various say district managers,

471
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:27.690
so on could have their subjective views of what makes a good customer service

472
00:30:27.691 --> 00:30:29.820
story.
But did you give them any guidelines at all?

473
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:35.600
<v 1>Uh,
not,
I didn't,
I'll be honest.
I mean,
customers,
I mean,</v>

474
00:30:35.601 --> 00:30:39.300
that's the important thing about customer service is,
um,

475
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.970
it takes lots of different forms,
right?
But,
um,

476
00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:49.160
what we weren't looking for is,
and it's not like this isn't important,

477
00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:54.460
but we weren't looking for the story of the cashier who stopped the robber.

478
00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:00.140
I mean,
so those are important stories,
but it,
you know,

479
00:31:00.141 --> 00:31:05.141
some companies are more focused on shrink prevention and things like that.

480
00:31:05.181 --> 00:31:09.590
We were focused on customer service and we had lots of different,
I mean,

481
00:31:09.591 --> 00:31:14.540
just emotionally powerful people helping other people in the store.

482
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:19.160
Um,
phenomenal,
phenomenally strong stories.
But no,

483
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.720
didn't set any guidelines.

484
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.340
<v 0>So you mentioned,
uh,
you know,
the,
the bay stuffing,
the bankrupt,</v>

485
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:28.820
not the bank robbery,
but the theft.
All right.
Not being a very good example.

486
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:33.560
And with this brings to mind for me is,
I think it was Andy Grove of Intel.

487
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:34.940
I might be getting this wrong.

488
00:31:34.941 --> 00:31:36.770
I'm sure someone on the Internet will correct me if I am,

489
00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:42.220
but that for every metric they decided to measure for,

490
00:31:42.681 --> 00:31:45.230
which was a positive indicator for the company,

491
00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.320
Andy would insist that they identify the PR,

492
00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:55.060
the perverse incentive or correlating metric that they should measure,
right.

493
00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.850
For side effects.
Right.
And so you could,
I mean,
I'm reaching a little bit here,

494
00:31:58.851 --> 00:32:01.910
but you could see if someone says this,
of course this is exaggerated,

495
00:32:01.911 --> 00:32:06.110
but oh my God,
I could get in the video if I stop a robbery,

496
00:32:06.111 --> 00:32:09.710
like who could I,
who can I hire to simulate a robbery?
Uh,

497
00:32:09.711 --> 00:32:10.990
and I'll let my buddy go,
but it,

498
00:32:10.991 --> 00:32:14.300
I'll put up a good fight and get it in the video.
Uh,
how did you,

499
00:32:14.301 --> 00:32:18.650
you mentioned the,
what you,
uh,
what you celebrate or I'm sorry,
the,

500
00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.990
let me get this right.
It just wrote it down.
But,
uh,

501
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.530
effectively you get what you measure,
you get what you celebrate,
right?
Uh,

502
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:31.600
what were some of the,
when you took the rans,
what were some of the metrics that,

503
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.900
that you focused on or that the organization focused on?

504
00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:39.140
<v 1>Yeah.
Uh,
so every retailer,
I mean now it's commonplace,</v>

505
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:44.060
you look at what's called net promoter score.
Uh,
but that,

506
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.410
I mean the,
if that's an accurate Andy grove quote,

507
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.140
I entirely agree with it because,
um,

508
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.600
it's definitely a quote from someone,

509
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.210
definitely a quote from someone in a white quote.

510
00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:01.100
Cause every single metric does have a germ of a problem in it.

511
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.010
So you have to be careful.
I mean,

512
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:06.410
we would measure net promoter score,
you know,

513
00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:10.560
how happy the customers are in the store.
Uh,

514
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.640
but it's always a reminder that the dominant measure is how are we doing on

515
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:22.040
sales and profitability.
So as you move down below that,

516
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:23.990
on the metric side,
you'd have to be very careful

517
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.320
<v 0>and how did you measure sales?</v>

518
00:33:28.321 --> 00:33:30.720
But there are many different ways to doing it.
A revenue,

519
00:33:30.721 --> 00:33:32.160
you have revenue per square foot,

520
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:36.900
you have say a profit or revenue or net income,

521
00:33:36.901 --> 00:33:39.750
whatever it might be per employee.
You have many different approaches.

522
00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:42.420
You could take,
were there any that were more important than others?

523
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:46.100
<v 1>No,
I mean we,
our stores,
uh,
fall,</v>

524
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:50.240
they're very idiosyncratic within the box.

525
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.980
Uh,
they're very similar and we just,
we would look at,
uh,

526
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:59.390
so we didn't have to get very sophisticated about on the store side,

527
00:33:59.391 --> 00:34:02.630
on revenue per square foot of the merchandising side.

528
00:34:02.631 --> 00:34:06.500
You do more of that because you'd want to say,
what's our,

529
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.870
what's our return on the space where we're allocating to that merchandise?

530
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.090
<v 0>See,
you'd mentioned,
uh,
at least once,</v>

531
00:34:15.091 --> 00:34:19.050
maybe a few times how he seemed to be the accidental CEO.

532
00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.290
Didn't expect to be asked to be CEO.

533
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.490
How did they explain it or if they didn't?
I'm sure they probably said something.

534
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.490
Why?
Why were you asked to be CEO?

535
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:32.930
<v 1>Uh,
well,
uh,</v>

536
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.200
that's in the end you need to ask Ken Langone,

537
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.690
who is the lead director and the other directors of Home Depot at the time.

538
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.310
I've never really spent time asking them why.
Uh,

539
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.540
I think they had seen a lot of me because,
uh,

540
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:52.300
I was in charge of deals and we did a lot of Amazon transactions.

541
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:53.880
<v 0>The SVP,</v>

542
00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:58.110
senior vice president of corporate business development or that was it?

543
00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.730
That was that a GE?

544
00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:01.680
<v 1>Well,
I did deals.
So my,</v>

545
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.870
the job I ended up with at Ge was doing m and a,

546
00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:10.130
the job I was doing at home depot was doing m and a.

547
00:35:10.131 --> 00:35:12.660
We went out and we bought,
uh,

548
00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:17.930
a whole series of companies called at the time home depot supply that became,

549
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:24.380
that was the largest commercial industrial distributor in the country,

550
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:29.030
the first,
but I pitched those deals to the board.

551
00:35:29.031 --> 00:35:33.170
So they saw me a lot.
And then the first thing I did when I became CEO and said,

552
00:35:33.171 --> 00:35:36.380
we need to sell this business and we sold the business.

553
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.340
Why did you have to sell the business?

554
00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:42.150
<v 2>Or why did you recommend that they sell the business?
So,
um,</v>

555
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:48.000
the dominant reason for me personally was,
uh,

556
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.060
and I think that this was organizationally right,

557
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:55.050
but I know it was right for me individually was saying,

558
00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.950
to be the best retailer in any space requires 110% of the effort.

559
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:08.480
For me to be the best leader of a retailer is a 110% plus of effort.

560
00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:16.500
No chance that I can also say,
oh,
and here's this other business,

561
00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:20.100
this,
you know,
great commercial and industrial distribution business.

562
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:25.610
I can be the best CEO in that space to just knew that was not going to be

563
00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:30.810
possible.
And So said we need to sell.
Is that what you said?

564
00:36:30.811 --> 00:36:35.730
To convince the board that it was a good idea or a much,
yeah,
pretty much.

565
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.150
Yeah.
Uh,
yeah.
And said,
and it was,

566
00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:43.230
I don't think I made it that personal where I think I said,
look,

567
00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.760
the cause the company we'd been losing market share.

568
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:52.620
Uh,
we were trailing our principal competitor.
I said,

569
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:53.820
this is,
um,

570
00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:58.470
we've got to be all eyes on the retail business and we got to get rid of

571
00:36:58.471 --> 00:37:03.420
everything that's a distraction of the retail business plus at the time.
Uh,

572
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:08.690
so I took over right at the start of 2007 and the housing crisis was,

573
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.200
you know,
by that point,
the clouds were fairly obvious.

574
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:18.480
And so we knew we had to make some dramatic changes because things were going to

575
00:37:18.481 --> 00:37:23.481
go downhill fast and they went even more downhill and faster or anticipate.

576
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.600
I bought a house in late 2007 til it got good time.
There you go.
There you go.

577
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:33.860
In San Jose,
Aka man,
Jose,
California,
but it's a separate story.
Uh,

578
00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:41.250
<v 0>the decision to divest of like is HD supply.</v>

579
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.233
Yup.

580
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.130
And I may be misattributed so please correct me if I'm wrong,
but it,

581
00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.910
it is also makes me think of Jack Welch if I'm getting this right,

582
00:37:51.911 --> 00:37:52.744
which is,

583
00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:57.760
did he not want every division or product line or company to be either number

584
00:37:57.761 --> 00:38:00.040
one or number two in its category or

585
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.240
<v 2>famously had that as an objective that did not drive that decision because home</v>

586
00:38:05.521 --> 00:38:09.000
depot supply was number one.
Right.
Got It.
So it's more a matter of focus.

587
00:38:09.001 --> 00:38:11.910
So it was a matter of focus.
And in fact a,

588
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.810
I mean my commentary was,
um,

589
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:21.050
there are some unique individuals like Jack who can run a conglomerate and I

590
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:26.910
would be deep,
deep into the details of the business I worked at in Ge.

591
00:38:26.911 --> 00:38:30.660
And Jack would still ask questions to me that I had just slapped my head and go,

592
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.840
oh my God,
what a great question.
Why didn't I think of that?

593
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:39.670
I knew not me.
I mean,
it would take,
but take all,

594
00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:44.290
as I said,
just running a conglomerate is,
it is a big,

595
00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:46.870
big challenge.
And that one I knew I couldn't do that.

596
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:52.540
<v 0>Uh,
so you mentioned,</v>

597
00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.330
uh,
we'll,
we've,

598
00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:58.660
we've talked a bit about your legal background and uh,

599
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.150
someone compared to your one point,
Darwin Smith,

600
00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:04.420
the attorney turns CEO at Kimberly Clark,
uh,

601
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:08.620
because of how lawyers are trained in conflict,
how to navigate deeper issues,

602
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.160
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Uh,
I've also noticed that for instance,

603
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.890
if I can't find a proofreader who is a professional writer,

604
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.530
I will ask one of my friends who is a lawyer because they're very good.

605
00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:20.920
They're not professional proofreaders per say for the type of writing that I do,

606
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:24.670
but they're very good at spotting language.
That is nebulous words.

607
00:39:24.671 --> 00:39:26.530
It shouldn't be there.
Uh,

608
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.340
how did your legal training help you for what came later?

609
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.170
And it might be a chicken and the egg thing.

610
00:39:32.171 --> 00:39:36.710
I mean it could be what helps you to be a good lawyer,
but,
uh,

611
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.590
what about those life experiences or that training helped you later or hurt?

612
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:43.200
<v 2>I think,
uh,</v>

613
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.610
I think the part of so the hurt is easier.

614
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.510
So you start there.
Yeah.
So the,
so the,

615
00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:54.530
the things that I kind of had to hike away from our,

616
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:56.400
uh,
for lawyers,

617
00:39:56.401 --> 00:40:01.401
everything is great right there and you can chew over decisions for a long time

618
00:40:02.701 --> 00:40:05.610
and it's very complex and full of ambiguity.

619
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:11.240
If you're leading a 350,000 people strong and you're calling out and your

620
00:40:12.721 --> 00:40:16.320
statements are in paragraphs,
I'd be just,

621
00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.200
cause you've lost it right from the start.

622
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:24.260
So driving for simple portable messages that just,

623
00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.880
you know,
screw the ambiguity,
uh,

624
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.190
that is essential.

625
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.540
I actually think it's essential regardless of whether it's 350,000 people or

626
00:40:36.541 --> 00:40:40.800
three people,
so that you kind of have to train away from.

627
00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:44.330
The part that's probably good is,
uh,

628
00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.550
you're trained to worry.
I mean,

629
00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:50.520
lawyers are trained.

630
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:55.550
I always felt like law school trains you to worry about things that no normal

631
00:40:56.011 --> 00:40:58.100
human being would worry about.

632
00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:01.590
And so there is a value,

633
00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:06.420
there is a value as a CEO to worry you,

634
00:41:06.421 --> 00:41:10.890
but you've got to kind of internalize that as much as possible.

635
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.810
Uh,
because the other part of you have to get rid of that worry.

636
00:41:15.811 --> 00:41:19.260
Colin Powell has a great expression that I deeply believe in,

637
00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:22.200
which is optimism is a force multiplier.

638
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.490
And in any organization you got to bend.

639
00:41:26.491 --> 00:41:29.640
This was particularly true as things were grim.
You've,

640
00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:33.580
you've got to drive to the optimistic side.
You can't be going on,
you know.

641
00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:34.000
Got It.

642
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.870
<v 1>Yeah.
It's just really good.
Turn out badly.
Uh,
so,
um,</v>

643
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.750
but I think internally that's helpful to worry,

644
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.560
to be thinking around the corner to be thinking what's going to go wrong.

645
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.600
Just as you said,
get that.

646
00:41:47.601 --> 00:41:52.160
Every metric that you put in place comes with its own little seed of

647
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:56.660
destruction.
Understanding that,
being aware of it,

648
00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.200
don't tell it to anybody else.
So,
you know,
we would,

649
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:05.270
all our stores would have net promoter scores.
I wouldn't tell them,

650
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:10.640
oh,
here's the fascinating flaw in that metric and why you might not want to be

651
00:42:10.641 --> 00:42:13.130
committed to that.
We just go,
this is what we're focused on.

652
00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.510
We're focused on our net promoter score.
So there,
oh,
I'm sorry.
Okay.

653
00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:21.550
<v 0>I was going to,
uh,
I'm going to zoom out,
but I want to zoom in for a second.</v>

654
00:42:21.551 --> 00:42:25.480
Just a net promoter score.
How did,
how did you,
uh,
how did you all measure that?

655
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.620
<v 1>It was by surveys in,</v>

656
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.660
at after on the receipt in the store.

657
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:36.040
And so you can immediately imagine if so,

658
00:42:36.041 --> 00:42:40.840
so not to get into the nitty gritty of what could along with net promoter
scores,

659
00:42:40.841 --> 00:42:45.760
but you can imagine one of the things is the more,
um,

660
00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.750
crowded your store is,
the more volume your store does.

661
00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.580
By and large,

662
00:42:51.581 --> 00:42:55.730
that correlated to a net promoter score that was a little bit lower,
right?

663
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.510
If you wanted the highest net promoter score,

664
00:42:58.511 --> 00:43:02.530
have a store that very few people what do,
uh,
right.

665
00:43:02.531 --> 00:43:06.430
So one customer per employee per day.
Right,
exactly.
And they were thrilled.

666
00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:11.170
It may take a little,
you know,
give,
give you the positive feedback.

667
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:14.440
But yeah,
we did it straight off of 'em,

668
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.790
straight off of receipts and people typing in and saying whether they're happy

669
00:43:17.791 --> 00:43:20.740
or they weren't happening.
And then,
you know,
now on the Internet,

670
00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:23.380
obviously a lot easier,
lot easier.

671
00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.320
Four C surveys come up all the time.

672
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:29.310
<v 0>It's also a lot easier to,
uh,
as you noted,
uh,</v>

673
00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.100
get lost in the seeds of destruction or the noise,
right.

674
00:43:33.101 --> 00:43:36.970
Because if you have a net promoter score also,
at least of some types,

675
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.020
you can have a selection bias for people that are unhappy,
which is super,

676
00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:44.890
super tough.
Yup.
Uh,
but the,

677
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.870
the zooming out,
uh,

678
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:50.620
I want to do right now and look at what you said about keeping,

679
00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.430
keeping a lot of that worry and potential downside inside.

680
00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:55.690
This is a,

681
00:43:55.990 --> 00:44:00.820
a huge challenge for a lot of founders and CEOs that I know where they have to

682
00:44:00.821 --> 00:44:03.970
really like put on the brave face and help everyone marched optimism while

683
00:44:03.971 --> 00:44:07.870
keeping any of the concerns they might have insight or at least not showing it

684
00:44:07.871 --> 00:44:09.040
publicly to all the troops.

685
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:15.090
Could you walk us through if possible or just describe maybe a period or an

686
00:44:15.221 --> 00:44:19.000
instance where you had a lot of that to keep inside and how you dealt with that?

687
00:44:19.001 --> 00:44:21.250
Because a lot of these CEO's felt really alone.

688
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:26.170
They end up in some cases getting health problems.
Uh,
it's very,

689
00:44:26.171 --> 00:44:30.480
very challenging.
Uh,
could you give us a,
maybe an example of,

690
00:44:30.481 --> 00:44:31.920
of how you've contended with that?

691
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.040
<v 1>Uh,
the best thing for me,</v>

692
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:40.100
I don't say there's a great saying in retail that now has to be amended because

693
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:44.010
of the Internet,
but the same retail is all truth is on the floor of the store.

694
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:48.980
So now it's also online,
but all truth,
it's on the floor of the store.
Um,

695
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.800
the best vehicle for me to deal with those worries was always spending time in

696
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:57.900
the store.
And I would try,

697
00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:02.640
I don't think I didn't do it religiously every week,
but I would do,

698
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:07.740
um,
dinners with hourly associates whenever I'd,
you know,

699
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:10.860
wherever I was,
I tried to do one a week,
um,

700
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:16.220
with hourly associates and you pretty quickly get your problems put in

701
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:19.260
perspective and it was hugely valuable to me.

702
00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:24.261
And I remember the first one I did was if we fly in and I'm sitting around,

703
00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:26.310
there's this very nice woman sitting next to me,
you know,

704
00:45:26.311 --> 00:45:31.020
kind of give or take my age and I'm complaining about my back.

705
00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:35.550
So I,
you know,
she says how you're doing.
And I was saying something with my back,

706
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:38.460
my dry flown in a private plane and I'm saying,

707
00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:43.290
I got my back problems and then I go,
how are you?
And she said,
well,
you know,

708
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:46.920
it's funny that you say that about your back problem because you know,

709
00:45:46.921 --> 00:45:51.921
three months ago I fractured my spine and I had to be in traction and it was

710
00:45:52.501 --> 00:45:56.040
really difficult when I started working in the store again and I was in a

711
00:45:56.041 --> 00:45:59.580
wheelchair.
And you know,
we have bulky items and they have to get moved or,

712
00:45:59.581 --> 00:46:04.500
and I'm going,
I'm complaining about the little.
And then she says,
and I go,

713
00:46:04.501 --> 00:46:07.530
wow,
that's amazing.
And then she said,
well,
that wasn't the really hard part.

714
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:12.531
The really hard part was I have a 12 year old developmentally disabled son and I

715
00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:16.470
had to pay that.
I have to pay them every day and I have to get them in the bath.

716
00:46:16.471 --> 00:46:19.230
And that was so difficult when I was in the wheelchair.

717
00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:25.740
The fears and worries kind of melt when you see what people are putting up with

718
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:33.710
every day and doing one foot in front of the other and having a smile and being

719
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:38.400
committed and to people around.

720
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.290
And so that gave a sense of perspective that sort of put the earnings per share

721
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:47.130
worries a little bit,
a little bit in farther focus.

722
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:51.800
And they were always great for that.
I mean,
just amazing home depot and,

723
00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:56.520
and both Bernie and Ken Arthur as well.
Uh,

724
00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:01.470
the great stories of Home Depot and wide built from scratch and such a great

725
00:47:01.471 --> 00:47:06.000
book.
Why it's such a great idea is some crazy stories in that book.
But I mean,

726
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.080
they're great.
They're just,

727
00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:11.960
the underlying thing is people who,
you know,

728
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.750
typically start,
I come in,
I'm shagging carts in a lot.
I,
you know,

729
00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:21.090
maybe I graduated from high school,
I'm not really sure why I'm doing this job.

730
00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.980
And you know,

731
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:27.210
80% of our store managers started as hourly associates.

732
00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.250
Our upper management started as hourly associates.

733
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.700
And it's these amazing,
uh,

734
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:36.850
career stories,

735
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:41.940
wealth generation through starting at the bottom in retail.

736
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.610
I was at dinner last week with a friend.

737
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:50.470
This I think happens all the time with Bernie and Canon Arthur.

738
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:54.820
But it was,
you know,
if you go,
boy,
there's a bell to ring in life.

739
00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:59.850
This guy comes up with and he's with his daughter and he said,

740
00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:00.670
uh,

741
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:05.170
I just wanted to introduce my daughter to you cause I want to introduce her to

742
00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:10.150
the person who's making her college possible.
And you go,
wow.
I mean,
first off,

743
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:15.130
obviously not me.
But wow,
that's,
that is such an awesome story.

744
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:19.990
And that story is replicated over and over and over and over again at home
depot.

745
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:24.020
And it was uh,
both Bernie and Kenton,

746
00:48:24.021 --> 00:48:28.420
the north always talk about the home depot,
you know,

747
00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:30.680
you're going to have your mission statement and all the rest of the way.

748
00:48:30.681 --> 00:48:35.320
It's really about as wealth generation for your associates and it ties back if

749
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:39.280
it ties back to Jack's comment about leadership,

750
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:43.750
that that if,
if,
if the end you could say,
wow,

751
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.670
these people made their lives and careers from it,

752
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.730
that provides a great perspective on the job

753
00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.450
<v 0>after leaving home depot.
Since that time,</v>

754
00:48:56.451 --> 00:49:01.451
how have you created a pressure release valve for the worrying or a stress?

755
00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.473
<v 1>Uh,</v>

756
00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:10.810
the first great thing about retirement is the anxiety level drops dramatically.

757
00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.450
So,
so,
so,
uh,
the,

758
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.290
if you were in boots every day,

759
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:23.410
you know the thing about a retail businesses on your phone there,

760
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:27.320
your sales and the it organization is saying,
Gee,

761
00:49:27.321 --> 00:49:31.310
I can give you this by the minute.
No,

762
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.130
I really don't want it.
Excuse me.
I don't want it by the minute.

763
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:39.770
So that anxiety of everyday home depot just a report,

764
00:49:39.771 --> 00:49:42.570
its results and there great results.
And uh,

765
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:47.450
Craig Menear and so CEO now is doing a phenomenal job.
But it is that every day,

766
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.110
every day pressure on delivery.
Uh,

767
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:55.120
that's good to step away from and good to think about.
What are the,

768
00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:57.790
some of the other things you want to do in your life and um,

769
00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.990
focus some time elsewhere.

770
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:04.510
<v 0>What else when it creeps in.
Is there anything that you like to do,</v>

771
00:50:04.511 --> 00:50:08.710
any particular sports or morning routines or anything that you find helpful for

772
00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.750
managing your state?

773
00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.900
<v 1>Uh,
there are lots of,
there are lots of things</v>

774
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.040
<v 0>cause I think your retirement is busier than most people's careers in some</v>

775
00:50:20.041 --> 00:50:24.780
respects.
I mean you,
you,
you,
you certainly keep yourself occupied.

776
00:50:24.781 --> 00:50:27.830
So I'd be curious to hear what,
what routines,
habits or

777
00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.930
<v 2>ah,
so the habits are very different now.
I,</v>

778
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:35.930
I think probably I had a very non,
uh,

779
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:41.680
pretty much because of starting without a preset set of notions of what I was

780
00:50:44.661 --> 00:50:45.560
going to do at home depot.

781
00:50:45.561 --> 00:50:50.060
If you asked me what I did at the start of every day as CEO of Home Depot?
No,

782
00:50:50.061 --> 00:50:52.880
it's the con comparing contrast.
Let's,
let's,
let's do both.
All right.

783
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:56.690
You're okay with that?
So,
yeah,
so the,
so,
and I'm not recommending this.

784
00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:01.150
This is not a good tool,
but I started every day,
uh,

785
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:06.670
reading emails from customers and I did that because,

786
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:12.530
um,
because in any large organization,

787
00:51:12.531 --> 00:51:17.531
it's really easy to get a false sense from averages and percents.

788
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.500
And then you see a,
wow,

789
00:51:21.501 --> 00:51:25.520
we did that badly and it's a good,

790
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:30.790
it was a good marker for me of how we were doing and what we needed to focus on.

791
00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:36.470
And that kind of management by anecdote is actually pretty powerful.

792
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.770
But I would do that for like an hour early in the morning.

793
00:51:39.771 --> 00:51:43.310
I have always gotten up really,
really early.
Wasn't like what time is early.

794
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:47.990
So I get up about quarter of five and I'd usually be in the office by six

795
00:51:47.991 --> 00:51:52.490
o'clock and,
you know,
start reading emails.
Now I don't,

796
00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:56.110
I still get up really early.
Uh,
now instead,
uh,

797
00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:00.830
I start by,
by reading.
Um,
uh,

798
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:05.740
my wife and I,
uh,
at this was a habit introduced and,
uh,

799
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:09.980
and um,
I'm not,
I,

800
00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:14.090
I struggle with the notion of an intentional God.
My wife does not.

801
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:18.380
My wife is a strong believer in an intentional God and we pray in the morning

802
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:23.780
together and,
uh,
it was awkward.
You know,

803
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:26.490
I'm a New England does just,
you know,
oh gosh,

804
00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:30.260
if we don't do anything with anyone that,

805
00:52:30.261 --> 00:52:33.200
that level of intimacy and,
uh,

806
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:37.820
that's actually really an interesting habit to have.

807
00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.073
Uh,

808
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:44.840
because saying things aloud and hearing what's in her mind,
uh,

809
00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:47.930
and then,
you know,
sort of being forced in yourself,
okay,

810
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:53.500
what foot do,
what am I grateful for?
What am I seeking help for is,

811
00:52:53.501 --> 00:52:57.980
is really,
is really valuable.
Um,
so that's a different,

812
00:52:57.981 --> 00:52:58.820
different kinds of habits.

813
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.550
<v 0>So what is the format?</v>

814
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:04.210
You don't have to share the specifics unless you're open to doing that,

815
00:53:04.211 --> 00:53:07.120
but what is the format of,
of the prayer?
How long does it last?

816
00:53:07.121 --> 00:53:10.330
And you mentioned maybe some,
some sneak peaks,

817
00:53:10.331 --> 00:53:14.600
but I'd love to hear about that because,
uh,
I journal almost every morning.
Yeah.

818
00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:19.080
And it's,
I'm not speaking aloud,
but there,

819
00:53:19.081 --> 00:53:21.880
there might be some commonalities.
Yeah,
no,
I suspect.

820
00:53:21.881 --> 00:53:23.680
What is the format that you use?

821
00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.190
<v 2>So the format is there.
There's actually,</v>

822
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.040
<v 1>we have,
there's a lectionary that tells you what readings.</v>

823
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:30.450
So there are a series of readings.

824
00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:33.150
So you do a reading typically from the Old Testament,

825
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.490
the psalms and the new testaments typically how you got.

826
00:53:35.491 --> 00:53:38.340
So we read and then we pray.

827
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:42.420
And my prayers,
I've gotten better at it,
you know,

828
00:53:42.421 --> 00:53:45.900
because I do think to the extent you write it down and you say things,

829
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:47.640
it kind of gives context.

830
00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:51.540
And maybe in some way it makes it more likely to happen.

831
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:56.010
My prayers that tended to be,
you know,
I hope everything works out.

832
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.630
And boy am I grateful for everything.

833
00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:03.430
My wife would be very specific about,
uh,

834
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.730
and is very specific about this person needs help.
Uh,

835
00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.820
this is what I'm going to do to try to help this person.
My wife,

836
00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.220
I've paranthetically,
um,

837
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.840
worked for habitat for humanity.
That was her job.

838
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:23.140
And she goes to Haiti nearly every other,
well,

839
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:27.810
every month for a while.
She's going almost every other week.
So she's,
um,

840
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:31.230
she does a lot for other people,
but she will mention,
here's,

841
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.280
here are the people who are in need.
Here's what,
and um,

842
00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.510
so it's really helpful seeing,
okay,
that's what she's focused on.

843
00:54:39.511 --> 00:54:43.680
And then it teases out from me,
what should I be focused on?
Who needs help?

844
00:54:43.681 --> 00:54:44.580
What should I be doing?

845
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:49.260
<v 0>So if,
if people,
if someone were transcribing your prayers with,</v>

846
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:53.100
would there be certain categories that tend to pop up more than others?

847
00:54:53.101 --> 00:54:55.570
Like somebody who needs help and how I'm going to have to,
I'm grateful for,

848
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.890
I need help with X.
Are there,

849
00:54:58.891 --> 00:55:01.110
are there particular buckets that tend to pop up a lot?

850
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:05.820
<v 1>It's,
it's,
uh,
other people who need help.
Uh,
we had,</v>

851
00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:09.200
there's a separate thing of each time kind naming two things we're grateful for

852
00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:12.820
and what are we grateful for?
And it can be,

853
00:55:12.821 --> 00:55:17.500
I'm grateful to be on Tim Ferriss' podcast.
I'm Greg crave.
I,
it's,
it's,

854
00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:19.860
uh,
but it's,
uh,

855
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:24.880
it's a good mental exercise to say,
Hey,

856
00:55:24.881 --> 00:55:27.640
there was an enormous amount of stuff to be grateful for.

857
00:55:27.641 --> 00:55:30.490
And then there are people who need help and it's,
um,

858
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:36.280
and my wife has a much more powerful prayer than I am,

859
00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.920
but I'm learning,
I'm getting there.

860
00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.580
<v 0>I really,
I really liked that.
I don't,
I don't pray in the morning,</v>

861
00:55:43.581 --> 00:55:45.650
although maybe someone would,
uh,

862
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:48.740
would consider what I do a secular prayer perhaps.

863
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:53.210
But I do have a gratitude journal and I note the three things that I'm grateful

864
00:55:53.211 --> 00:55:54.170
for first thing in the morning.

865
00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:58.670
And then I have a handful of prompts that take four to five minutes,
find the am,

866
00:55:58.671 --> 00:56:00.110
and then I do a review in the PM,

867
00:56:00.111 --> 00:56:04.420
including what am I grateful for that happened today effectively.
Uh,
it's,

868
00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:09.140
it's very deceptively powerful.
Exactly right.
Exactly right.

869
00:56:09.141 --> 00:56:13.430
And like you mentioned,
uh,
or maybe I'm implying or inferring,

870
00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.750
it also helps to develop the lens through which you view the rest of the day.

871
00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:21.710
Right?
If you buy a car and then all of a sudden you go out and you see your car

872
00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:22.161
everywhere,

873
00:56:22.161 --> 00:56:24.310
it's not because everyone went out and copied you and bought your car.

874
00:56:24.311 --> 00:56:28.920
It's because you have that attuned,
selective attention.
Uh,
it's,

875
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:30.640
it's,
it's really,
really powerful.

876
00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:34.670
<v 2>Uh,
it's a powerful way to get to learn about another person too.</v>

877
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:39.960
So to get that sense of,
oh,
okay,
Yup.
This is what they're worried about.

878
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:41.910
This is how they think.
It's really useful.

879
00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:46.960
<v 0>I really love that it starts with somebody else who needs help and then grateful</v>

880
00:56:48.441 --> 00:56:49.160
for,
yeah.

881
00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:54.160
In the sense that it's not right off the bat beginning with your ask.

882
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:56.310
That's a really important,
yep.

883
00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.640
You mentioned checking or reading customer email.

884
00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:06.620
So I had read on,
I think it was consumers.com is probably elsewhere,

885
00:57:06.621 --> 00:57:11.420
but you gave out your phone number and email and uh,

886
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:15.560
I think that,
uh,
this is,
this is the line that I found on consumerist.
Use it.

887
00:57:15.561 --> 00:57:18.260
If you have a persistent problem with home depot that hasn't been resolved

888
00:57:18.261 --> 00:57:22.070
through normal customer service channels,
remember to be polite,
professional,

889
00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:26.720
and to the point.
And then there's a phone number,
extension,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

890
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:30.020
You can also email frank_blake@homedepot.com.

891
00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.170
How on earth do you triage that?
Did,

892
00:57:33.171 --> 00:57:37.130
did you get fewer email and expected fewer phone calls?

893
00:57:37.131 --> 00:57:38.510
Did you get diluted what happened?

894
00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:43.610
<v 2>Yeah,
there's a lot.
And we have a team.</v>

895
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.330
Uh,
I mean I think it was hugely important to do.

896
00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:51.880
I did it early on.
I still get customer emails.
Uh,

897
00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:56.510
but we set up an executive resolution's team and you know,
I'm not,

898
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:58.550
uh,
I learned,

899
00:57:58.551 --> 00:58:02.630
I learned the first weekend on the job when I mistakenly answered my phone,

900
00:58:02.631 --> 00:58:05.790
not thinking and got a customer that,
you know,

901
00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:09.380
those take a long time to get resolved.
So you have,

902
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:12.530
so we have a professional team,
uh,

903
00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:16.880
that goes through those and resolves them.
And um,

904
00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:22.070
but for me what was useful was you see patterns and you go,
okay,

905
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:26.540
this is what's not going well at.
This is consistent.
We're just,

906
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:32.000
it may not be numerically that,
you know,
percentage wise that high.

907
00:58:32.001 --> 00:58:37.001
But if somebody is taking time out of their day to email the CEO saying this is

908
00:58:39.111 --> 00:58:42.110
screwed up,
it's worth listening to.

909
00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:46.580
And then associates also knew my email and they send me,
you know,
hey,

910
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:49.910
this isn't going well.
If you've got to fix this,
you got to fix that,
whatever.

911
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:54.810
<v 0>What,
what,
uh,
what,
uh,
what are some of your favorite interactions or,</v>

912
00:58:54.811 --> 00:58:57.420
or better put lessons learned,

913
00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:02.070
tidbits of wisdom received from Bernie?
Marcus,
you said you learned a lot.

914
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:04.590
So are there any that come to aligned?

915
00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:09.930
<v 2>Uh,
it could be anything where you were like,
wow,
that's really useful.
Um,</v>

916
00:59:10.610 --> 00:59:13.120
the,
the first is,
uh,

917
00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:16.390
just as I said about avoiding the echo chamber,

918
00:59:16.391 --> 00:59:21.120
getting outside of the Echo Chamber,
uh,
Bernie,
uh,

919
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.980
has a

920
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.813
<v 1>crate.</v>

921
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:27.360
I think one of the things that makes home depot such a strong culture is that

922
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:31.390
one of Bernie's other early on comments to me was,
um,

923
00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:36.980
look,
you have a prominent job but you don't have a significant job.

924
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:41.330
You have prominent job cause you go out and talk to analysts and all the rest of

925
00:59:41.331 --> 00:59:42.820
it,
but the only significant job,

926
00:59:42.821 --> 00:59:47.420
so the job so that people who are helping customers and so everything you do and

927
00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:49.370
that again,
it goes back to the inverted pyramid.

928
00:59:49.371 --> 00:59:54.371
Everything you do is in support of your frontline associates and your customers.

929
00:59:55.670 --> 01:00:00.650
And that's how you have to think about the orientation of,
of your business.

930
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:05.890
Bernie also the quote unquote headquarters and Home Depot is not called the

931
01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:09.740
headquarters.
Uh,
it's called the store support center.

932
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.040
That's not that unusual in retail,
but it's a real,

933
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.840
the idea is you're there to support the store.
That's what you're there to do.

934
01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:23.630
<v 0>What are some of the other ingredients?
Those could be preexisting.
So before,</v>

935
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:28.660
before you arrived or changes that you and your team help to,

936
01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:34.910
to make,
uh,
that helped foster the orange apron cult,

937
01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:38.750
that sort of,
that dedication to customer service because it seems,

938
01:00:38.751 --> 01:00:42.860
at least based on what I'd read that you,
you really paid a lot of attention to.

939
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:44.270
I'm not going to say resurrecting it,

940
01:00:44.271 --> 01:00:47.630
but really reinforcing that as a core differentiator.

941
01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:53.100
<v 1>I,
so it goes through,
I mean,
I,
it starts with,</v>

942
01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:56.850
um,
and again this is,

943
01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.390
this is another Bernie Ism,
but,
uh,
you,
you,

944
01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.070
you need to take care of your associates.
And so,
uh,

945
01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:10.050
even when things were really tough and the housing downturn,

946
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:15.470
we were giving our hourly associates pay raises and bonuses when we weren't in

947
01:01:16.291 --> 01:01:18.240
the,
in the store support center,

948
01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:23.460
we pay our assistant store managers get stock grants,

949
01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.413
um,

950
01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:28.890
which I don't think any other retailer anywhere near the home depot size.

951
01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:34.020
And now those stock grants,
you know,
those are worth a lot of money.

952
01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.250
Uh,

953
01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:40.250
so getting them bought into an understanding that the success of the company is

954
01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:45.090
their success as well.
Also on pay,
we,
uh,
we have a very,

955
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:49.410
we instituted a very strong success sharing programs.
So,
you know,

956
01:01:49.411 --> 01:01:54.000
if your store does well,
the associates get an extra bonus.
Um,

957
01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:57.270
all of those things to say,
look,

958
01:01:57.271 --> 01:02:01.950
I can't expect an associate to care about paying attention to the customer if

959
01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:06.720
the company isn't caring about the associates.
Uh,

960
01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:12.410
we did lots of other programs and then a lot on the recognition and reward side

961
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:16.290
to reinforce the culture of the company.

962
01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:21.000
But you do actually have to focus on how pay people to yeah,
I mean,
you know,

963
01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.710
there's only so much you can do

964
01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:26.310
without addressing.

965
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:31.430
You got to be creating opportunities for wealth generation for your team.

966
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:34.080
And that's what's got to be,
as I said,

967
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:37.380
that's what's got to be exciting to you and what's gotta to be driving

968
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:41.020
<v 0>[inaudible] uh,
one of the,</v>

969
01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:46.410
one of the bullets that was suggested to me as a point to explore with you,

970
01:02:47.561 --> 01:02:51.660
it's in fact the number one that was suggested by this friend of mine is

971
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:56.080
accountability.
And now this is what he wrote.
Every time something went wrong,

972
01:02:56.081 --> 01:03:00.240
he took responsibility even right before he left home depot and the trends,
uh,

973
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.130
even right before he left home depot and a transition plan was set up,
there was,

974
01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.910
there was a security breach,
I think it's 56 million credit card numbers or so.

975
01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.670
And frank took the blame also fix things fast.

976
01:03:09.671 --> 01:03:12.760
He has uncanny self awareness quite separately.

977
01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.400
I had wanted to chat about this.

978
01:03:15.401 --> 01:03:20.290
So the incident response room that was set up on the 20th floor of Home Depot,

979
01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:23.460
not headquarters,
the store support center,

980
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:28.240
how did you handle that crisis?
What was your thinking process?

981
01:03:28.241 --> 01:03:32.840
Can you just take us through that?
Because,
uh,

982
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.390
I really like to kind of explore the macro by digging into the micro.

983
01:03:37.391 --> 01:03:38.860
So should we,
maybe we can talk about this.

984
01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:43.690
<v 1>Uh,
so home depot,
we had a data breach in,
um,</v>

985
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:46.860
September of 2014,
uh,

986
01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:50.470
in the sort of Ironic,
uh,

987
01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.660
commentary in August,

988
01:03:52.661 --> 01:03:56.440
we had actually spent a half a day going through with our board why we thought

989
01:03:56.441 --> 01:04:00.550
we were in pretty good shape and weren't going to have a data breach.
But,
uh,

990
01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.560
obviously,
obviously we did,
uh,
we had a couple of,

991
01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.770
um,
so once we knew,
uh,

992
01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:13.860
we went out and made a public announcement right away.

993
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:18.640
Uh,
and my principals were,

994
01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:20.810
and I don't,
I've,
I,

995
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:25.300
I think there was a very nice article written on,
Hey,

996
01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:30.580
you've accepted accountability for this.
And another way to look at it is,
well,

997
01:04:30.581 --> 01:04:35.020
I mean really,
I mean you had to,

998
01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:39.850
I mean I that wasn't the not a serious choice.
Uh,

999
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:41.860
and understand,

1000
01:04:41.861 --> 01:04:46.861
and this is where it actually helped being a lawyer and understand that the help

1001
01:04:46.931 --> 01:04:51.270
that the lawyers are going to give you is not help because the lawyers are going

1002
01:04:51.271 --> 01:04:52.510
to say things like,

1003
01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:55.600
well don't admit that you did anything wrong because then you're going to be

1004
01:04:55.601 --> 01:05:00.601
subject to litigation and all the rest and you got to understand that actually

1005
01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:03.790
all that matters is taking care of your customers.

1006
01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.750
So I actually gave the Pan,

1007
01:05:07.751 --> 01:05:12.751
I said nothing is going to be written about what we do here from our legal team.

1008
01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:14.380
Love our legal team.

1009
01:05:14.381 --> 01:05:18.190
We had great lawyers but it's all going to be written by our person in charge of

1010
01:05:18.191 --> 01:05:19.090
communications.

1011
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:24.150
And all we're going to talk about is as a customer you're not liable and here's

1012
01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:25.960
what we're doing for you.

1013
01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:29.860
And then we just decided we were going to be completely transparent.

1014
01:05:29.861 --> 01:05:31.930
So every time we knew something we said something,

1015
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:36.880
it was really painful because the nature of these things is that you don't

1016
01:05:36.881 --> 01:05:41.170
really know what's going on.
It unfolds over time.

1017
01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:46.330
So we'd have one release after another.
It felt like we were constantly,

1018
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:50.450
uh,
in the barrel,
but I think,
uh,

1019
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:55.860
people appreciated that we were being transparent and focused on taking care of

1020
01:05:55.931 --> 01:06:00.340
our customer and we didn't really see any significant decline.

1021
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:05.950
<v 0>Was that a difficult or an easy conversation to have in terms of how you were</v>

1022
01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.990
choosing to respond?

1023
01:06:08.991 --> 01:06:13.700
Do you remember like sitting down and having that first conversation or any of

1024
01:06:13.701 --> 01:06:14.140
those?

1025
01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:18.560
<v 1>I do.
We set out here are,
here are three principles.</v>

1026
01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.790
It's the only thing that matters is how we communicate to the customers.

1027
01:06:21.791 --> 01:06:26.640
The second thing is I tell people just recognize it.

1028
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.680
The second principle is recognize no one is going to say massive data breach at

1029
01:06:31.871 --> 01:06:33.790
home depot.
Everybody did things right,

1030
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:39.160
so understand we screwed up.
Don't worry about that,

1031
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:40.660
worry about fixing it.

1032
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:45.520
And I was really pleased and I give a lot of credit to our CIO at the time.

1033
01:06:45.521 --> 01:06:46.031
Met Carrie.

1034
01:06:46.031 --> 01:06:50.710
I was really pleased that the experts who kind of came in and cleaned up the

1035
01:06:50.711 --> 01:06:52.720
situation,
uh,

1036
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:58.230
said that they saw less finger pointing CYA activity with home depot than

1037
01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:01.300
anybody else.
Uh,
so it was,
hey,

1038
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:04.900
let's just move forward and get this thing fixed.
Um,

1039
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:10.480
and uh,
we've,
we got through it.
It wasn't,
uh,

1040
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:11.943
I mean I,

1041
01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:17.800
there wasn't a lot of discussion about weighing other alternative approaches.

1042
01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:22.420
I was very fortunate because my board was entirely supportive of how we handled

1043
01:07:22.421 --> 01:07:23.980
it.
Um,
so

1044
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:29.040
<v 0>I would imagine having the legal credentials that you do also helps because you</v>

1045
01:07:29.351 --> 01:07:32.640
can think about it from the perspective of a general counsel,

1046
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:35.470
but the executive decision to do something different.
Exactly.

1047
01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:40.560
<v 1>And know that in the end the value gained from that is modest in terms of the</v>

1048
01:07:44.351 --> 01:07:48.670
value potentially lost by not being straightforward with,

1049
01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:50.390
with your customers.
In fact,

1050
01:07:50.391 --> 01:07:54.140
they are lawyer was 110% behind that too.

1051
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:57.520
<v 0>You mentioned the three principles.
Could you review them for us?
Yeah.</v>

1052
01:07:57.570 --> 01:07:58.140
<v 1>So it's,</v>

1053
01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:02.940
it was the customer as far as no Cya and fix the problem.

1054
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:03.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1055
01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:08.490
So recognize is related to a problem solving,

1056
01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:12.780
right?
It's like don't try to spin the facts might.
Yup.

1057
01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:15.560
Uh,
what,

1058
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:21.210
<v 2>were there any decisions that,
that,
that stick out for you as far as,
uh,</v>

1059
01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:26.000
the,
the most difficult or one of the more difficult decisions,

1060
01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:28.550
conversations you've had to,

1061
01:08:28.551 --> 01:08:31.400
you had to have during your tenure at home depot?

1062
01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:34.960
Are there any particular difficult periods?
Because looking at your resume,
it's,

1063
01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:37.940
I can imagine quite a few people think to themselves,
oh my God,

1064
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:39.380
this guy just bats a thousand.

1065
01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:43.940
Every time he steps up to the plate and find it very intimidating.

1066
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:48.750
Uh,
I think with,
with,
with some,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1067
01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:54.020
you know,
understanding,
but
any particular difficult times,

1068
01:08:54.021 --> 01:08:55.820
it doesn't have to be at home depot.
In fact,
I mean,

1069
01:08:55.821 --> 01:08:59.990
another question I'd like to ask,
and if this is a,
an easier way to go about it,

1070
01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:04.100
it could be thrown at anytime your career,
but a favorite failure.

1071
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:09.160
And when I mean by that is a failure that in some way set you up for later

1072
01:09:09.861 --> 01:09:14.300
success.
Uh,
is there any examples,
difficult times,

1073
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.520
difficult decisions or,
uh,

1074
01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:22.500
failures that ended up being for the better?
So it's,
it's,
uh,

1075
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:26.480
an embarrassing failure,
but I'll give a failure.

1076
01:09:26.481 --> 01:09:29.650
That was a great wake up for me.
Uh,

1077
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.540
so before I became CEO,

1078
01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.570
one of the things I did for Home Depot's I did our real estate.
And um,

1079
01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:43.220
as I mentioned,
my son work at the company is still works at the company,

1080
01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:47.540
but at the time had just come back from Iraq and was starting working in a store

1081
01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:50.300
in depot and was given a,

1082
01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:54.290
I take a temporary store assistance manager or a store manager,

1083
01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:57.290
can't remember exactly which out in Colorado Springs.

1084
01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:03.040
So I fly out there to see him and he's there with four or five of his colleagues

1085
01:10:04.191 --> 01:10:06.560
from who'd also just returned from Iraq.

1086
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:10.010
And they're telling the stories and I thought,
I worried about it as a parent,

1087
01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:13.520
but at the end of it I was just kind of overwhelmed by,
wow,

1088
01:10:13.521 --> 01:10:17.030
I didn't worry nearly enough these and,

1089
01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:21.950
and these people are just profoundly heroic.

1090
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.120
So that was the dent.
Then in the morning I say,
great frank,

1091
01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:30.720
I drive out and see your store and brand new store.

1092
01:10:30.721 --> 01:10:31.551
So it was a store.

1093
01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:35.840
I was responsible for brand new store and great,

1094
01:10:35.841 --> 01:10:39.140
here's the address.
And so I'm driving out to the store.

1095
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:42.020
I'd drive down,
I don't see it.

1096
01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:47.420
I kind of go three miles up.
Don't see it three miles back.
Don't see it.

1097
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:50.480
Do it again,
do it again.
Finally I see it.

1098
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:55.990
And the store is hidden by this massive berm along the roadway.

1099
01:10:56.870 --> 01:11:01.870
And there's this tiny little sign saying home depot and then the store itself,

1100
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:06.650
uh,
you know,
if you know the construction of the store,

1101
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.320
the store has beams where they shouldn't be.
I mean it was just,

1102
01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:14.130
and I go,
this was my job.

1103
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:18.300
<v 1>It was one,
we were doing 200 stores a year at the time.</v>

1104
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:21.930
This was my job.
This was a number.

1105
01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.970
I was just getting a number out to check my box.

1106
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:29.430
And this is my son's damn store.

1107
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.030
That's heartbreaking.

1108
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.600
And my commentary to myself was personalize this,

1109
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.240
make this personal feel.
It's personal.

1110
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:49.320
You're some may not be doing every job,
but pretend that there's somebody,

1111
01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.620
you know,
there's,

1112
01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.680
there are people at the end of these decisions and focus on that and don't check

1113
01:11:57.631 --> 01:12:01.590
a number of box.
Uh,
uh,
as I say,
not,

1114
01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.530
not a happy mistake,
a failure,

1115
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:09.180
but clearly a failure and one,
um,
hopefully,
hopefully I'll learn from.

1116
01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:11.270
<v 0>So the,
the,</v>

1117
01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:15.930
the word worry or worrying has come up quite a bit and it strikes me that

1118
01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:20.931
perhaps there are different species of worrying in the sense that there is maybe

1119
01:12:21.691 --> 01:12:24.990
passive worrying or something just eats at you and eats at you.
And it's,

1120
01:12:24.991 --> 01:12:26.820
as I heard someone say to me once,
uh,

1121
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:30.650
worrying is praying for what you don't want it,
but,

1122
01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:35.310
and then perhaps there are other forms of worrying that are more active.

1123
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.080
So when something is bothering it,

1124
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:41.730
bothering you or you see a potential risk,

1125
01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.610
what is the thought process or the,
the next steps for you,

1126
01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:47.861
what,

1127
01:12:47.861 --> 01:12:52.320
what had you then take it out of your head so it's not just acid in the vessel

1128
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:56.340
and do something with it.
Yeah.
And then any examples?
Well,
so there are different

1129
01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.940
<v 1>parts of wiring then just as you said,
Tim,</v>

1130
01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:03.520
there are lots of different ways of worrying on a personal level.
I,

1131
01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.970
you know,
I always found,
I just take the worry to,
okay,

1132
01:13:06.971 --> 01:13:10.480
here are a series of things that can go wrong.
Every single thing goes wrong.

1133
01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.570
And I mean,
you could ask my kids,
I joke,

1134
01:13:13.571 --> 01:13:16.630
I always figured I'd end up driving a taxi or an Uber.

1135
01:13:16.631 --> 01:13:20.390
Now just follow it all through and you're driving a taxi and eh,
you know,

1136
01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:24.190
that's not the end of the world.
And just deal with it that way.

1137
01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.440
Uh,
the more constructive worrying is,
uh,

1138
01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:33.190
when you,
when you actually try to break it down and say,
okay,

1139
01:13:33.191 --> 01:13:36.070
what am I worried about?
What?
And,

1140
01:13:36.130 --> 01:13:41.130
and typically the answer to that is take the worry from the generic and move it

1141
01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:47.380
to some level of ground engagement.
Go check it out.

1142
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:50.680
Go check it out.
Go figure out what's actually happening.

1143
01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.710
Odds are you'll be less worried.
And even if you're not less worried,

1144
01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:57.050
odds are you'll actually have an answer to how to deal with it.

1145
01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:01.800
<v 0>So step number one is fact finding or,
yeah.
All right.
So,
uh,</v>

1146
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:05.250
I read a great book many years ago.

1147
01:14:05.251 --> 01:14:08.550
So this is another book that has traveled with me.
Yeah.
One of the others.

1148
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.130
So along with,
uh,
the story of Home Depot,

1149
01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:16.180
there was one called how to stop worrying and start living by Dale Carnegie.

1150
01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:20.530
And
it's a fantastic book.

1151
01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:24.070
And one of the first steps is,
is this fact finding,
right?

1152
01:14:24.071 --> 01:14:26.110
Like don't assume that you're worried as well founded.

1153
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:27.990
Don't assume you figured it out.
All right.

1154
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:33.220
Go do some fact finding after you've done that,
whether you're,

1155
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.160
let's say you,
perhaps you're less worried,
perhaps you're more worried,

1156
01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.390
but still worried nonetheless.
All right.
This is a legitimate risk.

1157
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:42.370
What do you do then?
I,

1158
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:45.820
so if you ask the people who work for me at home depot,

1159
01:14:45.821 --> 01:14:50.740
and it's sometimes joke about this,
that I just would,
doing anxiety transfer,

1160
01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:57.010
just go,
okay,
hey,
here's my observation.
This isn't going well.
You got it.

1161
01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:01.990
Yep.
You got it.
You Go.
I had each rants and I think,

1162
01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.740
and that is my view of careers.
Careers exist.
People,

1163
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:12.740
people progress in their lives through solving bigger and bigger problems.

1164
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:15.730
So you can go here,
here's a problem,
here's what I see.

1165
01:15:15.731 --> 01:15:18.310
Here's a developmental opportunity for developmental opportunities.

1166
01:15:18.311 --> 01:15:22.540
See if you can go fix this.
Uh,
you know,
I was wondering,

1167
01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:23.380
as you said it would,

1168
01:15:23.381 --> 01:15:26.830
anxiety transfer would mean a friend of mine and he's a humorous,

1169
01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:28.930
also a fantastic writer named Aga Jacobs.

1170
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:31.830
He rides for Esquire among many other things.
It does.

1171
01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:36.920
And at one point he was experimenting with outsourcing to India,

1172
01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:38.560
the Philippines and so on.

1173
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:44.100
And he was trying to broaden the number of tasks that he could delegate to

1174
01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:45.843
someone else.

1175
01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.140
Keeping in mind that this is all a bit tongue in cheek and one of the things he

1176
01:15:50.141 --> 01:15:53.210
did,
because he is a real warrior,
uh,

1177
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.320
and he decided to outsource is worrying.

1178
01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.030
So whether it was a book deadline or something else,

1179
01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:03.400
you would ask someone in Bangalore to worry about it for him.
And he told me,

1180
01:16:03.401 --> 01:16:04.520
he said it actually worldwide,

1181
01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:09.010
just to know that someone would worry about it on my behalf.
I love that.

1182
01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:12.130
I love that.
That's terrific.
Outside of store,

1183
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:15.610
what if,
if,

1184
01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:20.670
what advice did you give to your successor at Home Depot?

1185
01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.760
Was there,
did you have sort of a presidential meeting?
Like,

1186
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:26.950
let me tell you a few things that I've learned in the trenches.

1187
01:16:26.951 --> 01:16:30.700
Few things to keep in mind.
Did you,
did you have that conversation?
Uh,
I'm sure.

1188
01:16:30.701 --> 01:16:34.260
I'm sure we did,
but I'm sure he also didn't need it.
And

1189
01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:40.520
let's say someone,
let's say that it were someone coming in fresh,
right?
So they,

1190
01:16:40.521 --> 01:16:42.460
they didn't have the experience with Home Depot.

1191
01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:45.370
What advice might you have given them,
uh,

1192
01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.770
aside from what we've discussed so far,
is there anything you would add?

1193
01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:51.930
I think it's,
it's,
um,

1194
01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:57.340
listening and how important listening,

1195
01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:02.400
communicating and getting your whatever it is you want as simply stated as

1196
01:17:04.001 --> 01:17:05.890
possible.
I'm,
uh,

1197
01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.280
so this is the other part of the legal side

1198
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:15.410
<v 1>is,
uh,
and I can't remember who said it,
but there is,</v>

1199
01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.680
what you always want to get to is simplicity.

1200
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:20.600
That's on the other side of complexity.

1201
01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:25.940
That's the goal for whatever it is you're working on.
And when you get there,

1202
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:30.040
you know,
you've got it.
And you know,
you really understand it.
Um,

1203
01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:33.530
and whenever you find yourself just bound up in complexity,

1204
01:17:33.531 --> 01:17:35.840
you just know you haven't worked at hard enough.

1205
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:37.630
<v 0>How did you,</v>

1206
01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:43.270
you'd mentioned the simple importable messaging.
Yeah.
Earlier.

1207
01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:49.030
How would you suggest someone develop that skill or how did you develop that

1208
01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:49.864
skill?

1209
01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:54.160
<v 1>Think about stories I think is though is the way to start.
I mean,</v>

1210
01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:57.220
uh,
listening to your podcast,

1211
01:17:57.221 --> 01:17:59.980
listening to how you tease out things from people.

1212
01:17:59.981 --> 01:18:03.430
It's in the end you remember stories.
And so if you said,

1213
01:18:03.431 --> 01:18:07.540
this is where I'm trying to go and this is the story around it,
uh,

1214
01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:12.730
you can get pretty simple portable messages.
Um,
slogans,

1215
01:18:12.731 --> 01:18:16.990
don't do it.
It's much,
much better if you can say,
here's the story,

1216
01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:20.720
here's what it,
here's what it looks like because people respond to the story.

1217
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:26.030
<v 0>Do you remember any stories that you've told that have had a particularly large</v>

1218
01:18:28.051 --> 01:18:32.670
impact or that you've just received a lot of positive feedback,
uh,

1219
01:18:32.671 --> 01:18:35.520
about,
uh,
and it,
and it brings,

1220
01:18:35.521 --> 01:18:40.340
it hearkens back to you talking about reading these passages,
uh,
in your,

1221
01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.930
your very first sort of address the troops.

1222
01:18:42.931 --> 01:18:46.350
But are there any other moments that come to mind?
Could be one on one,

1223
01:18:46.351 --> 01:18:50.280
could be with a smaller group,
could be with the entire base of associates.

1224
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:55.490
<v 1>It's home depot related or more button.
Anything.
Alright,
so anything,
uh,</v>

1225
01:18:56.170 --> 01:19:00.040
so one of the fun things or doing a post home depot is a,

1226
01:19:00.190 --> 01:19:04.900
is a podcast listening to yours and go cash.
These podcasts are fascinating.

1227
01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:10.140
So we do something called crazy good turns that talks about people who do crazy

1228
01:19:10.181 --> 01:19:13.300
good things for others.
And there are great,

1229
01:19:13.930 --> 01:19:17.380
I love it for lots of different reasons,
but here's the story.

1230
01:19:17.381 --> 01:19:22.030
So we've been doing it for three years and there's one human story.

1231
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:23.500
All of the stories are wonderful,

1232
01:19:23.501 --> 01:19:27.880
but there's one in particular that I particularly love.

1233
01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:31.750
There's a woman,
uh,
she happens to live in Atlanta.

1234
01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:36.810
She's now around 70 years old when she was three years old and she's described

1235
01:19:37.991 --> 01:19:40.030
very poor circumstances.
And you know,

1236
01:19:40.031 --> 01:19:44.830
her mom leaves her in the apartment and goes across the street to get groceries.

1237
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:49.090
She's in the apartment with her sister.
She's playing on the sofa.

1238
01:19:49.091 --> 01:19:53.320
She finds some matches down the cushion,
she'd lights them.

1239
01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:58.321
She's wearing cotton pajamas and she goes up like a match.

1240
01:19:59.410 --> 01:20:03.880
She's entirely on fire,
raced to the hospital,

1241
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:07.980
third degree burns covering most of her.
And again,

1242
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:11.340
<v 2>this is now 65,
67 years ago.</v>

1243
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:16.970
Massive blood transfusions for required skin graphs.

1244
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:21.900
Uh,
they put out an all point bulletin,
none a need for blood,

1245
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:27.240
a truck driver driving through the town.

1246
01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:30.240
Here's this stops,

1247
01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.740
donates blood and donate skin.

1248
01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:39.720
And apparently the skin graft is like one of the most painful operations ever I

1249
01:20:39.721 --> 01:20:40.554
can imagine.

1250
01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:45.600
Gets into his truck and drives on and you go,

1251
01:20:45.630 --> 01:20:50.370
I go.
If that's not the best,
I've,

1252
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:55.430
if that's not the best story ever of people doing something for someone else.

1253
01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:00.570
And then,
I mean,
just,
so that's my favorite.
Favorite story.

1254
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.650
You mentioned post,
Post Home Depot.

1255
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:09.540
What are you focused on these days?
Uh,

1256
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:14.090
what types of projects or keeping you,
keeping your mind occupied?
So the,

1257
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.840
so this crazy good turns podcast,
uh,
have,
uh,
a lot of fun with,

1258
01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:22.290
I don't do most of the work on that.
Uh,
the cofounder with me,

1259
01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:24.920
Bradshaw does the real work.
Um,

1260
01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:30.530
and we worked together at home depot and it goes to the message and the story

1261
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:35.870
and what Brad did at home depot was a lot of that storytelling of how you get

1262
01:21:38.611 --> 01:21:41.670
these messages that are portable,
that people understand.

1263
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.710
Was he in comms or was he exactly,
he was head,

1264
01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:47.460
he was a head of our corporate communications

1265
01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:53.670
and did just a phenomenal job.
And so we have great fun working on this podcast.

1266
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:57.760
Uh,
and then the,
uh,

1267
01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:02.970
when I started retirement,
I had this elegant theory or I thought it was elegant.

1268
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.850
I said I got to spend a third of my time on business stuff,

1269
01:22:05.851 --> 01:22:09.120
third of my time on personal stuff and that third of my time giving back.

1270
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:15.590
And that actually is turns out to be sort of a useless way to think about it.

1271
01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.160
Why is that?
Well,
um,

1272
01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:25.530
it's sort of choppy and it's not continuous enough.

1273
01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:29.670
And um,
it struck me recently,

1274
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.980
so in November I got to spend a day,
this is an interesting story in itself.

1275
01:22:34.981 --> 01:22:37.980
I got to spend a day traveling around with Ken Langone,
who,

1276
01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:40.470
Ken is one of the Co founders of Home Depot.

1277
01:22:40.471 --> 01:22:44.040
He was my lead director at the start of Home Depot.

1278
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:48.870
And he's just one of the life's phenomenal people.

1279
01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:53.800
And I realized at the end of it that really what I want to learn is I,
I,

1280
01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:58.890
I want to figure out how to be authentically generous and whatever it is I'm

1281
01:22:59.611 --> 01:23:03.480
doing.
I mean,
some people pay me for help.
Some people don't pay me for help.

1282
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:06.460
People who pay me for,
I'll probably frustrated

1283
01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:11.050
<v 1>by it,
but,
uh,
it's generosity.</v>

1284
01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:11.501
How do I,

1285
01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:16.120
so putting that piece together with Welch's final advice and how did you learn

1286
01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:20.590
to do that?
And it doesn't,
it's not something that comes naturally to me.

1287
01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:22.910
Uh,
I'm not the kind of person who,
you know,

1288
01:23:22.911 --> 01:23:25.630
you see the beggar on the street and I reached in my pocket and give a buck.

1289
01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:27.670
I'm much more of the kind of person who's going,
oh,

1290
01:23:27.671 --> 01:23:31.630
that's not really going to help him for the following reason.
Um,

1291
01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.900
but that's my,
so that's what I'm working on.

1292
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.530
I'm trying to figure out how to be more genuinely helpful and generous.

1293
01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:42.870
<v 0>How are you working on it?
So,
because it seems like,
just like with worry,</v>

1294
01:23:42.871 --> 01:23:45.030
you have subsets of worry,

1295
01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:48.410
there are many different ways to be generous and it,

1296
01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.670
it might mean different things to different people.
Yeah,
exactly.

1297
01:23:50.671 --> 01:23:55.200
So how are you working on,
yeah,
so,
and I don't,
and I'm way short,

1298
01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:58.100
right way,
way,
way,
way short of,

1299
01:23:58.110 --> 01:24:01.590
but I know if you kind of work right to left and you go,

1300
01:24:01.591 --> 01:24:06.480
what do I want people to say?
I'd love them to say that at,
you know,

1301
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.460
whenever,
uh,

1302
01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:13.050
<v 1>so,
so there are small things,
um,
in terms of,</v>

1303
01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:17.160
uh,
just giving money,

1304
01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:20.100
giving money is one way to do it.

1305
01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:25.190
I'm trying to be helpful when you do it so that it's not just writing a check

1306
01:24:25.831 --> 01:24:29.460
and it actually takes a lot of thought.
I've learned this,
you know,

1307
01:24:29.461 --> 01:24:33.390
I get to hang around a fair amount with Ken and with Bernie and Bernie.

1308
01:24:33.391 --> 01:24:36.780
Now what he does is his foundation.
That's what Ken does.

1309
01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:40.890
I you think about doing that and how you actually think about being helpful to

1310
01:24:40.891 --> 01:24:45.490
people as you're generous with your own resources.
Um,

1311
01:24:46.710 --> 01:24:51.330
it's learning and I can tell there are some things I do where I think I'm being

1312
01:24:51.331 --> 01:24:54.450
helpful where people go,
God,
that's fascinating,
but keep your help

1313
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:58.050
<v 0>do yourself.
And other things I do where,
where I think I'm,</v>

1314
01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:02.020
I'm a little more successful on where,
where do you think,

1315
01:25:02.021 --> 01:25:05.200
what falls in the latter category of,
uh,

1316
01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:08.620
<v 1>particularly people who are starting things,
um,</v>

1317
01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:11.110
and uh,

1318
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:16.710
for whatever reason in dealing with their own anxiety,
uh,

1319
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:21.750
find it helpful to talk to somebody else who's got some perspective and can help

1320
01:25:22.391 --> 01:25:27.391
them feel like they're making progress on whatever direction they're they're

1321
01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:29.290
going.
Um,

1322
01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:34.650
and I think one of the great things that's true now that wasn't true,

1323
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:38.290
you know,
when I was throwing up,

1324
01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.320
is that people are actually really willing to take some risks and do things and

1325
01:25:43.421 --> 01:25:47.320
start their own businesses and start their own charities and step out.

1326
01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:51.370
And that's phenomenal.
And helping.
That is great.

1327
01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.280
<v 0>So there,
there are probably hundreds of thousands,</v>

1328
01:25:55.281 --> 01:25:58.520
maybe millions of entrepreneurs listening to this.

1329
01:25:59.330 --> 01:26:02.240
And I'd love to go to some of my,

1330
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:07.160
my well-worn rapid fire questions,
but I might tweak it a little bit.

1331
01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:10.430
So I very often ask about the most gifted books or most re-read,

1332
01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:15.280
which I'll probably ask anyway,
but we're going to back into that by asking,
uh,

1333
01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.670
if are there any particular books you would recommend,

1334
01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:25.120
if you could recommend to say two or three books could be more to an

1335
01:26:25.161 --> 01:26:29.990
entrepreneur,
maybe they're a year into their business or in the early stages.

1336
01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:33.650
Uh,
doesn't necessarily have to be early stages.
I'm,

1337
01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:35.150
I know I'm adding a lot of qualifiers here,

1338
01:26:35.151 --> 01:26:37.430
but what books might you recommend to them?

1339
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:42.790
<v 2>Uh,
so we talked about one of them built from scratch I think is,
uh,</v>

1340
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.020
is just a great book.

1341
01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.680
And any entrepreneur should read it saying this,

1342
01:26:50.621 --> 01:26:52.570
not because I'm on this podcast,

1343
01:26:52.571 --> 01:26:56.950
but because I started listening to your podcasts and I think your books are

1344
01:26:56.951 --> 01:26:59.470
phenomenal.
And I think,
uh,

1345
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:03.690
what's great about them is,
uh,
that,

1346
01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:07.870
that you make an effort to kind of pull out from people.

1347
01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.900
Here's what I think is,
you know,

1348
01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:15.130
kind of a core part of what makes whatever it is I do successful.

1349
01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:19.660
And as a reader or as a listener,
I can kind of choose.
I could say,
yeah,
okay,

1350
01:27:19.661 --> 01:27:23.070
that makes sense.
Or No,
boy,
that person's just wait,
wait,
wait,

1351
01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.610
doing something different.
And I don't believe,
uh,

1352
01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:31.570
I don't believe that there's any one particular,
you know,

1353
01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:36.510
I as a business person,
I love Jim Collins is good,
you know,

1354
01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.880
good,
great.
But you can also look at that and go,
oh,

1355
01:27:39.881 --> 01:27:43.930
this is fascinating because the companies that were originally in good to grade

1356
01:27:43.931 --> 01:27:48.520
are now not so great,
not even existing.
So,

1357
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:49.120
uh,

1358
01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.740
so you have to be willing to understand that there are lots of different stories

1359
01:27:54.010 --> 01:27:58.150
and then you find your own within that.
Um,
so I,

1360
01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.380
so I give your book because I think it's,
I think it's very cool.
I think it's,

1361
01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:06.820
I think it's much more,
uh,

1362
01:28:07.150 --> 01:28:12.150
people have to have more respect for differences and different ways of

1363
01:28:13.331 --> 01:28:16.210
approaching problems is no one path,
no one path.

1364
01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:21.320
<v 0>Are there any books besides built a from scratch that you've gifted a lot to</v>

1365
01:28:21.421 --> 01:28:23.460
other people or re-read a lot yourself?

1366
01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:27.240
<v 2>So the book I tend to gift people is not,</v>

1367
01:28:27.241 --> 01:28:30.390
has nothing to do with uh,
um,
business.

1368
01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:35.160
It's a book by a writer called Clive James and it's called Cultural Amnesia.

1369
01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:37.200
And,
uh,

1370
01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:42.500
first off he writes a w he is so learned that,

1371
01:28:45.690 --> 01:28:48.560
uh,
you just want to read what he has to say.
So He's,

1372
01:28:48.570 --> 01:28:52.500
and I assume he's not making this up,
but you know,
he says,
well,
you know,

1373
01:28:52.501 --> 01:28:55.440
I wanted to read Proust,
but I didn't know French.

1374
01:28:55.441 --> 01:29:00.360
So I started with the La Rousse and start learning French.
And you go,
okay,

1375
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:02.010
anybody who do that,
I'm

1376
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:03.750
<v 1>interested in what he has to say.</v>

1377
01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:08.990
But the book is interesting because it talks about,
uh,

1378
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:14.030
to me it's interesting because it talks about how World War Two and the guilt

1379
01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:16.650
around World War II,

1380
01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:21.120
particularly in Europe infected the,

1381
01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:26.810
all of the sort of liberal arts world and the unwillingness to actually face

1382
01:29:27.961 --> 01:29:29.880
into,
uh,

1383
01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:34.500
the fact that there was more collaboration than people wanted to admit.

1384
01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:39.920
And so oftentimes the people that were truly heroic,

1385
01:29:40.710 --> 01:29:44.130
our actual are actually,
uh,

1386
01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:49.700
heavily criticized because the people who are less than heroic couldn't stand

1387
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.020
the comparisons.

1388
01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:56.040
And you go through all of these different literary figures and you go,
Whoa,

1389
01:29:56.940 --> 01:30:00.660
didn't know that backstory.
That's pretty interesting.

1390
01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:02.700
<v 0>So it's cultural amnesia.</v>

1391
01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:07.620
Is it a collection of examples in narratives related to,

1392
01:30:08.370 --> 01:30:10.290
I'm just trying to make sure I'm clear.

1393
01:30:10.291 --> 01:30:14.820
Different different authors and these are people who are chopped down by their

1394
01:30:14.821 --> 01:30:18.690
contemporaries because of their success.
Yeah.
Huh.
Yeah.

1395
01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:23.240
<v 1>[inaudible] or venerated now,</v>

1396
01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:27.860
but no one really sees through to,
hey,

1397
01:30:27.861 --> 01:30:30.530
maybe,
maybe there's,

1398
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:33.290
they're more feet of clay and then want to say,

1399
01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:37.590
<v 0>it makes me think of,
uh,
that sounds fantastic.
I want to check that out because,</v>

1400
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:40.020
and then do you give that to people?
Well,

1401
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:42.780
let me spit out what it was on top of my brain,
which was,

1402
01:30:42.810 --> 01:30:46.170
it reminds me of a quote from Francis Ford Coppola when he was being interviewed

1403
01:30:46.171 --> 01:30:49.620
by a friend of mine,
Robert Rodriguez,
who's here in Austin filmmaker.

1404
01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.330
And I think it was during this interview that he said,
I'm paraphrasing,

1405
01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.910
but of course Francis Ford Coppola,
one of the greats.

1406
01:30:57.180 --> 01:31:00.180
And he said the same things that get you fired when you're younger.

1407
01:31:00.230 --> 01:31:01.830
The things that give you lifetime achievement award,

1408
01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:07.220
which I thought was great.
A keen observation.
Uh,

1409
01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:12.990
do you give this to,
do you give this to people to embolden them,

1410
01:31:12.991 --> 01:31:17.970
to give them courage to do things with the expectation of facing that type of

1411
01:31:17.971 --> 01:31:20.430
blow back or why do you give this book?

1412
01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:24.410
<v 1>I,
I,
I give it first because,
uh,</v>

1413
01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:26.151
when he talks,

1414
01:31:26.151 --> 01:31:31.151
so the Cultural Amnesia is the subtext of what he's talking about.

1415
01:31:31.261 --> 01:31:36.261
But he also just is such a great observer of different writers and,

1416
01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:37.920
uh,

1417
01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:42.920
it makes you want to read all of the source material that he's writing about.

1418
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:47.340
So if you like reading books and I like reading books,

1419
01:31:47.370 --> 01:31:50.640
it's one of those books that first,
as I say,
you go,

1420
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:55.390
this may be the smartest human being who's ever put pen to paper and,
um,

1421
01:31:55.920 --> 01:32:00.280
just brilliantly smart.
And secondly,
that's an interesting

1422
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:03.250
<v 2>way to look at history and how history has impacted things,</v>

1423
01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:07.240
but it's more just do you love books and you love these,
these authors.

1424
01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:10.660
Are there any books that you've finished recently or that you're reading

1425
01:32:10.661 --> 01:32:14.680
currently?
So the book that I just finished recently,

1426
01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:18.250
I heart,
it's not a full fledged book,

1427
01:32:18.251 --> 01:32:22.810
so it's real short 300 arguments by Sarah Manguso.
Hmm.
Um,

1428
01:32:22.930 --> 01:32:24.910
and it's,
it's,

1429
01:32:24.911 --> 01:32:29.380
it's kind of a neat book because her objective is,

1430
01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:34.680
I'm going to reduce this book to the 300 things that you'd underline if I wrote

1431
01:32:35.351 --> 01:32:40.300
a real.
So it's got a lot of little,
it's,
it's uh,

1432
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:44.530
I mean you can read it in less than an hour,
uh,

1433
01:32:44.770 --> 01:32:49.540
but it's got a really,
it's,
it's kind of like Montanian it's like,

1434
01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:53.380
um,
little statement,
lots of Aphorisms,
little aphorism.

1435
01:32:53.381 --> 01:32:56.920
What's the theme of the book or,
great question.

1436
01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:00.370
And if I were a deeper reader,

1437
01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:03.520
I'd probably be able to tell you the theme and I'm,

1438
01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:08.560
I'm probably doing her book massive injustice by not knowing what the theme is.

1439
01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:13.750
To me it was sort of a random collectic mix.

1440
01:33:13.751 --> 01:33:17.440
I mean,
it just bounces,
bounces around with different observations,

1441
01:33:17.441 --> 01:33:22.180
some of which you go,
God,
that's brilliant.
And some of them,
ah,
but how do you,

1442
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:23.830
how did you choose that book?

1443
01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:26.080
And I guess the broader question is how do you choose books?

1444
01:33:26.081 --> 01:33:29.230
Because we all have finite time on this planet.
Yeah.
How did,

1445
01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:34.090
how do you go about choosing books?
So on that one,
uh,
and I can't remember how,

1446
01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:38.870
what the Path was,
the gut meet this guy who writes a blog,
Austin Cleon and

1447
01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:43.140
also an Austinite.
He's also here.
Oh,
no kidding.
All right.

1448
01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:45.400
So I don't know quite why I got steal.

1449
01:33:45.401 --> 01:33:48.700
Like an artist I think is one of his books.
He's a number.
So I,

1450
01:33:48.730 --> 01:33:52.720
so I start reading his blog and he talks about,

1451
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:54.160
and he had something that said,

1452
01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:58.270
here are the 15 best books I read in 2017 and I go done.

1453
01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:00.280
I've got to read the 15.

1454
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:05.190
And that was one of the books yet some others.
And I'm going through,

1455
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:09.910
I'm going to make this all 15.
Hello Austin.
Good work,
sir.

1456
01:34:10.490 --> 01:34:14.860
Uh,
this,
the next question is very much a left turn.
Uh,

1457
01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:20.170
and it's,
it's a hit or miss question.
So if it's,
if it's a flub on my side,

1458
01:34:20.171 --> 01:34:21.130
we can,
we can skip it.

1459
01:34:21.131 --> 01:34:26.131
But what is the purchase of $100 or less?

1460
01:34:26.690 --> 01:34:28.540
It could be $1,000 or less,

1461
01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:33.570
whatever that comes to mind that has positively impacted your life in the last

1462
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:39.640
year or two.
Does anything come to mind?
So if I can bump it up above $200.

1463
01:34:39.641 --> 01:34:42.730
Sure.
It's shoes.
All right.
So,

1464
01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:47.760
so recognize that I spent years walking concrete floors and you know what,

1465
01:34:49.651 --> 01:34:53.770
as I was saying on my back thing,
you know,
shoes are just hugely important.

1466
01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:58.771
So I got a shoe that I actually really like what's up?

1467
01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:04.520
What does the,
so does the same hopper choose Sam Hubbard?
Yeah.
And uh,

1468
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.690
yeah,
so to me finding it,
yeah.

1469
01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:11.290
<v 0>So all my,
all for the [inaudible]</v>

1470
01:35:11.370 --> 01:35:13.950
<v 2>last however many years,</v>

1471
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:18.540
I don't have the patience to actually get,
you know,

1472
01:35:18.570 --> 01:35:23.100
go through the right sizing.
And so I never wear the right size and,

1473
01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:26.940
uh,
it's just been an enormous frustration.

1474
01:35:27.210 --> 01:35:30.510
And I finally found a pair of shoes.
I really liked Sam Hubbard.
Yeah.

1475
01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:32.190
I big fan of shoes.

1476
01:35:32.290 --> 01:35:37.150
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
I,
I became fixated on shoes at one point because,</v>

1477
01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:41.650
uh,
as backstory I'd been extremely stingy.

1478
01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:45.920
Stingy sounds too scrooge McDuck cheap economical,
uh,

1479
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.050
for my entire life really.
I mean,
I was the guy who would have his,

1480
01:35:50.110 --> 01:35:52.970
his girlfriend complained about the single ply toilet paper and be like,
really,

1481
01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:56.860
really tell him like,
can we just get to apply?
This is terrible.
It's great.
And,

1482
01:35:56.861 --> 01:35:57.130
uh,

1483
01:35:57.130 --> 01:36:02.130
I would always buy the cheapest shoes that seemed comfortable and were tolerable

1484
01:36:02.650 --> 01:36:04.780
to my girlfriend a aesthetically.

1485
01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:09.840
And at one point I was in Panama talking to this wonderful woman woman who was

1486
01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:12.840
the wife of,
uh,

1487
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:18.250
this gent who at one point had owned the largest brewery in Panama,

1488
01:36:18.251 --> 01:36:22.840
maybe Central America and a really wise woman.
And she said to me,
you know,
Tim,

1489
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:25.900
cause she was looking at my shoes and had nothing appropriate for Panama.

1490
01:36:26.290 --> 01:36:30.490
And she said,
there are two places you should really spend money.

1491
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:31.780
She said if necessary,

1492
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:36.730
your mattress and your shoes because if you're not in one,

1493
01:36:36.731 --> 01:36:40.810
you're going to be was like
phenomenal advice.

1494
01:36:40.811 --> 01:36:45.580
So the same Humbard I mean I,
I really pay attention to the shoes now because uh,

1495
01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:49.780
well I should say what contributed to that or reinforced it was my experience in

1496
01:36:49.781 --> 01:36:50.620
writing about cooking.

1497
01:36:50.650 --> 01:36:55.030
And you have line cooks or standing all day mall prep.

1498
01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:57.000
I mean they're standing all day and they,

1499
01:36:57.290 --> 01:37:02.160
a lot of them wear shoes designed for hospital use for their,

1500
01:37:02.161 --> 01:37:06.880
these slip on shoes that are used by nurses and doctors.
Fantastic.

1501
01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:11.000
All right,
well I have,
I have a shoe type to check out.
Uh,

1502
01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:16.900
if you were to teach a class to,

1503
01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:22.080
let's call it high school seniors or college students,

1504
01:37:23.531 --> 01:37:26.470
you could,
you could pick the grade and actually you could pick any grade.

1505
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:28.780
What class would you teach and why?

1506
01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:35.390
<v 2>Uh,
history,
history,
just because history is about people.
Uh,</v>

1507
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:39.800
history,
we learned so much from history.

1508
01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:45.140
I'd love teaching history.
Well I wasn't a great history student,
but after,

1509
01:37:45.141 --> 01:37:47.390
you know,
when you think about what books are fun to read,

1510
01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:51.620
it's great to read history books.
And so any particular focus,

1511
01:37:51.621 --> 01:37:53.780
what would the course description look like?
Uh,

1512
01:37:57.070 --> 01:38:00.840
I like American history.
I'm not that familiar with,
you know,

1513
01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:04.080
I haven't spent enough time to know the history of other countries,

1514
01:38:04.081 --> 01:38:09.060
but I think our history is,
is unbelievably complex and fascinating.
Cause

1515
01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:15.680
I been going through the Oxford history of the United States soar book by book.

1516
01:38:16.710 --> 01:38:17.543
Um,

1517
01:38:17.730 --> 01:38:22.730
and they get maybe more deeply and then I might want to,

1518
01:38:23.851 --> 01:38:25.470
but it's fascinating.
It's great.

1519
01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:30.500
<v 0>Is there any particular historical figure from us history and that was a little</v>

1520
01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.760
department of redundancy department,
but that's okay.

1521
01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:38.120
Is there any historical figure in the u s you would particularly have liked to

1522
01:38:39.091 --> 01:38:42.960
meet
or have dinner with his?
Anyone?

1523
01:38:43.170 --> 01:38:44.130
Anyone come to mind?

1524
01:38:44.370 --> 01:38:49.110
<v 2>Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Um,
for there,</v>

1525
01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.160
so there's so many,
right.
You could list more than you could.
You could,
you could,

1526
01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:57.750
uh,
have a lot of,
a lot of fascinating,
a lot of fascinating people.

1527
01:38:58.230 --> 01:38:59.130
I'd actually,

1528
01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:04.160
Truman is of Truman would be interesting in Eisenhower would be interesting.

1529
01:39:04.231 --> 01:39:08.070
I think both of those characters,
uh,
you know,

1530
01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:12.600
for the decisions they faced.
And obviously Eisenhower,
uh,
you know,

1531
01:39:12.601 --> 01:39:13.434
I think we,

1532
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:18.590
so he was the president that I grew up with and so much deeper than any picture

1533
01:39:21.691 --> 01:39:24.000
that we have of him that would be interesting.

1534
01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:30.160
<v 0>Eisenhower gets used a lot as an example by Peter Drucker is an executive as an</v>

1535
01:39:31.551 --> 01:39:32.240
effective,

1536
01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:36.310
<v 2>I believe that the military has so much,
I've had,</v>

1537
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:38.930
has so many great learnings on

1538
01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:44.000
<v 0>Bader Shit,
a lot to be borrowed low,
a lot to be barbed there for sure.
All right.</v>

1539
01:39:44.001 --> 01:39:45.430
Last last few questions.

1540
01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:51.380
If you could put anything on a billboard,
metaphorically speaking,
so a word,

1541
01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:52.273
a sentence,

1542
01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:56.030
a quote could be yours or someone else's to get out to millions or billions of

1543
01:39:56.031 --> 01:39:57.860
people.
What might you put on that?

1544
01:39:58.030 --> 01:40:02.280
<v 2>Uh,
the,
it would be,
uh,</v>

1545
01:40:02.770 --> 01:40:07.330
the only blessings you own or the ones you share.
And,
um,

1546
01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:08.650
that's,
you know,

1547
01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:13.360
that's the most fun thing about this crazy good turns thing is seeing the people

1548
01:40:13.361 --> 01:40:18.361
who live that every day who are seeing things.

1549
01:40:19.330 --> 01:40:24.330
I'm seeing plights people in need that others,

1550
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:27.280
I mean,
there's a great one.
I could go on and on about this,

1551
01:40:27.281 --> 01:40:31.450
but there's a great story on who knew that there were homeless people living in

1552
01:40:31.451 --> 01:40:33.160
tunnels under Los Vegas.

1553
01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:37.420
And then here's a guy who recognizes this and goes and takes care of the

1554
01:40:37.421 --> 01:40:42.010
homeless people in Tunnels and Las Vegas and you go,
wow,
that's amazing.

1555
01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:45.160
Got To more of that,
please.
Um,
so

1556
01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.290
<v 0>that's crazy good turns.
Yeah.</v>

1557
01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:50.950
If you want it to get someone hooked on crazy good turns.

1558
01:40:50.951 --> 01:40:53.980
Are there one or two episodes that you might,
they

1559
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:58.400
<v 2>start with?
Uh,
I've,
I would start at the start.
Um,</v>

1560
01:40:58.450 --> 01:41:02.170
so the team Rubicon,
we did early one on team Rubicon,

1561
01:41:02.171 --> 01:41:07.171
which is the group of Iraqi and Afghan war veterans who come back and,

1562
01:41:07.871 --> 01:41:09.790
you know,
people are probably familiar with them.

1563
01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:14.080
They use their military training to go,
you know,
if there's a flood,

1564
01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:17.380
they go and address the flood and amazing,

1565
01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:22.360
it's an amazing,
uh,
group,
uh,
early on.
I mean,

1566
01:41:22.361 --> 01:41:25.870
they're all,
I love,
uh,
you know,
it's like kits,
which,
which your favorite kits.

1567
01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:29.920
I just,
so that's the first one,
but every single one of them.

1568
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:34.210
And then I think the second one we did was,
uh,

1569
01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:38.440
um,
about tunnel to towers,
tunnels to tower.
You know,

1570
01:41:38.441 --> 01:41:43.441
the story of the guy who was the fireman on his day off.

1571
01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:45.130
And,
uh,

1572
01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:49.960
the twin towers are hit and he's driving in to help his,

1573
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.700
a fire,
you know,
his colleagues.
And the tunnel is by backed up.

1574
01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:59.760
And so he puts all his gear and runs through the tunnel to the towers and

1575
01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:06.000
unfortunately died.
And then there's now a,
um,

1576
01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:11.140
uh,
a run every year through the tower and commemoration of that.
But you know,

1577
01:42:11.141 --> 01:42:16.060
just people are,
so I,
I'd start with the start and the first ones,

1578
01:42:16.061 --> 01:42:18.940
but I love the mall there.
As I say,
it's like choosing among kids.

1579
01:42:18.941 --> 01:42:22.840
Why did you create it or why did you create it?
What's,
why put us into the world?

1580
01:42:22.841 --> 01:42:26.310
I mean,
I know it takes effort.
It,
uh,
it's the,

1581
01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:29.140
so if,
if,
um,

1582
01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:36.530
when we started it was,
uh,
my first comment to Bradshaw,

1583
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:40.540
the guy who does it with me was I,
if eight people listen to this,

1584
01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:45.600
I'll be thrilled because I just want to take someone who's done amazing things

1585
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:51.510
and talk about them and just have them have a notion that someone's going to

1586
01:42:51.971 --> 01:42:55.600
spend,
you know,
ours are short,
the 25 minutes,

1587
01:42:55.601 --> 01:42:57.550
25 minutes talking about the great thing they do.

1588
01:42:57.850 --> 01:43:01.060
And then Brad did such a good job of it.
But now we're saying,
okay,

1589
01:43:01.061 --> 01:43:04.810
we want people to listen to it.
But it's,
it's,
um,

1590
01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:09.670
it goes back to the concept of celebrating whatever it is you want.
Celebrate,

1591
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:14.200
highlight and highlight it and tell stories about it.
And,
uh,

1592
01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:18.070
we connect from hearing these stories and sometimes you go,
wow,

1593
01:43:18.071 --> 01:43:21.640
this person's just so much better person than I'm ever going to be that forget

1594
01:43:21.641 --> 01:43:24.490
it.
That's how the Ballpark,
but it's still inspirational.

1595
01:43:24.491 --> 01:43:27.790
And then some of them you go,
Oh yeah,
okay.
I can,
I can do that.

1596
01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:30.500
Maybe I'll correct course one day.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1597
01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.610
So for all of you complain that my interviews are too long,
uh,

1598
01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:37.660
I mean certainly many of you listen to the entire interview,

1599
01:43:37.661 --> 01:43:41.920
but if you'd like a short form fix,
you just check out crazy good turns.

1600
01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:44.410
And I'm going to make,
I don't do this very much,

1601
01:43:44.411 --> 01:43:47.380
but I'm going to make an ask of the audience and then I'm going to ask you if

1602
01:43:47.381 --> 01:43:50.440
you have any parting words,

1603
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:55.280
<v 0>advice or asks of the audience.
Uh,
it's,
uh,</v>

1604
01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:58.130
beyond checking out crazy good turns.

1605
01:43:58.131 --> 01:44:01.880
I would challenge everyone listening for a day,

1606
01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:05.660
maybe a week to not criticize,

1607
01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:10.520
so to,
to try to put into practice what we've been talking about and that is

1608
01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:15.530
highlighting and applauding what it is you want to see more of in the world.

1609
01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:18.260
If you,
if you see someone online who is doing something great,

1610
01:44:18.710 --> 01:44:21.680
who's making sacrifices for the,
for the greater good

1611
01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:28.540
practice applauding that because if you do criticize and the criticism online is

1612
01:44:29.141 --> 01:44:30.860
certainly 99% of what we see,

1613
01:44:30.861 --> 01:44:35.300
but you practice makes perfect even if the practice isn't a good practice.

1614
01:44:35.301 --> 01:44:37.460
So if you've,
if you focus on being critical,

1615
01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:41.870
you'll get better at it and it will become easier.
So for day,
for a week,

1616
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:46.310
try to focus on applauding what it is you want to see more of out in the world.

1617
01:44:46.311 --> 01:44:48.500
So that'd be my,
my challenge,

1618
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:51.320
my suggestion to everybody who is listening to this.

1619
01:44:51.321 --> 01:44:55.670
And I will do the same for myself.
I will eat my own dog food on that one.
Uh,

1620
01:44:56.420 --> 01:45:01.100
so,
uh,
any,
any parting words?
Well,
that's the questions.

1621
01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.660
I'm not going to begin to improve on that.

1622
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:08.200
<v 2>Brilliant.
And it is so true.
It's so true.</v>

1623
01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.420
If you take time to recognize and appreciate other people,
uh,
it bounces back.

1624
01:45:13.450 --> 01:45:15.040
It gives back and very cool.

1625
01:45:15.630 --> 01:45:19.780
<v 0>Perfect.
Well,
sorry to go first.
No,
but I want it to get that.</v>

1626
01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:23.880
I feel so strongly about it.
There's so much negativity out of the world,

1627
01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:28.800
out in the world,
you and I,
none of us have to create more of it.

1628
01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:30.210
There's a surplus of negativity.

1629
01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:34.130
So try to focus on increasing the positivity and,
uh,

1630
01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:37.140
you don't get the positive just by shutting down the negative.

1631
01:45:37.650 --> 01:45:40.410
That void doesn't fill itself.
Uh,

1632
01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:45.520
where can people learn more about you,
find you online if,
if,

1633
01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:48.390
if there is any way that you would like to share.
And of course,

1634
01:45:48.391 --> 01:45:50.340
everyone who is listening to this,

1635
01:45:50.341 --> 01:45:52.530
you can find the show notes with links to everything,

1636
01:45:52.531 --> 01:45:57.180
including crazy good turns and so on at Tim.
Dot.
Blog forward slash,

1637
01:45:57.181 --> 01:46:00.810
podcast.
But is there a,
are there any other places people can say,

1638
01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:02.460
say hello or learn more about what you're up to?

1639
01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:07.110
<v 2>Uh,
at Frank Bike on Twitter?
Um,
uh,
that's,</v>

1640
01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:10.650
that's how it blends the dominant in addition to the crazy good turns.

1641
01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:15.200
<v 0>Fantastic.
Well,
frank,
thank you so much for your time.
Thank you.</v>

1642
01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:17.670
This was a lot of fun and,
uh,

1643
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:22.490
for everyone out there on the interwebs,
wherever you may be,
as always,

1644
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:24.890
thank you for listening.
Talk to you next time.
