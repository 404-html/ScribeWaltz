00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.640
Microphone Check Jocko.
How are you sir?
I'm doing pretty good.

2
00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:07.030
How are you feeling?
Splendid,
especially given this,

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.630
this cocktail of adrenaline that you've been feeding me

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.730
<v 1>flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.</v>

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.220
[inaudible]

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.320
I'm a cybernetic organism.

7
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.150
<v 0>This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.</v>

8
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.920
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way,
set it and forget it.

9
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:48.270
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

10
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:49.020
investors.

11
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.740
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

12
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:55.770
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

13
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.120
some of my very good friends,

14
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.330
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

15
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.390
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

16
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.680
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

17
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:09.690
pay pennies on the dollar for them,

18
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.380
and this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

19
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:16.140
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

20
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.300
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

21
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:24.540
assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for

22
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:28.350
free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their

23
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:32.280
advice,
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

24
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:34.170
you can set it and forget it and here's why.

25
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.490
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

26
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:42.930
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't great investing

27
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:44.580
is a marathon,
not a sprint,

28
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.240
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax

29
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.370
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

30
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.870
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

31
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:58.590
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

32
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:01.200
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

33
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:05.370
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

34
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:06.870
impossible right off the bat,

35
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.420
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

36
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:14.421
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

37
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:18.750
free.
If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

38
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.880
that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.
Now,

39
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:25.500
normally when I have a sponsor on this show,

40
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:29.070
it's because I use them and recommend them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

41
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.370
I don't use wealth front yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

42
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.630
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of SCC regulations,

43
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.290
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

44
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:44.110
So I couldn't be a user and have them on the podcast,

45
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.220
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

46
00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:52.060
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

47
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.210
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

48
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.690
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

49
00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:02.590
you'll $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account,

50
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.620
but just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

51
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.790
Take two minutes,
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash.
Tim.

52
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.910
It's fast,
it's free.
There's no downside that I can think of.

53
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.460
Now I do have to read a mandatory disclaimer.

54
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.300

55

this episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things

graphic design related.

66
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.210
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

67
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.910
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

68
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:04.900
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

69
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.140
the brainstorming and a lot of it took place with designers from around the

70
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:12.340
world and here's how it works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

71
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.820
a website,
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

72
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.570
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

73
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.210
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

74
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.900
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

75
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:27.610
money back.
It's that straight forward.

76
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.300
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

77
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:33.700
things that I'll be sharing in the future.

Hello Ladies and germs.

83
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:52.390
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

84
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:55.630
it is my job to deconstruct world class performers,

85
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:59.680
whether they are chess prodigies like Josh Waitzkin actors and governor tells

86
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.490
like Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything in between professional athletes,

87
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.533
you name it,

88
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.370
I want to talk to them because you find that at the very highest level at the

89
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.640
top of the top in each field and across those fields,

90
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:17.050
their commonalities and I want to tease out the morning routines,
the habits,

91
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.250
the favorite books and so on that you can apply immediately to your life to

92
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.010
level up and this episode is no exception.

93
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.890
This episode was a very intense episode.

94
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.400
My guest is someone who very rarely does any interviews,

95
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.480
Jocko Willink,
j.
O.
C.
K.
O.

96
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.420
He is a legend in the seal community.

97
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.010
He's also 240 pounds or so,
230 to 240 pounds of lean muscle.

98
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.160
He would routinely tap out 20 or so navy seals as a workouts and CC Brazilian

99
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:48.364
Jujitsu,

100
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.410
a practitioner at a world class level and also trains professional MMA fighters

101
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:56.290
in his spare time.
But dialing back to the beginning.

102
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:58.670
Jocko grew up in a small new England town,

103
00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:01.940
enlisted in the navy after high school and spent 20 years in the seal teams.

104
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.620
During his second tour in Iraq,

105
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.950
he led seal task unit bruiser in the battle of Ramadi,

106
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.180
which was some of the toughest,

107
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.090
most sustained combat in the seal teams since Vietnam.

108
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.070
Under his leadership task unit,

109
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:16.310
bruiser help bring stability to Ramadi and became the most highly decorated

110
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:19.790
special operations unit of the entire war in Iraq.

111
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.530
Jocko is subsequently awarded the bronze star and Silver Star.
After that.

112
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:25.910
Returning from that deployment,

113
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.600
Jocko served as the officer in charge of training for all west coast seal teams,

114
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.630
which means he designed and implemented some of the most challenging and

115
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:34.580
realistic combat training in the world.

116
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.990
He also spearheaded the development of CEO Leadership Training and therefore

117
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:42.050
personally instructed and mentor the next generation of steel leaders.

118
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.970
In 2010 chocolate retired from the navy to cofound echelon front,
that's e.

119
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:50.510
C.
H.
E.
L.
O.
N.
Never knew how to pronounce that Echelon Front,

120
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.930
a leadership and management consulting company which teaches leadership

121
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:56.960
principles learned and proven in combat to help others lead.
And when,

122
00:06:56.961 --> 00:07:00.680
and this is very interesting because you can view combat in many ways as sort of

123
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:05.681
an exaggeration of many states in situations that one experiences in other areas

124
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:09.890
of life including business Jocko is last but not least,

125
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.450
the author of a brand new book,
extreme ownership.
That's the title.

126
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:18.380
And we get into what that means.
Uh,
I am really enjoying this book,

127
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.610
extreme ownership subtitle,
how US Navy Seals lead and win.

128
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.660
I highly encourage you check this book out.
Even if you just read the,

129
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.560
the intro and chapters one,
six and 12,
even if you just do that,

130
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:35.090
the book is worth many times the price.
So check it out.
I highly encourage it.

131
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.350
And you can find jocko@echelonfront.com e c h e l o,

132
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:43.820
n and also on Twitter.
I am helping train him to use Twitter.

133
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:46.620
A lot of these guys,
the uh,

134
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.360
Navy seals and other divisions of the military do not like to be public facing.

135
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:58.010
But Jocko is going to be on Twitter.
So at Jocko Willink,

O,
c k,
O,W ,

136
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.390
I,

So without further ado,
please enjoy this very intense,

143
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.510
very insightful conversation with Jocko Willink.

144
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.720
We do get into the weeds and I implore you,

145
00:08:26.721 --> 00:08:30.410
I encourage you to bear with us if we get into a bunch of military specifics

146
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.580
because there are gems throughout this conversation and even if you only take

147
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:38.930
one or two a way,
it is well worth the time invested.

148
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.360
So thank you for listening and please enjoy.

149
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.800
Okay,
we are alive,
Casa Ferris.
Jocko,
welcome to the show.
Glad to be here.

150
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.270
Thrilled to have you here.

151
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.110
And looking at your bio and talking to people who know you,

152
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.010
the number of topics we

153
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.640
<v 3>could discuss our are many and extremely interesting,</v>

154
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:02.130
but I'll start with this tea.
What is this?

155
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.880
I suppose it's a pinkish colored liquid that you've been consuming and that uh,

156
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.890
you've shared with me.
It's a pomegranate white tea,

157
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.000
which I believe hit your soul pretty well.

158
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.260
Well,
I was surprised because I expected it to have low caffeine content.

159
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.600
I was like,
sure,
I'll try the tea.
It sounds like,
you know,

160
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:23.910
with the pomegranate and I'm like maybe it would help with my cramps or

161
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:28.020
something and I'm pretty well lit up for someone who drinks,
you know,

162
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:31.480
Pooh air tea,
Oolong tea,
I guess sort of a,

163
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.360
a veteran of indirect caffeine consumption with,
with leaves.

164
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.910
I,
I've been impressed.
How long have you been drinking this?

165
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.240
I forget when I stumbled upon it,
but

166
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.760
we used to do some desert training back when I was in the seal teams actually

167
00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:49.460
when I was running the training on the west coast.
And,
uh,

168
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.710
I would have to sit through the platoons briefs as they were getting ready to go

169
00:09:54.711 --> 00:09:56.900
out in the field and do a field training exercise.

170
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.280
And the briefs were about an hour long and we'd be on three or four hours of

171
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.990
sleep a night for a few days.

172
00:10:02.991 --> 00:10:06.770
And so at some point I discovered this stuff and I would start drinking it when

173
00:10:06.771 --> 00:10:09.590
the brief kicked off.
And by the time the brief ended,

174
00:10:09.591 --> 00:10:13.730
I would have taken copious notes and be ready to get after the platoon

175
00:10:13.731 --> 00:10:18.590
commanders that were,
uh,
trying to give good briefs and I'd,
I'd,
I'd get after it.

176
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.690
You'd be fired up for feedback?
Affirmative.
Did.
And,
uh,

177
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.380
you mentioned that you don't normally consume caffeine.
Is that true?

178
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.800
I do not normally can consume caffeine.
Now,
when do you,

179
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.120
what are some examples of when you reserve a,

180
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.490
or or when you do consume caffeine?
What's the use of caffeine?

181
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.540
Some kind of long drive,
you know,
so,
um,
you know,

182
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.980
even my first deployment to Iraq,

183
00:10:42.981 --> 00:10:47.330
we did longer patrols in the vehicles and I would have,
you know,
uh,

184
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.750
right in front of my seat.
So sort of hanging in front of my seat,
I'd have a,

185
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:55.400
a flash bang grenade,
and then another Flashband grenade,
and then a frag grenade,

186
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:59.120
which is the grenade that you know,
kills people.
And then another frag grenade.

187
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:03.020
And then the next three patches were red bull,
red bull,
red bull.
So you know,

188
00:11:03.021 --> 00:11:04.640
if you're going on a long patrol,

189
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.300
and I know it might seem strange that you would get tired,
but you would,

190
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.770
you know,
and,
and so you crack open a red bull and get after it.

191
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:14.900
And then that's the kind of occasions I would save the caffeine intake for what

192
00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:17.630
now we haven't spent too much time together.
We've been hanging out.

193
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.110
And you had an ice tea?
I had a couple of coffees and I feel like I've,

194
00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:25.010
I've just belligerently unnecessarily punched my adrenal glands for so many

195
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.360
years that the coffee pretty much does nothing to me.
But,
uh,

196
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.410
you're an intense guy,
which has meant as a compliment.

197
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.510
What do you like on three red bulls

198
00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.030
more Jocko.

199
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.380
And how did you get the nickname Jocko?
Uh,

200
00:11:45.381 --> 00:11:48.440
actually my parents gave me that nickname.
Oh,
they did?
Huh,
that's,
that's uh,

201
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:54.190
my real name is John,
but ever since I was born I've been called Jocko.
So

202
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.750
<v 5>that's what everyone knows me as.
And uh,
when you,</v>

203
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:03.751
and of course we're going to talk a lot about your time deployed and a training

204
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.030
other,
um,
other people,

205
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.890
but let's take a look at your physique.
So,

206
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.820
so we were introduced through a p to Tiaa has also been on this podcast.

207
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.390
Very funny,
very smart guy.
And he said,

208
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:22.150
you have to ask Jocko about his weight gain.

209
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.200
Now this is not bad weekend cause right now you're about how much would you say

210
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.220
to 30,
to 35 to 30.
If you're agreeing you'd be at the health care big guy,

211
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.820
uh,
and uh,
very fit.

212
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.290
But when you entered the seals,
how much did you weigh?
One 74.

213
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.070
One 74.
Yeah.
Wow.
Well that's when I,

214
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.770
when I started seal training and weighed 174 pounds.

215
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.240
And how did that transformation take place?
I mean,
was it,

216
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:53.950
was it just an a growth spurt or were you facilitating that with a resistance

217
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:58.090
training?
How did that come about?
So I entered seal training and 174 pounds.

218
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.860
And you know,
everyone's seen what seal training is like.
It's a lot of pushups,

219
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.620
a lot of pull ups,
a lot of dips,
running,
swimming,
obstacle course.
Uh,

220
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.250
I just ate what they fed us,
which is what they feed you a lot.

221
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.030
And in the course of seal training I put on,

222
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.950
I think I graduated 185 pounds.

223
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.280
And then once I was done with that and started getting in seal platoons,

224
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.920
you know,
and we all lifted heavy and wanted to be big and strong.

225
00:13:20.921 --> 00:13:24.040
And so I lifted heavy and ate a lot.
And I think I put on,

226
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.990
I was up to 200 my first platoon.

227
00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:30.490
And then after that I got up to about two 25 and now depending on what's

228
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:31.211
happening in the,

229
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:35.050
in the fight game and who I'm training with and what they're preparing for,

230
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.970
I'll go up to,
you know,

231
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:40.810
to 42 45 if I need to and then come back down once,
you know,

232
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.000
those events are over.
So in other words,
I'll be,

233
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.840
if I'm training a guy that's a heavyweight or,
or fighting a heavyweight,

234
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.450
then I'll put on some weight so I can simulate that better.

235
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:54.170
What type of training would you suggest for people with type of regimen?
What,
uh,

236
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.640
what might a workout or a week look like for someone who wants to,

237
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.720
let's just say a male,

238
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.850
25 years old who wants to add a lean mass?

239
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.450
We dead lift and squat,
deadlift in squat.
I mean,

240
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:09.280
I think that's the universal answer,
right?
Yeah.

241
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.980
Does anyone say anything different when you're asked that question?
I don't ask.

242
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.200
I don't ask many people.
But you have,

243
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.850
you have such an incredible range of weight over that period of time that I had

244
00:14:18.851 --> 00:14:21.550
to ask.
I mean,
I think that is the right answer.
Um,

245
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.050
I think the eating is a lot harder than the training in some respects leads from

246
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.120
me.
I mean,
I got up to,
I'm walking around about one 75 right now,

247
00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:32.620
but I did to beat a friend and a bet,
which didn't even involve money.
So,

248
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:36.580
I'm not sure why I subjugated myself to this or subject myself to this,
but,
uh,

249
00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:40.200
I got up to like two 15 mm.
Uh,

250
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.060
the eating was a harder component.

251
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.290
I remember being on a deployment on a ship and so the food on the ship is not

252
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:50.410
good.
You know,
you're on a six month deployment on a ship and I was a seal.

253
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:51.980
And when you're on a ship,
as

254
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.090
<v 3>a CEO,
you're not,
you don't have,
you don't have a job other than just a workout.</v>

255
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.780
This is especially,
you know,
in the 90s.
So it was a totally different world,

256
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:03.470
the dry years because there's no war going on.
And I remember your,

257
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.880
we're all just trying to get huge.

258
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.970
And I remember getting a plates full of chicken mcnuggets or whatever brand they

259
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:16.010
serve in the navy.
And I would just be sitting there at a table,
you know,

260
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.850
for 40 minutes after chow was done being served.

261
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:23.360
And I'm just looking at these chicken nuggets and hating them and putting them

262
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:26.450
into my mouth and forcing them down in order to gain weight.
So yeah,

263
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.520
stupid,
stupid,
but requires dedication.

264
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:35.690
And there there's something to be said for,
you know,
if to use one of your terms.

265
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:38.870
I'm a worldclass chicken nugget eater when I need to be.

266
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.590
Uh,
let's talk about,
um,

267
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.820
the MMA and then we're going to come back to military.

268
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:51.410
When did you first get exposed to Jujitsu or martial arts?

269
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:57.070
So I'm on my first deployment in 1992 or 1993 and I'm in Guam and there's an old

270
00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:04.970
seal master chief named Steve Bailey.
And he was kind of known as a bad ass.

271
00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:08.430
In fact,
he was known as a bad ass.
And the reason he was known as a bad ass,

272
00:16:08.431 --> 00:16:13.100
it's because he was a bad ass.
And so this is pre UFC,

273
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:18.550
no one knows anything and he has been training for a year or something with the

274
00:16:20.391 --> 00:16:21.710
Gracies up in Torrance.

275
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.180
And he took a bunch of us new guys and said,
hey,

276
00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:28.100
does anyone want to learn how to fight?
And of course,

277
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:33.710
absolutely want to learn how to fight myself and a couple of the guys and uh,

278
00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.440
you know,
he was like a high level white belt,

279
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.690
maybe even a medium level white belt,
but it's 1993,
you know,

280
00:16:39.691 --> 00:16:42.950
and no one know all new.
So he,
you know,
he taught us,
you know,

281
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:45.020
the rear naked choke,
the arm lock,

282
00:16:45.021 --> 00:16:49.880
how to escape the amount and possibly in Americana.
Yeah.

283
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.590
We're staying on the chest into,
right.
And so with those moves,

284
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.170
you know,
and there's a lot of,
you know,
being in the seal teams,

285
00:16:57.171 --> 00:16:59.600
you're constantly,
I mean,
it's a,

286
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.150
it's an environment where there's lots of escalations,
you know,
in a platoon.

287
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:08.760
And so you're constantly scrapping and wrestling and fighting and you know,
uh,

288
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.010
that's part of it.
And so,
but with these basic maneuvers that I learned,

289
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.140
I could do well,
you know,
and it was,
it was bad ass.
So that's when I started at,

290
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:21.110
and then I w I didn't really see it.
Didn't we have the vision?
You know,

291
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.720
I thought that it was,
you couldn't see where it would go.

292
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.310
I thought it was a finite thing.
I know these seven moves,

293
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:33.380
everyone that's stepped up to me now I've been able to handle.
I am good.
I'm,
I,

294
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.030
you know,
I'm good.

295
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.130
And it wasn't until one of my other buddies who is a CEO who was in that initial

296
00:17:40.131 --> 00:17:44.270
pack with me,
um,
a guy by the name of Jeff Higgs and he had kind of,

297
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.120
he had gotten out of the seal teams and he'd just dedicated himself to train in

298
00:17:48.121 --> 00:17:51.300
Jujitsu.
And one day he came to my house and you know,

299
00:17:51.301 --> 00:17:53.700
we were even when we were both idiots,
right.

300
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.510
And he came to my house one day and he says,
Hey,
you want to train?
And I said,

301
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.380
well,
yeah,
absolutely.

302
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.390
So we went over in the grass across the street from my house and you know,
he,

303
00:18:02.391 --> 00:18:06.210
he had just gotten his purple belt.
So you can imagine a purple belt in 1995.

304
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.130
Yeah,
I mean he was just completely beyond anything.

305
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:14.350
I knew.
He tapped me out thousand times and I said,
hey,
were,

306
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.780
were you training to me the place?
And that was,

307
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:19.290
it went down the next day and signed up for unlimited classes and I took three

308
00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:23.760
classes a day until the present time.
Three lessons a day.
Yeah.
I mean,

309
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:27.240
I would just go during lunch,
I'd go to the,
the beginner class.

310
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:31.470
I'd go to the advanced class.
I would just get after it.
And,
uh,

311
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.780
who was he training with?
Do you recall who he was from?
Fabio Santos,

312
00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:38.100
lobbyists and tips.
And let's flash forward to the current day.
Uh,

313
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.170
who are the primary teachers you've trained with and what's,

314
00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:47.850
what's these current status of your Jujitsu and training?
Well,
my,

315
00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:52.650
uh,
long story short,
myself and being lister,
uh,

316
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.360
we ended up not being with Fabio anymore and we ended up kind of going out on

317
00:18:57.361 --> 00:19:00.720
her own.
Dean went out or Arizona and I was,
I was,
you know,
an active duty seal,

318
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.980
so I wasn't a fulltime Jujitsu Guy,
but,
uh,

319
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.630
but I was a fulltime main training partner for Dean and so we left and we ended

320
00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:12.700
up going to a couple different schools and eventually opened a,

321
00:19:12.701 --> 00:19:17.410
a big gym down in San Diego.
And we have dean lister and Jeff Glover,
uh,
our,

322
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.560
our,
our primary instructors.
What's the name of the school?
Victory.
MMA Victoria.

323
00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.650
And,
and,
uh,
how did,

324
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.270
what was your experience opening a business as an active seal?

325
00:19:30.271 --> 00:19:33.480
How did your military experience help or hinder that?

326
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.770
You know,
I'd say it was typical stuff.
Hey,
okay,

327
00:19:37.771 --> 00:19:39.210
let's figure out what the plan is going to be.

328
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.810
How are we going to put it together?
I,
you know,
it was opening a gym.
We weren't,

329
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.550
you know,
planning and we weren't,
we were building a railroad.
It wasn't,

330
00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:50.640
it was a lot less than even planning a,
a regular seal mission.
Um,

331
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.590
in a lot of ways,
which again,
planting sealed admissions is no,
is no,
you know,

332
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:57.480
high intellectual tasks either.
I mean,

333
00:19:57.481 --> 00:20:01.770
you've got bad guys are going to go kill him.
That's,
that's not super advanced.

334
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.160
And of course there's technology and timelines and all that,
but it's not,

335
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.010
it's not rocket science.
And so I,
you know,

336
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.930
we did a good job and opened up a big space and teach you a bunch of Jujitsu,
so,

337
00:20:12.931 --> 00:20:14.940
okay.
Got It.
So it's as far as,

338
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:19.260
instead of tactical implementation,

339
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.870
not the most complex thing that you've done,
what would you,

340
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.920
what would you put on the,
uh,
the higher level and of,

341
00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:29.910
of complexity in terms of things that you've spearheaded or,
uh,

342
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.400
had to tackle up to this point here?
There's two types of complexity that you,

343
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.460
that you know,
we could talk about here.

344
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.190
There's the actual complexity of the mission,
which again,

345
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.060
in generally is not going to be super complex.

346
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.590
But what is complex is yet you're dealing with human beings who have,
you know,

347
00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:50.800
all these variables,
emotions and problems and issues and egos.

348
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.750
And that's the complexity in anything.

349
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.420
And so that's from a leadership perspective,

350
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.080
that's what I've found to be always the more challenging thing.
You know,

351
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.630
that's always the more challenging thing is dealing with people and getting

352
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:03.210
people to,
you know,

353
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:08.220
conduct operations or carry out missions in a way that is most efficient,

354
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:11.440
most effective,
especially when you know,
they could get killed doing it.

355
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.260
And you know,
you're asking guys to do things that are very,

356
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:18.250
very dangerous where they know they could die.
And so that's what's complex.

357
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:19.220
That's what's complex.
And,

358
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.020
and it transfers over to the business world where you've got to get,
you know,

359
00:21:23.021 --> 00:21:24.070
a group of people.
It's the same thing.

360
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:27.880
You've got to get a group of people to carry out a mission and that,
you know,

361
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.530
they in the most efficient and effective manner.

362
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.540
So they both have that in common.

363
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.590
And I think that is usually the more complex pieces of the leadership of human

364
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:40.270
beings.
Sure.
Well,
I mean it's,
uh,
makes me think of,

365
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:40.870
uh,

366
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:45.870
I guess custom auto who worked with Tyson for so long and really took him to his

367
00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:49.880
first world championship belt.
He said,
you know,

368
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.580
everyone has a plan until they get hit in the face.

369
00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:53.710
And I think that when you have something's very simple on paper,

370
00:21:53.711 --> 00:21:58.600
but there are a lot of unknown or uncontrollable variables.

371
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.150
The plan is just a starting point.

372
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.510
But then you have to adjust in the field and obviously when the stakes are as

373
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:08.380
high as they are,
uh,
when you were deployed,
uh,
I,

374
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.140
I can see how that would be infinitely complex potentially in it,

375
00:22:13.141 --> 00:22:17.890
depending on,
on how sideways things go.
Well,
how did you become a seal?

376
00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:21.790
What's,
what's the story of you becoming a seal?
Well,

377
00:22:21.791 --> 00:22:24.910
I grew up in New England and I actually grew up in a little town in the sticks

378
00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:29.740
of New England and I was kind of a rebellious kid.
In fact,

379
00:22:29.741 --> 00:22:32.250
I was a pretty significantly rebellious kid.
And,

380
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.760
and I know it seems counterintuitive,
but when you grow up in New England,
um,

381
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.990
one of the most rebellious things that a human being can do is join the military

382
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.670
and almost the,
the ultra rebellious thing you could do.
Cause,
you know,
it's very,

383
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.800
uh,
you know,
I grew up with a bunch of hippies,
you know,
kids were hippies,

384
00:22:50.801 --> 00:22:54.940
they were dead heads,
they were smoking pot.
And I was not into that.

385
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.190
And I was so,

386
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.920
so they thought they were rebellious because they were smoking pot and doing

387
00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:02.500
acid and whatnot.
And,
uh,
I don't know,

388
00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:05.980
you tell me who was more rebellious because I ended up becoming a commando for

389
00:23:05.981 --> 00:23:09.750
my whole life.
I think the,
the,
the sort of pot and hacky sack seen,

390
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.460
I've spent a lot of time in Vermont and New Hampshire at that exact seems kind

391
00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:16.480
of par for the course.
It's like a sort of conformist rebellion.

392
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.790
Uh,
but the uh,
in,

393
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.410
what was the path that you took then?
So it was a,

394
00:23:23.411 --> 00:23:27.820
at what point did you enlist?
So I actually,
uh,

395
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.250
1989 and Panama happens,

396
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.490
the invasion of Panama happened and for seals were killed there.

397
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:38.020
And when I saw that in the paper,
I was,

398
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:44.510
I guess the word would be ashamed that I was not there.
I,

399
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.020
you know,
the Vietnam War was over,
so we weren't seeing headlines all the time.

400
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.530
And all of a sudden there's guys that were dying for the,
for,
for our country.

401
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.960
And I was not there.

402
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:59.120
And right after that I went down to the recruiting station and said I wanted to

403
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:04.070
be a seal.
And what happens after that?
So then,
you know,

404
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:07.820
I went to bootcamp,
which is Navy boot camp,
got done with bootcamp,

405
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.970
and his boot camp is separate from bud.
It is,
it is separate.

406
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:14.780
And then you go to a school where you learn a navy trade and then you start
buds.

407
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.960
So started buds in,

408
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.640
I think it was April of 1991 so this was right after the Gulf War.

409
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.620
So from my perspective leading up to the Gulf War there,
you know,

410
00:24:27.621 --> 00:24:29.870
there were some reports.
I remember hearing him on the news.

411
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:33.440
They're saying there's going to be 40,000 casualties in the first 24 hours.

412
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.510
I don't know if you remember that,
but I remember that.
Don't remember that.

413
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.510
I remember that because I was in the military and I was going to seal training.

414
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.560
I was in China when I saw the announcement on television.
So,

415
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.620
so here I am thinking,
okay,
this is going to be,
I'm going to get some,
you know,

416
00:24:45.621 --> 00:24:46.970
I'm going to,
I'm going to go to war,
you know,

417
00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:50.150
all these guys are gonna get hurt and injured,
killed,
and I'm going to go to war.

418
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.230
And the war kicks off in 72 hours later.
It's over.

419
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:55.700
And I hadn't even started seal training yet,

420
00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.710
so I was pretty bummed out.
I know that sounds crazy,

421
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:01.220
but you know,

422
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.340
I was pretty bummed out because that's what I wanted to do with my life was

423
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:09.430
being combat and be some kind of warrior and now the chance had just dissipated

424
00:25:10.941 --> 00:25:15.680
in 72 hours.
Uh,
but you know,
it was the reality of what was happening.

425
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:17.300
So went to seal training,

426
00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:22.370
went through and went over to seal team one and in let's say boot camp just for

427
00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:25.610
people listening and for myself quite quite frankly,

428
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.720
who are not familiar with what happens in these different phases does,
does uh,

429
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.550
is the objective,
what is the objective of bootcamp in,
in the,
in,
in,
uh,

430
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:39.200
this is the case of the boot camp that you attended and then buds for instance,

431
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:41.240
because I think a lot of people are familiar with the term like hell,

432
00:25:41.241 --> 00:25:44.840
we can think they think of buds as a disqualifying phase,
right?

433
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.270
The objective is to weed out the people who,

434
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:52.300
who aren't suitable for combat or leadership or fill in the blank.

435
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.940
But what,
what,
what are,
what are the objectives of bootcamp?

436
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.000
So bootcamp is to get a severe turn,

437
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.180
a civilian into a military human and you know,

438
00:26:02.181 --> 00:26:04.160
they teach you all this basic stuff.

439
00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.100
I'd say the key thing that they teach you in navy boot camp is attention to

440
00:26:07.101 --> 00:26:10.130
detail.
So you've got to do all these tasks because if you're in the navy,

441
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.430
you're working on an aircraft and if you make a mistake working on the aircraft,

442
00:26:13.431 --> 00:26:14.210
people die.

443
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:17.390
So it's very attention to detail oriented and they just teach you the basic

444
00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:21.860
structure of the military and imprint that on your brain.
Right.

445
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:25.760
And then,
and then seal training is,
is what it is.
What you said it is,

446
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.960
it's weeding people out.

447
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.850
And what is the of the say incoming an apologist,

448
00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:34.640
I'm going to mask or the terminology here,
but of the incoming class,

449
00:26:34.641 --> 00:26:38.260
how many people go into buds and how many people make it out?
The other end,
it's,

450
00:26:38.261 --> 00:26:42.860
it's,
it's about an 80% attrition rate.
80% attrition.
So 20% make it through.
Yup.

451
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:48.150
And uh,
do you have to ring a bell?
Is that natural thing?
How does that work?

452
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:50.910
Can you describe the
yeah,

453
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:53.880
they have a bell and if you want to quit you can quit at any time.

454
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.200
And if you want to quit,

455
00:26:55.201 --> 00:26:58.560
you walk over to this bell that they carry on all the runs and they have it in

456
00:26:58.561 --> 00:27:00.510
the back of a truck.
And if you want to quit,

457
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:02.880
you go over and ring the bell and then you're done.
And then you're done.

458
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.500
What did you find most challenging personally in the buds training,

459
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:14.580
if anything?
You know,
the thing with buds is,
um,
you know,

460
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:17.880
I was not good at anything.
I wasn't great at anything.
I couldn't run fast,

461
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:21.720
I couldn't swim fast,
but I was like okay at everything,

462
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:25.730
which is actually better because you didn't have a single failure point.

463
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.460
I didn't have these areas of weakness are huge weakness.
Now again,
I was not,

464
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.550
believe me,
I'm not saying that I was great at anything because I really wasn't.

465
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:35.970
I finish to the middle of the pack on Iran in the middle of the pack of the
swim.

466
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.230
Uh,
there were some guys,
you know what I,

467
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.940
a couple of guys that I remember that were at the other end of the spectrum,

468
00:27:40.941 --> 00:27:45.090
we had a guy that played,
you know,
college,
Ncaa Water Polo,

469
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.260
and he was a phenomenal athlete and he quit because he couldn't get through the

470
00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:53.810
obstacle course.
I had another guy in my class that was a,
uh,
was,

471
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.770
was an Olympic gymnast alternate.

472
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.370
And he quit because the water and you know,

473
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.400
doing the stuff in the water got to them.
So for me,

474
00:28:02.401 --> 00:28:05.310
luckily I grew up in the water and I grew up in New England,

475
00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:08.910
so I was used to cold that didn't do anything to me.
And you know,

476
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:13.920
all you had to do is get the passing and put out as hard as you can,
you know,

477
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.010
like for the runs,
I had to run as hard as I could to pass the runs.

478
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:20.070
It was a sprint,
uh,
because you couldn't modulate,

479
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.370
he didn't know how long the runs really word.
They'd say they were four miles,

480
00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:25.260
but you had no idea what they were actually going to be.

481
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.170
So you just had to run as hard as you possibly could.
If that's what I had to do.

482
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.250
Right.
That's got to be a quite a mind trip.
I mean,

483
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:36.690
to start a run when it's not a primary strength and no,

484
00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:39.810
you have to go all out without having any idea of the length of,

485
00:28:39.811 --> 00:28:41.750
well you'd know it was going to be around role models.

486
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.990
I don't want to make it sound like it.
We had no idea,
but it was um,

487
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.300
you know,
we,
it'd be,
it'd be four and a half miles,
you know,

488
00:28:51.301 --> 00:28:52.740
four and three quarter miles or whatever.

489
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.510
Did the people who made it through the 20% who made it through buds,

490
00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.530
um,

491
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:02.520
did the people who showed the most promise in buds ended up performing best in

492
00:29:02.521 --> 00:29:06.180
the field?
Not necessarily because Bud's isn't,

493
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:10.960
is a much more athletic
event.
Right?

494
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.780
It's about athleticism.
A lot of it,
a lot of it is also,
you know,
don't quit.

495
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.850
And,
you know,

496
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:21.210
I hear some people say everybody thinks about quitting during seal training.

497
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.770
And I absolutely did not think about quitting at any time.
You know,

498
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:30.450
there was nothing if they could have killed me and it would have been fine,

499
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.950
but I definitely wasn't gonna quit.
And,
but when you get to the seal team,
yeah,

500
00:29:34.951 --> 00:29:35.850
there were some guys that,

501
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:41.300
that you that were stud athletically but they were not great seals when they got

502
00:29:41.351 --> 00:29:41.680
the teams.

503
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.050
And there's also guys that are studs athletically that were studs in the seal

504
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:48.910
teams.
So it's hard to put up a scientific answer around that one.
Yeah,

505
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.680
we'll come back to the training.
Cause I just,

506
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:55.681
I I loved talking about in any types of commonalities or patterns that you've

507
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.840
spotted in a couple of different areas.
But I'm

508
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.950
going to ask you about the bottle,
the,
the battle of Ramadi.

509
00:30:02.951 --> 00:30:04.270
But I want to first ask,

510
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.710
where did you get this mental toughness?
So this,

511
00:30:08.711 --> 00:30:11.740
this not thinking of quitting,
even if it killed you,

512
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.640
was that developed through athletics as a kid through something else?

513
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:20.050
Is your entire family like that?
I mean,
where did that,
where did that come from?

514
00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:23.230
Where'd that drive?
And then sticktuitiveness come from?

515
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:28.910
I'm not 100% sure.
Um,
some of it,
you know,
I remember,
you know,

516
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.720
my dad was definitely,
you're not allowed to quit at anything ever.

517
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.550
So that leaves a mark.
Roger.

518
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.370
Also,
I think that,
you know,
I grew up and I,

519
00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.420
I started listening to hardcore music and I had a hardcore attitude.

520
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.470
And so I think that growing up under that influence,
you know,

521
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:51.970
that and watching war movies and you know,
a product of,

522
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.410
of that,
you know,

523
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:58.411
of that influence of those mantras that you'd hear in some hardcore song that's

524
00:30:58.811 --> 00:31:03.190
about,
you know,
getting after it.
And I think that that left a mark as well.

525
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:08.730
Uh,
could you describe the battle of Ramadi at and,
uh,

526
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:13.540
explain what that is for people who may not even recognize the name or muddy.

527
00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.430
So the battle of Ramadi.

528
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:19.600
So Ramadi is a city in western Iraq,

529
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.850
in a state or province called all on bar problems,

530
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.840
which is the largest province in Iraq.

531
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:31.350
And Ramadi is the capital city and the battle of Ramadi that that I fought in

532
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:35.440
was in 2006 and at that time,
most of the,

533
00:31:35.441 --> 00:31:38.020
or many of the insurgents had been pushed out of Baghdad.

534
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:42.130
Many of them had been pushed out of fellowship because the Marine Corps did a

535
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.761
very,

536
00:31:42.761 --> 00:31:47.761
a substantial effort through Fallujah and cleared it out.

537
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.830
And a lot of those enemy had gone to Ramadi.

538
00:31:50.831 --> 00:31:55.831
So in the summer of 2006 the epicenter of the insurgency was in Ramadi.

539
00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:02.830
And so that's where my seal task unit deployed to and that's where we fought.

540
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:06.610
How long were you there?
We were there for six months.
For six months.

541
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.970
How do you,
how would you describe that experience to people?

542
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.650
And I know that's a very broad question,
but for,
for,

543
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.570
for lack of a better way to approach it,
because I mean we can,

544
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.570
we can really peel back the layers,
but when people ask you what was that like?

545
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:27.790
How do you answer that?
Well,
for one thing,
it was my second deployment to Iraq.

546
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.480
So my first deployment to Iraq was

547
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:38.310
completely different in that the insurgency hadn't been really a truly

548
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:43.370
established and we as a country,
this is 2003,

549
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:46.640
2004 and so we were doing very well,
you know,

550
00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:51.500
at least everyone thought we were and we were winning.
And you know,

551
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:55.520
I always talk about that deployment.
Like we were rock stars because we,
you know,

552
00:32:55.521 --> 00:32:59.210
one o'clock in the morning we'd drive out of the gate and go capture bad guy and

553
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:00.710
bring them back at three o'clock in the morning.

554
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:04.330
And it was like we were rock stars.
You know,
we had,
um,

555
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.240
we had such a tactical advantage over the enemy and it was just pretty,

556
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:16.100
pretty easy.
We always worked with seals only.
It was just,

557
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.210
it was just easy.
Um,
tough.
Of course I'm not,
I shouldn't say easy,

558
00:33:20.211 --> 00:33:23.900
but it was less challenging.
And,

559
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:28.930
and on that deployment it was like we won everything and we felt great.

560
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.180
We felt great about what we did.
We felt like we accomplished our mission.

561
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.680
And you know,

562
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.790
if those were the challenges of combat as an individual,

563
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:42.080
I felt like I did a good job.
Right.
And you're well equipped.

564
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:45.770
I did a good job and,
and my truth did.
My platoon did a good job.

565
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:49.790
We did a good job and it was,
it seemed like we passed a test,

566
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:53.150
you know like cause you know at that time we hadn't had sustained combat

567
00:33:53.151 --> 00:33:54.950
operations for a long time in the seal teams.

568
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.030
So we felt pretty bad.
Awesome.

569
00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:05.170
So now you fast forward to Ramadi in 2006 it is completely different.

570
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.460
There are insurgents that actually control a majority of the city.

571
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.990
They are,
have complete freedom to maneuver.

572
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.490
They are terrorizing and I don't use that term lightly.
They are terrorizing.

573
00:34:22.491 --> 00:34:25.310
They're skinning people alive.
They're beheading people,

574
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.810
they're doing what you see on TV right now with Isis.
They're doing that.

575
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:35.080
The civilian population is horrified and there are 30 to 50 enemy attacks a day.

576
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:43.130
In the city of Ramadi.
There are route Michigan,

577
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:47.240
which is a road that ran from east to west through Ramadi,

578
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.450
which was loosely controlled by Americans,

579
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.470
would have seven to 10 IED attacks,
IED attacks a day.

580
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:59.530
So this is the statistically the most IED road in all of Iraq and it's three

581
00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:04.430
miles long
improvised explosive device,

582
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:06.130
improvised explosive device.

583
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:11.140
So these are a roadside bombs that completely caused the majority of casualties

584
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:17.190
in the war in Iraq.
And so we get there,
you know,
the,

585
00:35:17.191 --> 00:35:20.900
the buildings are rumbled out,
the buildings have bullet holes in them.

586
00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.690
There's wrecked vehicles on the streets,

587
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.070
there's giant craters in the streets from iads.
And on top of all that,

588
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.560
on an almost daily basis,

589
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.390
you're going to some kind of a memorial ceremony for an American soldier,

590
00:35:35.391 --> 00:35:37.100
an American marine that's been killed in combat.

591
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.790
And we rolled into that.

592
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:46.410
And right away I knew this is completely different situation and we are going to

593
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:48.840
fight a completely different type of battle here.

594
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:53.160
We're the A in this case,

595
00:35:53.161 --> 00:35:55.680
I mean looking at your opponents,

596
00:35:55.681 --> 00:36:00.681
were they better trained or did they just have a sort of territorial and

597
00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:03.480
movement advantage,
um,

598
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:08.520
that that made it more difficult for you guys?
They had both.

599
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:12.360
They both had both.
So there was a former military base,

600
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.040
former Iraqi military base or you as,

601
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.450
so you had a lot of former regime people,
their soldiers,

602
00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:19.710
former soldiers that were there.

603
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:23.880
They definitely controlled the terrain without question.

604
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.950
They acted they were allowed to fight in a completely different way than us.

605
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:33.210
And by that I mean they have no rules,
right?
So you're fighting it.

606
00:36:33.211 --> 00:36:37.220
Someone that has no rules and you know,

607
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.930
they don't care about collateral damage.
We are,

608
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:44.100
we are very careful about collateral damage.
They don't care is to define that.

609
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:47.880
You mean taking out civilians,
people who were civilian casualties.

610
00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:52.060
It means nothing to them.
Destroying a building means nothing to them.
Um,

611
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:57.420
killing each other.
So accidentally shooting or suicide bombers,
I mean there,

612
00:36:57.421 --> 00:37:02.421
there were suicide bombers on the regular in Ramadi and so they have no rules.

613
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.210
And so that gave them an advantage as well.

614
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:11.100
Now tactically they did what we did.
So for example,

615
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.060
you know,
if we get into a bad firefight,
we'll call for reinforcements.

616
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:18.600
Reinforcements will come to help us.
We would watch them do the exact same thing.

617
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.350
If we had someone get wounded,
we would call for a casualty evacuation.

618
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:26.220
They'd come and pick them up and take them back to the field medical facility.

619
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:30.960
We would watch them do the exact same thing.
So they had communications,

620
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:32.730
they had plans,
they would,

621
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.410
they would hit with complex attacks that would be coordinated throughout the

622
00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:37.740
city.

623
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:42.740
So at one time they would attack three or four different coalition outposts in

624
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.940
the city or on the outskirts of the city,
all coordinated,
you know,

625
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.120
not only amongst themselves.
So the separate attacks would be coordinated,

626
00:37:51.121 --> 00:37:55.110
but the individual attacks would be coordinated where they were vicious,

627
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:56.490
usually ending,
you know,

628
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:59.520
starting with machine gun fire and then rocket propelled grenades.

629
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:04.680
And then their goal always was to get a suicide vehicle,
a suicide vehicle bomb,

630
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.550
and drive it right into the compound and detonate and kill as many people as

631
00:38:08.551 --> 00:38:13.510
possible.
And they did this on the regular
in that type of will.

632
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.950
What was the,
uh,
what was your unit?
What was your unit notice?

633
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.060
Seal team three task unit bruiser and how many people were in that unit?

634
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.231
So when that unit,

635
00:38:25.231 --> 00:38:30.231
you got about 35 seals and then we have another 70 support people.

636
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:37.060
So these are people that,
you know,
help us fix our vehicles,

637
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.810
get our intelligence,
man,
our radios and all that.
So that,

638
00:38:40.811 --> 00:38:44.170
so you've got about a pretty big,
pretty big contingent of support people.

639
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.110
They're not seals,
they're seals support.
Got It.

640
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:52.090
So about roughly like a hundred 105 people in total,
do those 35 seals,

641
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:56.320
uh,
do they all directly report to you?
So in of those 35 seals,

642
00:38:56.321 --> 00:39:00.790
there's two seal platoons with,
you know,
16 guys each.

643
00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.610
And then we have a small headquarters element.

644
00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:05.440
Myself and a couple of their guys got it.

645
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:10.510
And that was the most decorated special operations unit in the Iraq war.

646
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.300
It was what,

647
00:39:13.301 --> 00:39:18.301
what separates a good commander from a great commander in an environment like

648
00:39:20.571 --> 00:39:21.404
that

649
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.170
out of the gate?
You know,

650
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:32.200
my immediate answer is humility because you're in a situation like that,

651
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:37.580
there's no way that,
you know,
everything.
It just,

652
00:39:37.581 --> 00:39:42.350
it's not possible.
And so you have to be humble enough to,
you know,
reach out,

653
00:39:42.351 --> 00:39:46.160
ask people for advice.
There had been a,
there've been conventional units,

654
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:50.840
so big army units,
you know,
I'm on the ground for years and when we got there,

655
00:39:50.841 --> 00:39:54.810
there'd be a new unit on the ground,
the two to eight uh,

656
00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.620
iron soldiers from Pennsylvania.

657
00:39:57.621 --> 00:40:01.700
I'm just giving them some props right now cause they were awesome and they,

658
00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.790
they'd been on the ground for 14 months fighting.

659
00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:09.320
So we went to those guys and we said,
okay,
well how can we help?
What can we do?

660
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:11.960
What advice do you have for us?
Uh,

661
00:40:11.961 --> 00:40:16.070
we wanted to learn what they knew and I think that that was a big piece of it.

662
00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.840
And also,
you know,

663
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:22.820
I had an open mind when it came to the strategic mission that we were trying to

664
00:40:22.821 --> 00:40:25.220
accomplish because for many years,

665
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:30.550
what seals and special operations and the conventional units were doing was

666
00:40:31.311 --> 00:40:35.720
going out into neighborhoods,
grabbing bad guys.
And coming back to the basis.

667
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:40.220
And
after three years of that,

668
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.890
the enemy attacks had gone up 300%.
So clearly something was not working.

669
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:50.200
And the the brigade that came in and took over again,
I'm going to give some,

670
00:40:50.201 --> 00:40:53.920
a huge complements to the one one eight d under Colonel Sean McFarland.

671
00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:58.600
They came in with an amazing strategy,
which was seized,
clear hold and build,

672
00:40:58.601 --> 00:41:02.080
which meant you got these bad neighborhoods that are owned by the enemy.

673
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.860
And okay,
we're going to go in there and we're going to stay there.

674
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.820
And that was a very different strategy than anyone had used.

675
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.140
And so that's the CS.
That's the one that is the C's,

676
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.610
clear hold and build.

677
00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:19.600
So you go into these enemy territories and you actually take over a building or

678
00:41:19.601 --> 00:41:22.780
two buildings or three buildings and you make them your house,

679
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:26.110
make them your forte.
And so that,
so that's what we did.
And again,

680
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.990
so from my perspective,
uh,
you know,

681
00:41:28.991 --> 00:41:32.410
for Carl McFarland and the rest of the battalion commanders and all of those

682
00:41:32.411 --> 00:41:37.280
commanders to this open mind to try out a new,
a completely new strategy,

683
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.970
which was very,
very dangerous area,
dangerous.
I mean,
I'm not an expert.

684
00:41:40.971 --> 00:41:44.210
That sounds very risky.
It was extremely risky and you know,

685
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:47.390
there was a huge price was paid.
Um,

686
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:52.310
the casualties were very significant and very horrifying.
Now,

687
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:57.870
despite that overall,
was that an effective strategy?
It absolutely,

688
00:41:57.871 --> 00:42:00.440
that was just the price that it exists.
It absolutely was.

689
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:03.470
So by the time I left the strategy hadn't,

690
00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.930
we hadn't seen the results yet.
I left October 21st,

691
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:13.130
2006 by any and there were still about 30 to 50 enemy attacks a day.

692
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.390
About five months after we left the enemy attacks,

693
00:42:17.391 --> 00:42:20.030
we're down to one a day,

694
00:42:20.031 --> 00:42:24.440
two a day from what was from 30 to 50.
Wow.
And then,

695
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:28.190
and then six months later it was down to one a week and then one a month.

696
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:31.610
And then soon,
you know,
by 2007,

697
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.770
Ramadi was the safest place in Iraq.

698
00:42:33.771 --> 00:42:37.010
I mean if excluding maybe the curd controlled area up in the north.

699
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:43.040
And do you attribute that to anything else outside of this?

700
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:47.950
Uh,
this stratagem the,
the,
the CS.
I'm apologizing that I'm forgetting the,

701
00:42:47.951 --> 00:42:48.471
the others,

702
00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:53.471
but occupying these buildings or areas and making them your home for a period of

703
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:58.430
time.
Where there other tactical decisions or strategies that contributed to that

704
00:42:58.431 --> 00:43:00.740
decrease?
So the other,

705
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:04.130
well obviously the other huge piece of this is the men and women that were

706
00:43:04.131 --> 00:43:07.100
fighting and God blessed them all because it was

707
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:11.030
a hell of a fight.
And like I said,

708
00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:16.031
there was significant casualties and the other focus now was to take back the

709
00:43:17.091 --> 00:43:21.770
neighborhoods and in that secure the populace.

710
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.190
So in other wars,
you know,
you say,
okay,

711
00:43:25.191 --> 00:43:29.060
here's our strategic objective is to take this hail or take this airfield or,

712
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.300
or what or what have you.
And this one,
the goal,

713
00:43:32.301 --> 00:43:34.640
the strategic goal was to secure the populace,

714
00:43:34.641 --> 00:43:38.420
to make sure that the populace was safe.
Because once the populace was safe,

715
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:41.600
then it was,
okay,
now we're going to give you some food.

716
00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:44.480
We're going to get some water.
We have Iraqi troops with us.
We,

717
00:43:44.481 --> 00:43:47.810
so we worked all the time with Iraqi troops and they're speaking the same

718
00:43:47.811 --> 00:43:52.811
language and it took a very short amount of time before that barrier got broken

719
00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:58.271
down and the local populace of Ramadi turned against the insurgence because they

720
00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.480
will no longer feared them.

721
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.670
And so that was the other huge tipping point was getting the,

722
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:06.410
the local populace of our,
of Ramadi on the side of the coalition.

723
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.430
Imagine that would give you a,
I mean,
an enormous informational advantage.

724
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.850
Absolutely the same.

725
00:44:12.851 --> 00:44:17.851
It sounds like you have humility and openness to modifying preexisting

726
00:44:20.781 --> 00:44:24.350
strategies.
Uh,
but then there's also an experimental piece.
It sounds like,
I mean,

727
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.760
how was,
how was the first,
uh,

728
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.010
experiment conducted or

729
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.800
<v 0>how did it come to pass and be implemented,
uh,</v>

730
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:40.040
that you had go in and occupy and test out that particular approach because it

731
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:43.230
seems like,
were there other,
uh,
experiments like that?

732
00:44:43.231 --> 00:44:45.220
And I know I just asked two questions,
but,
uh,

733
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:47.250
I'm just trying to figure out in the military structure,

734
00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:50.910
and I haven't been exposed to that where I'm sure there are a lot,
there's a,

735
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:55.300
there's a lot of command structures in place.
Um,

736
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.400
were you given a lot of latitude to experiment that way or did it require a lot

737
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.360
of process?

738
00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.300
<v 3>So let me give you a,
I'll try and give a concise answer.
It doesn't have it.</v>

739
00:45:04.301 --> 00:45:06.850
We can say this is your,
you know,
you're going deep right now.
Oh yeah.

740
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.970
Which is fine.
Uh,
because I guess it's your podcast.

741
00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:17.010
So I'll take it back to a place called [inaudible] where the marines did a big

742
00:45:17.801 --> 00:45:21.370
sweep through [inaudible].
And at some point when they went through alcaide EAM,

743
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:24.400
the local populace started saying,
hey,
there's bad guys over there.
Hey,

744
00:45:24.401 --> 00:45:26.890
there's bad guys in that building down there.
Go get them too.

745
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.410
So there was a little thought about that.
Now,

746
00:45:29.411 --> 00:45:33.400
there was a place in north of Ramadi called Talla far,

747
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.690
which there's a great,
uh,

748
00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:40.980
legendary army commander and I'll have mcmasters and I got to look that up

749
00:45:43.361 --> 00:45:45.310
because I think you're missing him.
Yeah,
that's okay.

750
00:45:45.311 --> 00:45:46.930
And people in the show notes can also,

751
00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:51.100
they can also do research master the guys,
legendary guy.

752
00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:55.690
But he ran the C's clear and hold strategy up and tallow far and it was very

753
00:45:55.691 --> 00:45:59.080
effective.
And again,
this is pre surge.
That was 2005,

754
00:45:59.081 --> 00:46:04.081
2006 Colonel Mcfarland went and took over for him in California and saw,

755
00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.560
you know,
got the turnover and understood what had happened.

756
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:13.950
And then Colonel Mcfarlane got the task once McMaster left to come down to

757
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:18.520
Ramadi and he said,
you know,
I'm going to do the same thing there.

758
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:22.030
And so that's what he did.
And you know,
it was,

759
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:24.873
you know,

760
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
one thing that's interesting is it's not a movie and so everything was not

761
00:46:30.581 --> 00:46:34.240
perfect and you'd push into some of these neighborhoods and it was fierce,

762
00:46:34.241 --> 00:46:36.430
fierce fighting and you know,
you take casualties.

763
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:40.360
And I think that current Mcfarland understood that deeply.

764
00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:45.370
And he also had a vision for what the victory was going to look like.

765
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:49.280
So
those,

766
00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:53.150
those pieces and,
and pushing in,
you know,
the first time it was like,
hey,

767
00:46:53.151 --> 00:46:53.990
here's what we're going to do.

768
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.710
We're going to go into this neighborhood that's controlled by the insurgence and

769
00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:01.980
move in
and in it,

770
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.480
<v 0>in a,
in a battle such as,
uh,
you know,
uh,</v>

771
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:11.280
Ramadi,
how do you define objectives,
um,

772
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.880
in the longer term,
not necessarily on a,
on a nightly basis,

773
00:47:14.881 --> 00:47:18.730
but in the longer term,
so that you can focus the efforts and,

774
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:20.910
and sustain the morale for that matter.

775
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:24.350
<v 3>Right?
And that's,
that's actually a simple question,
you know,
okay,</v>

776
00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.150
here's what we're going to do three days from now.

777
00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.580
We're going to go into this neighborhood that we're going to establish a combat

778
00:47:28.581 --> 00:47:31.540
outpost,
and that's what we're gonna focus on for the next three days.

779
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:34.480
And then once we get that thing established,
guess what?
We're to spend,
uh,

780
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:37.330
you know,
four or five days there and then we're going to do it again.

781
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:40.960
And grand picture,
you know,
strategic vision,
here's what it's gonna look like.

782
00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:43.570
We're going to have combat outposts all over Ramadi that are going to be

783
00:47:43.571 --> 00:47:45.340
controlled by Americans,

784
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.300
with Iraqi soldiers in them that can go out and talk to the local populous and

785
00:47:49.301 --> 00:47:52.450
we can secure the city.
So it was,
it was a simple as that.

786
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:56.860
Now you take that down a level to let's say my seal platoon,

787
00:47:56.861 --> 00:47:59.410
one of my seal platoons,
and they'd be saying,
okay,
here's what we're going to do.

788
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.530
We're going to go and take this particular building and then we're going to

789
00:48:02.531 --> 00:48:07.531
cover for the conventional units as they come in in a very exposed way.

790
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.910
Because when you build these combat outposts,

791
00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.650
your literally doing a construction project in the middle of a combat zone.

792
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.450
So these guys,

793
00:48:16.451 --> 00:48:20.650
these brave army engineers are standing with,
you know,

794
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:24.340
a hammer in their hand,
full body armor and us,
you know,

795
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:29.770
reinforcing these buildings,
bloating,
sandbags,
building barricades,

796
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:35.140
and you know,
this is while we're being attacked.
Wow.
And so those guys,
you know,

797
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:39.010
like I said,
I can never give enough credit to the units that we work.

798
00:48:39.011 --> 00:48:41.680
They're in Ramadi.
They were phenomenal and brave.

799
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:46.810
And what we would do is while they were doing those missions,

800
00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:49.270
building out those combat outposts,

801
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:53.680
we would go out to the high ground surrounding the combat outpost.

802
00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:57.370
So we'd sneak out into the areas surrounding the combat outpost.

803
00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:01.810
So now when the enemy came to attack the combat outpost,
we would kill them,

804
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:06.220
right?
And they didn't know where we were in the beginning.
And eventually,

805
00:49:06.221 --> 00:49:11.010
you know,
they'd figure out where we were and,
and come attack.
What,
um,

806
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:17.400
was the sort of division of expertise like among the 35 seals,

807
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:21.970
uh,
under your command in so much as,
and again,
I,

808
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:27.160
I have to apologize because my,
what I know of seals,

809
00:49:27.161 --> 00:49:30.640
some of it has come from guys who have been deployed,
um,
who are friends of mine.

810
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.550
But a lot of it comes from seeing films,
right?
I mean,
it's,

811
00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:36.580
it's a lot of the exposure that civilians have here.
But,
uh,

812
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:39.830
and some people say like,
Oh yeah,
that guy's a door kicker.
You know,
this guy's,

813
00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:41.200
this,
this guy.
Is that,

814
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:46.560
how did the responsibilities break down across those 35,

815
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.290
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's a seal to seal platoons.

816
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.670
Each seal platoon has singular leader that's in charge of the whole platoon.

817
00:49:54.671 --> 00:49:57.700
And then he's got some subordinate leadership underneath him.

818
00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:01.180
And then you've got these guys that are,
have their specialty craft,

819
00:50:01.181 --> 00:50:05.170
whether they're snipers,
whether their medic guys Korman,

820
00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:09.100
whether they're breachers,
which are guys that blow up,
blow things up,

821
00:50:09.101 --> 00:50:14.080
blow open doors,
a riflemen granted deers point men.

822
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:19.070
So you've got these various,
um,
skill sets in.
What's he say?
Uh,

823
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.720
I apologize.
The rifleman and then what was the other word?

824
00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:25.930
Granted here are they're the same.
You know,
there's two different,
it depends,

825
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.830
you know,
so a rifleman is a guy with a rifle,

826
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:31.670
which we generally wouldn't have because almost every guy in a seal platoon is

827
00:50:31.671 --> 00:50:35.360
doing something other than just shooting his gun.
Like I said,
he's a radio man,

828
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:39.790
so he's calling in for fire calling,
tanks,
calling,
casualty evacuation,

829
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:43.370
anything like that.
The sniper is being a sniper.

830
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:45.770
The machine gunners are machine gunners,

831
00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:50.870
a granite dear lobs grant grenades at people.
Ah,
all right.
So,

832
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.960
so that's,
that's what a seal platoon is.
Now,

833
00:50:53.961 --> 00:50:57.710
the experience level in the seagull platoon is,
you know,

834
00:50:57.711 --> 00:51:01.130
you've got guys that have never deployed before and we had probably out of 30,

835
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.240
30,
whatever guys,
we probably had a dozen that had never deployed before.

836
00:51:05.241 --> 00:51:09.050
So I was their first deployment to Iraq and it was,
you know,
pretty epic,

837
00:51:09.051 --> 00:51:11.380
first deployment to Iraq.
Um,

838
00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:16.370
and then you've got guys that have varying levels of experience inside the

839
00:51:16.371 --> 00:51:20.810
platoons and you know,
some guys that deployed to Iraq one,

840
00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:24.530
two or three times.
And that's probably the level of experience.

841
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:27.590
And did you have,
um,

842
00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.550
what were the size of groups that would go out and say a,

843
00:51:32.551 --> 00:51:34.700
a nightly rate or something like that?
And again,
I'm,

844
00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.550
I apologize him playing the civilian role,
here are some,

845
00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:39.700
I'm not going to get everything right,
but like what are the,
the,

846
00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.110
the core group be sort of like a six or seven.

847
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.510
We were task organized depending on the mission.

848
00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:49.660
So if it's important to remember that we were working with Iraqi forces,

849
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:55.010
so we had these other people with us,
sure.
That we could use as bodies to do,

850
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:59.990
you know,
some of what,
some of the work,
right?
Some of the work.
And so,

851
00:51:59.991 --> 00:52:03.470
you know,
we'd send six,
seven,
eight,
nine,

852
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:07.640
10 seals out with eight,
10,
12,
20,

853
00:52:07.641 --> 00:52:08.870
40 Iraqis.

854
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:12.560
And then it's the whole spectrum because sometimes we'd send an entire seal

855
00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:13.371
platoon out,
you know,

856
00:52:13.371 --> 00:52:18.371
16 guys with 40 Iraqi soldiers or 50 Iraqi soldiers and sometimes we'd send,

857
00:52:19.221 --> 00:52:24.020
you know,
five seals out with five Iraqi soldiers to do some kind of an Overwatch

858
00:52:24.021 --> 00:52:28.250
position,
little smaller,
but we still had a minimum that we needed to take out.

859
00:52:28.251 --> 00:52:29.510
What does an Overwatch position,

860
00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.760
Overwatch position is kind of what I talked about earlier,

861
00:52:31.761 --> 00:52:33.980
where you get the high ground or maybe not,

862
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.470
maybe not necessarily the high ground,
but often the high ground.

863
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:37.910
That's the tactical,

864
00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.880
that's a tactical advantage is positioned on the battlefield,

865
00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:45.530
is to be on the high ground.
Who are other people,
uh,
in the military,

866
00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.080
alive or dead,
US or elsewhere,

867
00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:52.400
who you really respect as a sort of strategists are tacticians

868
00:52:57.110 --> 00:52:57.943
<v 1>okay.</v>

869
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:03.880
<v 3>Obviously I talked about,
uh,
criminal,
Shawn Mcfarland,
who was just fantastic.</v>

870
00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:08.380
And,
you know,
he was,
he was,
and I don't know if I'm necessarily right on this,

871
00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:13.600
but you know,
General Patraeus,
uh,
who wrote the manual on counterinsurgency.

872
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:17.590
So he's obvious and he orchestrated the surge and he's a brilliant,

873
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:21.580
and you know,
in my opinion was,
you know,
the critical player in,

874
00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:26.520
in really turning the rest of the war.
Again,
we were pre surge and,

875
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:32.090
but I think they used the success in Ramadi as a reason to,

876
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:36.390
uh,
to sell the surge.
Like,
we can do this in other places.
We did it in Ramadi.

877
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:40.320
So,
you know,
from my perspective,
both those guys were,
uh,

878
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:44.280
or just outstanding.
And when you,
when you look at,

879
00:53:44.281 --> 00:53:48.590
and the reason I was asking about the,
the smaller groups that are sent out,

880
00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.100
say that the eight to 10 seals with then the,
uh,
the,
the Iraqi,

881
00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:56.110
uh,
colleagues,
uh,

882
00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:02.480
what distinguishes a good leader in that type of situation or in buds or

883
00:54:05.341 --> 00:54:06.470
elsewhere?
I mean,
what,
what did,

884
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:11.480
what have you observed and learned about what makes a good leader versus a good

885
00:54:12.091 --> 00:54:15.920
or mediocre or a bad leader?
Uh,
again,
it's,
it's the,

886
00:54:15.921 --> 00:54:19.950
the immediate answer that comes to mind is humility because you've got to be

887
00:54:19.951 --> 00:54:23.010
humble and you've got to be coachable.
You know,

888
00:54:23.011 --> 00:54:26.400
that we would fire guys and later when I was running training,

889
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:30.300
we would fire a couple of leaders in every firm,
every seal team,

890
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.150
because they couldn't,
they couldn't lead.

891
00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:38.190
And 99.9% of the time,
it was,
wasn't a question of their ability.

892
00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:42.450
It was a question of their ability to listen and an ability to step outside and

893
00:54:42.451 --> 00:54:46.920
see that maybe there's a better way to do things.
Uh,
so that's,
that's number one.

894
00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:49.110
And number two,
I would say is a PR,

895
00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:53.730
an individual who is balanced.
And you know,

896
00:54:53.731 --> 00:54:56.280
I talk about there's a,
there's a phrase that I use.

897
00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:00.300
It's the dichotomy of leadership.
So lead in a leadership situation,

898
00:55:00.301 --> 00:55:03.090
you're constantly balancing these opposing forces.

899
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:08.340
So you have to be aggressive.
Absolutely.
Can you be too aggressive?
Yes,

900
00:55:08.341 --> 00:55:12.990
you can.
Um,
can you be,
do you need to be courageous?
Yes you do.

901
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:16.380
Can you be foolhardy and get people killed?
Absolutely.

902
00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:21.030
So there's all these balances.
Can you be too close to your men?
Yes you can.

903
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:25.200
Can you be not close enough?
Yes you can.
Can you be too robotic?

904
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.920
Yes you can.
Can you be too emotional?
Absolutely.

905
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.010
So what I find the best leaders,

906
00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:35.700
they have this ability to balance all those opposing forces.
And,

907
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:39.450
and usually when you do find a problem,
you know,
if you're,
if you're making,

908
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.450
if you realize that your leadership isn't working,

909
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:44.490
generally you can look and say,
oh,

910
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:49.320
I'm going too far in one direction on this particular,
uh,

911
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:54.030
force,
this dichotomy of leadership.
I'm going too far on being,
being overbearing.

912
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.820
I'm micromanaging.
Micromanaging is a great one,
right?

913
00:55:56.850 --> 00:56:01.710
You can obviously micromanager your people and they won't act.

914
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.260
They won't do anything on their own.
They won't take any initiative.

915
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.160
And that's horrible.

916
00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:08.500
The other end is you can not give them the guidance that they need and,

917
00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.740
and not pay close enough attention to them.

918
00:56:10.741 --> 00:56:12.390
And now they don't know what the mission is or what they're doing.

919
00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.870
So there's all these dichotomies that you have to balance as a leader.

920
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:19.760
And you know,
I think that between being humble and,

921
00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:23.860
and balancing all those dichotomies of leadership is,
is,
makes a good leader.

922
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:29.200
And how would say the ability to listen and be coachable?

923
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:33.430
Um,
what would be an example of how that manifests itself?

924
00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:36.850
Just how you would observe that and say that's a guy who is good at

925
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:41.130
being humble and coachable or the opposite,
right?
Like,

926
00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:44.290
so I'm looking for the things that you would observe or hear where he'd be like,

927
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:48.730
you know what?
I think we might have to let that guy go.
Yeah,
you'd see a guy in,

928
00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:52.510
again,
now we're going back to training.
We put these guys through very,
um,

929
00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:56.140
realistic and challenging training to say the least.

930
00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:58.600
And I know if there's any guys that went through training when I was running it

931
00:56:58.601 --> 00:56:58.901
right now,

932
00:56:58.901 --> 00:57:03.790
they're chuckling because it was very realistic and psychotic and we put so much

933
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:08.170
pressure on these guys and overwhelm them.
And,
you know,

934
00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:11.110
a good leader would come back and say,

935
00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:17.320
I lost it.
I didn't control it.
I didn't,
I didn't do a good job.

936
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.410
I,
I didn't see what was happening.

937
00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:24.910
I got too absorbed in this little tiny tactical situation that was right in

938
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:26.080
front of me.
They,

939
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:30.130
they either they'd make those criticisms themselves about themselves,

940
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.750
or they'd say,
what did I do wrong?
And when you told them,
they'd nod their head,

941
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:38.230
they'd pull out their notebook,
they'd take notes.
And,
and that right there,

942
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:40.330
you know,
that's a guy that's gonna that's gonna make it,

943
00:57:40.331 --> 00:57:41.164
that's gonna do it right.

944
00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:46.450
And then you get the guy that comes in and he's immediately saying,
uh,
you know,

945
00:57:46.451 --> 00:57:50.050
you say,
well,
what'd you think of the operation?
Or if it was a disaster,

946
00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:53.590
he said it was a disaster.
And you go,
well,
what went wrong?
And immediately it's,

947
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:55.263
well,

948
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:59.710
my assault team leader didn't do x and my mobility commander didn't do y.

949
00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:03.040
And I told those guys I wanted them to go over there and they didn't go there.

950
00:58:03.041 --> 00:58:06.210
Fingerpointing immediately finger pointing.
And that's just an,

951
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:07.600
an a telltale sign.

952
00:58:07.601 --> 00:58:11.840
You've got a guy that's not humble enough and coachable and it's,

953
00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:12.790
it's an awful thing.

954
00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:16.210
And you can try and you can try and change people and sometimes they would

955
00:58:16.211 --> 00:58:18.810
change,
but it's difficult to get them to change.
So,
you know,
that's,

956
00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:23.260
some people are born with that characteristic and,
and it's,

957
00:58:23.261 --> 00:58:26.890
it's a bummer to see because it's,
if you can't fix them,
you can't fix them.

958
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:28.390
Right.
And they're not going to listen to anybody.

959
00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:32.080
Well it sounds like it's self awareness is also a big component of that.

960
00:58:32.081 --> 00:58:32.914
To have the,

961
00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:38.490
the awareness to kind of step outside and objectively evaluate yourself.
I,

962
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.760
I,
I,
you know,
I call it a detachment and you know,

963
00:58:42.761 --> 00:58:46.600
that's one of the things that early on in my leadership career,

964
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:49.750
I actually remember when it happened.

965
00:58:49.751 --> 00:58:54.370
I was probably 20 something years,
22 or 23 years old.

966
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.233
I was in my,

967
00:58:56.950 --> 00:59:01.420
I was in my first seal platoon and we come up,

968
00:59:01.421 --> 00:59:05.320
we're on an oil rig in California doing some training and we come up on this

969
00:59:05.321 --> 00:59:08.890
level of this oil rig and it's never been an oil rig before.

970
00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:09.880
They're very complex.

971
00:59:09.881 --> 00:59:14.020
There's gear and boxes and just stuff everywhere on these levels.

972
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:16.620
And they're see through,
you can see through the floors and you can still,

973
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:17.860
it's complex environment.

974
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:23.360
And we come up and we all get on on this platform,
on this level,

975
00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:28.010
and everybody freezes.
And I'm kind of waiting and I'm a new guy,

976
00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:32.570
so I don't really,
you know,
I don't feel like I should be doing anything.

977
00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:36.350
But then I said to myself,
you know,
somebody's got to do something.
So I just,

978
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:40.220
what's called high ported my gun.
So I just lifted my gun up towards the air,

979
00:59:40.221 --> 00:59:41.930
like I'm not,
I'm not a shooter right now.

980
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:46.130
And I took one step back off the line and I looked around and I saw what the

981
00:59:46.131 --> 00:59:50.870
picture was and I just said,
you know,
hold left,

982
00:59:50.871 --> 00:59:55.400
move.
Right?
And,
and everybody heard it and they did it.
And I said to myself,
hmm,

983
00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.640
you know,
there's that,
that that's what you need to do.

984
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.300
And so I realized that detaching yourself from the situation so you could

985
01:00:02.301 --> 01:00:07.190
observe it so that you can see what's happening is absolutely critical.
And,

986
01:00:07.191 --> 01:00:12.080
and now,
you know,
when I talked to executives or mid level managers,

987
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:16.340
I explained to them that I'm doing that all the time.
I,
I,

988
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:17.720
it sounds horrible,

989
01:00:17.721 --> 01:00:21.050
but it's almost like sometimes I'm not a participant in my own life.

990
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:23.540
I'm an observer of that guy that's doing it.

991
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.360
So if I'm having a conversation with you and you know,

992
01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:29.570
we're trying to discuss a point and I'm watching and saying,
wait,

993
01:00:29.571 --> 01:00:33.710
are you being too emotional right now?
Oh wait a second,
look at him.
He,
you,

994
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.080
cause I can't,
I'm not reading you correctly.

995
01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:38.750
If I'm seeing you through my own emotion or ego,

996
01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.820
I can't really see what you're thinking.

997
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.290
But if I step out of that and now I'm seeing,
I can see the real you.

998
01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.350
And if you are getting angry,
if your ego is getting hurt,

999
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:51.650
if you're about to cave because you're just fed up with me.

1000
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:55.520
Whereas if I'm raging in my own head,
I might miss all of that.

1001
01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.600
And so that detachment that takes place as a leader is critical.
And,

1002
01:01:00.601 --> 01:01:01.940
and you're 100% right on that.

1003
01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:09.130
How do you instill that or try to teach that?
Is that is,

1004
01:01:09.131 --> 01:01:10.380
is that something people,

1005
01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:15.410
because I feel like that may be more than the humility seems to be a coachable

1006
01:01:16.011 --> 01:01:17.200
skill.
Um,

1007
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:22.300
and the part of the reason I say that is because I found that whether it's like

1008
01:01:22.821 --> 01:01:26.660
cognitive behavioral therapy or stoic philosophy for that matter,

1009
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:31.990
you can in small increments conditioned people to have less of an extreme

1010
01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:35.450
emotional response and to try to observe themselves.

1011
01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:39.170
And I suppose that there's some Buddhists thought that would translate to that

1012
01:01:39.171 --> 01:01:41.030
as well,
but how do you teach?

1013
01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:43.370
How do you help teach someone that ability to detach?

1014
01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:48.820
So what we did to teach them was put them under extraordinary pressure,

1015
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:54.580
were to fail to detach from the situation and step up and away from the problem

1016
01:01:56.810 --> 01:02:01.520
would result in failure.
And I had a great experience where one of my,

1017
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:02.760
uh,
one of the,

1018
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.960
the guy that actually took my job over as the troop commander and a very close

1019
01:02:08.121 --> 01:02:11.420
friend of mine,
he got hurt.
So he was,

1020
01:02:11.421 --> 01:02:16.421
he was going through the training now and I was running the training and we were

1021
01:02:16.701 --> 01:02:20.790
going out to a place called Niland,
California to do land warfare.
And again,

1022
01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:24.780
this is desert operations.
You're patrolling in long distances,

1023
01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:25.830
you're hitting targets.

1024
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:31.070
And we have like high level laser tag guns that we use to shoot.

1025
01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:36.210
And,
and it's very,
we put a lot of pressure on people.
There's helicopters,

1026
01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:40.500
there's smoke,
there's bombs,
there's all kinds of stuff happening.
And this guy,

1027
01:02:40.501 --> 01:02:43.800
this buddy of mine,
he was supposed to be commanding at all,

1028
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:47.430
but he had broken his neck.
Oh God.
About,
I don't know,

1029
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:50.340
six weeks prior to this I said,
or like a ropes course or they always,

1030
01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.660
it was a climbing a ship and the guy above him fell and broke his neck.

1031
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.980
And so this guy who's,
who had been in Ramadi with me and you know,

1032
01:02:58.981 --> 01:03:00.830
did an outstanding job and,

1033
01:03:00.831 --> 01:03:05.831
and amazing effort and was as brave as to a fault,

1034
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:11.270
you know,
we're lucky he's here.
So he,
so,

1035
01:03:11.271 --> 01:03:16.271
so the land warfare training takes place and he comes out and I said,

1036
01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:20.870
hey,
just come out and watch with me.
And so he comes out and you know,
we're,

1037
01:03:20.871 --> 01:03:24.150
we're,
we're watching and we're out on one of these field training exercises.

1038
01:03:24.151 --> 01:03:28.470
So all this mayhem starts and there's bad guys up in the hills and there's bombs

1039
01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:33.360
going off and there's smoke everywhere.
And what from our position,

1040
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.400
which we were standing next to the guys that were in it,

1041
01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.970
and he looks at me and he says,
you know,

1042
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.470
it's so easy when you're not in it.
And I said,

1043
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:48.900
this is how it was for me when we went through,
I was up here and he was like,

1044
01:03:48.901 --> 01:03:52.680
a light bulb went off,
you know,
he said,
I saw you,
you know,
like he would,

1045
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.590
he kind of saw me like that and said,
how does he know what's happening?

1046
01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:59.670
So the ability easy in so much as when you're the outsider looking in,

1047
01:03:59.671 --> 01:04:02.940
you can see what to do,
what's going on.
Exactly.
And when you did it,

1048
01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:07.860
you were not necessarily physically removing yourself,
but sort of mentally.

1049
01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:11.350
Yes.
Pulling the perspective back so you could observe it.
So,

1050
01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.920
so if you take someone like your,
your uh,

1051
01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:17.370
your friend who has this realization like,
Oh holy shit.
Okay.

1052
01:04:17.371 --> 01:04:20.460
That explains a lot because if you could create this perspective,

1053
01:04:20.461 --> 01:04:23.640
you would have a huge tactical advantage.
Um,

1054
01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:26.600
what type of,
uh,

1055
01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:32.190
exercise would you put someone through where the consequences were so

1056
01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.960
significant that they would be forced to detach in that way?
I mean,

1057
01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:41.370
these are just exercise that we do and you know,
like I said,

1058
01:04:41.371 --> 01:04:46.371
so we would use lasers where this advanced laser tag system where you get,

1059
01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:49.530
you can get shot at 300 meters and if you go,

1060
01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:52.650
if you get shot at an island and your beeper goes off and says you're dead,

1061
01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.140
then you're dead right.

1062
01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.150
And you're going to have to get carried out by your buddies,
which is awful.

1063
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:59.730
And you're going to get,
they're going to get hurt,
sprained ankles,

1064
01:04:59.731 --> 01:05:01.740
everything else.
It's a nightmare.
And then,

1065
01:05:01.741 --> 01:05:04.080
and they're also now they can't maneuver as well.

1066
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.170
So now what happens when they get attacked again,
which they're going to,

1067
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:12.510
because it's going to be Murphy's law there and the problems compound.

1068
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:16.020
And if the leaders get bogged down in those problems and don't step back,

1069
01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:18.040
we will literally,
we would kill all

1070
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.420
<v 5>of them,
right?
And they'd come back with their,
with their heads down and say,</v>

1071
01:05:22.421 --> 01:05:25.720
you know,
what the hell just happened and what can we do better?
And then,

1072
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:29.890
you know,
we'd,
we'd,
we'd have this talk with them.
And you know,

1073
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:31.090
it's one of those things,
it's like when you,

1074
01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.360
it's like when you're growing up and you don't listen to anybody,

1075
01:05:34.361 --> 01:05:37.810
it was not that you don't listen to people,
but some lessons you have to learn,

1076
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:41.170
you know,
through life and through experience.

1077
01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.500
And so that happened in the guys would,
you know,
guys at varying levels,

1078
01:05:44.501 --> 01:05:47.110
some of them would,
would be able to go,
oh,
I just saw it.
Okay,

1079
01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:49.570
now I can make this happen.
And that would happen as well.

1080
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:53.240
Where I would see there,
you know,

1081
01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:56.620
when in like in Terminator when the beginning of the tournament,
I said,
you know,

1082
01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:01.150
on August 27th,
2016,
the machines became aware.

1083
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:06.900
You could see their leadership switch happen and all of a sudden they'd go boom.

1084
01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.930
And then I would know my job was done and they'd step up.
They'd,
they'd,

1085
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:15.220
they take a step back from the situation.
They would look around,
they'd observe,

1086
01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:15.790
they wouldn't,

1087
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:20.710
they'd make good decisions and good calls and then watch them progress out of it

1088
01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:23.710
and finish the problem and,
and do well.

1089
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.260
And then I knew that I had done my job.

1090
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:30.400
That'd become aware that they became aware as leaders.
Yeah,
it sits.
So I,
um,

1091
01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:36.220
this is in my mind at least related to not panicking or at least being able to

1092
01:06:37.271 --> 01:06:39.810
think in the midst of panic.
Uh,

1093
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:43.900
and there are so many examples of this man in sports and elsewhere,

1094
01:06:43.901 --> 01:06:46.690
but I remember doing some,
uh,

1095
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:51.220
convoy and evasive driving training with a bunch of executive types.
I mean,

1096
01:06:51.221 --> 01:06:53.140
these are not military guys.
Uh,

1097
01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.790
just really for the experience and part of the training involved,

1098
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:00.280
splitting up into two teams,

1099
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:04.840
having sort of an ambush team and trying to go get a broken down car with a

1100
01:07:04.841 --> 01:07:06.460
person passed out inside,

1101
01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:10.840
they might be dead that might be passed out back through uh,

1102
01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:15.930
basically a a finish line and we got to pick teams and I happened to be I guess

1103
01:07:16.481 --> 01:07:16.960
one,

1104
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.700
one team leader and I picked the guy who had the best evasive driving skills to

1105
01:07:21.701 --> 01:07:24.310
be sort of the victor one driver.

1106
01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:28.480
And then I was in the passenger side with cubs and everybody had paintball guns

1107
01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:29.790
and uh,

1108
01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:33.760
we had to keep the passenger side and drivers had windows down so we could get

1109
01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:35.280
nailed.
And uh,

1110
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.840
there are also drivers trying to like take us off the road and whatnot.

1111
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.650
In any case,
it's soon as the paint ball started flying,

1112
01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:46.420
this guy just gunned it in a straight line,
no response to comms,

1113
01:07:46.421 --> 01:07:47.890
no response to anything.

1114
01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:52.420
Even though under the pressure of sort of mock competition with the evasive

1115
01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:54.970
driving and so on within Cohen's,
he'd been spectacular.

1116
01:07:55.690 --> 01:08:00.690
How do you either pick people who are less likely to have that,

1117
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.900
that just go into a blind kind of red zone where they're unresponsive,
uh,

1118
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.890
or,
uh,

1119
01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:12.610
prepare people and condition them so they can actually function when the shit

1120
01:08:12.611 --> 01:08:16.040
starts hitting the fan.
And then that's exactly right what you just said.
We

1121
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:21.040
<v 3>desensitize them to being in horrible situations and we condition them and work</v>

1122
01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:28.160
with,
keep putting that pressure on them until they can get through it.
Got It.

1123
01:08:28.161 --> 01:08:32.840
So it's just a matter of exposure.
And most,
most guys do,
you know,

1124
01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:36.950
most,
most guys,
they go,
okay,
I'm used to this.
And then,

1125
01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:40.880
and then it'll be up a level eight for real.
It'll be up a level.

1126
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:43.700
So you'll and most guys will be good there too.

1127
01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:46.130
You'll have a couple of fallout there,
but uh,

1128
01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:51.460
but the seal teams does a very good job of applying that pressure and

1129
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.720
conditioning you in desensitizing you to horrible situations so that you can

1130
01:08:56.721 --> 01:08:59.600
deal with it when it comes.
Uh,

1131
01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.420
<v 0>so I want to talk a little bit,</v>

1132
01:09:02.421 --> 01:09:04.180
we're just going to shift gears a little bit and I know we're,

1133
01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:07.080
we're going to bounce around a lot,
but,
so I,
I have,
uh,

1134
01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:12.110
I've heard that I've heard of your workouts,
uh,
when you're deployed,

1135
01:09:12.111 --> 01:09:15.800
and one guy said,
I don't know if this is true that you would,
uh,
you know,

1136
01:09:15.801 --> 01:09:18.400
roll with like 20 guys in a platoon as,

1137
01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:21.200
as a workout and just tap out like 20 guys.
Is that true?

1138
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:25.670
<v 3>Well,
yeah,
I mean,
you're own with guys that don't know anything.</v>

1139
01:09:25.671 --> 01:09:29.870
And so in order to get good training in,
I would just have guys,
you know,
come in,

1140
01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:33.710
you know,
every 15 minutes.
And,
you know,
I,
I,

1141
01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:36.850
I remember this particular year when I was at team too,

1142
01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.850
and I'll just have the guys come in every 15 or 20 minutes and just,
you know,

1143
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:44.960
roll with them and then another guy would come in.
So,
yeah,
it's tough,
but I mean,

1144
01:09:44.961 --> 01:09:46.850
I was,
you know,
better than them at Jujitsu.

1145
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:50.540
And so it's not that I was any tougher,
I just knew more.

1146
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:53.660
When you look at,
uh,
of course,
you know,

1147
01:09:53.661 --> 01:09:57.530
many very good competitors in Jujitsu,
MMA.

1148
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:58.970
When you look at the,

1149
01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.930
<v 0>the top performers in that world,</v>

1150
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:05.760
and then some of the top performers you've met in the CEO World,
uh,

1151
01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:11.320
<v 3>what are the commonalities,
if any?
Well,</v>

1152
01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:13.580
let me talk about Jujitsu first.
Sure.
Uh,

1153
01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:17.700
one thing I noticed about Jujitsu is there are,

1154
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:21.360
when we get to that,
when he gets to the world class level of Jujitsu guys,

1155
01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:27.080
there is a stratification there between guys that have a natural God given

1156
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:38.340
ability that is above and beyond normal human.

1157
01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.780
It's above and beyond what a normal human being would do or should be able to
do.

1158
01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.420
Right?
And there's not many of those people who loves you,
put,

1159
01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.200
who comes to mind when you think of that?
I,
I think,
um,

1160
01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:58.150
Hixon Gracie who,
who,
you know,
I've trained with him and yeah,
he's,
I was,

1161
01:10:58.210 --> 01:10:59.680
I was a blue belt when I trained with them,

1162
01:10:59.681 --> 01:11:03.850
but you could feel that this guy is not normal.
Uh,

1163
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:08.380
Dean Lester,
who was my training partner forever.
And you know,
I've rolled with,

1164
01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:13.090
Gosh from all over the world and dean lister is at another level.

1165
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.680
I've never worked with Marcello Garcia,
but,
uh,
you know,

1166
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:21.360
just from watching you and competition,
you can see that he has that as well.

1167
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:24.030
And then the next,
and,
and I mean,
that's,

1168
01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.250
there's not a large group of people at that level.

1169
01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.500
And then the next level down is guys that trained like maniacs and they're great

1170
01:11:31.501 --> 01:11:34.560
athletes and that's that.
And they're awesome to,
you know,

1171
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.400
those guys are the world champions,
et cetera.
Um,

1172
01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.570
so that's,
that's my estimation.

1173
01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:46.830
And having rolled with guys on both ends of the spectrum,
you know,

1174
01:11:46.831 --> 01:11:48.690
Dean as an example,
because Dean

1175
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:56.030
has won world championships training a minuscule amount compared to,

1176
01:11:57.690 --> 01:12:00.030
you know,
what a normal person would have to train to get there,

1177
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:05.070
which I don't know if that's a compliment or,
uh,
uh,
us,
uh,

1178
01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:09.780
you know,
a negative.
Right.
But you know,
it's,
it's true.
Yeah.

1179
01:12:09.781 --> 01:12:13.990
It's a now in the seal teams as far as the,

1180
01:12:13.991 --> 01:12:18.990
the high performers,
I think it's the people that,
you know,

1181
01:12:18.991 --> 01:12:22.920
you,
you,
it's a certain level of focus I think.

1182
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.390
And again,

1183
01:12:24.391 --> 01:12:29.340
a certain level of open mindedness and a certain level of dedication to the task

1184
01:12:29.341 --> 01:12:31.500
and to the craft that they're dealing with.

1185
01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:36.510
And you get guys that are just super passionate about the job.

1186
01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:39.510
And if you're super passionate about the job in the seal teams,

1187
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.660
there is a really good chance you're going to be one of the top performers

1188
01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.360
because you're gonna put in all that extra effort to do well.

1189
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:50.730
What are you world class at that people might not realize?

1190
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:55.860
Uh,
well,
first of all,
I think worldclass is a,
is a strong word.

1191
01:12:55.861 --> 01:12:59.520
It's a stroller.
I get to,
I sorry to interrupt because I,

1192
01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:03.880
because I'd say I'm worldclass at,
uh,
you know,
just about nothing.
Um,

1193
01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:08.100
and,
and as far as what people might not know about me,

1194
01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:12.420
one thing that's interesting about me is I live a fairly compartmentalized life

1195
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:13.890
where,
you know,

1196
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:18.360
my Jujitsu friends would not meet my seal friends who would not meet the people

1197
01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:20.670
that I work with in a leadership situation or in a,

1198
01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:22.860
in a civilian sector business world.

1199
01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:26.120
So there's people that don't know that,
you know,

1200
01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:29.970
I'm a really good Jujitsu player or that I work with big companies and help

1201
01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:34.890
their leadership.
And so there's that.

1202
01:13:34.891 --> 01:13:37.030
But if I had to say,
you know what,
uh,

1203
01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:42.530
the skill set that I have that I think helped me was number one,

1204
01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:48.650
taking complex things and making them simple and then being able to communicate

1205
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:53.820
that simplicity to other people is number one.

1206
01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.200
And number two,

1207
01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:59.250
the ability that we already talked about to detach myself from situations

1208
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:04.620
emotionally and mentally,
usually not physically.

1209
01:14:04.621 --> 01:14:09.130
You have to be able to do it without detaching physically.
But those,

1210
01:14:09.131 --> 01:14:14.020
those things would be what I would say my talents if I had any.

1211
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:18.490
Because,
you know,
I'm definitely not the fastest,
not the strongest,
not the,
uh,

1212
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:23.140
not the most flexible or whatever and not the smartest,
but it seems like,

1213
01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:27.310
um,
it's very interesting when Madonna would say the same thing about,
like,

1214
01:14:27.311 --> 01:14:29.650
I'm not the best answer,
I'm not the best singer.
I'm not the best this,

1215
01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:33.790
but I think like yourself,
she's kind of a,
um,
what a five tool player,

1216
01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:37.540
like a baseball player who can like hit for power,
hit for getting on base,

1217
01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:39.470
could field,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
I mean,

1218
01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:44.500
and it's the collection of those tools that makes you say are worldclass

1219
01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:49.890
commander or something like that.
Uh,
what is your,
what do,

1220
01:14:49.891 --> 01:14:52.930
what do your morning routines look like on an ideal day?

1221
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:55.780
Like what does the first 90 minutes of your day look like?
When do you wake up?

1222
01:14:56.530 --> 01:15:01.510
What does,
what does that look like?
So I wake up early,
I wake up at four 45.

1223
01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:02.643
Um,

1224
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:07.740
I like to have that psychological win over the enemy.

1225
01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:11.530
And you know,

1226
01:15:11.531 --> 01:15:16.531
for me that when I wake up in the morning and I don't know why I'm thinking

1227
01:15:18.911 --> 01:15:23.200
about the enemy and what they're doing,
and I know I'm not active duty anymore,

1228
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:25.090
but it's still in there,

1229
01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:30.480
that there's a guy that's in a cave somewhere and he's rocking back and forth

1230
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:34.240
and he's

1231
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.480
got a machine gun in one hand and a,
and a grenade in the other hand.

1232
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:44.530
And he's waiting for me and we're going to meet.

1233
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.780
And when I wake up in the morning,
I'm thinking to myself,

1234
01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:55.410
what can I do to be ready for that moment which is coming,

1235
01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:01.960
which is coming.
And uh,
so that,
that propels me out of bed.

1236
01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:06.820
That,
and I work out early in the morning,
uh,

1237
01:16:06.821 --> 01:16:09.850
she wake up at four 45.
What's the next thing?

1238
01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:13.300
Aside from like brushing your teeth and doing the usual,
uh,

1239
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.510
do the usual start working out.
And I try,

1240
01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:20.200
ideally I'd like to get done with my workout by the time the sun comes up.

1241
01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:23.480
And so now if there's waves,
you know,
I live by the Ocean Salt,

1242
01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.380
go surfing and get done with that.
And what is the morning work out?
Well,

1243
01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:31.850
what does a typical morning workout look like?
Uh,
I,

1244
01:16:33.450 --> 01:16:38.080
you know,
I do a lot of pull ups,
pushups in depths I dead lift and do squats.

1245
01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:40.900
I do sprints.
I mean it's everything that everybody knows.

1246
01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:45.820
It's everything that everybody does,
right?
I swinging kettle bells,
uh,
do burpees,

1247
01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:49.540
you know,
it's,
it's all that and it's like a 60 minute workout.
How long has,

1248
01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:54.250
it depends.
It depends on what's going on.
Um,
I will,

1249
01:16:55.370 --> 01:17:00.190
I'll try and do some strength movements to be strong,
you know,
dead lifts,
cleans,

1250
01:17:00.191 --> 01:17:04.570
clean and jerk,
something like that.
Uh,
to make myself stronger.
Or even if it's,

1251
01:17:04.571 --> 01:17:07.510
even if it's something like just dead hang pullups and I'm just maxing out,

1252
01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.280
but I'll do like that to make myself stronger.

1253
01:17:10.281 --> 01:17:13.250
And sometimes that can take awhile,
you know,
cause I'll just want to relax and,

1254
01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:18.680
you know,
hit singles or doubles.
I'm on dead lifts or cleans or whatever.

1255
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:22.750
And then when I get done with that,
I'll do some kind of,
uh,

1256
01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:25.370
some kind of metabolic conditioning of some kind.
You know,

1257
01:17:25.371 --> 01:17:30.371
I'll be sprinting or rowing or swinging a kettle bell or you know,

1258
01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:33.290
lighter weight clean and jerks for wraps or something like that.

1259
01:17:33.291 --> 01:17:35.000
So that's what it looks like for me.

1260
01:17:35.490 --> 01:17:40.250
So you finish training when the sun comes up,
hit the waves,

1261
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:43.790
since they're there,
which is a good policy and,
um,

1262
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:49.700
what happens then,
you know,
I'll come back and,

1263
01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.560
you know,
start doing normal human stuff.
Right?

1264
01:17:54.561 --> 01:17:56.810
That's one of the work.
But you know,
I,
you know,
I have,

1265
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:59.000
I have a leadership and management consulting business,

1266
01:17:59.001 --> 01:18:03.200
so I'll have clients to talk to all of emails to push out,
um,

1267
01:18:04.450 --> 01:18:06.560
and,
and I'll,
I'll start taking care of that business.

1268
01:18:06.561 --> 01:18:11.561
I normally don't get hungry until 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning,

1269
01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.800
so around 10 or 11 o'clock I start wanting,
you know,

1270
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:19.520
to start to graze on some food and I'll do that.

1271
01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:25.070
And then by,
by noon I'm,
I'm feeling pretty hungry.
Like I need some lunch.
And,
uh,

1272
01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:29.540
what is,
what is your diet generally look like?
January looks like steak,

1273
01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:34.310
steak and chicken and salad.

1274
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:38.840
Paleo Ish.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And um,
I don't know.
You know,

1275
01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:43.760
I'm no stranger to having some mint chocolate chip ice cream or some oval teen

1276
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:47.750
or whatever.
Uh,
you know,
again,
I'm not,
I'm not,

1277
01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:53.360
you know,
a competitive bodybuilder.
And so,
you know,
I,

1278
01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.020
I'll eat some normal food,
right?
You can indulge when the,
when the,

1279
01:18:58.021 --> 01:19:01.100
when the spirit moves you,
when you think of the word successful,

1280
01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:04.400
who are the first people or the first person that comes to mind?

1281
01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:15.120
So for me,
you know,
the,

1282
01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:19.780
the part of the world that I've seen is a very dark place.

1283
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:24.460
It's a dark place.
That's what war is.

1284
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:30.280
And when your job,

1285
01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:32.680
which my job was,

1286
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:38.050
was to expand that darkness in many ways.
I mean,

1287
01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:40.330
it's,
war is about killing people.

1288
01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.310
And so for me,

1289
01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:49.590
when I look to someone that's successful,

1290
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:56.270
it's someone that brings some light into that darkness.

1291
01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.460
So for me,

1292
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
the first people that come to my head are Mark Lee,

1293
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:12.180
who is one of my guys first seal killed in Iraq.
Mike Monster,

1294
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:15.480
one of my guys,
second seal killed in Iraq,

1295
01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:19.260
posthumously awarded the Medal of honor and Ryan Job,

1296
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:24.030
one of my guys wounded in Iraq,
blind in both eyes,

1297
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:30.720
made it home,
medically retired from the,
from the navy,

1298
01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:32.700
married his high school sweetheart,

1299
01:20:34.090 --> 01:20:36.610
got her pregnant and

1300
01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:40.330
finished his college degree.

1301
01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:46.030
And after his 22nd surgery to repair the damage that was done to his,

1302
01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:50.320
his head and face,
there were complications and he died as well.

1303
01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.400
But all of those guys

1304
01:20:56.710 --> 01:20:58.300
in all that darkness,

1305
01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:04.830
they did things.
They made a sacrifice

1306
01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:10.350
that
was completely selfless.

1307
01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:20.410
And to do that
and to live

1308
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:25.000
and fight and die

1309
01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:28.030
like a warrior,

1310
01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:34.650
that to me is success.
And those guys

1311
01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:36.220
<v 0>are my heroes.</v>

1312
01:21:43.090 --> 01:21:47.560
What do you,
what do you struggle with?

1313
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:51.070
And I asked that because I mean,
we've,
we've only just met,

1314
01:21:51.071 --> 01:21:56.071
but it's hard for me as a civilian to fathom what,

1315
01:21:57.010 --> 01:22:01.510
what you and your friends had been through,
uh,

1316
01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.270
impossible for me to find them.
Um,
and I mean,

1317
01:22:04.271 --> 01:22:09.271
it makes me just feel ashamed for ever complaining about a bad day or a hard

1318
01:22:09.671 --> 01:22:11.330
day.
Uh,

1319
01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:15.790
given what you guys have experienced in the stakes that are involved and the

1320
01:22:15.791 --> 01:22:20.791
sacrifices and the sadness and tragedy that is a part of that job.

1321
01:22:22.690 --> 01:22:26.750
Uh,
what,
what do you struggle with,
uh,

1322
01:22:26.751 --> 01:22:30.020
whether it's in the business sphere or just in life in general,

1323
01:22:30.170 --> 01:22:33.230
if you're open to talking about it?
Because I certainly,
I know that

1324
01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.130
I used to,
when I had these icons in my head,
I was like,
oh my God,

1325
01:22:41.131 --> 01:22:43.920
Richard Branson,
he's got it all figured out.
He's doing everything perfectly.

1326
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:48.660
He's just,
he's on cruise control,
hitting home runs every time he gets it bad.

1327
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:52.930
And as I've slowly gotten to known,
honestly,

1328
01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:57.390
Branson directly,
although I have met him before,
I realized like people all have,

1329
01:22:57.391 --> 01:23:00.300
and this is something that you talked about the detachment.
You know,

1330
01:23:00.301 --> 01:23:01.111
when I find myself,

1331
01:23:01.111 --> 01:23:05.860
I've always had kind of impatience and anger issues and it's helped me to be in

1332
01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:06.520
sport

1333
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:10.420
<v 3>and in business and in a negotiation,
but it's also caused some problems for me.</v>

1334
01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:11.850
And,
uh,

1335
01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:16.610
but I've realized that one of the ways I can tone that down is by realizing that

1336
01:23:16.611 --> 01:23:20.570
like everybody has,
everyone is fighting a battle,
you know,
nothing about,
uh,

1337
01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.840
in some way.
But what are the things that,
uh,

1338
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:26.950
that you find difficult or that you struggle with or have struggled with?

1339
01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:36.650
It's,
it's,
it's an interesting question because,

1340
01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:41.840
and this is a filler answer in case you couldn't tell that because when I start

1341
01:23:41.841 --> 01:23:42.500
off with,

1342
01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:46.790
it's an interesting question and that means I'm not really quite sure what to

1343
01:23:46.791 --> 01:23:48.280
say.
Um,

1344
01:23:51.190 --> 01:23:52.023
<v 4>I've,</v>

1345
01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:56.730
<v 3>you know,
I've been,
I've been lucky,
I've been blessed.</v>

1346
01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:59.860
I've had,
you know,

1347
01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:03.690
a life that I would not trade with anyone in the world.

1348
01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:08.340
Um,
when you talk about Ramadi,
I,

1349
01:24:08.341 --> 01:24:12.270
that was the highlight of my life because I was leading men in combat,

1350
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:17.300
which is something which was something that I always wanted to do and something

1351
01:24:18.811 --> 01:24:23.220
that I felt that I was destined to do.
And when I was in that situation,

1352
01:24:23.221 --> 01:24:26.070
I knew that I wasn't,
I don't look back and say,
Oh,

1353
01:24:26.071 --> 01:24:30.330
I wish I would have enjoyed that.
No,
I knew it then.
This is it.
This is,

1354
01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:34.380
this is what you have been waiting for your whole life and what you really have

1355
01:24:34.381 --> 01:24:36.750
been preparing for your whole life.

1356
01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:44.150
And I was lucky to be there and I was lucky to have incredible guys to work

1357
01:24:44.151 --> 01:24:44.391
with,

1358
01:24:44.391 --> 01:24:48.770
both in my unit and in the other units in the army and the Marine Corps that we

1359
01:24:48.771 --> 01:24:49.460
work with.

1360
01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:53.780
I was lucky enough to have guys that were so brave and so dedicated,

1361
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:58.700
and I will use the word fearless,

1362
01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:02.030
not that they didn't have fear,
but that they overcame it all the time.

1363
01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:08.360
And so I'd say if there's anything that I struggle with now,
it's just that,

1364
01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:15.210
does anything else matter?

1365
01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:20.190
Is there in the answer's no.
The answer's no.

1366
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:22.950
Nothing else matters.
Nothing else is close.

1367
01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:28.640
And so you have to deal with that.

1368
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:30.900
And,
and I don't,

1369
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:36.000
struggle is a strong word because I don't sit there at night,
you know,

1370
01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:40.680
wishing I was back while.
Okay.
I do do that.
You know,
sometimes I,

1371
01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:42.390
I often wish I was back,

1372
01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:47.930
but I don't dwell on it because it's gone and I'm so happy that I could be part

1373
01:25:51.181 --> 01:25:55.410
of it and that I was able to work with such tremendous guys and,
uh,

1374
01:25:55.620 --> 01:26:00.000
I try and keep their memory alive every day in my own head.

1375
01:26:01.650 --> 01:26:02.850
How did you,
when you were

1376
01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:11.270
reconcile the risks that are inherent in that job with family,

1377
01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:16.550
with your family?
Well,
first of all,

1378
01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.830
I actually,
when I had,
when I was young,
you know,

1379
01:26:21.831 --> 01:26:24.260
I thought that I was going to die.
I thought I was gonna die in combat.

1380
01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:28.310
There was no war going on.
This is ignorant thought,
right?
This is young,
stupid,

1381
01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:33.490
um,
you know,
ah,
unknowledgeable idiot saying I'm only going to live to be,

1382
01:26:33.491 --> 01:26:34.810
I'll never going to make it to 30.
Right.

1383
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:40.460
And I was good with that because I had nothing.
I was a single guy that was,
uh,

1384
01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:44.720
wanted to go out and destroy the world,
you know?
That's awesome.
Then,

1385
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:47.600
you know,
as I got older and I realized though,

1386
01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.990
I'm actually going to live to be 30 and probably 40.

1387
01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:57.580
And so I had to,
you know,
work through that.
Um,

1388
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.843
and you know what?

1389
01:26:58.990 --> 01:27:03.260
I got married along the way had kids and I actually,

1390
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:05.120
when I had kids,

1391
01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:10.180
I actually felt more ready to die because,

1392
01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:16.490
you know,
I had left my fulfill that.
I just filled my,
my,
my,

1393
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:21.560
I left the,
I left children.
And so I actually felt like I was okay with that.

1394
01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:27.110
Um,
which I guess that's bad,

1395
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:28.550
but you know,

1396
01:27:28.670 --> 01:27:33.670
men have been traveling and fighting for thousands and thousands of years since

1397
01:27:33.771 --> 01:27:38.030
the beginning of mankind.
And I knew that as a warrior,

1398
01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.553
that's okay.

1399
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:44.890
And sometimes men don't come home and the family's drive on and that's the way

1400
01:27:45.591 --> 01:27:49.610
the world works.
So I didn't really have much to reconcile there.

1401
01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:55.670
Um,
now as far as division of time and you know,

1402
01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:59.030
having a family,
I can tell you,
uh,
you know,

1403
01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:03.890
I was very lopsided and unbalanced in that situation.
You know,
I,

1404
01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:09.080
the seal teams to me was everything and nothing else mattered.
Well,

1405
01:28:09.081 --> 01:28:11.960
I shouldn't say it didn't matter,
but it was definitely on a much lower priority.

1406
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:17.950
And I remember actually my wife sent me an email when I was on deployment and

1407
01:28:18.201 --> 01:28:18.981
she,
you know,

1408
01:28:18.981 --> 01:28:23.300
she's very independent doing her thing and she sends me an email that says

1409
01:28:23.301 --> 01:28:27.560
something along the lines of,
hey,
you know,
send us a picture of where you sleep.

1410
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:31.550
Fair enough.
You know,
they show the kids were when I sleep at night.

1411
01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:35.100
And so I went up to my room and we had some old,
uh,

1412
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:37.910
Saddam palace that we had taken over,

1413
01:28:37.911 --> 01:28:41.270
not really palace Saddam House that we had taken over.
And that's where we lived.

1414
01:28:41.271 --> 01:28:42.890
And I had the one of the rooms in this building.

1415
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:47.120
And so I went up and I took some pictures,
some digital pictures of my bed,

1416
01:28:47.690 --> 01:28:49.880
and I looked at him and I said,
oh,
wait a second.

1417
01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.820
And I went into all folder that I had and I pulled it out and I took out

1418
01:28:55.821 --> 01:29:00.821
pictures of my wife and kids and I hung them up on the wall and I took pictures

1419
01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:08.640
and I sent those home and I took the pictures back down because

1420
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:15.790
I didn't want to be thinking about my wife and kids when I had men's lives at

1421
01:29:17.451 --> 01:29:19.460
stake.
And

1422
01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:25.650
that's how I compartmentalized and did what I did,
what I had to do,

1423
01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.450
which was be dedicated to my guys,
to the mission and to the country.

1424
01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.060
And at that point in time,
you know,

1425
01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:37.080
it had to take priority over everything took priority over there.
I mean,
my guys,

1426
01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:38.460
they had families,
they had to go home too.

1427
01:29:38.970 --> 01:29:43.770
I can't be thinking about this other stuff.
So there's a little reconciliation.

1428
01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:49.940
<v 0>Who are,
uh,
now that you've entered the,
uh,
the civilian world,</v>

1429
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:54.230
are there particular nonmilitary leaders,

1430
01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:58.830
whether they're CEOs or maybe outside of the private sector,
uh,

1431
01:29:58.970 --> 01:30:00.530
you admire or

1432
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:05.300
look to in some way as role models?

1433
01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:11.300
<v 3>You know,
you meet these guys and girls and they are,</v>

1434
01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:15.450
a lot of them might as well have been in the seal teams.
You know,

1435
01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:19.290
they're aggressive,
they're making things happen.
And yeah,
I'll,
I'll,

1436
01:30:19.291 --> 01:30:22.230
I admire and learn from them all the time,
you know,
and,

1437
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:25.560
and I think they get the same thing for me.
And that's why I'm in business,

1438
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.220
you know?
So,
uh,
absolutely.
There's some,
you know,

1439
01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:33.330
America's the greatest country on earth and you know,

1440
01:30:33.331 --> 01:30:37.020
capitalism is what makes this country one of the,

1441
01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:40.590
one of the things that makes this country so great and those folks that run

1442
01:30:40.591 --> 01:30:44.940
these businesses are,
you know,
part of that fabric that makes America great.
So,

1443
01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:48.300
absolutely there,
they're incredible people and,

1444
01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:51.630
and they have the same faults that seals have and,

1445
01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:53.850
and they make the same mistakes and they get,

1446
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:57.930
they get involved emotionally with stuff and their ego gets in the way,

1447
01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:01.980
of course,
just like it happens with seals,
it happens with them.
And,
and they,

1448
01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:02.760
you know,

1449
01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:06.660
they make the same mistakes where they don't explain the mission to their troops

1450
01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:11.130
or they don't break it down from a strategic level to a tactical level so that

1451
01:31:11.131 --> 01:31:14.130
people on the frontline can understand.
So it's all the same mistakes.

1452
01:31:14.131 --> 01:31:16.590
And that's again,
that's kind of why we're in business now.
Right.

1453
01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:20.580
Humans will be humans.
Exactly.
Unfortunately.
Yes.
That is correct.

1454
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:25.140
<v 0>And you know,
when you,
when you were talking about,
um,
the detachment,</v>

1455
01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:28.990
it made me think of,
uh,
uh,

1456
01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:30.270
quite a few years ago,

1457
01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:34.410
but I had my first sort of frivolous lawsuits come in,

1458
01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:37.410
which completely paralyze me.
I mean,

1459
01:31:37.411 --> 01:31:42.411
I was so intimidated and shocked and fearful and it ended up getting completely

1460
01:31:43.471 --> 01:31:45.750
tossed out.
But it took a long time and a lot of money.

1461
01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:50.400
And I ended up developing migraines.

1462
01:31:50.401 --> 01:31:53.880
I started clenching my jaw to the point where these shooting pains and I had to

1463
01:31:53.881 --> 01:31:55.320
get a mouthpiece in it.

1464
01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:59.040
It caused a whole cascade of health problems and issues.

1465
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:02.350
And I remember talking to a number of my buddies who had been in business for

1466
01:32:02.351 --> 01:32:04.960
decades and at very high levels.
And one of them,

1467
01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:10.460
I won't give his full name,
where Pete,
really hilarious,
uh,

1468
01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:13.990
but brilliantly effective executive.
He goes,
Timmy,
he's like,

1469
01:32:13.991 --> 01:32:14.770
you're too fucking nice.

1470
01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:17.020
I should have sued you just because you should get used to it.
And he's like,

1471
01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:20.440
starts talking to me,
treating it like such a non event.

1472
01:32:20.441 --> 01:32:25.330
It was just such a nonevent for him and I couldn't compute it at the time.
But,

1473
01:32:25.670 --> 01:32:26.503
uh,

1474
01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:31.480
now I've just realized like some of these things are a cost of doing business

1475
01:32:31.481 --> 01:32:34.930
and if you're going to be aggressive and push the envelope and step into

1476
01:32:34.931 --> 01:32:37.870
environments that are uncertain because that's where a lot of rewards are,

1477
01:32:37.871 --> 01:32:40.150
potentially you're going to deal with these things.

1478
01:32:40.151 --> 01:32:44.170
And so now I'm at a point like I've been exposed to that enough times,

1479
01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.760
didn't not necessarily frivolous lawsuits,

1480
01:32:45.761 --> 01:32:50.761
but just legal headaches because that's a sort of a side effect of having a very

1481
01:32:50.921 --> 01:32:53.770
vigorous free market,
uh,
on one hand is you,

1482
01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:57.810
you have some legal complications.
And,
uh,

1483
01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:01.570
what I've tried to figure out for myself,
uh,

1484
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:06.750
spending time with people who have been deployed and done the realistic training

1485
01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:12.730
that you've referred to.
I mean,
some of which is just beyond intense,

1486
01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:16.600
uh,
as they've described it to me.
I've wanted to

1487
01:33:18.170 --> 01:33:22.280
take myself out of this sort of keyboard,
uh,

1488
01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:27.340
shackled experience from day to day and expose myself to more of these stresses

1489
01:33:28.551 --> 01:33:33.551
to try to toughen myself and inoculate myself against future uncertainty and

1490
01:33:33.621 --> 01:33:36.100
things like that.
What are,
uh,

1491
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:40.760
what are skills or experiences that you think every man should have?

1492
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:47.400
No,
I mean,
there's a whole lot,
there's a whole list of those.
Oh yeah,
no,
I'm,
I'm,

1493
01:33:47.530 --> 01:33:49.440
I'm interested because quite frankly,
I feel like,

1494
01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.320
and I've had female friends say this to me where they're like,
you know,

1495
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.960
<v 6>okay,</v>

1496
01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.570
<v 0>I meet a lot of guys.
Like I date a lot of guys,</v>

1497
01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.700
but there just aren't many men out there anymore,

1498
01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:04.510
which that we could dig really far into that.
And there's,

1499
01:34:04.810 --> 01:34:09.250
there's all sorts of complicated sort of gender questions and topics to that

1500
01:34:09.251 --> 01:34:11.620
could raise.
But just putting all that aside for the time being,

1501
01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.430
I think a lot of folks like myself,
even,
uh,

1502
01:34:14.431 --> 01:34:17.260
and I experienced this when I was doing the four hour chef and really got back

1503
01:34:17.261 --> 01:34:22.090
into doing hunting and feel dressing and trying to build things and working with

1504
01:34:22.091 --> 01:34:23.080
fire and I was like,
wow,

1505
01:34:23.081 --> 01:34:28.081
I feel like I'm slowly becoming maybe barely manually literate,

1506
01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:32.320
you know,
compared to like my great grandfather who was chopping wood every day,

1507
01:34:32.321 --> 01:34:35.920
building stuff,
fixing things that broke,
et cetera.
Um,

1508
01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:40.630
so what's,
what would be on that list in your mind?
I mean,

1509
01:34:40.631 --> 01:34:42.280
if guys are listening to this and you knew it,

1510
01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:47.210
I want to toughen the fuck up just still,
just a little bit.
You know,
you,

1511
01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:50.680
if you went bare bones basic,
you're talking food,
shelter and water,
right?

1512
01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:53.710
Do you have the skills to bring those things to the table and make them happen?

1513
01:34:53.711 --> 01:34:58.040
I think that's a very basic place to start.
I can tell you that from,
from my

1514
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:58.873
<v 3>perspective.</v>

1515
01:34:59.390 --> 01:35:04.390
And I actually gave a speech at one of my buddies weddings and you know,

1516
01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:11.500
I said that there was three things in my life that made me feel like a man.

1517
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:17.090
And when you,
when I say feel like a man,

1518
01:35:17.091 --> 01:35:20.060
it doesn't mean blow up and feel like a man.

1519
01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:24.260
It actually means the opposite actually means I'm confident enough that I don't

1520
01:35:24.261 --> 01:35:27.560
need to bow up and I don't need meaning puff up your chest,

1521
01:35:27.561 --> 01:35:29.950
puff up my chest and I'm a bad ass.
Yeah.

1522
01:35:30.710 --> 01:35:32.840
And the first one was,

1523
01:35:32.841 --> 01:35:37.841
that was actually a Jujitsu was learning how to fight and knowing that there's

1524
01:35:38.691 --> 01:35:42.740
not a question that if I get into an altercation I can handle myself.

1525
01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.890
I 100% that.
Cause when you're,

1526
01:35:45.891 --> 01:35:48.140
when you don't know Jujitsu or you don't know how to fight,

1527
01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:51.680
then you questioned that in the back of your mind.
And how do you,

1528
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:55.970
how do you answer that question?
You act like an Asshole,
right?

1529
01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:59.720
You,
these are the guys that run around in a bar getting in fights with people.

1530
01:35:59.721 --> 01:36:01.400
Cause they don't know.
They don't,

1531
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:06.260
they're not confident that they can handle themselves.
So that was number one.

1532
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:09.230
Number two was going into combat because again,

1533
01:36:09.231 --> 01:36:11.480
there was a big question mark of view,

1534
01:36:11.481 --> 01:36:16.370
don't know for sure how you're going to react in those situations.

1535
01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:21.680
And I felt pretty good that I knew how it was going to act,
but you know,

1536
01:36:21.681 --> 01:36:24.320
you need to,
you need to check the box.

1537
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:29.590
And so I checked that box and I knew that I was going to do fine and that I did

1538
01:36:31.161 --> 01:36:36.161
find in that I was brave and not scared and was able to detach myself and make

1539
01:36:36.201 --> 01:36:39.050
decisions and make things happen.
So that was good.

1540
01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:44.620
And then the last one was getting married and having kids because now all of a

1541
01:36:45.621 --> 01:36:50.621
sudden I have other humans that are directly relying on me for as their,

1542
01:36:51.970 --> 01:36:56.420
you know,
their soul kind of leader and you know,

1543
01:36:56.421 --> 01:36:59.660
realizing that this is the most important thing.

1544
01:36:59.661 --> 01:37:01.310
You have to make this the most important thing in your life.

1545
01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:05.930
And you're out of that game too,
you know,
so you're no longer trying to do them.

1546
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.300
You're no longer trying to impress,
you know,

1547
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:13.010
a girl or whatever because you got a girl.
Right?
And so there's a,

1548
01:37:13.011 --> 01:37:16.730
there's a level of,
you know,
I don't care anymore,
you know,

1549
01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:21.320
that that is also nice.
So those,
those three things were for me were kind of the,

1550
01:37:21.810 --> 01:37:26.150
where I was able to say,
okay,
you know,
I'm good now,
let's focus on being a good,

1551
01:37:26.190 --> 01:37:28.850
a good guy and moving forward.
But those were,

1552
01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:34.490
those are,
those are three good ones.
The,
the on the Jujitsu side,
I,

1553
01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:38.760
that's the only one that I can,
that I can speak to having done,
uh,
you know,

1554
01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:42.210
a little bit here and there and also Moy Thai and whatnot.
But I think that it's,

1555
01:37:42.230 --> 01:37:45.890
it's so valuable on so many levels because not only do,
you know,

1556
01:37:45.891 --> 01:37:46.880
you can handle yourself,

1557
01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:49.880
but if you think you're a tough guy and you go to a good gym,

1558
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:54.590
you get taught really quickly how uncuff you are.
And so,
uh,

1559
01:37:54.591 --> 01:37:56.370
I just remember for instance as training

1560
01:37:56.370 --> 01:38:00.150
<v 0>at fair tax ages ago here in San Francisco and,
um,
you know,</v>

1561
01:38:00.151 --> 01:38:04.400
one of the guys who was a trainer,
his name is n e n,
n and he's a southpaw.

1562
01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:05.850
So I trained with them because I'm a south pump,

1563
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:09.660
the most unassuming little dude you've ever seen in your life.
Calves,

1564
01:38:09.661 --> 01:38:13.230
the size of my torso,
but otherwise you would never guess in a million years.

1565
01:38:13.231 --> 01:38:14.640
And he had terrible fashion sense.

1566
01:38:14.641 --> 01:38:18.420
And so you'd wear these like huge baseball caps.
It would cover his entire head.

1567
01:38:18.421 --> 01:38:21.000
So he looked like he was about seven years old.
It was our ears,
only,

1568
01:38:21.001 --> 01:38:24.540
like five foot,
one,
five foot,
two huge baggy tee shirt,
baggy pants.

1569
01:38:24.541 --> 01:38:29.480
So he just looked like average guy who's going to be some type of manual labor,

1570
01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:33.240
uh,
and people have mistaken for being Mexican.

1571
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:37.920
And I just remember he went out to this bar because the gym was on Clementine

1572
01:38:37.921 --> 01:38:41.920
history,
which was between Howard and folsum I think around.
No,
I'm sorry.
Yeah,

1573
01:38:41.921 --> 01:38:45.360
it was between Howard and folsum between fifth and six,
which is a,

1574
01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:50.400
it was a terrible place to be when,
when,
um,
when I was training there,

1575
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:54.380
in fact Alex Gong,
the owner was shot in the chest and killed,
um,

1576
01:38:55.290 --> 01:38:58.440
basically while I was there and uh,

1577
01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:01.110
by guy stuck in traffic.
It's an insane story.

1578
01:39:01.111 --> 01:39:05.520
But suffice to say that he goes out to a bar and I was at a fly in camp at the

1579
01:39:05.521 --> 01:39:10.350
time with a bunch of other guys and this guy pulls a knife on one of the other

1580
01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:13.110
trainers.
Why?
Who knows?

1581
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:18.120
And so everybody kind of backs up and they're like kind of two groups facing

1582
01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:22.500
each other.
And one of the guys is like,
I'm gonna fuck you up.

1583
01:39:22.501 --> 01:39:26.160
And to end who looks like he's like a tiny little guy and he just throws the

1584
01:39:26.161 --> 01:39:29.580
nastiest roundhouse kick you can imagine,

1585
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:31.470
basically breaks the guy in half.

1586
01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:33.810
Like it's a lego figure being broken by gorilla.

1587
01:39:34.890 --> 01:39:37.220
And then that was just the show stopper.
But it's just,

1588
01:39:37.230 --> 01:39:39.330
I think once you train with people like that,
you're like,

1589
01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:43.800
I am never going to pick a fight because you never know who theN is.

1590
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:49.530
Right.
And,
um,
and I,
I think it's very,

1591
01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:50.390
uh,
it,

1592
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:53.970
it also that confidence and that humility I think transfers to so many other

1593
01:39:53.971 --> 01:39:57.420
areas,
uh,
because you realize like,
wow,
you know,

1594
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:59.130
I thought I was the cat's meow.

1595
01:39:59.131 --> 01:40:02.190
I thought I was the king of the hill and in Areas A,
B,
c,
d or e,

1596
01:40:02.191 --> 01:40:06.060
but you know what,
that's probably not the case.
Um,
the,

1597
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:10.770
uh,
on the combat side of things,
uh,

1598
01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:16.220
what are stressful experiences that a civilian might expose themselves to that

1599
01:40:17.191 --> 01:40:20.340
could,
I know,
not perfectly simulate it,

1600
01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:25.020
but to perhaps give them that type of fear,

1601
01:40:25.021 --> 01:40:29.520
inoculation or conditioning on some level.
Um,
I think any of those,
you know,

1602
01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:34.170
rock climbing,
parachuting,
uh,
anything that has a real,

1603
01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.580
real danger to it,
which both those things can,
you know,
and do.

1604
01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:43.980
Um,
I think those,
those can definitely help.
I would say those are,

1605
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:47.220
those are people good exemption that we could sit here and brainstorm about it.

1606
01:40:47.490 --> 01:40:50.160
You know,
cause,
cause as soon as you put simulation,
you know,

1607
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:53.950
we could say paint ball,
right,
right.
But,
but there's no risk

1608
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.190
<v 3>risk and paintball,
they're just to zero.
So it's cool.</v>

1609
01:40:57.191 --> 01:41:01.720
And you can definitely get somewhat conditioned to,
you know,
that,

1610
01:41:01.721 --> 01:41:04.180
that panic and that stress level,
cause it hurts.
You get hit with a paint ball,

1611
01:41:04.181 --> 01:41:08.410
you know,
owl,
owl.
But it's not,
it's not the fear of death,

1612
01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:12.910
which the fear of death is the,
uh,
is I guess the,
the real,

1613
01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:16.190
the real thing that we're talking about.

1614
01:41:16.191 --> 01:41:19.480
And I guess you overcome that fear of death

1615
01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:23.920
<v 0>and then what else was there to be afraid of now?
Right.
You know,
well,</v>

1616
01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:26.400
you and I were,
uh,
you know,
we were sitting here where my house,

1617
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:30.330
and you notice the Musashi that I have out over there,
this,

1618
01:41:30.331 --> 01:41:34.470
this historical novel about,
uh,
Miyamoto Musashi.
And I,

1619
01:41:34.590 --> 01:41:37.170
I think that,
um,

1620
01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:41.370
I don't know where it came from and I can't really pinpoint it.
But,

1621
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:43.383
<v 3>uh,</v>

1622
01:41:43.770 --> 01:41:47.850
<v 0>the reason I have that there is to remind me that if you're constantly afraid of</v>

1623
01:41:47.851 --> 01:41:51.120
death,
I mean,
you're paralyzed in so many facets of your life.

1624
01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:54.240
It really prohibits you from making even effective decisions,
right?

1625
01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:56.580
So one could say,
well,
you should love your family and have the photos up.

1626
01:41:56.581 --> 01:41:56.971
And it's like,
well,

1627
01:41:56.971 --> 01:42:00.330
if I really want to love my family and go home to see my family,

1628
01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:04.890
maybe I shouldn't have those up as something that's going to occupy a part of my

1629
01:42:04.891 --> 01:42:08.040
brain.
I need to be effective in the field for me and my men.
Right?

1630
01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:08.791
No doubt about it.

1631
01:42:08.791 --> 01:42:12.240
So it's thinking not about that first move that looks good on paper and to

1632
01:42:12.241 --> 01:42:16.530
everyone around you.
But thinking about the second,
the tertiary effect,
etc.

1633
01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:20.180
<v 3>Um,
do you have,
um,</v>

1634
01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:25.110
are there any books that you've gifted to other people?
Uh,

1635
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:30.730
uh,
or,
or what,
what do you gift to someone?
So for books,

1636
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:32.253
there's,

1637
01:42:32.410 --> 01:42:36.970
I think there's only one book that I've ever given and have only given it to a

1638
01:42:36.971 --> 01:42:38.820
couple people.
Uh,

1639
01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:42.610
then that's a book called about face by Colonel David Hackworth.

1640
01:42:43.150 --> 01:42:47.680
And it is huge.
Have you ever heard of it?
I haven't.

1641
01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:50.920
And uh,
I was just looking for it.
Oh wait,
here's my,
here's my pad.
And,

1642
01:42:50.921 --> 01:42:54.430
and interestingly,
I looked for it today on,

1643
01:42:54.850 --> 01:42:59.350
on to see if I could download a digital copy and I don't think it's available

1644
01:42:59.351 --> 01:43:01.330
digital,
which surprised me.

1645
01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:07.360
So Colonel David Hackworth was the tail end of World War II.
Uh,

1646
01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:12.490
he was in Korea,
he was highly decorated in Korea.
He joined the,

1647
01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:17.290
like joined the merchant marines or something when he was 15 and got into the

1648
01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:20.080
army when again,
right after World War II.

1649
01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:22.600
So he kind of got raised by those World War II veterans.

1650
01:43:23.230 --> 01:43:28.180
And then he was in Korea and he was in Vietnam.
And he was just absolutely

1651
01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:34.920
borderline worshiped by the men that he led and by some of the senior leadership

1652
01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:42.670
and just a great book.
And he was a rebel,
you know,
and,

1653
01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:45.130
and he did question the way we were doing things.

1654
01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:50.280
And what's controversial about him is that he's the guy that said to Walter

1655
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:53.740
Cronkite,
or he said that he,

1656
01:43:53.741 --> 01:43:57.650
he's the first guy in Vietnam that said you were not going to win this thing.

1657
01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.860
And so he's kind of,
you know,
blacklisted by much of the army.
But you know,

1658
01:44:03.861 --> 01:44:05.810
as you dig into that,
what he was really saying was,

1659
01:44:05.811 --> 01:44:08.720
we're not going to win this thing if we keep fighting how we're fighting.

1660
01:44:08.721 --> 01:44:13.721
He recognized that we needed to do a significant paradigm shift in the strategy

1661
01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.290
that we were executing over there.
And you know,
it's like you,
you've heard,

1662
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:21.680
hey,
we've never lost,
we never lost a tactical battle in Vietnam.

1663
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:22.660
You've heard that,
right?
Yep.

1664
01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:25.010
And there's plenty of people that will say that all day long.

1665
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:30.370
But if you and I are leading a platoon and we take our platoon out and we hit a

1666
01:44:31.311 --> 01:44:34.910
booby trap and it kills three of our guys are two of our guys and wounds and

1667
01:44:34.911 --> 01:44:39.470
other three and there's no one to shoot at.
And we met evac those guys,

1668
01:44:39.471 --> 01:44:44.000
and we come back to base who,
who won,
who won that,
right?
And you know,

1669
01:44:44.001 --> 01:44:47.780
he recognized that.
So the metrics that were being used were sort of a,

1670
01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:51.340
not a lot a smokescreen,
but they were at,

1671
01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:53.740
at best the wrong metrics and ionic kids.

1672
01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:58.550
I had that book next to my bed in Ramadi and I literally read it every night.

1673
01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:01.490
I would,
you know,
that's how it fall asleep.
I'd go read a couple of pages,

1674
01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:04.580
you know,
just open to any and you'd find something in every,

1675
01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:06.850
it was very comparable.
You know,
they were working with the,

1676
01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:08.780
the South Vietnamese army and guess what?

1677
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:13.010
They were corrupt and they were scared and they weren't the best soldiers.

1678
01:45:13.011 --> 01:45:14.330
And we were working with Iraqis and guess what?

1679
01:45:14.331 --> 01:45:16.130
They were corrupt and they were scared and they weren't the best.

1680
01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:18.830
There were so many parallels between the two.

1681
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.950
And so that's the book that I've given to some,

1682
01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:25.220
a couple of close friends of mine that,
that,
you know,

1683
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:30.020
I wanted them to have about face.
The other book that I really,

1684
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:35.480
that the,
the,
the other book that I've read multiple times is blood meridian.

1685
01:45:36.110 --> 01:45:39.200
Blood Meridian.
Yeah.
I don't know that.
Oh,
okay.

1686
01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:43.870
So it's written by Cormac Mccarthy.
Oh,
fantastic writers.

1687
01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:46.460
So this is his best book.
And you know,

1688
01:45:46.461 --> 01:45:49.540
I was an English major in college and so,
you know,

1689
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:52.820
I was forced to read all kinds of books.
And you know,

1690
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:56.660
obviously Shakespeare is,
is,
is kind of the pinnacle in my mind.

1691
01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:01.960
And this Cormac McCarthy is the guy that I think it actually has that.

1692
01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:06.410
And if you read blood Meridian,
then there it is.
Right.

1693
01:46:06.411 --> 01:46:08.720
And I think what I find so

1694
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:15.560
gripping about it is,
you know,

1695
01:46:15.561 --> 01:46:18.110
I talked earlier about the darkness of the world,

1696
01:46:18.650 --> 01:46:23.650
and this is a historical novel based on a group called the Glanton gang that

1697
01:46:24.621 --> 01:46:26.870
were killing Indians.

1698
01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.240
And they ended up killing everybody.
Uh,

1699
01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:35.030
if you had black hair,
your scalp was going to be taken.

1700
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:40.430
And that's what it's about.
And it's completely epic and,
but it,

1701
01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:42.200
but for me,
it showed,

1702
01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:47.560
it communicated to me the a Guy Cormac Mccarthy was able to show the in

1703
01:46:49.741 --> 01:46:52.520
humanity.
And there's nothing good about that.
I mean,

1704
01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:57.400
there's nothing pleasant in any way,
shape or form in that book.

1705
01:46:57.910 --> 01:47:02.910
But that's in many ways the world that I lived in.

1706
01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:05.810
<v 0>Do you think there is,
I,</v>

1707
01:47:05.811 --> 01:47:10.400
I struggled with this myself because apart and when I say struggle with what am

1708
01:47:10.401 --> 01:47:11.234
I struggling with,

1709
01:47:11.930 --> 01:47:16.930
how much to voluntarily expose myself to darkness because I have sort of ups and

1710
01:47:17.601 --> 01:47:21.530
downs that I contend with and a lot of people in my family just hereditarily

1711
01:47:21.531 --> 01:47:25.700
deal with this.
But I feel like on one hand,
I don't want to be Pollyanna ish.

1712
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:27.200
I don't want to,

1713
01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:33.200
I don't want to just put on my rose colored glasses and believe that everything

1714
01:47:33.201 --> 01:47:37.790
is okay.
Everyone has everyone else's best interests in mind,
right?

1715
01:47:37.791 --> 01:47:42.020
Because I've had friends who had been kidnapped.
Um,

1716
01:47:42.021 --> 01:47:46.520
I've had,
uh,
nothing that compares to what you've experienced,

1717
01:47:46.521 --> 01:47:51.350
but I've seen enough glimpses of this like brutish,

1718
01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:55.780
um,
nastiness that on,
on one hand,
you know,

1719
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:59.020
I wonder as a civilian,
should I not look at that stuff?
Should I,

1720
01:47:59.210 --> 01:48:03.560
should I try to shield myself,
you know,
develop a basic level of protection and,

1721
01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:04.491
and skills,

1722
01:48:04.491 --> 01:48:08.750
but otherwise shield myself from it because it's not my job to have to look that

1723
01:48:08.751 --> 01:48:10.220
in the face.
And in fact,

1724
01:48:10.221 --> 01:48:15.221
it will darken my view of humanity or should I really like stare it directly in

1725
01:48:15.861 --> 01:48:20.600
the eyes and recognize it for what it is and become acquainted with it.

1726
01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:23.510
And I don't know why I think about this as much as I do.

1727
01:48:23.511 --> 01:48:26.570
Maybe it's because I have enough friends who've been in the military that it's,

1728
01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:30.770
it's sometimes a topic of conversation.
But what are your thoughts?

1729
01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:36.120
<v 3>I think that in order to truly experience the light and the bright,</v>

1730
01:48:36.210 --> 01:48:37.740
you have to see the darkness.

1731
01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:41.100
And I think if you shield yourself from the darkness,

1732
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:46.590
you'll not appreciate and fully understand the beauty,

1733
01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:51.570
the beauty of life.
And again,
you know,

1734
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:56.600
I go back to the sacrifices that I saw guys make on the battlefield and it's in

1735
01:48:56.851 --> 01:49:00.270
the complete darkness of the world of the human soul.

1736
01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:04.370
And you see that there's no,

1737
01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:09.640
there's no nothing brighter than somebody that lays down their life for their

1738
01:49:10.461 --> 01:49:11.294
friends.

1739
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:16.870
And so I think if you want to understand the beauty and the glory of the life

1740
01:49:19.701 --> 01:49:20.534
you have,

1741
01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:24.800
it is good to know and understand that darkness.

1742
01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:27.320
Now that makes sense.

1743
01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:30.220
<v 0>What are,
what are common myths?</v>

1744
01:49:30.250 --> 01:49:33.160
What are some of the most common misconceptions about,

1745
01:49:34.210 --> 01:49:36.850
<v 3>um,
navy seals</v>

1746
01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:43.010
<v 0>or you can pick whichever one you want to tackle.
Um,
what,</v>

1747
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:44.470
what,
um,

1748
01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:48.430
inaccuracy is bother you about seals

1749
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:50.980
<v 3>or the military for that matter that are common in movies?</v>

1750
01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:52.540
One of the things that I,

1751
01:49:52.810 --> 01:49:57.370
that I talk about when I talk to businesses because businesses think that,

1752
01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:02.200
um,
you know,
if you're a military guy,
if,

1753
01:50:02.290 --> 01:50:03.640
if you're,
if you're,

1754
01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:07.000
if Tim is military guy and I outrank you and I tell you to go do something,

1755
01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:09.730
you're going to go do it with a big smile on your face and you're going to make

1756
01:50:09.731 --> 01:50:13.450
it happen.
And so that's the,
that's the misconception.

1757
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:15.070
And if that was true,

1758
01:50:15.071 --> 01:50:18.130
then military leadership would be the easiest form of leadership in the world

1759
01:50:18.131 --> 01:50:20.140
because everyone would just obey your commands,
right?

1760
01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:22.900
And it couldn't be further from the truth.

1761
01:50:22.930 --> 01:50:27.310
Now it would work if I outrank you and I tell you to clean the toilet,
you go,

1762
01:50:27.311 --> 01:50:31.510
okay,
you outrank me and you go do it.
But then you multiply the intensity.

1763
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:35.070
There are times infinite to where I'm telling you you need to go charge your

1764
01:50:35.071 --> 01:50:37.030
machine gun nest and you're going to die if you do it.

1765
01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:41.240
Are you gonna listen to me?
I wouldn't want to you.

1766
01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:44.500
You wouldn't want to and you may or may not,
right?
You may or may not.

1767
01:50:45.010 --> 01:50:47.890
And I need to be a leader.

1768
01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:52.300
I need to actually be a leader too.
If I'm going to get you to do stuff,

1769
01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:56.500
I need to lead you.
I can't just order you to do it.

1770
01:50:56.501 --> 01:50:59.110
So that's the biggest misconception is that,
oh,

1771
01:50:59.111 --> 01:51:01.390
if we're in the military and our order you to do something,

1772
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:03.820
you're going to have to do it.
Now again,

1773
01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:06.550
you're not going to disobey the chain of command.

1774
01:51:07.090 --> 01:51:08.950
But you know there's stories of seals.

1775
01:51:08.951 --> 01:51:12.010
If you don't have so many stories from seals and Vietnam that have told me,
Oh,

1776
01:51:12.011 --> 01:51:14.800
they got tasked with a mission to go out and do x,

1777
01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:16.420
and they looked at the mission and said,
you know what,

1778
01:51:16.421 --> 01:51:18.730
that doesn't make any sense.
I'll tell you what,
we'll,
they'd go out,

1779
01:51:18.930 --> 01:51:23.260
they'd go out on patrol 100 yards out outside the wire,
sit down in a little,

1780
01:51:23.261 --> 01:51:27.340
a little rice patty somewhere,
wait two hours,
come back and say,
yeah,

1781
01:51:27.341 --> 01:51:29.950
the target wasn't there or the ambush didn't happen or whatever.

1782
01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:33.730
They would just blatantly disobey.
Those are not blatantly,

1783
01:51:33.790 --> 01:51:37.450
they would surreptitiously,
yes,
surreptitiously disobey orders.

1784
01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:41.000
So that's,
that's one of the,
one of the big challenges,
the,

1785
01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:45.700
another thing I'll get is,
you know,
I'll meet with a CEO and he'll say,
I,

1786
01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.940
you know,
I can't wait for you to get in here and whip my people into shape.

1787
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:50.381
So you know,

1788
01:51:50.381 --> 01:51:54.130
in their mind they're thinking that if I come in and yell and scream,

1789
01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:58.470
people do pushups,
like a drill instructor,
that that will somehow,
you know,

1790
01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:02.920
create a paradigm shift in the strategy and the culture of the company.

1791
01:52:03.490 --> 01:52:07.520
We both can laugh at that because it's completely false.
And you know,
I think it,

1792
01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:11.170
it comes very quickly as I start to talk to them about what's happening inside

1793
01:52:11.171 --> 01:52:13.840
their company.
They realize that,
you know,

1794
01:52:13.841 --> 01:52:18.841
what we do from a leadership perspective is infinitely more about brains than it

1795
01:52:19.001 --> 01:52:19.900
is about brawn.

1796
01:52:19.930 --> 01:52:24.100
And the Brown stuff is from the movies and it does not work in reality.

1797
01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:29.440
What,
uh,
when,
when you mentioned the,
the seals in Vietnam,
you know,

1798
01:52:29.441 --> 01:52:33.070
sitting right outside the trip wires or whatnot,
maybe think of band of brothers,

1799
01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:36.800
uh,
towards the end.
Um,
I don't know what your opinion is of that,
um,

1800
01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:41.560
that entire series,
but awesome.
I've,
I've watched it multiple times.
My mom,

1801
01:52:41.561 --> 01:52:46.220
I grew up,
my mom is very fascinated by World War II,
so

1802
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:47.910
<v 0>letters from you what Gima and so on to sh.</v>

1803
01:52:48.010 --> 01:52:50.210
So that fascination was passed onto me.

1804
01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:53.450
Hardcore history is an amazing podcast for listening to,

1805
01:52:53.451 --> 01:52:55.700
whether it's world war one or Gaviscon or otherwise,

1806
01:52:55.701 --> 01:52:58.340
but that's I completely second that.
Oh,
it's so good.

1807
01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:03.110
I tell people about it all the time.
Yeah.
Dan Carlin's amazing.
Uh,
but in,

1808
01:53:03.111 --> 01:53:04.910
in of brothers,
you know,
they,
they were tasked with,

1809
01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:09.290
I guess a raid towards the end.
It's like,
we've,

1810
01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:14.060
we've already won this and this is for some type of God.

1811
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:18.470
Is this for somebody who wants a promotion back thousands of miles away.

1812
01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:23.240
And so they made the decision,
you know,
to kind of sit it out.
Uh,

1813
01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:26.000
I dunno why I felt compelled to share that.
I just,
I think,

1814
01:53:26.050 --> 01:53:30.050
I think the band of brothers for me more than anything else that I've observed

1815
01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:32.570
gave me,

1816
01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:36.170
I felt like I had a window into sort of the pain and suffering and courage and

1817
01:53:36.171 --> 01:53:41.060
sacrifice that was involved,
uh,
in a battle that I,
that is,

1818
01:53:41.061 --> 01:53:44.570
I suppose in many ways,
very,
very different from the insurgent,
uh,

1819
01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:47.780
sort of counterinsurgency warfare in terms of terrain.
Right.
I mean,

1820
01:53:47.781 --> 01:53:49.490
when you have a bad guy late like Hitler,

1821
01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:53.690
it seems like in retrospect everyone's on your side,

1822
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:57.260
but,
um,
if somebody is a civilian,

1823
01:53:57.261 --> 01:54:01.580
wants to get a better understanding of the experiences that you've had,

1824
01:54:01.581 --> 01:54:05.990
aside from the books you recommended as the,
what,
what are other,

1825
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:09.770
are there movies or documentaries that that do it?
Justice?

1826
01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:13.250
Restrepo Restrepo,
which I'm sure you've seen.

1827
01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:15.500
I have seen that's a heart wrenching.

1828
01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:18.920
<v 3>It's unbelievable.
There's a,
there's an hour long,</v>

1829
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:22.940
I think it's history channel.
It's actually called a chance in hell.

1830
01:54:22.941 --> 01:54:25.320
The battle for Ramadi,
which is about [inaudible],

1831
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:27.050
which is about the battle for Ramadi.

1832
01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:33.260
I like band of brothers.
I love the Pacific.
Did you see the Pacific?

1833
01:54:33.261 --> 01:54:35.600
I've had it recommended to me multiple times.
I mean,
it's,

1834
01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:39.770
it's the band of brothers in the Pacific,
so it's absolutely phenomenal.

1835
01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:44.690
And I had read several of the books that,

1836
01:54:45.170 --> 01:54:49.280
uh,
the Pacific is based on Eugene Sledge,
just,
you know,
uh,

1837
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:54.290
I had read his book with the old breed.
Um,
I'd read a bunch of those books,

1838
01:54:54.291 --> 01:54:57.710
so I kind of knew and understood it.
And,
and that's just a phenomenal,

1839
01:54:58.160 --> 01:54:59.300
just a phenomenal

1840
01:55:01.250 --> 01:55:04.820
epic story and it,
and it does,
you know,
it,

1841
01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:11.150
it got to me like when I was watching it dies.
Got that feeling.

1842
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:16.070
You know,
that feeling.
I remember there's one scene where,
where they're walking,

1843
01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:20.210
they're walking through the jungle in some island in the Pacific and nothing has

1844
01:55:20.211 --> 01:55:21.044
happened yet.

1845
01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:24.380
And I had that feeling because it's just like the feeling you'd have in Ramadi

1846
01:55:24.381 --> 01:55:27.920
and you'd be walking down the street.
If not,
if no shots had been fired yet.

1847
01:55:28.490 --> 01:55:31.100
It's this,
it's this feeling of,

1848
01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:37.400
of anticipation,
but it's fear.

1849
01:55:37.401 --> 01:55:38.660
It's an anticipation.

1850
01:55:38.930 --> 01:55:42.830
It's the unknown and it's the weighting sounds Erie.

1851
01:55:42.831 --> 01:55:45.750
It's waiting for it to happen and you know,
it's coming.

1852
01:55:46.170 --> 01:55:47.910
And I got that feeling watching,
you know,

1853
01:55:47.911 --> 01:55:51.510
watching the Pacific and that was in one of the early,
early ones.
And I said,
wow,

1854
01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:55.920
this is nailing it.
Well done.
Yeah,
I have to watch that.
That's been,
this is,

1855
01:55:55.950 --> 01:56:00.690
this is sort of the,
uh,
it definitely the,
the final push.
I need to watch that.

1856
01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:03.480
Um,
what,
um,

1857
01:56:05.130 --> 01:56:06.810
what would you put on a billboard if you had a,

1858
01:56:06.811 --> 01:56:10.170
if you could have one billboard anywhere,
what would you put on it?

1859
01:56:14.490 --> 01:56:15.323
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1860
01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:18.310
<v 3>You know,
one on one of my,
one of my kind of,</v>

1861
01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:24.340
I guess my mantra is a very simple one.
And that's discipline equals freedom.

1862
01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:29.740
I've found that,
you know,
as a,
as an individual,

1863
01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.700
the more disciplined you are and it's counterintuitive,
right?

1864
01:56:33.701 --> 01:56:36.940
The more disciplined you are,
the more freedom you actually have.

1865
01:56:37.810 --> 01:56:41.740
And you know,
you and I both know if you wake up early,
you,

1866
01:56:42.670 --> 01:56:45.220
you get more done and you end up with more free time.

1867
01:56:45.250 --> 01:56:47.260
So the more you manage your time,

1868
01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.360
the more disciplined you are with your time management,

1869
01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:53.500
the more free time you ended up having,
the more disciplined you are.
You know,

1870
01:56:53.501 --> 01:56:57.100
physically with your diet,
with physically,

1871
01:56:57.370 --> 01:57:01.240
the more freedom you have because you can do more stuff,
you have more freedom.

1872
01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:03.490
So the more disciplined you are,
the more freedom you have.

1873
01:57:03.670 --> 01:57:08.670
And what's interesting is how that transfers over to both military units and the

1874
01:57:08.711 --> 01:57:12.400
civilian sector that you know,
imposing or,

1875
01:57:12.401 --> 01:57:16.660
or when when an element or a unit or when a company is a disciplined group,

1876
01:57:16.810 --> 01:57:21.090
they actually end up with more freedom.
So,
you know,
I had a seal troop,

1877
01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:23.620
we were highly disciplined.
You know,

1878
01:57:23.621 --> 01:57:27.040
we had standard operating procedures for just about everything that we did.

1879
01:57:27.730 --> 01:57:32.530
And you'd think that that would restrain your creativity,

1880
01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:36.850
but it actually doesn't.
The more disciplined you are,
the easier I could say,

1881
01:57:36.851 --> 01:57:38.740
hey you four go take down that building.

1882
01:57:38.741 --> 01:57:41.050
And they knew what to do cause they were highly disciplined.

1883
01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:43.900
I knew what they were going to do because they were highly disciplined.

1884
01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:47.950
We understood what parameters they were going to stay within because we had

1885
01:57:47.951 --> 01:57:51.850
standard operating procedures to follow.
So that discipline,

1886
01:57:52.150 --> 01:57:56.500
both on an individual level and as a group equals freedom.

1887
01:57:56.620 --> 01:58:00.940
And just like anything else with leadership,
you can take that too far.
You know,

1888
01:58:00.941 --> 01:58:03.490
you can do,
you can discipline a,

1889
01:58:03.491 --> 01:58:06.130
an element or a person so much that they,

1890
01:58:06.430 --> 01:58:08.590
they break down and they no longer have creativity.

1891
01:58:08.650 --> 01:58:10.570
So just like the dichotomy of leadership,

1892
01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:14.950
you can go too strong with discipline and they end up breaking down or you can

1893
01:58:14.951 --> 01:58:18.460
give them too much freedom and they break down in the other direction.
Yeah.

1894
01:58:18.461 --> 01:58:21.760
This is this,
I'm really glad that you,
you mentioned that because I,
um,

1895
01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:26.170
I've realized in a way that my,

1896
01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:31.030
when I struggled the most kind of existentially or we're really just creatively,

1897
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:35.320
it's one,
I have the fewest constraints.
I want positive constraints.

1898
01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:38.940
I need,
uh,
I need,
uh,

1899
01:58:39.730 --> 01:58:42.160
I need boxes.
Not that I could have to stay

1900
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:47.130
<v 0>within the box,
but that I can start at least coloring inside the box.
And,
uh,</v>

1901
01:58:47.170 --> 01:58:51.820
that's part of the reason I've been so excited to adopt this rescue puppy,
Molly,

1902
01:58:51.821 --> 01:58:56.821
because it forces me to regiment and structure my day in such a way that I can

1903
01:58:57.281 --> 01:59:00.340
then plan around fixed objects.

1904
01:59:00.730 --> 01:59:02.950
And I think that whether it's in the military,

1905
01:59:02.951 --> 01:59:04.390
at least in my experience in business,

1906
01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:08.530
you want to reserve your creativity for the things that require creativity,

1907
01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:13.330
not for what should I,
what should the steps be when I'm doing a room clearance?

1908
01:59:13.331 --> 01:59:13.901
It's like,
no,
no,
no.

1909
01:59:13.901 --> 01:59:18.901
You want a standard operating procedure so that your brain cycles are allocated

1910
01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:24.550
to the places where you need those brain cycles.
Right?
That's 100% right.
And,
uh,

1911
01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:29.200
so I've realized in the last few months for myself that what I thought I wanted,

1912
01:59:29.201 --> 01:59:29.411
right?

1913
01:59:29.411 --> 01:59:33.280
Which is freedom in the form of infinite options is not actually what I want at

1914
01:59:33.281 --> 01:59:37.570
all.
It's very stressful and you end up burning calories.

1915
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:40.060
You burned 10 calories in a million directions,

1916
01:59:40.090 --> 01:59:44.320
you're fatigued and you didn't get shit done.
And,
uh,

1917
01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:49.410
so I'm actually in a way trying to figure out how I can say no to a thousand

1918
01:59:49.451 --> 01:59:53.380
things so that I can be fully creative on one or two things.
And,
um,

1919
01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:57.410
it's just,
it's,
it's one of the reasons I enjoy doing this podcast so much is,

1920
01:59:57.411 --> 02:00:00.550
and when you talk to people who have operated at the highest levels in any
field,

1921
02:00:00.970 --> 02:00:04.540
this kind of stuff comes up.
And after a while it's like,
Ferris idiot.

1922
02:00:05.590 --> 02:00:06.730
Do you get the message yet?

1923
02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:10.510
You've heard meditation from 80% of the people who've been on your podcast.

1924
02:00:10.810 --> 02:00:13.510
Maybe you should chill the fuck out and like sit down for 20 minutes every

1925
02:00:13.511 --> 02:00:16.570
morning.
Uh,
but the,

1926
02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:20.060
the one I'm talking about ownership and,
uh,

1927
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:25.170
could you explain your book and why you decided to write it?

1928
02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:32.690
<v 3>So,
first of all,
while I was still in the seal teams,
you know,
I had guys,</v>

1929
02:00:32.691 --> 02:00:35.920
cause they,
once everyone knew I was getting out,
that guy said,
hey,
you know,

1930
02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:39.890
you need to write this stuff down.
You need to pass on these lessons learned.
And,

1931
02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:42.250
you know,
I did that in a,
uh,

1932
02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:46.490
in almost a doctrinal way and I captured those lessons learned and pass those
on.

1933
02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:51.350
And then when I started working with civilian companies,

1934
02:00:51.970 --> 02:00:55.100
you know,
Lafe and I,
my,
my business partner,
we'd started hearing the same thing,

1935
02:00:55.101 --> 02:00:58.430
which is,
hey,
do you guys have a reference?
Can we,
you know what,

1936
02:00:58.670 --> 02:01:02.120
we want to hand out some stuff to the rest of our people that couldn't make
this.

1937
02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:06.890
And Hey,
you guys really changed the way this group is operating.

1938
02:01:07.010 --> 02:01:09.350
We want to spread that to the rest of our groups.

1939
02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:13.310
Do you have a book we can give them?
Do you have reference material?
And you know,

1940
02:01:13.311 --> 02:01:18.200
eventually we said,
okay,
we,
we need to write something.
And so,
you know,

1941
02:01:18.201 --> 02:01:21.100
from,
from my perspective,
this is uh,

1942
02:01:21.710 --> 02:01:26.710
an opportunity for us to pass on the lessons that we learned and relearned that

1943
02:01:27.321 --> 02:01:29.270
had been,
you know,
some of them,
some of the,

1944
02:01:29.570 --> 02:01:33.950
some of the lessons we learned and talk about had been around for thousands of

1945
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:36.020
years and some of them were,

1946
02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:39.140
were discovered a little bit more recently,

1947
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:43.430
but they are definitely solid.

1948
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:48.020
And they've been very well tested in a variety of environments,

1949
02:01:48.021 --> 02:01:51.560
starting with the harshest environment of the mall,
which is sustained,

1950
02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:55.250
violent urban combat.
And then they've,

1951
02:01:55.340 --> 02:02:00.340
we've brought them to dozens and dozens of companies and we keep hearing the

1952
02:02:00.351 --> 02:02:04.340
same thing.
Which is these work,
what,

1953
02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:07.040
what's the explanation behind the title?

1954
02:02:09.650 --> 02:02:14.330
Actually came from an email that I sent to a,

1955
02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:18.350
uh,
you know,
grew up a manager in a company and,

1956
02:02:18.530 --> 02:02:21.570
and the email basically said we,

1957
02:02:21.710 --> 02:02:24.050
when I was in the seal teams and I was a troop commander,

1958
02:02:24.051 --> 02:02:27.080
so I was in charge of task unit bruiser and we were getting ready to go on

1959
02:02:27.081 --> 02:02:31.910
deployment.
And occasionally the commodore,
which is a couple ranks above my boss,

1960
02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:36.140
actually one rank above my boss is a guy named the commodore,
which is,
you know,

1961
02:02:36.180 --> 02:02:39.860
a full bird colonel if you're in the Marine Corp,
the army.

1962
02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:43.790
And he's kind of in charge of all the seal teams on the west coast.

1963
02:02:43.791 --> 02:02:47.390
And so he would have occasional meetings where he'd bring in us the troop

1964
02:02:47.391 --> 02:02:49.490
commanders,
and we're like the front line guys.

1965
02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:54.940
And this is west coast of the u s west coast of the u s and the story that I

1966
02:02:55.371 --> 02:02:57.590
told him this email,
what was that?

1967
02:02:58.010 --> 02:03:00.920
He would go around the room because he wants to get some direct feedback from

1968
02:03:00.921 --> 02:03:04.340
the troops and he'd ask somebody,
you know,
okay,
well what do you need?

1969
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:09.140
And these guys are my peers.
And you know,
someone would say,
well,
you know,

1970
02:03:09.141 --> 02:03:11.750
the boots that we have are okay in the hot weather,

1971
02:03:11.751 --> 02:03:15.120
but we're getting ready to be in a cooler environment.
We need new boots.
Uh,

1972
02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:19.340
and we need them by this date because that's our next training block.
Okay.

1973
02:03:19.341 --> 02:03:21.440
Got It.
And he gets the next person.
So you know,

1974
02:03:21.441 --> 02:03:25.550
when we're out at the desert training facility,
there's no Wifi Internet.

1975
02:03:25.551 --> 02:03:29.300
So our guys are disconnected and you know,
we really need to get wifi out there.

1976
02:03:29.330 --> 02:03:31.010
Okay.
Got It.
And the next guy would say,

1977
02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:34.760
we need more helicopter training support because we don't feel like we're

1978
02:03:34.761 --> 02:03:37.370
working around helicopters and off.
We really need that.

1979
02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:41.510
And eventually it'll get to me,
I need,
you know,
common would say,
Jocko,

1980
02:03:41.511 --> 02:03:44.090
what do you need?
And I would say we're going to start,

1981
02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:50.600
and I was stating the obvious,

1982
02:03:50.601 --> 02:03:52.160
which is if I have problems,

1983
02:03:52.161 --> 02:03:54.110
I'm going to handle them and I'm going to take care of them.

1984
02:03:54.111 --> 02:03:55.160
I'm not going to complain.

1985
02:03:55.770 --> 02:04:00.770
I took extreme ownership of my world and the way that work two fold was when I

1986
02:04:02.001 --> 02:04:05.930
did need something,
it number one,
it was something significant.

1987
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:09.710
It was something real.
And when I told the commodore,
Hey boss,

1988
02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:11.870
we need this right here.

1989
02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:17.140
I would almost get it instantaneously because he knew that I really truly needed

1990
02:04:17.451 --> 02:04:20.430
it.
And so I'd written this,
kind of told that story and,

1991
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:23.930
and talked about extreme ownership and to and owning everything in your world.

1992
02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:27.590
Because the other piece of that is you,
you complain,
you know,
people complain,

1993
02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:31.130
they place blame on other people.
And finally,

1994
02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:36.380
you know,
if your boss,
if Tim's boss isn't giving you the support you need,

1995
02:04:36.381 --> 02:04:41.160
who's fault is,
whose fault is it?
If your boss is not giving you what you need,

1996
02:04:41.161 --> 02:04:44.430
who's fault is that?
I suppose is my fault.
Plenty people,

1997
02:04:44.431 --> 02:04:46.950
plenty of people will say,
well,
it's my boss's fault.
No,

1998
02:04:47.010 --> 02:04:49.170
it's actually your fault because you haven't educated them.

1999
02:04:49.290 --> 02:04:51.090
You have an influence them,
you haven't,

2000
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:54.540
you haven't explained to them in a manner that they understand why you need this

2001
02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:57.360
support that you need.
And so that's extreme ownership.

2002
02:04:57.361 --> 02:05:01.920
That's where the title came from.
Or you've made them like,
like you,
uh,

2003
02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:04.900
I suppose alluded to,
um,

2004
02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:10.160
you've made them immune to your requests because you're the boy who cries wolf.

2005
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:12.900
Exactly.
And if you're constantly needy,

2006
02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:16.650
they will determine that nothing is important or,

2007
02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:21.600
or it's not a real urgent important request.
Yep.
Uh,
and that,

2008
02:05:21.630 --> 02:05:22.410
that really,
I mean,

2009
02:05:22.410 --> 02:05:25.830
that's extreme ownership in a nutshell is you're taking responsibility for

2010
02:05:25.831 --> 02:05:27.840
everything in your world.
And there's no one else to blame.

2011
02:05:28.410 --> 02:05:32.370
And when we do talk about bosses,
you know,
I,
I tell this to people all the time,

2012
02:05:32.371 --> 02:05:32.940
cause you know,

2013
02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:36.960
I always hear complaining about people's bosses and I tell people that

2014
02:05:38.970 --> 02:05:42.120
I worked for every different type of boss you could imagine,
you know,

2015
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:47.390
superb tactical geniuses that were incredible leaders of men.

2016
02:05:47.670 --> 02:05:51.510
And I've worked for people that didn't know anything and were horrible.

2017
02:05:52.410 --> 02:05:55.590
And I had the same relationship with all of them,

2018
02:05:55.920 --> 02:06:00.920
which is I built up trust with them so that they trusted that I was going to do

2019
02:06:01.141 --> 02:06:05.400
the right thing and they gave me the support I needed.
And Th that's a,

2020
02:06:05.450 --> 02:06:05.880
that's a real,

2021
02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:09.150
I took ownership of those relationships to make sure that that was always the

2022
02:06:09.151 --> 02:06:11.490
case.
And that's another piece that I,
you know,

2023
02:06:11.550 --> 02:06:14.850
if you have a problem with your boss,
it's not your boss's fault,
it's your fault.

2024
02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:18.600
And obviously it's the same thing down the chain of command as well.
What,

2025
02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:24.060
what are some of the principles or lessons that the companies you've worked with

2026
02:06:27.541 --> 02:06:29.370
have found most valuable?

2027
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:34.500
We'll cover and move is a big one covering the cover and move.

2028
02:06:34.530 --> 02:06:39.530
So if you and I were going to attack a building across the street where there

2029
02:06:40.021 --> 02:06:42.000
was enemy,
uh,

2030
02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:46.260
I would get in a window here and I would start shooting at them covering fire,

2031
02:06:46.290 --> 02:06:49.080
covering fire,
and you would move,
when you heard me shooting,

2032
02:06:49.081 --> 02:06:51.120
you would start to move and you'd find a better tactical position.

2033
02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:54.930
And then once you've gotten a better tackle position,
you would start shooting.

2034
02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:58.500
And I would move and eventually we would get to a position where we could kill

2035
02:06:58.501 --> 02:07:00.870
the enemy and take down the building.
So that's called cover and move.

2036
02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:04.710
And honestly,
when I started talking to companies,
I said to myself,
well,

2037
02:07:04.711 --> 02:07:09.340
how do I translate an actual gun fighting tactic?
I that's,

2038
02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:13.020
that's all it is.
A gun fighting tech.
How do you translate that to,

2039
02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:17.340
to accompany to a business?
And as soon as I started talking to,
you know,

2040
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:22.320
businesses,
uh,
I mean the first business I talked to,
I realized that guess what,

2041
02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:27.540
every single business has multiple different elements within it.
Whether it's,

2042
02:07:27.541 --> 02:07:30.750
you know,
you've got an operational group,
you've got a manufacturing group,

2043
02:07:30.751 --> 02:07:32.700
you've got a sales group,
and guess what?

2044
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.100
All of those elements have absolutely to work

2045
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:37.870
<v 5>together,
cover and move for each other.</v>

2046
02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:41.740
Because if I'm the sales guy and I sell something and you're the manufacturer

2047
02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:46.780
and you don't manufacture it in time,
or it's faulty or whatever,
that we fail,

2048
02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:47.890
we fail.
Right?

2049
02:07:47.890 --> 02:07:51.280
And if you manufacture a bunch of perfect units and I can't sell any of them,

2050
02:07:51.310 --> 02:07:53.940
guess what we fail.
Right?
So that,

2051
02:07:53.960 --> 02:07:58.960
that's a huge one that people really grab onto because just about every company

2052
02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:03.760
experiences,
some need to cover and move.

2053
02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:05.253
And uh,

2054
02:08:06.070 --> 02:08:10.060
there there's so many maxims that are memorable from the military.
I mean,

2055
02:08:10.061 --> 02:08:11.980
one that I only got exposed to a few days ago.

2056
02:08:11.981 --> 02:08:15.800
And you mentioned it when we got started right here.
Um,
was,
you know,

2057
02:08:15.850 --> 02:08:19.780
the fact that I have,
I have two recorders.
And uh,
so what is,

2058
02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:21.670
what does the expression,
cause I,
I,
I,

2059
02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:25.960
I was trained very early on to think about single points of failure actually.

2060
02:08:25.961 --> 02:08:29.680
My first job,
which was mass data storage.
So you always want redundancy.

2061
02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:33.820
They're all about redundancy,
whether that's,
you know,
a raid array,
uh,
or,

2062
02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:36.760
or anything else,
you don't want a single point of failure.
So what,

2063
02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:40.300
what was the expression that you used in two is one and one is non.

2064
02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:42.740
So it just means have a backup means how backup,

2065
02:08:42.750 --> 02:08:44.740
if you only have one of something,
it's going to disappear.

2066
02:08:47.230 --> 02:08:51.730
And the,
the structure of the book,
uh,
I really like,
and um,
you know,

2067
02:08:51.731 --> 02:08:52.281
I spoke with,

2068
02:08:52.281 --> 02:08:57.190
with Pete about this is could you describe it because seems like every chapter

2069
02:08:57.191 --> 02:08:59.800
has a story from combat,
the reflects a principal,

2070
02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:02.710
then you explain the principle and then you use a business story to show how

2071
02:09:02.711 --> 02:09:06.340
that translates exactly.
Right.
And uh,

2072
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:08.590
what is your,

2073
02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:13.660
what do you think is a part of the book that people might not pay enough

2074
02:09:13.661 --> 02:09:15.690
attention to that they should pay more attention to?

2075
02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:21.970
Because I know there are aspects,
I'll just for instance,
like in the,
in the,
uh,

2076
02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:24.760
four hour chef,
I'll give an example.
People Focus,

2077
02:09:24.761 --> 02:09:27.010
when I'm talking about an accelerated learning framework,
they're like,
okay,

2078
02:09:27.011 --> 02:09:31.000
deconstruction,
got it.
Selection,
you know,
doing the 80,
20 analysis.
Got It.

2079
02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:34.270
Uh,
and then eat a sequence in.
Cool.
Got It.

2080
02:09:34.271 --> 02:09:37.600
And then stakes sending up consequences,
they kind of gloss over it.
And I'm like,

2081
02:09:37.601 --> 02:09:41.740
no,
no,
no.
If you don't have sufficient incentive,
like a punishment or reward,

2082
02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:44.740
all that other stuff,
the how to stuff,
it doesn't matter.
Right.
But,

2083
02:09:44.741 --> 02:09:47.290
but they gloss over it.
And I think I take responsibility for that.

2084
02:09:47.291 --> 02:09:50.080
Like maybe I didn't highlight the importance enough,
but what are,

2085
02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:52.990
what are areas of the book or chapters that,

2086
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:54.550
anything that comes to mind where you're like,
you know what,

2087
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:58.240
people might gloss over this or pay less attention to it then they should.

2088
02:09:58.270 --> 02:10:00.910
Well I think,
I don't know if this will answer your question,

2089
02:10:00.911 --> 02:10:05.500
but what's been interesting on the feedback we've gotten is we,

2090
02:10:05.610 --> 02:10:09.700
we have different people find different chapters,

2091
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:13.970
they latch onto different chapters.
And so there's even chapters where we were,

2092
02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:16.360
we,
you know,
we said,
hey,
you know,
maybe we should take the chapter out,

2093
02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:18.490
I don't know about this chapter or that chapter.

2094
02:10:18.940 --> 02:10:21.940
And we even got some feedback so that I would take the chaparral and literally

2095
02:10:21.941 --> 02:10:23.650
would get someone saying,
Hey,

2096
02:10:23.651 --> 02:10:26.440
the best chapter is the chapter that someone else told us to take out.

2097
02:10:26.890 --> 02:10:31.890
So I think that people are going to identify very easily what relates to them.

2098
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:35.750
And you know,

2099
02:10:35.751 --> 02:10:38.300
there'll be a high point of this completely relates to me and there'll be some

2100
02:10:38.301 --> 02:10:41.270
other ones.
Oh yeah,
I've seen that before.
Not as much because of,
you know,

2101
02:10:41.271 --> 02:10:45.170
maybe that's a skill area that they have.
So they don't,

2102
02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:48.050
they don't really need to work on that.
But that's what I've,

2103
02:10:48.051 --> 02:10:52.730
I've found most interesting is that the variety of answers when people,

2104
02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:55.850
people like the different sections and they get something out of the,

2105
02:10:55.851 --> 02:10:58.280
out of the various chapters.
That's a,
that's a really,

2106
02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:02.300
that's a really good sign by the way.
And I know we were chatting,
um,

2107
02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:08.030
about this book and I'm excited to see what it does in the wild.
The,
uh,

2108
02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:11.480
what I've noticed for the books that I've written,
which are way,

2109
02:11:11.481 --> 02:11:16.010
way too long for any sane person to write them reading is a different story

2110
02:11:16.011 --> 02:11:17.630
because going to be like a choose your own adventure book.

2111
02:11:17.631 --> 02:11:21.260
But what I've done proofreading,
and I've had friends read,

2112
02:11:21.290 --> 02:11:24.620
the rule that I've decided on is to remove something.

2113
02:11:24.621 --> 02:11:28.910
You need a consensus to keep something.
You only need one person to love it.

2114
02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:32.240
So if I have one person who says,
I love this part,

2115
02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:36.170
it doesn't matter if nine out of 10 people say,
I hate it,
it stays in,

2116
02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:41.870
that's a good rule.
And,
uh,
because you don't need a book,

2117
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:43.910
everything in a book to apply to every person.

2118
02:11:43.911 --> 02:11:46.790
It's just like if you had a commanding officer,

2119
02:11:47.450 --> 02:11:50.780
not everything that person would say we equally apply to you if there's,

2120
02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:54.630
if they're dealing with groups as you have dealt with groups and teams.
Uh,

2121
02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:58.120
so that's very promising sign.
Um,

2122
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:05.000
there's so many questions I could ask you.
I don't even know where to start.

2123
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:09.300
Let me,
uh,
let me take a quick glance at a few things here.
Um,

2124
02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:14.360
because I know we want to grab some food in not too,

2125
02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:19.010
not too short order.
Uh,
Jocko hungry.

2126
02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:21.260
Jack Andre,
Jocko smash.

2127
02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:25.910
I don't want Jagoda to smash me because I would be helpless.
Uh,

2128
02:12:26.540 --> 02:12:29.990
what do you talk to about seals

2129
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.950
more versus civilians
as opposed to,

2130
02:12:36.951 --> 02:12:38.570
I mean,
obviously you have the,
the,

2131
02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:43.070
the comradery and common background of,
uh,
the,

2132
02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:48.050
the warfare experience,
right?
But aside from trading those stories,
uh,

2133
02:12:48.110 --> 02:12:51.680
what do you tend to talk to seals about more versus civilians?

2134
02:12:56.330 --> 02:13:00.490
Straight to the point when you're torn up?

2135
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:01.910
When I go and talk to seals,

2136
02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:05.870
I spend time a little more time talking about,

2137
02:13:05.871 --> 02:13:07.690
well number one I talk about the tactics,
like the,

2138
02:13:07.691 --> 02:13:10.460
the actual on the ground tactics of what was happening and that's,

2139
02:13:11.090 --> 02:13:12.770
that's valuable lessons learned.

2140
02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:18.920
Another thing that I talk about in depth is around

2141
02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:25.460
the piece of risk mitigation.
Now as you know,
in the business world,

2142
02:13:25.461 --> 02:13:27.890
risk mitigation is huge and it's a matter of fact,

2143
02:13:27.891 --> 02:13:30.110
the first time I ever spent the day with a CEO and he said,

2144
02:13:30.111 --> 02:13:31.980
well what do you think of this stuff?
And I said,
well,
it's kind of like what I

2145
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:33.120
<v 3>used to do risk mitigation.</v>

2146
02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:38.580
But when you're talking about your guys getting killed,

2147
02:13:39.150 --> 02:13:40.800
it's a whole nother ballgame.

2148
02:13:40.890 --> 02:13:44.190
And I remember a conversation I had with my commanding officer.

2149
02:13:44.191 --> 02:13:48.360
And so this is the type of thing that I would tell seals.

2150
02:13:50.070 --> 02:13:52.680
We're not on deployment yet.
So we're still back in America.

2151
02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:57.740
And my commanding officer brings me in and he says,

2152
02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:01.700
Hey Jocko,
you know,
he knew we were going to Ramadi.

2153
02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:06.650
He knew Ramadi was really bad.
And he said,
before you go on any operation,

2154
02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:11.060
I want you to think about if it is a worth,

2155
02:14:11.670 --> 02:14:14.900
if it is worth the risk of losing one of your guys.

2156
02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:22.070
And I said to him,
sir,
I,
I don't need to think about that.

2157
02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:28.160
I can tell you right now,
there's no operation you can give me.

2158
02:14:28.190 --> 02:14:32.600
You can task me with that is I would trade one of my guys for not going to

2159
02:14:32.601 --> 02:14:35.810
happen.
That being said,

2160
02:14:36.710 --> 02:14:39.380
we are going to on deployment to Iraq,

2161
02:14:39.710 --> 02:14:44.710
we have a mission and we have a job and we have a duty to execute that mission

2162
02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:52.420
and we will take risks and we'll do everything we can to mitigate those risks.

2163
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:58.160
But if we're going to take zero risks than we might as well just stay here in

2164
02:14:58.161 --> 02:14:59.300
San Diego,
California.

2165
02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:04.360
So that's the kind of thing I think that,
you know,

2166
02:15:04.370 --> 02:15:07.850
cause people can be very risk averse,
even in the military solitary,

2167
02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:12.700
<v 5>uh,
it can get very,
very risk averse and it's,
and it's understandable,</v>

2168
02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:16.720
you know,
it's understandable that you say,
look,
what is,
what's,

2169
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:19.840
is this worth the risk or not?
And my point always was,

2170
02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:23.020
you have to just mitigate the risks as much as you can,

2171
02:15:23.021 --> 02:15:26.530
but there are going to be risks you you're going to have to deal with.

2172
02:15:26.770 --> 02:15:29.350
Absolutely.
Well,
it end in military context.
I mean,

2173
02:15:29.351 --> 02:15:32.050
it seems like a huge risk is not making a decision,

2174
02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:36.370
which is a decision in and of itself.
Uh,
and when I look at,
say,
you know,

2175
02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:41.080
the Laird Hamilton's the world is an incredible big wave surfer or some of
these,

2176
02:15:41.081 --> 02:15:45.850
uh,
just interviewed Jimmy Chin Who's one of the key climbers.
I mean,

2177
02:15:45.851 --> 02:15:49.150
he's effectively a professional athlete in this documentary called Meru,

2178
02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:52.450
which is about this,
uh,
the shark's Fin,

2179
02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:55.960
and I want to say it's India,
but it might be Pakistan.
This,

2180
02:15:55.990 --> 02:16:00.160
this rock face that has defeated the world's best climbers for 30 years.

2181
02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:01.663
Um,

2182
02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:07.600
they are all people view all of these people is massive risk takers.

2183
02:16:07.630 --> 02:16:09.760
And when you actually sit down and talk to these guys,

2184
02:16:09.761 --> 02:16:14.440
you realize they are expert risk mitigators and uh,

2185
02:16:14.670 --> 02:16:19.670
and I think it's very easy to miss come to the mistaken conclusion and business

2186
02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:23.440
for example,
that you only win big if you bet the farm.

2187
02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:27.010
And in fact when I talked to some of these companies here in Silicon Valley for

2188
02:16:27.011 --> 02:16:29.630
instance,
that have uh,

2189
02:16:30.970 --> 02:16:33.970
become worth billions and billions of dollars,
uh,

2190
02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:38.950
some rightly some maybe in the irrational exuberance of our current day,

2191
02:16:38.951 --> 02:16:41.350
but many I think rightly so.
Uh,

2192
02:16:41.770 --> 02:16:44.590
you see that in my experience,

2193
02:16:45.250 --> 02:16:48.760
in no cases have,
they bet the farm,

2194
02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:51.560
they have evaluated the downside.
They've,

2195
02:16:51.850 --> 02:16:55.120
they've tried to measure the maximum allowable downside.

2196
02:16:55.510 --> 02:16:58.750
They know not only kind of their bet and their bet size,

2197
02:16:58.751 --> 02:17:03.130
but when they're going to fold a,
they have an exit strategy for,

2198
02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:05.650
for minimizing or capping losses.

2199
02:17:06.550 --> 02:17:09.070
And unfortunately,
I think that the,

2200
02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:13.810
the kind of renegade risk taker gets romanticized in a lot of different spheres,

2201
02:17:13.811 --> 02:17:14.740
including business.

2202
02:17:14.741 --> 02:17:18.070
And they get the magazine covers in some cases because it makes for a good
story,

2203
02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:22.150
but there's a huge survivorship bias,
right?
Because you don't get to see,

2204
02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:23.110
you know,
the,

2205
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:28.000
the nine out of 10 who tried the same excessively ballsy move and got their

2206
02:17:28.001 --> 02:17:31.360
balls chopped off.
You don't,
they don't make it to the magazine cover.

2207
02:17:31.450 --> 02:17:35.020
I often talk about the fact I'll get up and brief a bunch of missions that we

2208
02:17:35.021 --> 02:17:38.680
did,
you know,
and,
and when,
when I get done,
I'll be saying,
you know,

2209
02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:43.090
I didn't brief you guys on any missions that we didn't do.
You know,

2210
02:17:43.220 --> 02:17:45.640
there was missions,
plenty missions that we looked at.

2211
02:17:45.670 --> 02:17:48.310
We weighed the risk versus the reward.
And we said,
you know what,

2212
02:17:48.370 --> 02:17:52.370
not worth the risk.
And so we did the exact same thing.
I think you're 100% right.

2213
02:17:52.450 --> 02:17:56.560
So it's a very high level.
Risk mitigation is,

2214
02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:00.970
is the same in business and in combat.
Yeah.
And it's,
um,
you know,

2215
02:18:00.971 --> 02:18:03.430
I remember hearing an expression,
I don't know who to attribute this to,

2216
02:18:03.431 --> 02:18:06.490
but it's like if you cap your downside,
the upside takes care of itself.
Um,

2217
02:18:06.550 --> 02:18:09.130
and I'm not sure if that applies in every circumstance,
but it's a,

2218
02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:13.150
might not be a perfect guideline,
but it's a helpful guideline where it's like,

2219
02:18:13.151 --> 02:18:16.180
if you take enough shots and you've constantly kept your downside,

2220
02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:18.460
if you have a couple of outliers,

2221
02:18:18.461 --> 02:18:22.690
they give you disproportionate upside in the long run.
I mean,

2222
02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:25.360
you're going to average out ahead and beat most people,

2223
02:18:25.361 --> 02:18:29.940
especially the people who were cavalier.
Um,
who's the,

2224
02:18:30.130 --> 02:18:33.460
who's a historical figure that you identify with,

2225
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:37.663
<v 4>if any.</v>

2226
02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:45.050
<v 5>You know,
I talked about David Hackworth,
then I definitely,
uh,</v>

2227
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:50.280
definitely identify or I,
I would,
you know,
I look up to him,
um,

2228
02:18:50.690 --> 02:18:55.010
it in,
by the way,
I didn't,
you know,
he became,
you know,
uh,
uh,
piece guy.
I mean,

2229
02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:58.760
that's,
that's where he ended up was living on Australia as a,
you know,

2230
02:18:58.761 --> 02:19:03.200
premier leading the pack on,
you know,
anti nuclear weapons.

2231
02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:08.060
So it's,
it's,
you know,
it's not,
not your average guy.
A historical figure.

2232
02:19:12.550 --> 02:19:14.350
It's a tough question.
I'm not sure what my answer would be.

2233
02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:21.640
Yeah.
I'll stick with Hackworth.
Alright.
Hackworth.
It is,

2234
02:19:22.570 --> 02:19:25.360
what is something most people would be surprised to know about you?

2235
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:30.703
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2236
02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:33.470
<v 5>Again,
I think it's the,
uh,</v>

2237
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:37.410
the same thing I talked about earlier with the fact that

2238
02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:43.080
they expect,
you know,
I have a certain look to me you might say,

2239
02:19:43.570 --> 02:19:48.360
then I look like,
you know,
kind of a serial killer bind with,
you know,

2240
02:19:48.361 --> 02:19:53.350
some kind of Psychopathic,
uh,
steroid mutant and,
and,

2241
02:19:54.250 --> 02:19:57.060
you know,
so people I think have a loose on my texting,
my girlfriend.

2242
02:19:57.230 --> 02:20:00.000
I was just trying to prepare.
I think,
uh,

2243
02:20:00.390 --> 02:20:02.850
there's some kind of surprise,

2244
02:20:03.310 --> 02:20:06.720
I think when people hear me string a sentence together and say,
oh,
okay,

2245
02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:09.780
that's what I think that's surprising to a lot of people.

2246
02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:15.050
It makes me think of this comedian Jim Gaffigan,
really funny guy who's like,
ah,

2247
02:20:15.410 --> 02:20:18.180
these talking about how attractive people have it.
Really easy because he's like,

2248
02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:21.690
and then there's a beautiful woman and she has a book and people are like,
Ooh,

2249
02:20:21.691 --> 02:20:26.220
she's beautiful.
And she can read double threat.
But uh,

2250
02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:29.580
no.
You're very good at string sentences together.
Uh,

2251
02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:35.220
do you have any bad habits or bad habits that you're working to overcome?

2252
02:20:39.540 --> 02:20:43.710
Bad Habits?
I can rephrase.

2253
02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:46.850
Non Ideal habits or what are you trying to improve about your song?

2254
02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:48.780
I'm trying to improve everything all the time.
I mean,

2255
02:20:48.781 --> 02:20:53.250
that's a much easier question cause because I want to be faster,
stronger,

2256
02:20:53.340 --> 02:20:57.150
more limber,
uh,
smarter,
quicker.

2257
02:20:57.210 --> 02:21:01.620
Whittier always everything,
always trying to improve.
So if the,

2258
02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:03.980
if you were to prioritize those currently,

2259
02:21:04.010 --> 02:21:05.520
let's just say over the next 12 months,

2260
02:21:05.550 --> 02:21:09.300
which are the areas that you're hoping to most,
uh,

2261
02:21:10.530 --> 02:21:15.120
push into overdrive for improve upon?
You know,
I think

2262
02:21:18.470 --> 02:21:21.020
I literally wake up every day and I'm trying to do all those things.

2263
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:23.630
I don't know how I prioritize them,
which w and,

2264
02:21:23.770 --> 02:21:27.880
and the reason I think is because they're not mutually exclusive.
Right?
You know,

2265
02:21:27.890 --> 02:21:32.720
one of my,
one of my,
one of my law is a combat is prioritize and execute,

2266
02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:34.670
which means if you've got multiple problems going on,

2267
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:38.150
if you try and handle them all at once,
you will absolutely fail.

2268
02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:41.420
So prioritize and execute.
You look at what problems you have,

2269
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:46.070
you pick the most impactful one or the biggest threat and you solve that one and

2270
02:21:46.071 --> 02:21:49.010
then you move onto the next one,
the next one,
so forth.
But you know,

2271
02:21:49.700 --> 02:21:54.700
I can definitely read and work out and stretch all in the same day.

2272
02:21:56.180 --> 02:22:00.820
These are not mutually exclusive things.
And,
and I'll,
I'll do them all.
You will.

2273
02:22:00.890 --> 02:22:04.490
You were right.
And I guess it is in a way kind of,

2274
02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:07.540
it could be viewed as a trick question.
I was reading,
um,

2275
02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:13.640
a number of transcribed lectures by Krishna Murti.
And he talked about,

2276
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:16.280
and I'm probably butchering this by paraphrasing it,

2277
02:22:16.281 --> 02:22:19.400
but the fact that people talking about stuff,
you know,

2278
02:22:19.401 --> 02:22:21.170
changing one small thing at a time.

2279
02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:24.880
And I do think there's a place for that and behavioral change and certainly a

2280
02:22:24.881 --> 02:22:26.040
plus.
Things like dog training

2281
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:29.820
<v 0>or human training.
Uh,
you know,
operant conditioning,</v>

2282
02:22:29.850 --> 02:22:32.100
classical conditioning and blah,
blah,
blah,
shaping and all that.

2283
02:22:32.101 --> 02:22:36.300
But there are cases where the every,
the elements are so intertwined.

2284
02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:40.620
You can't change one without changing all the others.
Uh,
and uh,

2285
02:22:40.660 --> 02:22:43.920
so you do have to kind of try to,

2286
02:22:44.850 --> 02:22:47.520
if he can't eat the elephant in one small bite at a time,

2287
02:22:47.521 --> 02:22:51.160
you have to try to eat the whole fucking elephant.
Uh,
all right.

2288
02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:53.550
Let me ask a couple of cheesy questions just cause I just,
cause I'm,

2289
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:57.480
I'm feeling the spirit moved me here.
Um,
you walk into a bar,

2290
02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:02.490
what do you order from the bartender?
Water.
Water.
Do you not drink?
I'll go.

2291
02:23:02.491 --> 02:23:07.470
Nope.
You did not.
No caffeine or very limited caffeine.

2292
02:23:07.471 --> 02:23:10.140
No alcohol.
What other,
what other things?

2293
02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:17.880
Are there any other things you abstained from that would surprise people
perhaps?

2294
02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:22.530
I don't think so.
Okay.
Uh,

2295
02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:26.370
what do you listen to?
What type of music do you listen to and working out?

2296
02:23:29.310 --> 02:23:30.360
So I,

2297
02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:35.880
<v 3>I grew up listening to heavy metal and hardcore music.</v>

2298
02:23:37.350 --> 02:23:41.560
Primarily black Sabbath was kind of my indoctrination into [inaudible] world.

2299
02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:45.210
Good choice.
I remember one of my buddies grown up,
you know,

2300
02:23:45.211 --> 02:23:49.830
he's was praising black sabbath and he said,
you know,
music throughout the,

2301
02:23:50.280 --> 02:23:53.520
throughout the history of the world has been meant to,
you know,

2302
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:56.430
make people feel better and bring them joy.

2303
02:23:56.760 --> 02:24:00.480
And Black Sabbath has absolutely nothing to do with that.
I think that's,

2304
02:24:00.570 --> 02:24:01.950
you know,
that darkness again,
you know,

2305
02:24:01.951 --> 02:24:06.951
we going back to that theme of darkness and I think that Black Sabbath was the

2306
02:24:06.961 --> 02:24:11.940
first group that I heard that I said,
that's what I feel.
What is that?

2307
02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:16.140
And I,
and I latched onto it and you know,
from then I started saying,

2308
02:24:16.141 --> 02:24:19.500
what's harder?
What's darker than that?
And you know,

2309
02:24:19.501 --> 02:24:21.060
I ended up listening to a lot of hardcore,

2310
02:24:21.290 --> 02:24:24.870
I'll give a shout out to black flag hill.
Yeah.

2311
02:24:24.930 --> 02:24:28.470
Lifelike black flag.
My War side too.

2312
02:24:28.890 --> 02:24:33.810
Which if you,
if you listen to black black flag,

2313
02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:38.190
you'll even,
even to me when I was growing up,
I thought,
yeah,
these guys are okay,

2314
02:24:38.191 --> 02:24:42.960
whatever,
no big deal.
Punk rock.
But you get to my war side too.

2315
02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:48.080
And there was a paradigm shift and it was a completely new thing.

2316
02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:52.770
And that was another,
I had black flag,

2317
02:24:52.771 --> 02:24:56.320
my war side too on my record player for,
you know,

2318
02:24:56.370 --> 02:24:59.970
maybe even a year where that's just what I listened to.

2319
02:25:00.390 --> 02:25:03.810
So you know,
that.
Um,
and then,
you know,
again,

2320
02:25:03.811 --> 02:25:06.510
a lot of the hardcore stuff that I grew up listening to,

2321
02:25:07.060 --> 02:25:09.750
I still listen to that today.
It's still,
you know,
on my,

2322
02:25:09.751 --> 02:25:12.000
on my iPhone and what I plugged into a,

2323
02:25:12.001 --> 02:25:15.750
if I was to say some of the more modern music that I listened to,
I'd,

2324
02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:20.370
I'd throw out the white buffalo,
the White Buffalo.
Yeah.
Who's a

2325
02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:24.820
great,
just an incredible,
incredible position.

2326
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.670
And what's incredible about him is he's,

2327
02:25:28.030 --> 02:25:33.030
he writes songs and sing songs that have impact and leave a mark and he's,

2328
02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:38.380
he plays acoustic guitar and a,

2329
02:25:38.381 --> 02:25:41.020
it's not heavy metal by any stretch of the imagination,

2330
02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:44.560
but it is hard and it is raw.

2331
02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:47.380
And it is true.

2332
02:25:48.090 --> 02:25:52.930
And one of the few concerts I've seen in the last 10 years has been

2333
02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:55.220
<v 0>buffalo,
white,
buffalo,
white buffalo and white buffalo.</v>

2334
02:25:55.221 --> 02:25:57.630
So I've seen him a bunch of times.
Every time it comes around and go and see him,

2335
02:25:58.100 --> 02:26:01.100
I'll have to check that out.
White Buffalo,
I won't even get into it,

2336
02:26:01.101 --> 02:26:05.260
but very interesting mythological,
uh,

2337
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:08.330
or it should have traditional native American associations with the White

2338
02:26:08.330 --> 02:26:10.910
Buffalo.
Also,
people can Google that and check it out.
But that's,
you can,

2339
02:26:10.911 --> 02:26:15.710
you can go deep looking into the stories associated with the white buffalo also.

2340
02:26:16.260 --> 02:26:19.170
Uh,
just a few more questions.

2341
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:23.910
If you could give yourself your 25 year old self advice,
what would it be?

2342
02:26:25.370 --> 02:26:27.320
<v 3>Yeah,
so I'm 25 years old.</v>

2343
02:26:27.620 --> 02:26:32.620
I'm at seal team one and I need to know that you don't know everything.

2344
02:26:35.650 --> 02:26:37.440
And,
and,

2345
02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:41.630
and right now I know that right now that I don't know everything and I still

2346
02:26:41.631 --> 02:26:45.530
have a ton to learn and it's like kind of like,
again,
we'll go back to Jujitsu,

2347
02:26:45.650 --> 02:26:49.970
but I told that story earlier when I first learned a couple of basic moves.

2348
02:26:49.971 --> 02:26:53.390
I thought I knew Jujitsu.
I thought it was good.
I got it.
Yeah.
And then you know,

2349
02:26:53.391 --> 02:26:54.560
now and you know,

2350
02:26:54.561 --> 02:26:58.040
I've been training for 20 something years and I know that there's still tons of

2351
02:26:58.041 --> 02:27:02.300
my,
I know,
I don't know,
a quarter of what I need to know,

2352
02:27:02.301 --> 02:27:05.540
a 10th of what I need to know.
And it's the same thing with everything in life.

2353
02:27:05.570 --> 02:27:07.880
You know,
you're going to,
you've got to have an open mind.

2354
02:27:07.881 --> 02:27:12.170
You've got to be ready to learn all the time and always,
always be

2355
02:27:14.420 --> 02:27:17.930
seeking out that knowledge because it doesn't just smack you.
You know,

2356
02:27:17.931 --> 02:27:19.830
you've got to seek it out and talk to people and,

2357
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:21.170
and that's how you're learning gets smarter.

2358
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:26.800
<v 0>What,
uh,
how,
how old are you now if you don't mind me asking?
I'm 44.
44.</v>

2359
02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:28.810
What about your 35 year old self?

2360
02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:34.550
<v 3>So now I'm,
I'm in Ramadi and</v>

2361
02:27:36.980 --> 02:27:38.240
looking back now.

2362
02:27:39.900 --> 02:27:40.733
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2363
02:27:40.810 --> 02:27:45.070
<v 3>I would say
relish that moment,</v>

2364
02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:46.720
which I did,

2365
02:27:49.150 --> 02:27:50.890
but I would say relish that moment.

2366
02:27:53.390 --> 02:27:56.240
<v 0>Jocko,
this has been fascinating and a real honor.</v>

2367
02:27:56.241 --> 02:28:00.890
I appreciate you taking the time.
Where can people find more about you?

2368
02:28:01.110 --> 02:28:04.120
About the book,
about Your Company and work in the,
uh,

2369
02:28:04.130 --> 02:28:07.350
were the best places to visit you and everybody listening,
of course,
the,

2370
02:28:07.410 --> 02:28:11.720
the links and so on to everything we talked about in this discussion.

2371
02:28:11.721 --> 02:28:16.250
We'll be@afourhourworkweekallspelledoutforourworkweek.com and just click on

2372
02:28:16.251 --> 02:28:17.840
podcast.
But,
uh,

2373
02:28:18.050 --> 02:28:22.220
where can people find more about you and your work online?

2374
02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:27.770
<v 5>So we have a Facebook for the book that's coming out.</v>

2375
02:28:28.580 --> 02:28:31.400
Extreme ownership is,
this is where you can find that on Facebook.

2376
02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:37.360
We have a Twitter for extreme ownership as well.
And Lafe and I are both,
uh,

2377
02:28:38.930 --> 02:28:43.760
extremely,
uh,
inept at social media.

2378
02:28:44.030 --> 02:28:47.810
So it's a,
we're,
we're,
we're trying to make some improvements there and as we,

2379
02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:52.460
as we get people interested,
we'll do more.
And you know,

2380
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:54.440
I have,
I actually have a Twitter account.

2381
02:28:54.441 --> 02:28:58.510
I think I've posted one Twitter statement.
Yeah,
it's kind of weird.
You know,
I,

2382
02:28:58.700 --> 02:29:02.730
I always feel like I never liked people that just like talked for no reason.

2383
02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:05.840
Right.
And I kind of get the feeling when you're posting something on Twitter,

2384
02:29:05.841 --> 02:29:08.930
you're kind of talking for no reason.
Yeah.
And so I don't know,

2385
02:29:08.931 --> 02:29:12.350
maybe as people start to ask me questions on Twitter and now I have a

2386
02:29:12.351 --> 02:29:15.530
conversation cause to just sit there and talk,

2387
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:18.890
it feels awkward to me and not really described the Brita.

2388
02:29:18.890 --> 02:29:21.890
You just had perfect strangers on the Internet.
I will,

2389
02:29:21.891 --> 02:29:23.300
I'll tell you what I'll do after we get off.

2390
02:29:23.301 --> 02:29:28.301
I'll show you how I use Twitter for extremely fast information gathering and

2391
02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:31.910
polling and I think you'll find that interesting.

2392
02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:34.580
I'm sure there are some very practical applications.
So guys,

2393
02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:38.120
I will link to all of this website is,

2394
02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:42.650
I always mispronounce this,
is it at Chalan or Exelon?

2395
02:29:42.830 --> 02:29:47.830
It's actually as Chalan Chalan e c h e l o n front.com.

2396
02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:51.290
And I'll link to all this stuff but I'll say it anyway,
uh,

2397
02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:55.730
follow Jocko so that he is forced to interact on Twitter,

2398
02:29:55.731 --> 02:29:59.330
which is the sort of the antithesis of

2399
02:30:00.890 --> 02:30:04.250
the act.
More talk,
less ethos that I so respect.

2400
02:30:04.251 --> 02:30:07.100
But I will show him some interesting ways to implement it.

2401
02:30:07.310 --> 02:30:10.550
At Jocko Willink on Twitter at j.

2402
02:30:10.551 --> 02:30:13.160
O c k o W.
I l l,

2403
02:30:13.161 --> 02:30:18.161
I N K and a extreme ownership will also be on Twitter and Facebook.

2404
02:30:18.410 --> 02:30:23.120
I'll link to all this stuff but that will be in the show notes and Jocko,

2405
02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:25.430
thanks so much.
I really appreciate the time.

2406
02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:27.590
Appreciate the opportunity to thank you.
All right man.

2407
02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:30.740
We'll get some food and a to be continued.
So guys,

2408
02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:34.640
let us know what you thought.
Uh,
check out the book.

2409
02:30:34.970 --> 02:30:36.620
You should really check out the book extreme ownership.

2410
02:30:36.621 --> 02:30:41.450
I've been reading it and very highly actionable,
very easy to digest.

2411
02:30:42.020 --> 02:30:45.980
You have lessons wrapped into stories so you have some,
some,
some,

2412
02:30:45.981 --> 02:30:50.981
some sugarcoating that will help compel this and propel this into your brand so

2413
02:30:50.991 --> 02:30:54.890
you can actually use this information and as always,

2414
02:30:55.220 --> 02:30:59.300
thank you for listening.
Until next time,
learn,
experiment,

2415
02:30:59.450 --> 02:31:01.880
test and educate yourself.

2416
02:31:07.220 --> 02:31:09.590
This episode is brought to you by 99 designs.

2417
02:31:09.591 --> 02:31:12.890
Your one stop shop for all things graphic design related.

2418
02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:17.900
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers,

2419
02:31:17.901 --> 02:31:19.980
including sketches and mock ups

2420
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:21.630
<v 7>that led to the four hour body,</v>

2421
02:31:21.631 --> 02:31:25.590
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

2422
02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:26.440
the brainstorming.

2423
02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:29.760
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

2424
02:31:29.761 --> 02:31:33.960
works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,
a website,

2425
02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:36.540
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

2426
02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:40.260
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

2427
02:31:40.470 --> 02:31:42.930
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

2428
02:31:43.170 --> 02:31:46.590
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

2429
02:31:46.591 --> 02:31:47.280
money back.

2430
02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:51.060
It's that straightforward and many of you who are listening have already used it

2431
02:31:51.061 --> 02:31:53.520
and created some amazing things that I'll be sharing in the future.

2432
02:31:53.790 --> 02:31:56.160
But in the meantime,
if you want to see some of my competitions,

2433
02:31:56.310 --> 02:32:00.270
some of the book covers as well as get a free $99 upgrade,

2434
02:32:00.290 --> 02:32:03.180
go to 99 designs.com forward slash Tim,

2435
02:32:03.210 --> 02:32:06.270
that's 99 designs.com forward slash.
Tim,

2436
02:32:11.010 --> 02:32:15.030
this episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.

2437
02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:19.830
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way,
set it and forget it.

2438
02:32:19.831 --> 02:32:24.180
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

2439
02:32:24.181 --> 02:32:24.930
investors.

2440
02:32:24.930 --> 02:32:28.620
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

2441
02:32:28.621 --> 02:32:31.620
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

2442
02:32:31.650 --> 02:32:33.000
some of my very good friends,

2443
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:36.180
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

2444
02:32:36.570 --> 02:32:39.270
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

2445
02:32:39.570 --> 02:32:43.560
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

2446
02:32:43.561 --> 02:32:45.540
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

2447
02:32:46.050 --> 02:32:49.290
And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

2448
02:32:49.291 --> 02:32:52.020
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

2449
02:32:52.530 --> 02:32:57.180
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

2450
02:32:57.181 --> 02:32:57.931
assessment quiz,

2451
02:32:57.931 --> 02:33:01.830
which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the

2452
02:33:01.831 --> 02:33:04.800
portfolio they'd put you in.
And if you just want to take their advice,

2453
02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:08.160
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

2454
02:33:08.161 --> 02:33:10.020
you can set it and forget it and here's why.

2455
02:33:10.380 --> 02:33:14.370
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

2456
02:33:14.371 --> 02:33:18.840
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't great investing

2457
02:33:18.841 --> 02:33:19.650
is a marathon,

2458
02:33:19.650 --> 02:33:22.980
not a sprint and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like

2459
02:33:22.981 --> 02:33:26.250
automatic tax loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

2460
02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:30.750
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

2461
02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:34.470
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

2462
02:33:34.471 --> 02:33:37.080
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

2463
02:33:37.081 --> 02:33:41.280
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

2464
02:33:41.281 --> 02:33:42.780
impossible right off the bat,

2465
02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:45.300
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

2466
02:33:45.301 --> 02:33:50.301
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

2467
02:33:50.941 --> 02:33:52.980
free.
If you use my link,

2468
02:33:53.010 --> 02:33:57.330
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that is less than $5 a month to invest a

2469
02:33:57.331 --> 02:34:01.450
$30,000 account for instance.
Now,
normally when I have a sponsor on the show,

2470
02:34:01.451 --> 02:34:04.950
it's because I use them and recommend them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

2471
02:34:05.310 --> 02:34:09.270
I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

2472
02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:13.500
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of SCC regulations,

2473
02:34:13.710 --> 02:34:17.190
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

2474
02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:19.990
So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast,

2475
02:34:20.470 --> 02:34:24.100
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

2476
02:34:24.101 --> 02:34:27.940
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

2477
02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:31.060
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

2478
02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:34.630
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

2479
02:34:34.660 --> 02:34:38.470
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account.

2480
02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:41.500
But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

2481
02:34:41.530 --> 02:34:45.670
Take two minutes,
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash.
Tim,

2482
02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.390
it's fast,
it's free.
There's no downside that I can think of.
Now,

2483
02:34:49.391 --> 02:34:51.370
I do have to read a mandatory disclaimer.

2484
02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:55.210

2489
02:35:06.371 --> 02:35:10.180
most innovative companies coming out of Silicon Valley,
and they're killing it.

2490
02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:13.210
They've become massively popular.

2491
02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:15.160
