1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.450
Kelly would you have for breakfast?

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.890
I ate 20 dwarves while doing a handstand on the carpet.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.320
It's a key that carpet,

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.900
<v 1>this attitude,
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.</v>

5
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.360
I'm a cybernetic organism living this year.

6
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.290
<v 0>Podcast is brought to you by Mizzen and main.
Don't worry about the spelling.</v>

7
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:37.520
All you need to do is this.

8
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.650
I have organized my entire life around avoiding fancy shirts because you have to

9
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:46.910
iron them.
You sweat through them,
they smell really easily.

10
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:48.050
They're a pain in the ass.

11
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.490
Mizzen and main has given me the only shirt that I need.

12
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:55.400
And what I mean by that and Kelly Starr at loves the shirts as well,

13
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.680
is that you can trick people.

14
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.430
They look really fancy so you can take them out to nice dinners,
whatever,

15
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.610
but they're made from athletics,
sweat wicking material.

16
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.570
So you can throw this thing into your luggage in a heap or on your kitchen table

17
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:12.650
like I did recently and then pull it out,
throw it on with no ironing,

18
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:14.060
no steaming,
no nothing.

19
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.350
Walk out and you could probably wear this thing for a week straight or make it

20
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:22.820
your only dress shirt and take it on trips for weeks at a time.
Never wash it.

21
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:24.920
It will not smell.
You will not sweat through it.

22
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.330
You got to check these things out.

23
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:29.210

40
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.610
Hello Ladies and gentlemen,

41
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:38.240
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

42
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.370
I am thrilled to be bringing you yet another example of worldclass performance

43
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.900
and of course in the Tim Ferriss show,

44
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:48.830
what I attempt to do is deconstruct those performers to give you the tools and

45
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:52.790
tricks that you can use and whether those people be from the worlds of finance,

46
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.920
say investors like billionaire Peter Teal,

47
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.460
celebrity like Arnold Schwartzenegger or sports,

48
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.340
and this is going to focus on the one thing besides politics and religion,

49
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.210
the get Americans all hot and bothered,
and that is crossfit.

50
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.960
We will delve into the good,
the bad,
and the ugly of all things crossfit.

51
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.400
We will answer many,

52
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:16.840
many questions including what are the three most dangerous exercises in crossfit

53
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:17.860
gyms?
Generally speaking,

54
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.130
what are the most common nutritional mistakes in crossfit?

55
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.020
What do elite crossfit athletes do differently than the rest?
For example,

56
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.810
what do rich Froning and Jason Khalifa do for warmups?

57
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.910
Is the crossfit games really crossfit and what is the future of crossfit the man

58
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:37.090
to answer all of this and much more as Kelly Starr ret,

59
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.330
he's trained crossfit athletes for more than 130,000 hours and 10 years at San

60
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.600
Francisco.
Crossfit,

61
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.020
which was one of the very first 50 crossfit affiliates in the world.

62
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.550
There are now more than 10,000.
His clients include Olympic gold medalist,

63
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.181
Tour de France,

64
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:56.140
cyclists world and national record holders and Olympic weightlifting and power

65
00:03:56.141 --> 00:04:00.280
lifting,
crossfit games,
metalists ballet dancers,
elite military,

66
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.690
on and on and on.
This is going to go very,
very deep.

67
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.920
It involves significantly less alcohol than the last long conversation I had

68
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.190
with Kelly,
uh,
which is also included in the blog

69
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:17.191
post@fourhourworkweekdotcomforwardslashpodcastwhereyoucanfindshownotesandotherthingsforourworkweek.com

70
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:22.690
forward slash podcast and without further ado,
enjoy,

71
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.460
discuss,
debate,
yell and scream.
Here you are.
Kelly started

72
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.300
<v 2>Sir Kelly.
Welcome back to the shell.
Oh,
thanks for having me.
Thank you.</v>

73
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.280
A little more lucid this time.
Perhaps little lucid,
little less alcohol,

74
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.500
a little more caffeine.
Whatever you gave me here.

75
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.000
I mistakenly thought it was one cup of coffee and you're like it strong.

76
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.990
I was on the phone and I was like,
I don't worry.
Yes,

77
00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:47.450
strong fucking strong coffee.
What?

78
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.120
I think it's supposed to be diluted at like eight to one,
but it's fine.

79
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:51.954
I'm sure it'll be fine.

80
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.650
So we are here at San Francisco crossfit and you have quite an anniversary,

81
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.110
I suppose you could call it.
You've spent 10 years in this world called crossfit.

82
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.430
Yeah,
this is,
this year now is 10 full years.

83
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.840
So I want to dig into this because we've known each other for quite awhile and

84
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.810
to perhaps lead off for people who may not be familiar with this world or have

85
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:23.550
heard the word a million times but don't know what it really means for you.

86
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.100
What is crossfit or how do you define crossfit?
You know there,

87
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.630
there's the official definition of trying to get people to work at higher

88
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:35.631
intensity in movements that replicate the movements that we see in life.

89
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.660
It looks like squatting and dead lifting and pushing and pulling and running.

90
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:44.400
And if you had to sort of mash up the tenants of gymnastics,
Olympic lifting,

91
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:45.670
power lifting and all the,

92
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.540
the aerobics responsibilities also that come along with that.

93
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.860
That's what the programming looks like,
but that's not what it is for me now,

94
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:56.790
10 years I've been,
I mean we estimate even in our gym here,

95
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.880
we've doing it for nine plus years.

96
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.690
We've done maybe 130,000 athlete hours here,

97
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.560
which is a lot of pattern recognition.
That's a lot of people going up and down,

98
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:08.620
squatting,
moving and what we've come to,

99
00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:10.750
I've really come to understand this mean this is my own interpretation is

100
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.600
basically saying,

101
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.830
we've figured out now here are all the things that a human should be responsible

102
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.270
to be able to do.
You know?
Can you put your arms over your head?
Yes or no?
Well,

103
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:23.090
can you do that in a handstand?
Can do that with a Dumbbell,

104
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:25.010
can do that with a Kettlebell and new with the barbell.
Can you,

105
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.590
can you go from ground to overhead to do that?
Can you press overhead?

106
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.980
What ends up happening then is we've been able to winnow down to say,

107
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:32.180
here are the positions,

108
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:36.660
the archetypal shapes that are represented in every sport and every shit

109
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.400
situation,
every,
every position.
But in the gym I can say,

110
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:44.000
do you have this position?
Yes or no?
And then I can say,
Oh,
you do.
Well,

111
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:47.720
let me challenge it.
And the obvious one for the gym,
for most people is,
you know,

112
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.140
is,
is load.
Let's make it heavier.
And you know,

113
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.250
cause you've come out of a serious drink conditioning background in the past and

114
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.550
powerlifting that along time ago,
our answer to everything was,
oh,

115
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:02.660
just get stronger.
You know,
he's got glute weakness.
I'm like,
seriously?

116
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.290
I mean that guy deadlift 700 you think his glutes are weak or she plays in the

117
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:10.250
NFL.
You know what I mean?
Like people are ridiculous.
It's not a weakness problem.

118
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.540
And what I found for a long time was that we were throwing bigger and bigger

119
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:17.000
engines onto cars that couldn't handle it.
Right?
Well,

120
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:18.700
how much do I need to squat if I'm a runner?

121
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.720
400500600 guys like Pawel where like you can double body weight back squat,

122
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.410
you're probably good enough to 60 you're excuse from skidding and he's stronger.

123
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.740
Right?
I know Dan John was like,
Hey,
you should front squat.
You know,

124
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.210
a long time ago Greg Glassman was like,

125
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:34.520
you look at the overhead squat versus your front squat.

126
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.730
Just presuppose that you can do those two movements.
Right?
Right.

127
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.380
And then look at the difference between there.

128
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.680
And that's a pretty good indicator of how robust your spine is and how good your

129
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:44.590
shoulders are.
So we've gotten,

130
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.960
now we can start asking a little bit different question besides,

131
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.220
is it because what we,

132
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:52.610
what we evaluated was will I put more weight on the bar so it must be better,

133
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.550
right?
But now we can say,
Hey,

134
00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.230
what about if I have you run around the building and you start breathing hard

135
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.470
and then show me how strong you are.
Show me how that position was.
Oh,
okay.

136
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:07.400
So now I can challenge your position with cardio-respiratory demand.
And boy,

137
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:09.050
that starts to look a lot like sport.
Huh?

138
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.580
Like fighting looks like skiing at the bottom of a bump run or running all the

139
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:15.350
way down and having to cut or you know what I mean?

140
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.700
They'll actually starts to feel like sport.

141
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:19.730
What happens if I start to burn or I'm fatiguing metabolic demand?

142
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.850
What happens if I add speed?
I make a lot of errors.
If I go fast,

143
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.650
what happens if I'm competing like you and I just decided right now we're going

144
00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:28.190
to go have a pushup contest.

145
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.260
Whether you are the world champion and pushups or not,

146
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.830
a little bit of your back of your brain starts to freak out because it's on the

147
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:35.630
spot.
So we had the psychological pressure.

148
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.470
What happens if I make you change mechanics?

149
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:42.590
And so this is a bunch of block practice.
Instead of doing a hundred swings,

150
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.660
we're going to do a burpee than to a Calabasas.

151
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.980
So suddenly I can change the motor programming.
And what we found,
and my,

152
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:50.600
this is my own language around this,

153
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.470
is that all of those things are really deficient of intensity,
metabolic load,

154
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.970
right?
Car,
respiratory demand,
load speed.

155
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.930
The other aspects are the aspects of the training that are the sort of

156
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:03.990
intellectual piece around sort of programming in the training.

157
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.990
But my estimation is the people who can maintain the best positions are the best

158
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:14.721
athletes and remain the most robust and have the biggest work capacities.

159
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:15.750
And as a side effect,

160
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:18.540
because we teach all these principles can apply them to things that matter,

161
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.070
like life and sport,
not just more exercising.
No,
it's a,

162
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:27.340
I was having a conversation with,
uh,
you mentioned Paul and uh,
he's,

163
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.840
he is a tendency for very short answers,
which is fun to listen to,

164
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:34.090
his great voice too,
for the short answers.
But somebody asked him,
uh,

165
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.800
for basic advice related to endurance and he said,
fix your posture,

166
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.250
work on your posture.
Uh,
whether that is,
you know,
running posture,

167
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:45.540
standing posture,
sitting posture,
et cetera.
And what I'd love to ask you is,

168
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.710
if you look at the crossfit community as a whole,
there's so many gyms,

169
00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:51.280
so many boxes,
uh,

170
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:56.510
what are problems that are very often not being addressed?

171
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.300
So people come in,
they jumped straight into,
you know,
the workout of the day or,

172
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.980
or,
or metabolic conditioning.
Um,

173
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.600
what are some common mistakes of whether it be crossfit instructors or trainees

174
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:13.050
where they come out six months later and from your eye you're like,

175
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.960
ab and C has not been sure.
Well,

176
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.400
I will correct and just play the devil's advocate around the statement because

177
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:24.600
my experience is honestly now,
Ben,
no one just jumps right into a gym anymore.

178
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:27.780
You can see on the Internet and go explore on your own garage.

179
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.550
But I think about a hundred percent of the gyms I run into have some sort of,

180
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:36.660
holy crap,
you don't know how to move.
You may have a big engine,

181
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:40.620
but you don't have any exposure to this.
Like our cyclists are the worst.

182
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.040
They come in with the most like robust aerobic engine.

183
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.120
They generate huge amounts of concentric forests have no eccentric control at

184
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:51.620
all.
Right?
So it means they can't lengthen underload basically.
Right.

185
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.570
And then those people listening who are not in the gym much.

186
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.690
If you're in a squat position and you move up into a standing position,

187
00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:00.660
you can think of that as concentric doing the reverse east centric where you're,

188
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.830
you're,
you're lengthening.

189
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.790
So what we saw was that people were coming in relatively aerobic fed.
I mean,

190
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:08.550
people aren't slouches anymore.
There really aren't.
They're exposed,

191
00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:12.190
they're doing intervals that,
I mean the Internet has blown people's,

192
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.050
I think general conditioning now much higher.
Like for example,

193
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.680
and I'll come back to the question,
but for example,
you know the,

194
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.000
the crossfit unofficial crossfit mascot,
everyone loves the show is pukey right?

195
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:28.260
Pukey the clown.
I haven't seen someone vomit in a crossfit in eight years.

196
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.180
I used to happen all the time.

197
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.200
Like people used to come in and do a workout and vomit because technically

198
00:11:34.201 --> 00:11:36.690
there's an area in the back of your brain stem called the area post Irma.

199
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.030
It's samples your blood circulation.
Right?

200
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.000
And what ends up happening is people are generally so much lactic acid that

201
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:42.481
their brain was like,

202
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:46.050
you've poisoned yourself but activated your vom mission center.

203
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:48.360
That's the mechanism for vomiting from workouts.

204
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.750
That doesn't happen anymore because people's conditioning,

205
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.000
whether you're at soul cycle,
you'd go to soul cycle,

206
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.740
blow your brains up on a bike,
you're going to be d like you protect it,

207
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:01.000
not from move Mary centric love,

208
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:04.720
but like you will be able to buffer some lactic acid,
right?
So we've seen,

209
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:07.690
I seen the general fitness go up,

210
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:10.480
but what has happened now is that people have said,
okay,
look,

211
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:14.170
you can't just come in here and train because you're going to wreck yourself and

212
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:17.050
more important,
you're not going to understand what is we're trying to do,

213
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.050
which is here are the fundamental movements that are the sort of,
um,

214
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.540
sort of signature positions of the crossfit method.

215
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.840
And you don't know any of them,
right?
So we,
we,

216
00:12:27.841 --> 00:12:32.841
we forced people to come in and the mistake is as a coach that I need to get

217
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:37.810
people moving.
And this is why if you go to a crossfit level one seminar,

218
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.690
they are going to teach you.
And they're really excellent,
excellent coaches,

219
00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:44.980
very thoughtful,
very,
very,
the,
the course has evolved in 10 years.

220
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.010
A ton.
We've become more sophisticated 10 years,

221
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:51.370
but we teach you with really low loads,
I.
E.

222
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.210
A PVC pipe or medicine ball because I've never seen anyone die from those
things.

223
00:12:55.211 --> 00:13:00.211
But the ego gets involved and pretty soon there's a barbell in it and you can

224
00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:05.611
still see people performing a tremendous amount of work in bad positions.

225
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.610
And what ends up happening is as we get people in,

226
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:11.260
we have to give them a little taste of the intensity.

227
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:14.350
And we do that with the rowing machine and some burpees,
right?
We get,

228
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:15.250
we get them saying,
hey,

229
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.520
I need to show you what happens when you start reading hard.
But then,

230
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.540
and we ended up making I think a set of decisions about getting people moving,

231
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.600
right?
Because if you,
if your mind mom,

232
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.330
maybe you don't have the ankle range of motion,
you have an artificial hip.

233
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.840
The most important thing is that we start squatting,
right?

234
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.960
And I have a lot of ways of making that difficult.
Oh,
we're going to be on this,

235
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.750
this air dyne and we're going to sprint a little bit and then come back and air

236
00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:41.410
squat.
For me,
like that's enough for a lot of people.
The problem is,

237
00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:44.410
and I might turn your feet out and I might be okay with you rounding your back a

238
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:47.410
little bit,
doesn't have to be perfect,
but now at least you're squatting.

239
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.890
We can have a conversation about what's next,
right?
I can make errors.

240
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.160
The problem is we start loading this inefficient,

241
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:56.020
this compromise movement because we said,
hey,

242
00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:57.580
the first thing is let's get moving.

243
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:03.180
Now what and what is we need to continue to refine the mechanic for life and

244
00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:07.810
that's the biggest mistake.
I think people don't understand that.
They're like,

245
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:10.710
well,
they're squatting up and down.
Now find the mechanic meaning the movement,

246
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.170
the principles behind the move,
right?
Right.
And it's all there for us.

247
00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:17.410
It has always been there for us.
Hey,
limit motion of your spine.

248
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:18.700
Underload everyone agrees.

249
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.670
And yet when I take the average person off the street and just have them squat

250
00:14:21.671 --> 00:14:25.810
very fast,
I see a ton.
I had a young NFL prospect and today,
right,

251
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:29.200
getting some advice about his knees going to go to the combine.
I asked him,

252
00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:32.500
just do an air squat and the amount of reversal in his spine,

253
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.490
he literally rounded into a dumped like dog taking a poop position.

254
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.720
And he had massive fins in the middle of his back where his musculature has

255
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:44.830
overdeveloped from him,
basically rounding underneath.
And I was like,
um,

256
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:49.310
so that's not really good.
Let's do less of that.
And he's like,
what?

257
00:14:49.311 --> 00:14:50.190
Wha what are you talking about?

258
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.680
Like he couldn't even identify that this thing was going on.
Right.
And you know,

259
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:59.300
from the physical therapy side of things,
from the sports performance side,

260
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:04.160
the highest level form on these issues that I hammer on and hammer people on are

261
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:07.850
the limiting factors to you getting,
stopping injured.

262
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.390
And there are the limiting factors to you being the best in the world and

263
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:13.340
winning a gold medal.
I mean,
these little details.

264
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.960
And so we should be constantly refining technique to express what is full

265
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:22.880
physiology.
So,
for example,
um,
there was,

266
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:24.710
uh,
you know,
one of the things,

267
00:15:24.711 --> 00:15:27.140
there's so many voices and fitness now and so when people come in,

268
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:30.730
but like someone basically,
do you know what apologetics is like?
That's,

269
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:31.910
I get the first part,

270
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:37.430
not the plural apologetics is basically in religion where people come around and

271
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.110
explain a phenomenon in terms of the dogma that this is what that meant now.

272
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:45.960
Right?
Then they,
it's because a lot of it was allegory and metaphor and lesson,

273
00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:47.780
right?
In science fiction,

274
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:51.380
apologetics means you can explain any technology away based on some other thing.

275
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:55.370
Well,
I see apologetics happen in human physiology.
Oh,

276
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:59.360
the reason you can't squat all the way down is your hip structure,
right?
Oh,

277
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:01.560
well some people don't just have long Femur,

278
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:04.190
so they can't take a poo in the woods.
It's Squallo down.
And I'm like,

279
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:09.020
what are you talking about?
The issue is that people we haven't making,

280
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:14.021
giving people clear benchmarks about what is normal and what is this normal,

281
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.030
right.
Cook and those guys cook and Burton,

282
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.380
the functional movement screen have tried to establish baselines for
performance,

283
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.590
but those don't even go all the way to show me that you have full range of

284
00:16:24.591 --> 00:16:26.210
motion,
your ankles like you.

285
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.730
One of the secrets I don't think people understand is that you are,

286
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.230
you have good positions and those positions have protected you for a long time,

287
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.480
right?
You have a,
you can squat with your feet together,

288
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.600
ankles together all the way down full hip function for ankle function,

289
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.440
but people are coming into the gym basically as demi human,

290
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.890
they have big Rubik engines because that's what someone said they should do,

291
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:51.310
but they don't have even like 50% of the ranges of motion it should have and

292
00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:55.010
they don't even have the motor control to be able to start to express this
stuff.

293
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.160
You know,
what is it?
If you want the great tranquility,

294
00:16:58.161 --> 00:17:00.290
be willing to sweat the white hot beads,
right?

295
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.060
I mean Olympic lifters got it right?

296
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:03.560
And you can see why they lumped with Virgil like what the hell?

297
00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:05.990
Why aren't you Olympic lifting?
You can't even put your arms over your head.

298
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:06.561
You know what I mean?

299
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:10.730
And the Olympic lifting demands that we have basic capacities and all of these

300
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:14.930
shapes.
The only thing that's missing is the bench press shape.
But guess what?

301
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.510
Olympic lifters do some bench pressing.
You know what I mean?

302
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:19.790
So they figured it out.
It's a lot easier to go that direction.

303
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.330
You know they're round.
Right.
And that's right.
And so it's interesting,
you know,

304
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.010
I think that what we're,

305
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:29.690
what we have not done a good job of is showing people how far away from normal

306
00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:31.640
they are.
Right.
We,
you'd have no,

307
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:36.590
I'm like you should be able to keep your back flat and leg straight and hinge

308
00:17:36.591 --> 00:17:38.990
over and pick up a barbell.
And I bet,

309
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.640
I know you can do it cause I've seen you do it.

310
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.180
But I bet that 95% of the people the street are stiff,

311
00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:46.940
don't have the motor control,
tight hips,
whatever.
It doesn't matter.

312
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.430
It's not an indictment on their lifestyle and an that we don't understand what

313
00:17:50.431 --> 00:17:51.360
could function is.

314
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.560
And the training we've been doing for the last 50 years has not necessarily

315
00:17:55.561 --> 00:17:58.020
heightened that.
Now there are populations,

316
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.950
the Jujitsu guys have been on this a long time,
right?

317
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.390
That you have to have these good positions there.

318
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.290
The requisites are is the size of camel flexors.

319
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.390
It's true cause a little low back soreness otherwise besides that.

320
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:15.570
But what you're seeing is a lot of people have worked this out many,
many,

321
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:19.800
many times.
We haven't applied it to sort of the rigor of modern humans.

322
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.140
And that means modern strengthen conditioning.

323
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.010
And we haven't couched it in the terms.
So when people walk into the gym,

324
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.360
you know it is,

325
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:32.630
I don't think people realize as a coach it is an enormous fucking challenge to

326
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:36.330
say,
oh by the way,
you have no understanding of how you move.

327
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.810
And if I make you breathe a little bit hard,

328
00:18:37.811 --> 00:18:42.120
if you throw it away and you move like crap and by the way you eat like an

329
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.630
asshole and you don't sleep.
And what are we going to do in this hour?

330
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:49.150
We have to start a conversation.
So for me,
there's this line of,
well,

331
00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.080
we've got to get people in the door and we got to get them started.
Right?

332
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.930
But that's not the end of the conversation,
you know?
Yeah.

333
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:58.200
You can squat with your feet turned out like ducks.
You totally can.

334
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.180
You can set a world record in powerlifting like that,

335
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:03.420
but you know what you can't do,
you can't run.
You can't jump and land.

336
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.650
You can't cut.
I mean,
it really caused all these problems.
I see it.

337
00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:10.170
And I also see people losing performance that way.

338
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:13.800
So the question remains this dichotomy,
then his chair,

339
00:19:13.801 --> 00:19:16.560
my feet are turned out because that allows me to squat all the way down.
Great.

340
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.750
That's a beginning of a conversation.

341
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.810
But the optimal position is the position that allows me to take my fitness and

342
00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:28.680
now transplant that into motor patterns instead of just saying,
well,

343
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:31.080
you're really fit now,
so you're protected now.
And he said,
well,

344
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:34.630
I've practiced these shapes and this pattern and the,

345
00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:38.130
the theory and the principal and I can then apply that to whatever I'm doing.

346
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:41.310
And that's what's missing from the gym.
So this is,
uh,

347
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.370
this is a really fascinating topic for me.
The,

348
00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:49.380
the gym to sport transition huge and whether that is a worthwhile goal.

349
00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:54.600
Also,
uh,
for me,
just as a side note,
I mean,
I've been spending time exploring,

350
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:59.930
just chanced upon meeting the cofounder of Acro Yoga and I'd never had much

351
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:04.740
interest in yoga.
Well,
let's just stop.
I mean,
acro yoga sounds really stupid,

352
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.520
but what is not is not really stupid.
No,
it's not.
And it's,

353
00:20:08.521 --> 00:20:13.521
it's partner yoga involving gymnastic and acrobatic position.

354
00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:15.090
So if you've ever seen,

355
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:19.170
say a Cirque de Solei performance with two strong men where they're linking arms

356
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:22.490
and holding handstands overhead and s and so on,
uh,

357
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.790
the motions are quite similar,
but you spend a lot of time on your back,
uh,

358
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.980
balancing people on your feet and so on.
And,

359
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.970
but the coming back to your squatting position,

360
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.760
I remember asking Jason,

361
00:20:35.761 --> 00:20:38.820
I think his last name present Neemar really excellent coach.

362
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:43.050
Why he was recommending that I hold my hands a certain way when practicing

363
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:46.440
handstands because I've been instructed elsewhere by other,
uh,

364
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.430
gymnastics coach is to do it a different way.
And he said,

365
00:20:48.431 --> 00:20:49.840
the reason you're holding it that way,

366
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:51.100
even though it's a little more uncomfortable,

367
00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:54.580
is because when you go into the actual positions in Acro Yoga and you're doing

368
00:20:54.581 --> 00:20:57.820
it at speed,
you're going to maintain that exact hand position.

369
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.960
So you want to train that pattern.
And I was like,
oh,
got it.
Yeah.

370
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.360
And uh,
let's talk about athleticism though.
The,

371
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:10.360
the training versus athleticism conversation.
Uh,

372
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.780
Kay and I hadn't heard of this because I,
I,
I'm not,

373
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.410
I'm not exposed to the crossfit games much,
but can you talk about the,
uh,

374
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:22.690
the softball phenomenon a bit?
Well,
I,
it's,
it's,
you know,

375
00:21:22.691 --> 00:21:27.460
crossfit,
Eh,
you know,
as originally conceived by Greg Glassman.

376
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.600
And if you look at the original,
you know,

377
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.760
fitness in a hundred words or less in there,

378
00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:38.360
it says regularly learn and play new sports.
Hey,
nice middle splits,
bro.
Well,

379
00:21:38.361 --> 00:21:39.430
you started doing the middle splits.

380
00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:41.500
We're sitting here on the floor in the gym and I was like,
I like getting,
get,

381
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.930
getting sort of the adductor jealousy.

382
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.350
So although your ties look like swollen texts and mine look like,

383
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.500
I just don't know.
I just woke up and I was like this bro.

384
00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:53.560
I don't know how it came with the kit.
The um,
you know,

385
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.410
so the tenant always has been,
hey,

386
00:21:56.411 --> 00:21:59.290
you've need to keep learning and you keep diversifying.

387
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.030
They call that lateralization.
Right?

388
00:22:01.031 --> 00:22:04.030
People have been talking about it and surfers or some skill,
the big,

389
00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.520
the big wall climber suddenly are doing breath holding and they learned

390
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:10.080
something about that.
Right.
Slap lining.
Yes,
exactly.
Lateralization right.

391
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:11.230
Steven Kotler has been all about him.

392
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.840
So that's an important piece of like saying,
okay,
you have this skill set,

393
00:22:16.841 --> 00:22:19.720
let's go challenge it and no domain.
That's the crucial.

394
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:24.750
What is interesting and is always going to be a problem with for me with

395
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.760
crossfit is that,
um,
I can always,
you know,

396
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.100
crossfit is the sing for me,

397
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:36.610
the single best integrated way of training I have ever come across.

398
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.330
I still haven't seen it.
I've seen it refined,
I've seen Mckenzie apply it.

399
00:22:40.331 --> 00:22:42.190
The concepts and principles to endurance athletes.

400
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:45.130
I've seen well born apply it to power athletes.
This,

401
00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:48.400
the colonel and the methodology is the same.
Right.
But,

402
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.470
and I haven't to date seen something that looks better at general physical

403
00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:54.041
preparedness.

404
00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:58.600
Like I want my daughters to have a skillset and a base fitness and strength and,

405
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.810
and this is the,
the model is it,
the model is,

406
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:06.370
should I have all of my NFL is do something that looks exactly crossfit?
No,

407
00:23:06.371 --> 00:23:08.950
but I can still keep the tenants there.
I can,
I the the thing,

408
00:23:08.951 --> 00:23:10.090
the base code is so good.

409
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:15.160
The problem is sometimes we confuse the ability to do,

410
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.400
perform a lot of work with the ability to be athletic and in one of my

411
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:24.460
definitions of who's the best athletes,
who picks up the new skill the fastest.

412
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:25.480
This is why,

413
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.480
I mean your little experiment about the Tim Ferriss experiment about how fast

414
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:34.680
can I learn really piqued my interest because I'm like,
that is the,
the limiter.

415
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.480
How cow fast can I apply this base skill set?
What does,

416
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.900
what does that base skill set look like?
You remember?
Um,
uh,

417
00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:44.110
Robert Highland had that little quote.
It was like a man should be able to,

418
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.640
I like butcher a hog captain,
a ship to etc. Etc.
Plan a war,
like I said,

419
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:53.990
a bone,
right?
Specializations for insects,
right?
That like awesome,

420
00:23:53.991 --> 00:23:58.880
strong girls in the background.
Oh,
if you heard that,
but the issue here is,

421
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:59.803
you know,

422
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:05.150
what we should be doing is trying to ask ourselves what constitutes the right

423
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.200
skillset to quickly pick up new skills and to reapply as myself once a learning

424
00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:11.084
animal.

425
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.920
Him what I can tell you in my believe this in my soul souls and I've seen it

426
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:20.330
that good strength and conditioning programs and I'm talking about at all now,

427
00:24:20.331 --> 00:24:21.470
right beyond crossfit,

428
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.780
good straightening into industry proof or programs reinforce skills in
positions.

429
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.310
Ido Portal for examples.
A good example of this,
right?
I don't,

430
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.190
I don't know if you know many of his guys are going to play in the NFL,

431
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:38.240
but that's not,
doesn't mean he hasn't,
he's right about this,
this concept,

432
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.380
but that,
you know,
how do we,

433
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.920
what's the language of creating a ready state in the human so that I can

434
00:24:45.921 --> 00:24:50.921
constantly be not limited by my physical capacity and that is positioned to,

435
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:52.730
that's positionally driven.
That's my,

436
00:24:52.731 --> 00:24:54.440
it's my ability to pick up and learn new skills.

437
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.320
And I think what you're referring to is in the crossfit games that we saw is

438
00:24:57.321 --> 00:25:00.260
that people were freakish about their work capacity.

439
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.050
And then some people ask them,
let me be very strong,

440
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.080
huge Arabic engines and they were like,
just throw this ball and you're like,

441
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.590
what was the,
what was the event?
I didn't see it was a soft ball toss.

442
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.450
Any different this throws.
Yeah,
throw distance.

443
00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:13.580
Throw the softball as far as you can now check this out.

444
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.450
It turns out that rich Froning played football in college.
Guess what?

445
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.680
He's a pretty good athlete.
Yeah.
Graham Homework to Sport College Athlete,
right?

446
00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.370
Oh,
what did he do?
Oh,
he was the pitcher and the quarterback,
like he's a mutant.

447
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.100
So he did all right.
Appreciating these guys store.

448
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.210
But there's some other kids who obviously had deficiencies in there,
have,

449
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.120
have thrived in because in crossfit,

450
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.500
but the nature and the limitations of challenging people's fitness,

451
00:25:39.501 --> 00:25:43.580
it's hard to see the at the aspects of athleticism and it's not always the case.

452
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.060
They,
they really do try to program those things in.

453
00:25:47.061 --> 00:25:49.740
But it's also limited by like,
how do we do with,
you know,

454
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.680
how do we have a pickup game of basketball?

455
00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:55.250
I can't really see and judge that stuff.
Um,
you know,
they make people swim,

456
00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:57.410
they make people run.
They me to go bike.
They paid the,

457
00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.530
the obstacle course was a great example of the expression of just moving through

458
00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:02.770
the environment.
I love that event.
Um,

459
00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.510
but there were some people who had some really horrific soft,

460
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.450
they ended up rolling and underhand because,

461
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.560
and that really begs the question because the central tenant of what this

462
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:15.440
experiment was and it's important for,
I think the average person who is,

463
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.350
is crossfitting,
right?

464
00:26:18.351 --> 00:26:23.351
Is that there's sort of two crossfits and I think crossfit HQ would back me up

465
00:26:23.691 --> 00:26:28.220
on this,
that we have the highest expression of crossfitting,

466
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.000
which is the crossfit games.
And I just came from,

467
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.230
I'm an athlete camp that Reebok put on in The Bahamas.
I'm not going to lie.

468
00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:37.880
It was okay.
Yes,
right.

469
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.210
But we did a bunch of train session with some of the best athletes on the
planet.

470
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.230
And the first thing that all of these Gamer guys did,
like these are the,

471
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.290
like these are rich Froning,
Jason Cleopas,
all the really extraordinary athletes.

472
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:54.120
They all went and played pick up football and onto masterfully boom immediately

473
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:57.510
and you're like,
Oh wow,
these guys are pretty legit athletes.

474
00:26:57.511 --> 00:27:01.920
There was some aspect of that athleticism that they carried to crossfit and then

475
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:05.550
cross it allowed them to heighten this,
this a row,
this,
these functions.

476
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.570
And what I think happens sometimes is now,

477
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:12.210
because people can't sort of separate that out,

478
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.370
it's easy to put on a pedestal.
If I can just work really hard,

479
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.670
then I'm going to be a really good athlete and able to pick up all these new

480
00:27:18.671 --> 00:27:19.980
sports.
And yes,

481
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:24.840
one of the things that I've seen Greg Cook pivot on and some people pivoting on

482
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.370
around crossfit as they didn't,

483
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:31.050
they realize that people aren't giving up capacities to crossfit right there.

484
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.030
They still are.
Most of us are still half full ankle range of motion.

485
00:27:35.031 --> 00:27:38.430
Cause you do pistols additive not yes,
yes.
And,

486
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.310
and for a long time in the strength and conditioning world,

487
00:27:41.311 --> 00:27:46.080
we have seen people get a really big power clean and then everything else sucks.

488
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:47.400
Right?
It all sucks.

489
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:51.540
So what's interesting about the program here in our gym is that we really ferret

490
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:55.650
out all the crappy wind patterns,
you know.
So let me ask you this.
If I could,
uh,

491
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.920
this is just top of mind right now,
I guess.
I guess two things.

492
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.940
If someone were to ask you,
is crossfit games really crossfit?

493
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:08.150
Should the multitudes of people in crossfit gyms aspire to that as an objective?

494
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:12.420
Number one,
let's start with number one.
Uh,
but,
uh,

495
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:17.280
got a bunch of top of mind.
But no,
first of all,
I don't think they should and,

496
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.780
but I will tell you that the athletes involved in the experiment involved has

497
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:26.310
been so informative for me as a coach,
as a physio,

498
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.880
because I can really see what the deficiencies are a day,

499
00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:32.960
five at day three under these loads.
And,

500
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.320
and it really starts to matter when we see that the best athletes refined

501
00:28:37.321 --> 00:28:42.150
position,
refined position,
refined efficiency and,
and win,

502
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.400
right?
That's,
that's been the name of the game.

503
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.790
It used to be that you could just outwork people that do people train and two

504
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:48.624
and three times a day.

505
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.960
They are the most meticulous athletes I've ever seen in any sport anywhere.

506
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.180
They're on top of the nutrition game,
on top of the recovery game,

507
00:28:57.181 --> 00:29:01.950
on top of hydration,
adaptation,
mechanics.
Like they are really,
really have def,

508
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:06.030
I mean rich Froning,
he's a little tiny guy,
you know,
how much does he weigh?

509
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.990
I think he's probably like one 95 just something like that.

510
00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:13.510
Snatches snatch three 15 that's like in tennis shoes and,

511
00:29:13.511 --> 00:29:17.190
and Reebok flat nano shoes that like I can not,
not Olympic lifting shoes.

512
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:21.120
And he does that in the context of also being able to do all these other things.

513
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.490
So I think it's what it has done.

514
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.460
What the reason for me that the Games are so important is that it's,

515
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:30.690
it's changed the consciousness about what's possible.
By the way,

516
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.430
you can still run this mountain seven k and be brutally strong.
In fact,

517
00:29:35.431 --> 00:29:36.480
why aren't you?
You know?

518
00:29:36.481 --> 00:29:38.580
And I think people have been having that conversation for a long time.

519
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:43.750
It also has gotten us really clear about what works and doesn't work in a very

520
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.780
sort of pressure cooker situation in terms of programming and training load of

521
00:29:48.991 --> 00:29:53.980
the pro programming.
But I would say about nutrition,
about,
I've never seen these,

522
00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:57.220
any athlete in the history of the world do more work than these kids.

523
00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.870
I know the Tour de France guys,
I,

524
00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.080
I mean I know them personally and their wattage's are insane.

525
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.700
The run best runner,
like they're put,

526
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.870
everyone's putting out hard but no one like the CNS load,

527
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.580
the crazy loads.

528
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.990
And that has really made it very clear about the lessons that we've been able to

529
00:30:13.991 --> 00:30:17.580
pull out.
So as an experiment,
as Formula One,
right?

530
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:21.310
But not all of us should aspire to be formula one drivers or even drive our
cars.

531
00:30:21.311 --> 00:30:23.890
Like Formula One and very few of us have the genetics,

532
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.480
which is the also sort of yourself,
right?
The lie that we tell ourselves,

533
00:30:28.481 --> 00:30:32.410
well you know,
I can train like them.
So I'm I,
you know,
no you can't.

534
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:37.210
You're not them genetically.
I'm sorry,
but sorry,

535
00:30:37.211 --> 00:30:40.960
Tim Ferriss here.
A bad Bethel.
I sit in the corner.
You know what?
Play scrabble.

536
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.450
You are relatively strong.
You're strong ish.
I strong as your aerobic fit.

537
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.920
Good thing you're a smart kid and you're good to answer.

538
00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:48.754
People don't know that about you.

539
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.890
And I learned to throw the genuineness of the people who are stronger and I can

540
00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:55.780
run away.
So,
you know,
I think,

541
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.620
I think that it's vital to understand the role of the games have played in terms

542
00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:00.460
of raising the boat.

543
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:06.340
Also sort of distilling down the essences of what's important and not important

544
00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:09.730
and the lessons we've learned out of that and how to program.
You know,

545
00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:12.550
cause I think a long time ago,
you know,
even guys like Louie was like,

546
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:15.190
well we're all powerlifter so we'll just plot powerlifting.

547
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.230
Well that didn't work at all.
Right?

548
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:20.470
And what we're seeing is very sophisticated training,

549
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:24.520
a mega wave heart rate variability,
like what people are doing.

550
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:29.200
It's a way of sort of looking at bow rhythms,

551
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:30.490
heart rate variability,

552
00:31:30.491 --> 00:31:34.090
and really coming up with recovery score so we can understand in real time the

553
00:31:34.091 --> 00:31:37.870
effect of yesterday's training.
The HRV would be part of that.
Yeah,
absolutely.

554
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.300
But like like Hrv on steroids,
right?

555
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.920
And so what's amazing now is we see that level of sophistication and I've been

556
00:31:44.921 --> 00:31:48.520
able to take that and apply it to the NFL and you know,

557
00:31:48.521 --> 00:31:51.640
I mean not like hey we do thrusters,
we're going to be good the NFL,

558
00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:55.900
but really the principles and also it's given me the view of understanding all

559
00:31:55.901 --> 00:31:57.790
the corners that were missing,
right?

560
00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.990
That you have to have the corners of your range of motion and capacities.

561
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.800
Otherwise we're going to have issues.
What do you mean by corners?
Well,

562
00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.330
sort of the edge cases like this is the 10% case.

563
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.620
More like show me that you actually,

564
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.680
you don't have 85% ish of your shoulder range,

565
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:19.710
but you have stability and capacity in the fullest end ranges.

566
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.170
So in the corners of your range of motion,
right?

567
00:32:23.171 --> 00:32:26.740
So all the way overhead is one of those corners.
Have my arm over my head.

568
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.940
Like if you're not,

569
00:32:27.941 --> 00:32:31.960
if you can't hold two dumbbells over your head with your arms,
like straight,

570
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.810
like you're hand holding like hammers and your rib cage down,

571
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.710
that's an incomplete position and it's that position that's costing you when you

572
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.780
swim is that position with costing you when you throw a ball,

573
00:32:41.781 --> 00:32:44.210
it's that inefficiency that's costing when you fall.

574
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.740
Now we have a way of really understanding and what I've been able to do is for

575
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:52.700
me,
I've been able to repurpose crossfit into the greatest diagnostic tool ever.

576
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:55.400
And it's independent of you breathing heart,
right?

577
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.400
The intensity is an important piece that other people don't understand.

578
00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:02.870
So the GPP that everyone has been talking about for a gazillion years,

579
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:06.590
general physical parents,
the Russians I think invented that word,
right?
And they,

580
00:33:06.591 --> 00:33:09.200
and they got into their like,
you have to be able to jump off a ladder,

581
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.450
you without your knees wobbling.

582
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.080
That was a really simple way of just loading a squat.
Right?
That was,

583
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:18.290
that's what that was.
It's not mystical.
You know,

584
00:33:18.291 --> 00:33:21.200
what we said for a long time was,
you know,
get your kid in gymnastics,

585
00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:22.670
that's really good.
We'll make good athletes were,
look,

586
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:26.120
what the fuck does that matter?
Like really tell me why.
Well,

587
00:33:26.121 --> 00:33:26.954
it turns out that the,

588
00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:31.640
the things that you have to be able to do in gymnastics teach you certain

589
00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:35.150
positions and principles that you can then apply it.
Use your skeleton,

590
00:33:35.151 --> 00:33:39.260
not just your muscles.
Yes.
And then we can get away with,
you know,

591
00:33:39.261 --> 00:33:42.770
big muscle bound guys to get their asses kicked,
you know,
like,
you know,

592
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.630
or the little skinny cardio whippet who falls apart,

593
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.350
can't lift 60 kilos off the ground when they're breathing a little bit hard.

594
00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:51.270
Like those are both ends of the spectrum that aren't good.
What,

595
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:55.430
you mentioned nutrition and I've got a bunch of a bunch of questions,

596
00:33:55.431 --> 00:33:57.590
but uh,
in,
in brief,

597
00:33:57.591 --> 00:34:02.030
what would you say are the most common nutrition mistakes or,
uh,

598
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:09.260
let's see,
detrimental beliefs that crossfitters have?
Well,

599
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.310
this is the first for a lot of us,
me included,
you know,
I'd actually heard,

600
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.880
you know,
the zone was the first thing that you know,

601
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.180
that Greg talked about as well.

602
00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.910
Back when I was first training in a crossfit mine,

603
00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.110
I think I've told you this before,

604
00:34:24.111 --> 00:34:26.870
but back when the Santa Cruz guys would come to mountain view to train at the

605
00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:29.570
health Gracie gas,
it was all about the zone.

606
00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:33.320
And I remember training with those guys.
Well,
and so again,
let's,

607
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.490
let's get to understanding why that mattered.

608
00:34:37.491 --> 00:34:42.010
Because People's macronutrients there combinations in terms of what they were

609
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:45.500
eating was way,
way out of,
was wacky,

610
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.310
not eating any fat,
not barely getting enough protein,

611
00:34:49.311 --> 00:34:50.690
massive amounts of carbohydrate.

612
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:54.500
And that was the first way we could just identify the problem,
right?
So,

613
00:34:54.501 --> 00:34:57.380
but then we started measuring and Langston and we had an idea of what roughly

614
00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:00.440
we're taking it.
And to this day I look at a bed and I'm like three blocks,

615
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.790
you know,
that's 30 grams of carbohydrate that you know,
like,
uh,
it's been useful.

616
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:08.250
It's like a unit,
like a metric unit,
right?
That's a kilometer.
That's a meter,

617
00:35:08.251 --> 00:35:11.540
right?
It gives me a baseline of understanding how much food I need to be eating.

618
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.740
But then,
and it was always about food quality.

619
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.560
That was always an important conversation.
But then people would be like,
well,

620
00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:23.210
I can eat this bacon and drink this beer and I'm still in the zone.

621
00:35:23.211 --> 00:35:26.910
And it was a room I come on,
you know?
And so what,

622
00:35:26.911 --> 00:35:31.310
what happened then was that we saw this Paleo revolution wash over the

623
00:35:31.311 --> 00:35:35.300
crossfitter.
So I were like,
and I,
the first time I said this to my wife,
Juliet,

624
00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:36.650
bless her little heart,
was like,

625
00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:39.330
she googles on line because Juliet is the biggest skeptic.
And she was like,

626
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.010
this is some bullshit.
I'm like,
what?
She's like,

627
00:35:41.011 --> 00:35:45.630
the first thing that came up was a hornet's nest soup.
Like wasp nest soup.
Kelly.

628
00:35:45.631 --> 00:35:47.970
She's like,
that's what you fucking mean.
And I was like,
I don't,

629
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:52.980
I think it means no grains,
you know,
and we should eat vegetables.
And she's like,

630
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.340
this is some bullshit.
But that was really,
again,

631
00:35:56.341 --> 00:36:01.030
a conversation about food quality.
Right?
Well.
Then we saw this rubber bushing,

632
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.040
Juliet.
Literally,
it's just not the greatest bullshit detector.

633
00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:07.020
Thank you everyone.
Everyone's get yourself a Juliet.

634
00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:12.060
But then what we saw was that everyone got super squeaky clean,

635
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.020
like didn't even use salt,
and I was like,
Oh,
you know,
salt is really useful.

636
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.200
I saw a bunch of my friends who cleaned up their diet and they were,

637
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.830
they literally tanked like they were blacking out because they weren't getting

638
00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:27.060
any salts ever.
Like we,
there's this thing called salt.
It's amazing.

639
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.920
Humans invented the salt routes forehead,
right?
It,

640
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:34.950
I read a study on primates and why humans are so fund of Fructose,

641
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.230
the naturally occurring sugar in fruit and why it's so problematic to have,

642
00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:42.210
say high fructose corn syrup or Gabi Nectar.

643
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:44.880
It's like 75% plus fructose and we get fatty liver disease.

644
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.970
When we were migrating apes,

645
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:54.020
the way that we would sustain higher blood pressure without salt was with fruit.

646
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:59.250
Oh,
isn't that make perfect sense?
Yeah,
it makes perfect sense.
But yeah,
salt,

647
00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.370
guess what folks?
Pretty important or like blood pressure.
It's so important.

648
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:04.650
Like Stacy sims is a good homey of ours,
right?

649
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.500
She is a exercise physiologist out of Stanford.

650
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:12.650
She's been exercise physio to the best athletes on the planet best,

651
00:37:12.961 --> 00:37:15.360
especially the best aerobic athletes.
But she assists everyone.

652
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.960
Her company is called Osmo nutrition.
And Her thinking about hydration is vital,

653
00:37:19.961 --> 00:37:23.340
but she's like,
hey,
there's this stuff called sea salt.
Take a pinch of it,

654
00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:27.300
throw it in your water and quit being a jerk and diluting yourself.
I,
you know,

655
00:37:27.301 --> 00:37:29.790
not diluting,
diluting.
Right?

656
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:35.090
And what we've seen is that people are not applying the lessons of that we've

657
00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:39.840
learned in sport for the last 2030 40 years to day to day life.

658
00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.530
So people got really squeaky clean and they could not eat enough carbohydrate to

659
00:37:43.531 --> 00:37:46.560
support the level of training that we're doing.
Right?

660
00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:48.480
And all the endurance athletes were like,
dude,

661
00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:53.250
you can't eat a hundred grams of carbohydrate a day and expect to thrive and or

662
00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:57.360
just be a Keto adapted athlete.
I'm like,
yeah,
that works if I have to do it.

663
00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.880
But man,
that's,
that's not working for me.
So well,

664
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:04.070
you have to be very meticulous genetics to really support that,
you know,

665
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:07.980
and like boot,
oh I,
I looked at some sugar,
now I'm not keto adapted.
Right.

666
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:12.180
And you know,
the key is always,

667
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:15.330
and this has always been the crossfit HQ position for one,

668
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.660
number one eat enough carbohydrate to support exercise.
Well,

669
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:21.240
I've taken a finally figured out what that means.
Right?

670
00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:24.930
And that's a fluctuating norm,
you know,

671
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.470
and also in the last 10 years we have figured out,
for example,

672
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:33.950
through the miraculousness of blood testing of genetic testing,

673
00:38:34.321 --> 00:38:37.720
like we can actually get that stuff now done pretty easily.
It turns out,

674
00:38:37.721 --> 00:38:38.410
for example,

675
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:43.410
I'm going to Roebuck responder means big aerobic workouts caused my body to be

676
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:47.350
like in Nirvana and power athletes stuff.

677
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.970
I have to train that stuff of course.

678
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.870
But that is not where I should be making my money.
Why my genetics tell me.

679
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.660
And it's interesting that any success I've had as an athlete,

680
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:58.960
I basically have been swimming against that stream my whole life.
Right.
Well,

681
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:02.560
my genetics also tell me that I don't process saturated fats very well.

682
00:39:02.561 --> 00:39:06.640
And they call it lean Paleo,
which means eat high quality food,
Kelly,

683
00:39:06.641 --> 00:39:08.320
but you don't need bacon every day.

684
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.540
I don't eat bacon everyday and I don't eat nuts.

685
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.570
Cause when I do my cholesterol goes through the roof.

686
00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:15.700
And I know we can be sophisticate about cholesterol,

687
00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:19.930
but when your cholesterol is 400,
like there's something up,
right.
That's not,

688
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.740
you know,
and I had a bunch of friends,
galleries in a whopper.
That's right.

689
00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:27.490
So I think that's the,
what we found is that people have gone back to rice.

690
00:39:27.491 --> 00:39:29.290
They've gone back to,
you know,
hey,

691
00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:34.291
I've got a source my carbohydrate intelligently in order to support the amount

692
00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:37.600
of training I'm doing.
And that was,
that was,
I think a reaction.

693
00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:39.460
People are less afraid of gluten.

694
00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.710
I think they're really try to stay away from it.
You know,

695
00:39:41.711 --> 00:39:44.440
maybe that's just Monsanto that's talking there,
but uh,
you know,

696
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.340
that's how you're gonna have to edit that out.
Sorry to no,
no,
no.

697
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.890
They'll send a letter about the house,
not mine.
Just kidding.
I love you.

698
00:39:50.891 --> 00:39:55.540
Must not tell that one.
You know what's funny about weeds?

699
00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:58.100
Nothing's funny about weeds.
So no,
the,
the,

700
00:39:58.101 --> 00:40:01.990
the bottom line is I think we've seen that correction,
but once again,

701
00:40:01.991 --> 00:40:04.690
we should take that lesson from the highest level sport.

702
00:40:04.691 --> 00:40:09.610
That's what coaches are trying to do.
Distill principles,
not methods.

703
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.280
And also I think particularly when it comes to Macros,

704
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:17.260
is know thyself and know thy sport or training load.

705
00:40:17.261 --> 00:40:20.500
Right.
So Pete a Tia,
Dr [inaudible] who you've met,

706
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:22.870
have you ever spent any time with who you have to meet this guy?

707
00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:25.760
You guys would love each other,
but uh,
he was on the podcast.

708
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:30.080
We talked about cancer research,
but he's also,
he would,
is he the,

709
00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:34.060
he's the sugar cancer connection guy?
Well,
I,
he would talk about that certainly.

710
00:40:34.061 --> 00:40:38.950
But he is a,
he was a former oncology researcher.

711
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.560
He's also been a surgeon and he's a high level,

712
00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:45.160
he would not want me to say high level,
but he's a high level endurance athlete,

713
00:40:45.161 --> 00:40:47.740
you know,
a hundred mile swims and things like that.
Well,
that high level.

714
00:40:47.741 --> 00:40:52.280
And he's also,
but he's also very strong for his,
for his bodyweight.
And he,

715
00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:54.760
he loves doing time trials for cycling.

716
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:58.810
And so he is almost always Quito adoptees and Coteau sis.

717
00:40:58.811 --> 00:41:01.750
For those people who haven't heard my conversation with Peta Tiaa,

718
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:06.520
all that means is you're,
you're,
you're utilizing fat.

719
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:10.210
This is highly simplified but fat instead of glucose as,
as your primary fuel.

720
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.190
And when he's doing these intense rides though,
he,

721
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:19.200
he knows exactly his respiratory quotient when he kicks over to anaerobic and

722
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.710
how many calories he can consume and how many calories is his liver can store so

723
00:41:23.711 --> 00:41:27.160
that he never comes out of Ketosis.
So he can be pounding gels,
but he's like,

724
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:29.020
okay,
I know that my liver at my body weight,

725
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.560
I'm going to store about 400 calories of carbohydrates based on based this

726
00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.380
target distance and this target,
wattage,
et cetera.

727
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.460
I can end my race and still be in Ketosis or my time trial.
Uh,

728
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:43.160
but that's because my problem with that of course,
is that that's true.

729
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.030
And he is the freakish outlier.
Nobody's going to do data right.

730
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.750
And very few people are going to do that.
Um,
that's amazing.
But,
but what's,

731
00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:55.610
what's fascinating is,
um,
so yeah,
the Paleo,
the Paleo community.

732
00:41:55.611 --> 00:41:56.570
What are,
what are other,

733
00:41:56.571 --> 00:42:00.060
are there any other common dietary mistakes that you feel?
People,

734
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:01.970
terrible round water.

735
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:06.590
The coffee has been the cult like black fluid,
what do we call it?

736
00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:09.680
The Cup of fear.
Cup of fear,
cover fair.
And uh,
you know,
people are like,

737
00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:13.670
I don't need a drink.
Water,
drink coffee all day long.
And then this kill cliff,

738
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.580
you know,
which is an amazing crossfit soda,
you know,

739
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:19.550
that it's not related to crossfit,
but it's sponsored by some crop.
Anyway,

740
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.010
you get the idea.
It's amazing with vodka too,
by the way,

741
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:25.820
but which is also can be gluten free.
So you're still paleo,
it's fine.

742
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:31.460
But I think what we're seeing is that,
you know,
you can eat,
here's,

743
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.540
here's what's crucial.

744
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.870
You can be at 80% of your function and come in and do relatively okay once you

745
00:42:38.601 --> 00:42:40.850
move.
Well,
once you've been doing this for a while,

746
00:42:40.851 --> 00:42:44.530
you can just be on the edges of your sleep on the,
you know,
borderline,

747
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:48.470
eat some extra ice cream,
you know,
budge a little bit,
you know,

748
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.460
not deal with stress done,
but of course we know all of those things.

749
00:42:52.461 --> 00:42:53.241
I've got to keep an eye on.

750
00:42:53.241 --> 00:42:57.890
This is what a physical practices and what we've seen then is for me,

751
00:42:57.891 --> 00:43:00.290
it's important that you're actually signing up for a race.

752
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.040
You're signing up for an event.
The gym is not the event.

753
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.420
This is the place where we train and yes,

754
00:43:05.421 --> 00:43:09.980
it feels like competition to hear because I,
it's intense.
It's deep practice.

755
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.630
Daniel.
Cool.
Thank you.
It's,
it's me really,
really practicing.

756
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.950
Telecode that's right.
Nice Dude.
Uh,
it's,
it's deep intention.

757
00:43:18.951 --> 00:43:20.570
It's harder aerobic conditioning,

758
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:25.820
but it's still not the same thing as stepping into a ring or of lining up on a

759
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:27.530
five k or signing up.

760
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:32.390
And what you realize is how important all those aspects of our to your,
your,

761
00:43:32.391 --> 00:43:35.030
your training,
you have to eat.
Right.
That's why I'm like,
look,

762
00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.640
the crossfit is doing it because it does the crossfit open,

763
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:42.560
which is the biggest sporting event in the history of mankind.
That's what it is.

764
00:43:42.561 --> 00:43:44.600
Every year,
more people sign up for the crossfit open,

765
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:48.940
they do five workouts and then,
and it's a big international competition,
right?

766
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.990
It's a virtual game.
It's a virtual games basically.
It's a,

767
00:43:50.991 --> 00:43:55.520
it's a feeder to regionals.
So you know,
whether you like it or not,
I'm like,

768
00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:00.500
why don't you do it and for no other reason then why don't you have something

769
00:44:00.501 --> 00:44:04.970
hanging over your head for five weeks in a row?
Because that's really,

770
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:09.800
which also gives you a target other than the next more phase Wad.

771
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:13.190
Yes.
It's a,
you can actually decide what the optimal diet is.

772
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.580
Given that five week goal,
you just make a whole bunch of different decisions.

773
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:20.360
You know what,
when they say,
I mean deadlines focus the mind,
you know,

774
00:44:20.361 --> 00:44:24.020
Mr deadline guy and uh,
he'll stay up all night because you realize you're like,

775
00:44:24.021 --> 00:44:27.830
wow,
it really does force.
You know,
you're thinking about this.

776
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.350
And I think that's,
that's what sometimes gets lost in the crossfit gym.

777
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:35.280
Initially it was terrifying.
I didn't know if I was going to survive.

778
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.460
Let me give an example.
When I started this thing 10 years ago,

779
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:42.930
Adrian Bosman who was a,
you know,
crossfit headquarters,
Uber Manch right.

780
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.520
And,
and he was one of our first coaches.
I did all the coaching.
We,

781
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.490
this was all unknown.
There were,
we were the 27th Crossfit,

782
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.730
I think officially 50th now like 27 on the list.
How many are there total?

783
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:57.990
11,000 roughly.
Which is a revolution.
You,
I mean it's not a gimmick.

784
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:03.140
And what ends up happening was there was a workout that was snatch 135 pounds 30

785
00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:06.870
times Adriana and I didn't know we could do it.

786
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:11.310
We didn't know anyone who had done it except like Olympic lifters,
you know,

787
00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:14.700
who would like seriously trained and we're strong.
And one day we're like,

788
00:45:14.701 --> 00:45:15.570
we're going to do this.

789
00:45:15.571 --> 00:45:20.571
Even if it takes us all day and like we psych ourselves up and like now they

790
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.820
throw that as like an after effect.
You can do that in 90 seconds.
I mean,

791
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:28.821
things have changed dramatically in 10 years because w you know,

792
00:45:28.861 --> 00:45:30.300
it's like the four minute mile,
everyone's like,
oh,

793
00:45:30.301 --> 00:45:32.040
you're still running a four minute miles is so quaint.

794
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:36.810
We're in the one minute mile now.
And um,
but you know,
10 years we didn't know.

795
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:40.910
And so now we're starting to see that,
you know,
what's,
what's possible.
Yeah,

796
00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:44.210
for sure.
Coming back to this notch for a second.
Um,

797
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:50.300
so I've never been a a practitioner of Olympic lifts for a whole host of

798
00:45:51.301 --> 00:45:51.631
reasons,

799
00:45:51.631 --> 00:45:55.980
but primarily because I had reconstructive shoulder surgery in 2004 doing a

800
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.220
silly stuff like grappling that made my arm straight out of the front of my

801
00:45:59.221 --> 00:46:01.790
chest.
And maybe you should have been Olympic with this,
so maybe I should have.

802
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.970
So I had a lot of apprehension about spitefully sound like terminal,

803
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.680
it's going to overhead last 15,
20 degrees.
And uh,

804
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.780
but I found a lot of value,

805
00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:15.300
particularly in the last six months or so with focusing on overhead squatting

806
00:46:15.301 --> 00:46:19.080
movements.
Yeah.
Still not to the point where I'm going to do snatches.
Uh,

807
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:23.070
and I think that's where I've become smarter over the years is recognizing that

808
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:27.240
you can,
you can really refine that movement patterns.

809
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:32.010
I don't have the go heavy go big or go home mentality anymore that I used to

810
00:46:32.011 --> 00:46:37.010
because the,
the risk benefits so unfavorable to me.
But uh,

811
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.490
why is rich Froning so good at the snatch and what are the common mistakes that

812
00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:45.600
people make with that movement?
Well,
rich has excellent mechanics,

813
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.250
has full range of motion,
his ankles,

814
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:53.020
his excellent shoulder range and understanding of stability.
He's able to get me,

815
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.480
he just does things that are naturally important.
A snatching.

816
00:46:57.481 --> 00:47:02.000
He does them effortlessly in terms of getting his torso upright.
His history,

817
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.500
obviously it's a lot of training stimulus and these things,

818
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:09.120
but he understands how to create stable shapes and he's able to get into those

819
00:47:09.121 --> 00:47:12.530
shapes who doesn't have to work very hard.
The,
the,

820
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.900
the work he does goes into it's,
he gets 100% benefit from that.

821
00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:19.680
He doesn't have to,
he's not working at 80% of 70% efficiency.

822
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.770
Does that make sense?
That makes sense.
He's,
he's working hard on the shapes.

823
00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:27.990
What you,
what you discovered though is I think underlying the center,

824
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.380
you know it's a part of the functional movement screen since 1986 Dan John is

825
00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:37.090
like all we see all this throw her say I wish I had overhead squat more Glassman

826
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:37.481
valued.

827
00:47:37.481 --> 00:47:40.900
It is like the one of the most important capacities and in fact one of the

828
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.030
earliest best crossfit workouts,

829
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.200
I think it's called Nancy and it's run 400 meters.
So innocuous,
right?

830
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:51.050
And then just overhead squat 95 pounds,
15 times like I'm sick.

831
00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:55.250
Like that's pink a weight,
but just 15 tenths,
400 meters doesn't some,

832
00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.420
Pete didn't know if you don't have to overhead squat 1595 pounds,

833
00:47:58.421 --> 00:48:01.060
15 times run 400 meters and then just do that.

834
00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:04.690
Oh I said just do that like five times and what you're going to see where they

835
00:48:04.691 --> 00:48:07.180
quickly is when it happens,

836
00:48:07.181 --> 00:48:09.910
like everyone can fake it for three,

837
00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.900
but then as you start to fatigue or your,
your,
your,

838
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:18.160
your positions aren't robust,
you bounce off the tent,

839
00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.250
you're no longer have access.
Right.
And you know,
you start,

840
00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:22.570
the world gets really small.

841
00:48:22.571 --> 00:48:26.400
And then you start suffering and then you eventually Labrador retriever in the

842
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:30.640
close sliding door.
That's true factory.
So you know,

843
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:35.700
I think what is key is understanding what are the salient positions.

844
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:38.440
You know,
all we're doing,
we say overhead squad is,

845
00:48:38.441 --> 00:48:41.590
I'm saying show me you can squat with your torso upright and that looks a lot

846
00:48:41.591 --> 00:48:46.240
like sport,
doesn't it?
And if you have to lean forward where the far to do that,

847
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:49.870
then it says you have incomplete hip and ankle function and you don't know how

848
00:48:49.871 --> 00:48:54.520
to create stability in your trunk.
And that is a very powerful idea.
Right.

849
00:48:54.521 --> 00:48:58.390
And what's nice about the overhead squat is,
I call it a category when movement,

850
00:48:58.391 --> 00:49:02.770
I can get very organized and I can grind down to a position where either either

851
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.380
we agree that it's full range of motion or not,
or two,

852
00:49:05.381 --> 00:49:07.090
I start to lose position and come back up.

853
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:11.170
What I've removed out of it as the element of speed.
So for my nine year old,

854
00:49:11.171 --> 00:49:14.950
for example,
Georgia,
the overhead squat is something we do all the time.

855
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:18.640
Sometimes we just bring the little kitty barbell into the,
into the living room.

856
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.320
If she goes to bed or even less,

857
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.410
maybe 10 pounds and she just has to do three sets of five.

858
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.660
Why it's practicing the shape,

859
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.590
practicing the position and that's where we're going to get bang for the buck.

860
00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:31.870
Do you,
you can pull,
you don't need a snatch heavy.

861
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:36.850
Do you think should be any cross fitters focus on working out and not
practicing?

862
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:40.660
Well,
totally and I would say that that let,
let's,

863
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.980
let's take it out across it for a second and let's put it into running.
Sure.

864
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.480
Running is a very,

865
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:51.400
very technical skill that we should be developing from a very early age and

866
00:49:51.401 --> 00:49:52.240
there are only like what,

867
00:49:52.241 --> 00:49:55.720
30 million renters in America through who run three times a week and only 80% of

868
00:49:55.721 --> 00:49:59.560
them are injured in a year.
That's like the worst statistic ever.
Listen,

869
00:49:59.561 --> 00:50:03.160
if you're listening to this,
do not let your children run.
It's dangerous.
Comma,

870
00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.560
if you're a runner and running is the f one,

871
00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:06.790
one of the things that makes us human,

872
00:50:06.791 --> 00:50:09.760
you should be able to run that is one of the tenants of being a good athlete.

873
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:14.140
In fact,
looked at the NFL combine for example,
they jump right?

874
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.560
They have to bench press,
which is a joke.
That's the one piece.
It's a joke,

875
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:20.410
but everything else is a run drill,
change direction,
Jill.

876
00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:24.430
It's about fluency and economy of running and changing mechanics.

877
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:28.550
No wonder a couple of years in crossfit put this big like you know cone drill

878
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.040
thing in there because they were like,
hey look this thing,

879
00:50:31.041 --> 00:50:33.710
you should be really competent in that and you're going to get punished if you

880
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:35.750
suck at it.
So if we look at most people's running,

881
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.330
how much actual skill development did they do in running?

882
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:41.810
You mean besides tying your shoes next?
None.
None.

883
00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:44.510
And they just start running less year with say a Joe to Franco,

884
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:47.270
planning on being in the NFL combine.
And he's like,

885
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:48.620
actually if you're right handed,

886
00:50:48.621 --> 00:50:52.070
you should switch your feet this way because you cut one step at a shuttle run

887
00:50:52.071 --> 00:50:55.070
and then wow,
now you're a super fan.
Joe Does a whole bunch of stuff about being,

888
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.470
do you have the positions to run?
Like for me,

889
00:50:57.471 --> 00:51:02.360
the most dangerous sport to middle aged men is a track workout.
Oh my God.

890
00:51:02.361 --> 00:51:02.891
So dangerous.

891
00:51:02.891 --> 00:51:06.530
Like you're just asking for a pulled hamstring or torn cap because you're at the

892
00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:07.940
end ranges and when you start,

893
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:11.180
your back starts to deflect because you can't buffer,
you're,
you know,

894
00:51:11.181 --> 00:51:14.400
you're huge engine brand.
Then you have a neuro mechanical compromise.

895
00:51:14.401 --> 00:51:17.030
Tear hamstring.
It's the same thing happens in basketball.

896
00:51:17.031 --> 00:51:19.130
We don't even talk about what the end,

897
00:51:19.131 --> 00:51:22.970
what do you have the required range of motion to run?
Yes or no?

898
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.060
And resoundingly the answer is Hell No.

899
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:29.210
And do we do any skills or drills about improving economy?
No.

900
00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.810
So what ends up happening of course,
is that we should,

901
00:51:32.811 --> 00:51:37.100
and what's what I can tell you that I see is that I see very,

902
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:41.480
very intelligent coaches practicing skills,
teaching skills,

903
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:45.560
and then challenging those skills in a workout.
And that is good programming.

904
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:49.310
So if I am getting to a point where I'm comfortable with overhead squatting with

905
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:53.300
the barbell and can that never happens by the way,
cause it always,

906
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:57.830
it always gets worse.
Well,
I've,
I've,
uh,
you should have,

907
00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:01.590
I'll send you some photos.
They're hilarious.
Uh,
the,
uh,

908
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:06.290
if I'm considering going into say,
training for the snatch,

909
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:11.240
what are common mistakes that I should be aware of that I should avoid?
Well,

910
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:16.250
you know,
we have basically been able to break those fundamental positions down.

911
00:52:16.251 --> 00:52:19.500
So how about this?
Show me that you can actually put,
you know,

912
00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.310
just put some tens on the bark,
right?
A women's bar.
Make it a really light,

913
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.190
you know,
but it could be that you can a little bit,
hey,

914
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:29.690
they're called dwarf hands.
All right.
Yeah.
And,
and one of the issues is,
you know,

915
00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:32.690
show me,
you can keep your back flat and actually get to the bar.

916
00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.120
And what you're going to see is that people can't do that.
Get to the bunk.

917
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.890
Getting to the bar.
Yeah,
no,
no.
Just get into the setup position for the garden.

918
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:43.250
And what you're going to find is that people can't even get into a decent setup

919
00:52:43.251 --> 00:52:46.100
position without rounding the back and dumping their shoulders.

920
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.040
And then we start asking the question,
what the hell are we doing?

921
00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:53.660
Your setup position is so set up cheating that bottom.
Can you show me?

922
00:52:53.661 --> 00:52:56.840
You put your hands in a snatch grip and then sit all the way down on your,

923
00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.690
on your ankles,
right?
Sit down and get into a good position.

924
00:52:59.691 --> 00:53:01.430
What you're gonna find is that people,
university can't do that.

925
00:53:01.431 --> 00:53:03.800
So suddenly I've learned something about myself.

926
00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:08.960
Why do all the best coaches teach from the hang while we teach from the hang?

927
00:53:08.961 --> 00:53:10.940
Then I take that portion out of it.

928
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:15.940
I can derive a lot of the benefits from snatching without taking you to these

929
00:53:15.981 --> 00:53:17.180
compromised shapes.

930
00:53:17.181 --> 00:53:21.260
And the problem is I know you can snatch from that compromise shape,

931
00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:25.070
but that's not the shape we all agree is the best shape does that make?

932
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:27.810
So if you can't even get all the way down to the bar,

933
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.210
an issue of technique is never,

934
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:34.080
we're never going to solve this because you're making basic type one errors from

935
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:38.160
the first inch off the ground floor in centimeters cause everything's in kilos

936
00:53:38.161 --> 00:53:40.440
in Olympic lifting.
Let me ask you,

937
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:43.620
I want to put you on the spot for a second cause I've always wanted to ask you

938
00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:46.470
this and I'm not sure why I haven't.
Uh,
yes,
these are my real calves.

939
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:51.330
They're not Catholic.
I was curious about your testicles all surreal.

940
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:57.420
No,
it's just the left.
I noticed you only put one in.
Just testing it out.
Uh,

941
00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:00.560
the uh,
if you worked,

942
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:05.130
if you had to remove three common exercises from crossfit gyms in the interest

943
00:54:05.131 --> 00:54:07.650
of safety,
what would they be?

944
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:11.370
So if you had two gun against the head,

945
00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:15.490
well it doesn't have to be three,
three.
Let me deconstruct that for a second.

946
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.930
And that's crucial because first and foremost,

947
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.850
all the movements in the training language are inherently safe.

948
00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:27.990
If you have full range of motion in the motor control of doom,
right?

949
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.020
So presumably though you get a thousand people come in,

950
00:54:31.021 --> 00:54:34.650
there are certain exercises where a higher percentage of those people will lack

951
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.980
that prerequisite.

952
00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:40.980
But the number one most dangerous skill bench press and why?

953
00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:44.430
Because people don't have any internal rotation of their shoulder.

954
00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:46.500
They've pinned there back down,
right?

955
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:50.820
Let's you can press all day long standing overhead,
military press press,

956
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:52.830
you're going to fail safely.

957
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.670
When you fail in a bench press that shoulders is,

958
00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.320
it's going to translate forward.
There's your labor on those.

959
00:54:59.321 --> 00:55:03.090
You can you bench rest safely?
Yes.
Do we love floor pressing in our gym?

960
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:06.090
Absolutely.
We floor press a ton,

961
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.900
but what I find is that people do not have the basic mechanics and that's one of

962
00:55:09.901 --> 00:55:13.370
the ways that we've gotten our head that we define like you know,

963
00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:17.610
we define strike how much you bench,
you know,
how much you bench.
You know,

964
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:21.690
my friend Mark Bell,
then just over 900,
our friend Mark Bell,

965
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:26.130
our friend Mark Sally.
And uh,
you know,
that's an amazing amount.

966
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:29.850
And what I will tell you is that it's his positions and mechanics.

967
00:55:29.851 --> 00:55:34.510
It is so technical.
Like I think I once it became hyper-technical and all sorts,

968
00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:36.630
the assistants work and everything that he does related to it,

969
00:55:36.631 --> 00:55:37.770
it's so sophisticated.

970
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:42.600
I think f after knowing mark and Jesse Burdick for several years,
I fee,

971
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:46.260
I feel like I finally learned how to bench press even though I've been

972
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.320
benchpressing since I was what,
like a man,
I came out like,

973
00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.490
like my testicles drop and they handed me a bench press,
you know.
And uh,

974
00:55:52.491 --> 00:55:54.210
so I mean I've said I pulled the bench out of that.

975
00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.160
I also will pull the rings out rings.

976
00:55:56.161 --> 00:56:01.161
And the reason is what we see is that people can do movements that looked like

977
00:56:02.251 --> 00:56:04.110
ring dips.
They go up and down,

978
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:08.130
but they don't lock out the shoulders in terrible positions.

979
00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:10.620
And what we value is them doing work,
going up and down.

980
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:13.380
But if we put the rings back in for Stability Work,

981
00:56:13.381 --> 00:56:17.850
show me you have a good start position and finish position.
Like here's what,

982
00:56:17.851 --> 00:56:18.510
here's what I promise.

983
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:21.870
Like the TRX is a great piece of home equipment like you can,

984
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.520
one of the things that I'm a big fan of,

985
00:56:24.521 --> 00:56:29.140
it's understanding that if your hands are on the ground doing a pushup,
right,

986
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.240
then you can cheat off the ground.

987
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.550
You have what I call a closed torque environment.

988
00:56:33.551 --> 00:56:37.900
If you grew up a barbell that's close,
close Torque,
it's basically a circuit,

989
00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:38.201
right?

990
00:56:38.201 --> 00:56:42.250
And I can create stability off that in really strange positions cause I can

991
00:56:42.251 --> 00:56:45.670
still join the rending the bar.
That's right.
I should be bending the bar,

992
00:56:45.671 --> 00:56:49.030
but I can still bend the bar even though my body's and really strange shapes,

993
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:53.140
as soon as they put a dumbbell in your hand,
you can't do that in different game.

994
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.370
Right?
That's why kettlebells are so important.

995
00:56:55.371 --> 00:56:59.260
My dumbbells are so important because they,
I call it an open torque system.

996
00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:02.620
I have to create all the stability at the big primary engine.

997
00:57:02.621 --> 00:57:07.330
I can't cheat it up through the chain.
And so why are ring so important?
Well,

998
00:57:07.331 --> 00:57:08.470
one of the reasons rings,

999
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:13.530
dips are important is because they forced me to show my hand what's really going

1000
00:57:13.661 --> 00:57:16.720
on at the shoulder and an open torque environment.
The problem.

1001
00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:21.190
So one of the reasons this TRX is great is that you're basically taking really

1002
00:57:21.191 --> 00:57:25.210
simple movements and being able to apply this.
I'm in a strap,

1003
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:28.820
I'm hanging right?
And I can't cheat anymore,
right?
Because I,

1004
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:31.930
if I'm disorganized at the shoulder,
I don't,
I don't try to force.
So,

1005
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:36.330
but the problem is with the rings that you can still cheat yourself in

1006
00:57:36.331 --> 00:57:39.910
internally and try road into an terribly internally rotated position,

1007
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:44.400
cranking your neck back and you can still go up and down until you can't.
And um,

1008
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.160
and remember the gym is a diagnostic tool should be figuring out what's going
on.

1009
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:49.810
I think the shoulder,

1010
00:57:49.811 --> 00:57:54.811
we'll hand the hips will handle a lot more silly bs a lot longer than the

1011
00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:59.710
shoulder will.
Right?
If I had to pull out one more movement,

1012
00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:02.650
you know,
hand against the gun against the wall.

1013
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:07.250
I would say the butterfly Kipp only because I think it's,

1014
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.360
that's how I,
if you asked me to do a bunch of pullups,

1015
00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:10.930
guess what I'm going to do butterfly kit.

1016
00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.780
But I understand the principles and I have good range of motion.

1017
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:16.720
It's a completely safe position.

1018
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:19.660
But what we see is that people do not have,

1019
00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:22.030
I asked them to put their arms over their head for example.
Right?

1020
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:23.133
And they can't do it.

1021
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:27.370
And then so suddenly magically hanging from a bar is going to increase that

1022
00:58:27.371 --> 00:58:31.870
range of motion or they're going to compensate then swinging and lending.

1023
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.890
So what we do is we add speed to a bad position and then that's really the

1024
00:58:35.891 --> 00:58:40.580
recipe.
Capell goes the lion.
That's right once,
but once again,
you know,

1025
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.370
we program all that stuff on our gym,

1026
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:46.810
but you'll notice that we have a lot of static ring stations because what we saw

1027
00:58:46.811 --> 00:58:48.490
as well,
people can't even do,

1028
00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:50.590
you can't even get into the start position on the rings,

1029
00:58:50.591 --> 00:58:52.420
which is elbows locked out.

1030
00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:56.650
But squeeze thumbs turned out they can't even get into the finish position or

1031
00:58:56.651 --> 00:58:59.700
the start position.
So what are we talking about?
You know,

1032
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:04.020
what we're doing is we're ended up arguing about bullshit,
right?
You,

1033
00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.040
you can't even get into the bottom position of a snatch.

1034
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.980
Why are we talking about your snatch?
Right?

1035
00:59:08.981 --> 00:59:13.930
And I mean I'm getting into more gymnastics,
uh,
these days and uh,

1036
00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:15.310
know I want to be able to do it back tuck.

1037
00:59:15.311 --> 00:59:20.020
I've never been able to do a back tuck.
And really,
yeah,
attribute wise,

1038
00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:24.560
I have the attributes but it's a long story because I was obsessed with that
too.

1039
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:28.190
So I want to get to that point.
You can do that safely,

1040
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:32.240
but you can certainly do it very,
very unsafely or attempt to do it unsafely.

1041
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:35.450
And I think that the question of sequencing and how you put things in a proper

1042
00:59:35.451 --> 00:59:39.560
order from diagnostics to refinement to training,

1043
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:44.690
we have not given people the background or the language of how their bodies
work.

1044
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.770
You know,
I get to work with kids like children,

1045
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:53.090
like first graders in some kindergarteners in our swim team all the way up to

1046
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:57.530
master's Olympic athletes.
I mean,
like we,
I've see it all right?

1047
00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.910
And what I can tell you is that most along the way,

1048
01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.960
no one gets any formal training.
And the mistake has been always like,

1049
01:00:05.961 --> 01:00:08.150
I think crossfit is doing it more,
right?

1050
01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:12.110
The defrank goes gyms,
the Mike Boyle's,

1051
01:00:12.111 --> 01:00:16.220
the places like that are,
you know,
Shan Turley at Stanford.

1052
01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:21.221
There are pockets of really excellent thinkers who are teaching people how to

1053
01:00:21.501 --> 01:00:24.110
move.
And that's a specific thing,
right?

1054
01:00:24.111 --> 01:00:26.870
And that's not just jumping back and forth and chasing a bouncy ball.

1055
01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.370
That's very specific skills and challenging those skills with the things we

1056
01:00:31.371 --> 01:00:33.530
talked about.
So you know,

1057
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.060
what we've seen is a decentralized and cross for samples that could decentralize

1058
01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:40.370
Soviet sports system.
Why do we have 11,000 states?

1059
01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:44.330
And what you'll see is that kids will grow up through the crossroads system and

1060
01:00:44.331 --> 01:00:47.000
a generation and they will ha,
they'll already be like,

1061
01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.190
of course I'm going overhead squat.
What?
I mean,
why can't you overhead squat,

1062
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:53.390
you know what I mean?
And we'll solve a lot of problems.
But the,
the key pieces,

1063
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:58.450
we can't confuse exercising for full human capacity.

1064
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.410
That's,
that's the missing link.
And speaking of full human capacity,

1065
01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:06.860
if you look at the most elite crossfitters,
what are,

1066
01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.630
are there things that they do that the lower ranks do not commonalities that

1067
01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:14.420
you've observed that people can,

1068
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:16.700
can borrow or emulate or incorporated?

1069
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:21.050
You're saying that that top crossfitters that the bottom aren't doing that just

1070
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:25.730
the recreational?
Yeah,
like the top,
top,
core tile or decile.
They,
uh,

1071
01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:29.930
they all have,
most of them I know are obsessed with mechanics,
most of them,

1072
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:34.350
and really spend a lot of time refining that mechanics.
Um,

1073
01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.470
that's really,
you know,
their positions are more effortless.
Like there was a,
uh,

1074
01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:43.650
you know,
I this physical therapy instructor and she was like,
she,

1075
01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:46.640
she taught pediatrics and she's like,
let me be fucking clear.

1076
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.020
Muscles and tissues are like obedient dogs.
And I was like,

1077
01:01:51.021 --> 01:01:52.830
like my mind was like Douche.

1078
01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:56.270
Like this is coming from the pediatric physical therapist who was like,

1079
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.930
what the Hell's wrong with you?
Why?
You know,
why are you so stiff?
You know,

1080
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:02.840
and um,
you know,
in the,

1081
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:07.790
the key the we're doing synchronized stretches is,

1082
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:09.690
um,
the,

1083
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.040
the key is that people aren't spending enough time working on full position.

1084
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:19.530
And maybe it's because I have not made the case for it because what we've done

1085
01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:21.450
is we know you can get by at 80%,

1086
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:26.700
but show me you have full capacity because that's the thing that these top

1087
01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:29.090
athletes have.
I mean,
they obviously can work with the home,

1088
01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.120
meaning the corners of these position,
positional put full position,

1089
01:02:33.121 --> 01:02:36.270
and I always use this example,
but squat down with your feet together,

1090
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.880
keep your heels on the ground,
needs together.
Can you do that?
Yes or no.

1091
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:42.510
If he can't do that needs together all the way down,
chilling out in the bottom,

1092
01:02:42.511 --> 01:02:45.810
like we're on a campfire,
then you're missing full hip range of motion,

1093
01:02:45.811 --> 01:02:46.531
ankle range of motion.

1094
01:02:46.531 --> 01:02:50.670
One of those things is missing and that's the mechanism for your hip
impingement.

1095
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.300
That's the mechanism for your plantar Fasciitis,
for your Bunyan,

1096
01:02:54.301 --> 01:02:57.150
for your torn Achilles.
You know,
for years pulled Catholic.

1097
01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.680
That is the fucking problem.

1098
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.640
And you should be obsessing about this.
You know,

1099
01:03:02.641 --> 01:03:07.050
crossfit is like it's or any good modern strength conditioning system because

1100
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.370
we're not the only ones doing it now,

1101
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:13.530
but they force us into these shapes that are diagnostic.

1102
01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.930
You know,
and you know,

1103
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.830
if you've been around Pawel will then you probably have done a pistol at some

1104
01:03:19.831 --> 01:03:20.664
point.
Sure.

1105
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:25.760
That's because you have to be able to have that open torque control on your leg,

1106
01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.640
right?
That's how he gets away with not having to do lots of step ups.
Right.

1107
01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:33.180
Show me that you can squat up and down one leg with that strength and

1108
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:35.490
immediately you can tell if you have the ankle range of motion,

1109
01:03:35.491 --> 01:03:36.600
hip range of motion to do that.
Right.

1110
01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:39.810
So it's interesting that that got pulled into the language because it was so

1111
01:03:39.811 --> 01:03:42.280
diagnostic.
If,

1112
01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:47.560
if there were two or three movements that people listening to this could

1113
01:03:47.701 --> 01:03:52.701
videotape themselves performing for sort of maximal diagnostic value,

1114
01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:58.110
uh,
let's just say it's busy professional who's like,
Eh,
you know,

1115
01:03:58.111 --> 01:04:00.390
I'm probably letting go but I want to get back into training.

1116
01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:05.780
I want to be able to videotape myself at certain points just to see how screwed

1117
01:04:06.241 --> 01:04:09.030
up I am before I tried to do something I did when I was 20 years old.

1118
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.190
Is there anything in particular you'd recommend?
Well,

1119
01:04:11.191 --> 01:04:14.940
here's the problem with that is that you somehow devalue some of the other

1120
01:04:14.941 --> 01:04:18.180
positions.
And in,
in physical therapy school,

1121
01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.230
they had this great statement in there like test something you think you changed

1122
01:04:21.231 --> 01:04:23.010
and something you didn't think you changed.
And now it's like,

1123
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:27.360
so it turned on an amazing and then I was like,
well fuck,

1124
01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:30.840
it's my fucking shoulder and if I'm compromised on this end,

1125
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:34.950
I maybe don't have the intellectual capacity to understand how that compromises

1126
01:04:34.951 --> 01:04:37.560
me on the other side.
And so what,

1127
01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:42.420
what's crucial is that you can go from the start position.
So,
for example,

1128
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:46.260
you may not think that Olympic lifting is important to you as a swimmer,

1129
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:50.490
but Olympic lifting forces you all the time or swinging kettlebells into having

1130
01:04:50.491 --> 01:04:51.990
full internal rotation of your shoulder.

1131
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:54.930
So even just doing the Bergner warmup with a PVC pipe is,
um,

1132
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.690
he's an Olympic lifting coach.
You can Google Bergner warmup.

1133
01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:01.050
How do you spell his name?
It's like B,
u.
R.
G.
E.
N.
E.
R.

1134
01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:03.683
Got it.

1135
01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:09.290
And if Mike Bergner and if you just get into this high hang position,

1136
01:05:09.871 --> 01:05:14.010
like,
like you're doing like the robot dance out to the side,
right?
All the time,

1137
01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.950
you should be able to get your hand all the way down to your hip and your

1138
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.640
shoulders shouldn't twist forward.
So people are like,
oh,

1139
01:05:21.641 --> 01:05:22.510
I don't need to Olympic lift.

1140
01:05:22.511 --> 01:05:25.090
Well you should be able to snatch PVC pipe without hurting your shoulder.

1141
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:29.380
But those same people will go to the pool and not recognize that the finish

1142
01:05:29.381 --> 01:05:32.770
position for the crawl stroke is the same business,
same position.

1143
01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.280
And so what ends up happening then is in the swimming language,

1144
01:05:36.281 --> 01:05:39.280
if I'm missing that intern rotation at the end,

1145
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.970
that means my shoulder comes forward and that means my next stroke is

1146
01:05:42.971 --> 01:05:43.900
compromised.

1147
01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:48.790
And that's why you have to have full range on both ends of your shoulder.

1148
01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:49.660
Right?

1149
01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:53.620
Because I'm going to compromise and that's going to mess up my next start or my

1150
01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:58.480
next rep.
I've been amazed how much my entire physiology has changed.

1151
01:05:58.481 --> 01:06:02.440
Just focusing on terminal knee extension,
just like lay on your back,

1152
01:06:02.441 --> 01:06:05.500
put your legs straight up in the air,
pull your toes back,
straighten your legs,

1153
01:06:05.501 --> 01:06:08.800
and if he can't straighten them completely.
I was like,
wow,
my legs are shaking.

1154
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:12.780
Like you know,
I hadn't handed that over to two.

1155
01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:17.140
NFL is today who were were,
were,
were coming back from an ACL repair.

1156
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.600
That tea,
they sit all day long,

1157
01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:21.250
they're sending 14 hours a day and knees slightly bent.

1158
01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:24.550
They don't have that range.
Post to your chain is,
you know you should,

1159
01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:27.220
why can't you do a long sit?
You know,

1160
01:06:27.221 --> 01:06:29.830
last time you saw me I could barely do this and now I'm like,

1161
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.450
that's right out to the one of the things that you,
the truth,

1162
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:37.450
Pr Lifetime,
one of the,

1163
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:41.860
one of the truths is that you know we're always talking about putting the hip

1164
01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.470
back into the socket.
Like that's the capsule stretch.

1165
01:06:44.471 --> 01:06:48.160
That's four hour body stuff.
Definitely,
but what you figured out was,
boy,
if I,

1166
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:52.000
if I have some more,
some load,
my legs are up and I put some load to that,

1167
01:06:52.001 --> 01:06:57.001
that's seated that hip back into the position and reinforce that mechanic and

1168
01:06:57.641 --> 01:07:00.460
then you had to be stable in that shape.
Same thing happens when you squat.

1169
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.490
Theoretically,
same things should be happening when you deadlift,

1170
01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:06.520
but what we see is that the modernness of us is what messes us up.

1171
01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:10.840
You have to have a movement practice [inaudible] practice yogas,
movement,

1172
01:07:10.841 --> 01:07:11.660
practice.

1173
01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:15.430
Acro Yoga is moving practice because they're exposed crossfits moon practice,

1174
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:18.070
but then I also have to probably breathe hard a little bit.

1175
01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:22.210
Someone there and get stronger and you're moving practice can handle that can be

1176
01:07:22.211 --> 01:07:24.610
kettlebells based.
I,
you can go to the Olympics that way.

1177
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.230
And then the last piece of course,

1178
01:07:26.231 --> 01:07:28.570
is that you have to be able to take care of your tissues.

1179
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:31.120
You have to know how to do some basic maintenance.
You know,

1180
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:34.290
one of the reasons that far body spoke to so many people,
it was a,

1181
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:35.980
it was like you gave them a blueprint,

1182
01:07:35.981 --> 01:07:38.980
a Betty Crocker cookbook of how their body worked and the things that they can

1183
01:07:38.981 --> 01:07:42.610
do that were actionable that didn't require a doctor,
a physical therapist.

1184
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:47.500
That's the revolution.
Thank you.
Uh,
thank you for helping with that.

1185
01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:52.000
Also,
I have to ask this.
This is,
this is a,
it's a common question.

1186
01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:54.760
It's not one that I ask myself much,
but I'm curious how you would answer it.

1187
01:07:54.761 --> 01:07:58.330
Is Cross it a fad.
I would say totally,

1188
01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:03.550
totally a fat because front squatting and running as a fad,
it's a gimmick.

1189
01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.820
No,
look,
gymnastics is not a gimmick.

1190
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:12.550
Olympic lifting,
not a gimmick.
Power lifting,
not a gimmick.
You know,

1191
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:17.090
one of the things that I don't think people really recognize crossfit so much

1192
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:19.190
and you can even go,
go back to Paul's book.

1193
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:23.000
It's like he interviews some MMA guy was legendary for his conditioning.

1194
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:24.740
He does the hundred Kettlebell snatch test.

1195
01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.840
He doesn't like eight minutes and it destroys him.

1196
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.790
Like I have 13 year old girls who can do that version of that thing and like

1197
01:08:30.791 --> 01:08:32.300
three and a half minutes.
No,
I mean,

1198
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:36.740
so we we've done is we've gotten a lot better conditioned and,

1199
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.310
and I think people understand that crossfit has always prioritized conditioning

1200
01:08:40.311 --> 01:08:42.410
and Roebuck engine first.

1201
01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:45.770
You've got to take care of that stuff and the body weight control stuff is the

1202
01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.900
easiest way and the most democratized way.

1203
01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:52.490
Then let's have a conversation about how much you weigh,
how strong you are.

1204
01:08:52.491 --> 01:08:54.350
If you give me the best of the crossfit games,
you're going to have to be really,

1205
01:08:54.351 --> 01:08:57.170
really strong and really Rubik for rest of us.

1206
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:59.700
We can keep putting money in that strength bank,
but that,

1207
01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:02.340
that aerobic functioning bank,
it goes dry.
Uh,

1208
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:04.950
the conditioning to a and a,

1209
01:09:04.951 --> 01:09:08.360
I know you got got a bunch of people to train here and business to handle so

1210
01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:08.991
I'll let you go in a minute.

1211
01:09:08.991 --> 01:09:13.730
But the to thin slice conditioning for a second because for for me,

1212
01:09:13.731 --> 01:09:16.850
of course I want to,
I want to dig into the measurables.

1213
01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:20.300
Is that primarily when I look at say a metabolic conditioning workout,

1214
01:09:20.301 --> 01:09:21.200
a metcon workout,

1215
01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:25.460
is it primarily trying to push up that anaerobic threshold so that you don't get

1216
01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:28.670
crippled by lactic acid and the hydrogen ions and all that and puke into a

1217
01:09:28.671 --> 01:09:30.710
bucket a is a vo two Max.

1218
01:09:30.711 --> 01:09:35.000
Like what are the primary components that you can kind of perform that you can

1219
01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:39.590
track?
The idea is that,
you know,
we could maintain all these other functions,

1220
01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.880
strength,
power,

1221
01:09:40.881 --> 01:09:44.660
all the things that sort of valued us as a powerful functional people and I

1222
01:09:44.661 --> 01:09:49.661
could get all the benefits of the aerobic anaerobic training with intervals like

1223
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:54.350
training,
high intensity training,
right.
Izumi Tabata prove that along time ago.

1224
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:56.030
But we found is that,
hey,

1225
01:09:56.031 --> 01:09:58.860
probably you need to go long once in a while to make sure you can and there are

1226
01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:03.170
some adaptations that only happen at that long steady state,
right?

1227
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.700
I'm about to,
I'm signed up for the Molokai.
I'm Palen Osi one.

1228
01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:08.390
It's like a five to seven hour race.

1229
01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:13.190
20 minute workouts are not going to do it from the sea kayaking,
outrigger canoe,

1230
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:14.203
outrigger canoe.
Right.

1231
01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.190
But my point is that I'm going to have to go long how long we need to go is up

1232
01:10:19.191 --> 01:10:20.360
to my coach.
You know,

1233
01:10:20.361 --> 01:10:23.420
I'm probably not doing longer than an hour still maintaining respecting this

1234
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:26.150
robot piece,
but that the intensity,
you know,

1235
01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:30.410
all of our energy systems work in concert and out the same time.
You know,

1236
01:10:30.411 --> 01:10:33.110
if you go longer than two minutes,
two minutes is a 50% of aerobic,

1237
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:37.790
50% anaerobic effort.
So you know,
running,
you know it's six minutes,

1238
01:10:37.791 --> 01:10:40.090
eight minutes,
your full robot power.
You know that,

1239
01:10:40.091 --> 01:10:42.920
that's a much more interesting do one k repeats.
You know,

1240
01:10:42.921 --> 01:10:45.290
that's something that people don't understand about Brian Mckenzie's model.

1241
01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:45.921
You know,

1242
01:10:45.921 --> 01:10:49.610
it's like he asked me to do five k repeats and stuff and on the Erg and poo,

1243
01:10:49.611 --> 01:10:54.020
it's brutal.
That's brutal.
Is the standing or seated her?
That'd be the scourge.

1244
01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:58.010
The skier,
the skier,
you know.
Got It.
You know,
that's,
that's,
that's a tea.

1245
01:10:58.011 --> 01:11:01.430
Those are terrible places to be,
you know,
one k repeats,
you know,

1246
01:11:01.431 --> 01:11:05.120
and I think we even,
people are not afraid of working hard anymore.

1247
01:11:05.121 --> 01:11:09.260
We've gotten past that.
Now let's have a little bit better conversation.
What,
uh,

1248
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:13.650
what do you think is the future of crossfit?
You can as way you want it.
Well,

1249
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.140
you know,
it's going to continue to refine itself.

1250
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.640
I think people are coming in and all the coaches I know and work with,

1251
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.090
you know,
are starting to understand what is we're doing and how sophisticated.

1252
01:11:24.091 --> 01:11:24.571
It's not just,

1253
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:27.660
we just don't throw a bunch of random shit up and exercise until we puke.

1254
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:29.520
You know,
it seems like that,
you know,

1255
01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.410
bunch of bunch of jerks swinging around the bar.

1256
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:32.520
That's not what's happening at all.

1257
01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.850
There are some jerks swinging on the bar that happens.
I mean,

1258
01:11:35.851 --> 01:11:38.280
I always point out on like the physical therapist out in the world,

1259
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:40.800
you had a business long before crossfit,
Fyi.

1260
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:44.310
Like there are people have been fucking themselves up in every sport for as long

1261
01:11:44.311 --> 01:11:47.430
as when people,
because we're ego driven people because we're,

1262
01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:50.490
we're driven to perform,
right?
So,
you know,

1263
01:11:50.491 --> 01:11:54.540
the key is to pull your ego out of this and really play the long game.

1264
01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.990
What do you look like?
How strong,
how can you be when you're 50?

1265
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.140
The conversation changes a little bit for me.
It's not,
you know,

1266
01:12:01.141 --> 01:12:03.960
can I dead lift 600 anymore?
It's,
you know,

1267
01:12:03.961 --> 01:12:06.240
what's this look like when I run an ultra?
What's this look like?

1268
01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:09.210
How effective and I am at running a 10 K or paddling.

1269
01:12:09.211 --> 01:12:12.450
Those are for me starting to be more interesting conversations and just absolute

1270
01:12:12.451 --> 01:12:15.420
strength or absolute work power.
How can I,

1271
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:17.610
how does this make me a better mountain biker?

1272
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:23.350
<v 0>If there were any,
uh,
any sort of parting tips,</v>

1273
01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:24.370
suggestions,

1274
01:12:24.371 --> 01:12:29.050
requests that you could make of the people out there who either currently

1275
01:12:29.051 --> 01:12:33.190
crossfitting or considering crossfitting well,
what would you say to them?

1276
01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:34.780
What would you suggest?

1277
01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.230
<v 2>Tooth.
It's not about who can work hardest anymore.
That ship has sailed.</v>

1278
01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:45.940
If you're in an a series strength conditioning program,
you are very fit.

1279
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:49.600
You know,
probably fitnesses not unless you're a beginner.

1280
01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.440
Fitness is not the limiting factor anymore.
Your positional quality,

1281
01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:58.120
add intensity is the limiting factor because you're going to do the same

1282
01:12:58.121 --> 01:13:02.410
experiment that everyone has done and you will end up in a little tiny box at

1283
01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:05.470
some point wondering why you're George Saint Pierre and you've torn both your

1284
01:13:05.471 --> 01:13:10.360
acs,
right?
No one was fitter.
No one was more powerful,
but as positions,

1285
01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:15.040
costume is acs and now he's that consciousness has come at a very,

1286
01:13:15.041 --> 01:13:19.420
very high price and you know you should be able to do these things forever.

1287
01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:20.410
You know there's,

1288
01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:24.520
there's not a time where you don't need to get up off the ground or do a pushup,

1289
01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.220
but just thus become more sophisticated.

1290
01:13:26.221 --> 01:13:29.670
Let's advance the conversation a little bit.
Don't be a Douche bag.

1291
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:33.940
If I walk into the room and you're rounding your back,

1292
01:13:33.941 --> 01:13:37.800
I'm going to cock punch you.
Come on.
It may happen once in a while.

1293
01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:40.670
Your heaviest loads.
I was drinking coffee and you've tried to cock much Jeff.

1294
01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:43.870
That was aggressive.
Luckily.
I know,
I just,
I think that's,

1295
01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.360
that's the issue is that it's,
you know,

1296
01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:48.190
you need to bring the awareness that we're supposed to bring to this.

1297
01:13:48.191 --> 01:13:50.950
If we're doing a five rep,
we're just not even a fiber at Max,

1298
01:13:51.370 --> 01:13:54.400
but were just squatting.
That fits.
Fifth Rep should look fucking good.

1299
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.100
You just had four more like make it look better.
Okay.

1300
01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:01.930
<v 0>Okay.
We got,
we got to run guys.
Uh,
last question.</v>

1301
01:14:01.931 --> 01:14:06.931
Any lesser known strength coaches or coaches period that,

1302
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:12.130
uh,
that you particularly,
that stick out in your mind that people might

1303
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:16.900
<v 2>want to look up and learn more about?
More about?
Joda Franco is amazing.</v>

1304
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:20.680
If you haven't ever listened to Pavle talk,
you know,

1305
01:14:20.681 --> 01:14:24.270
he solved a lot of this a long time ago.
Yeah.
Um,
the,

1306
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:28.180
the internet is rich right now with,
you know,
I would say,

1307
01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:30.850
look at who's been on the podcasts.

1308
01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:36.340
There've been some serious banner carriers for a long time.

1309
01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:40.460
Mark for Stagen at Exos has been talking about these basic shapes and comparable

1310
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:44.770
positions for a long time who were on his show,
who's around,
you know?
Right.
Um,

1311
01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:48.880
and I,
and I think the working coach pieces is it,
there are a lot of models,

1312
01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:49.381
you know,

1313
01:14:49.381 --> 01:14:53.920
we just just need to start a practice and then from there we can advance

1314
01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:54.754
ourselves.
But there's,

1315
01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.340
there's a lot of really good thinking in the world right now.
It's very exciting.

1316
01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.830
This is a good time to be in the world.
Definitely.
So Yeah,

1317
01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:01.300
questioning your assumptions folks.

1318
01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:04.950
Test your own rules and don't be afraid to suck,
suck for the SOC.

1319
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:09.940
Find a place where you can suck privately,
safely.
Kelly,
where can people find,

1320
01:15:09.941 --> 01:15:13.810
uh,
find you on the Internet and elsewhere?
Uh,
I'm on your couch,
Tim Ferriss,

1321
01:15:13.811 --> 01:15:18.070
couch.com,
and to be confused with other cats on the internet.
Oh Dude,

1322
01:15:18.071 --> 01:15:22.270
we're at MobilityWOD and mobilitywod.com and a man.

1323
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.610
I can't believe I've been doing this for 10 years.
That's a lot of pullups.
Yeah,

1324
01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.880
well to many more decades.
All right.
Thanks so much man.
Appreciate you.

1325
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:37.420
<v 0>This podcast is brought to you by Mizzen and main.</v>

1326
01:15:37.690 --> 01:15:40.270
Don't worry about the spelling.
All you need to know is this.

1327
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:45.400
I have organized my entire life around avoiding fancy shirts because you have to

1328
01:15:45.401 --> 01:15:49.660
iron them.
You sweat through them,
they smell really easily.

1329
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:50.830
They're a pain in the ass.

1330
01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:55.210
Mizzen and main has given me the only shirt that I need.

1331
01:15:55.211 --> 01:15:58.150
And what I mean by that and Kelly Starr at loves these shirts as well,

1332
01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.430
is that you can trick people,

1333
01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:04.150
they look really fancy so you can take them out to nice dinners,
whatever,

1334
01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.360
but they're made from athletics,
sweat wicking material.

1335
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:11.320
So you can throw this thing into your luggage in a heap or on your kitchen table

1336
01:16:11.321 --> 01:16:15.380
like I did recently and then pull it out,
throw it on with no ironing,

1337
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.810
no steaming,
no nothing.

1338
01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:21.100
Walk out and you could probably wear this thing for a week straight or make it

1339
01:16:21.101 --> 01:16:25.570
your only dress shirt and take it on trips for weeks at a time.
Never wash it.

1340
01:16:25.571 --> 01:16:27.670
It will not smell.
You will not sweat through it.

1341
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.050
You got to check these things out.

1342
