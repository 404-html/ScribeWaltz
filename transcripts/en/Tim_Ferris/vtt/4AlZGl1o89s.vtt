00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.820
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.150
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.010
Familiar question.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.990
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.
I wasn't either.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.020
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by 99 designs,</v>

6
00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:29.320
your one stop shop for all things graphic design related.

7
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.350
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

8
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.050
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

9
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:42.040
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

10
00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.250
the brainstorming and a lot of it took place with designers from around the

11
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:49.480
world and here's how it works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

12
00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:52.960
a website,
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

13
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.710
you submit that project and designers from around the world,

14
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.320
we'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

15
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.040
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

16
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:04.750
money back.
It's that straight forward.

17
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.440
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

18
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:10.810
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,

19
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:12.580

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.910
the Tim Ferriss show is brought to you by on it.

24
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.320
I have used on IT products for years.
If you look in my kitchen in my garage,

25
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:36.490
you will find Alpha brain chewable Melatonin for resetting my clock when I'm

Kettlebells,
battle ropes,
maces steel clubs.

27
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.600
It sounds like a torture chamber and it kind of is.

28
00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:48.340
It's a torture chamber for self improvement and you can see all of my favorite

Good and talk my 60 leaky munchkins.

34
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:13.431
This is Tim Ferriss in a very echo ladened wouldn't room on an island and we'll

35
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.440
be hearing more about that in a future episode with Chris Saka.

36
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:21.300
But in the meantime,
I am so excited to present an episode that was a very,

37
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:22.740
very physically demanding.

38
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.860
And this conversation you are about to listen to is with none other than Rick

39
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.880
Rubin.
And if you don't recognize that name,

40
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.850
well the bio could seem almost fabricated.
It is so impressive.

41
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:38.490
So he has been called the most important producer,

42
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.100
that's music producer for the last 20 years by MTV.

43
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.020
And in 2007 he peered on time's 100 most influential people in the world list.

44
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.500
Why would he appear on such a list?
Well,
if you could imagine,

45
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.420
say in the book world that you named every author you could think of off the top

46
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:56.160
of your hand,
all the name brand folks,

47
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.370
and then found out that one agent and one editor,

48
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:02.950
we're responsible for all of them.
You'd be dumbfounded.

49
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.510
And that's pretty much the case when you look at the discography of Rick Ruben.

50
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:11.080
So he was the former co President of Columbia records.

51
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.170
He's cofounder along with Russell Simmons of def jam records and help to

52
00:03:15.171 --> 00:03:18.250
popularize hip hop music by working with the Beastie boys,

53
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:20.710
ll cool j public enemy,
run DMC for instance.

54
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.110
And I'm not going to give the whole list because it's too long,

55
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.660
but here are just some of the artists that he has worked with.

56
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.830
Red Hot Chili peppers,
Beastie boys,
which I already mentioned,
Johnny Cash slayer,

57
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.630
Jay Z.
And he appeared in the 99 problems video Danzig,
Dixie chicks,

58
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:38.800
Tom Petty,
and the heartbreakers black sabbath,
slipknot,
Metallica,
ACDC,

59
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.970
Arrowsmith,
Lincoln Park,
Weezer the call Neil diamond,

60
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.110
a Mick Jagger system of a down.
It goes on and on.

61
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.930
And these genres span from say,

62
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.280
Lady Gaga to Zz top to Shakira and everything in between.
Kanya West,
m,
and m,

63
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:57.160
you name it.
So he's a fascinating guy.
Uh,

64
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.460
very much a zen monk in his temperament.

65
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.990
And I've gotten to know Rick over the last few years and he insisted that we do

66
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.090
the podcast in his sauna,
which is a barrel sauna that makes your head melt.

67
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.360
It is so intense.
So this was a very challenging episode.

68
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.540
I hope you get some laughs out of it.
And uh,

69
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.590
what you will realize very quickly is you have to listen intently to Rick's

70
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:24.220
answers.
So Rick has it of layers behind layers,
behind layers.

71
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.960
So he'll tell you something and you're like,
wow,

72
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:27.940
I'm not sure I actually get what that means.

73
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:30.040
And then months later it'll dawn on you.
Oh my God,

74
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.770
there are so many different depths to that answer.

75
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:36.190
I didn't pick up on it the first time around.
So,
uh,

76
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:41.191
you will have to interpret and ponder a lot of what Rick brings up and I hope

77
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:45.250
you enjoy this.
Uh,
I enjoyed it,
although I nearly had heat stroke.

78
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.260
And without further ado,
here is Rick Ruben.
Well,
will almost without further ado,

79
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:53.440
folks,
one more or do I forgot to mention?
If you are interested in music,

80
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.070
be sure to check out the drumming episode of the Tim Ferriss Experiment,

81
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:58.060
which is my TV show.

82
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:02.590
It's been the number one TV season on iTunes now for some time,
amazingly.

83
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.910
But if you go to itunes.com forward slash Tim Ferriss two r's,
two s's,

84
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.620
you can see a bunch of bonus footage,

85
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:13.000
all of the episodes including the drumming episode where I am trained by Stewart

86
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.040
Copeland,
the founding drummer of the police,

87
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:17.740
widely considered one of the top 10 drummers of all time.

88
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.770
His teaching method resembles doc from back to the future.

89
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.730
It is an amazing experience and I only had a few days with a gun against my head

90
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.940
to train to then play to a sold out auditorium as the Drummer for foreigner,

91
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.420
uh,
which was a nervous breakdown inducing to say the least.

92
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:37.480
So you can check it out.
itunes.com forward slash Tim Ferriss,

93
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:41.200
two r's and two s's.
And now here is Rick Ruben.

94
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.740
Rick,
welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me.

95
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.310
And this setting is somewhat unique and I've been looking forward to it slash

96
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.060
fearing it ever since.
You first mentioned it,
me,
uh,
where are we right now?

97
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.680
We are sitting in the sauna.

98
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.120
We here sitting in a very hot barrel son and I was told that I was one of the

99
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:10.121
conditions for having this conversation and it's such an impressive barrel

100
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:15.290
sauna.
It's indoors that I wanted to get the specs for it when I first saw it.

101
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.450
And you have a heater that has to be what,

102
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:21.710
four times the size of the off the shelf heater that would go into such a
heated,

103
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.340
it's a much bigger heated and for the size of the room.

104
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.100
And I'm sitting on the floor because I have such little confidence in my ability

105
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:34.730
to withstand heat compared to you.
But we do have the,

106
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.890
the alternate,
which is the bath just outside of this door and a,

107
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:43.070
you and I have gone back and forth of course quite a few times with the step of

108
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:47.060
cycling.
But what is right outside of the store?
A metal tub filled with ice.

109
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.270
It is a metal tub about four feet,

110
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.200
three and a half feet off the ground full of ice.
Uh,

111
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.460
looks like if you were to say what a horse trough times to something like that,

112
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:02.960
something like that.
It's gotta be maximum low fifties,

113
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.560
something like that.
I think it's about today.
It's probably about 38 degrees.

114
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.620
Oh my God.
All right.
So we have a,

115
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.390
we have two mics on the floor I'm hoping won't explode or melt down to the age

116
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:18.290
four and the and the h six and we have a water ice heat.

117
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.760
Nothing could go wrong.
I'm looking forward to it.
So Rick,
I was uh,

118
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.190
I was hoping perhaps we could start with,
uh,

119
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.490
a discussion of your physical transformation and I'd love for you to perhaps

120
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:34.410
just describe to people,
I mean you're in my mind the sort of the,

121
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.850
the picture of a fitness and a lot of ways now and we've been paddle boarding

122
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:42.650
before and you summarily what my ass,
every time we go out,
I'm always breast.

123
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.650
There are a lot of things contributing to my,

124
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.490
my lack of competency and fear there.
But,
uh,
where,

125
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:53.540
where were you and how did you end up undergoing this,

126
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.450
this physical transformation because you've lost how much weight at this point

127
00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:57.610
and how much fat Rosen

128
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.830
<v 3>I lost at the peak moment ls to between 135,</v>

129
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:04.430
140 pounds.

130
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:10.040
And I always thought I was eating a healthy diet.

131
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.440
I was Vegan for 20 something years.
And,
um,

132
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.560
all organic vegan really,
you know,

133
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.360
very strict with what I ate.
And doing that,

134
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.560
I got up to 318 pounds.
Um,

135
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.720
and I,

136
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.460
I read a book by a guy named Stu middlemen who ran a thousand miles in 11 days.

137
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.160
And I remember reading that and just thinking,
wow,

138
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.890
it's like I can barely walk down the block.

139
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.480
And this guy ran a thousand miles in 11 days.
And it just seemed so inspiring.

140
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.800
So I read his book and in the book he talked about a guy named Phil maffetone,

141
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.850
who I'd never heard of before,
and he said it in stews book.

142
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:54.140
He gets to the part where you said,
well,

143
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:57.900
I met this doctor Phil maffetone and he changed the way I trained and he changed

144
00:08:57.901 --> 00:09:01.170
the way I ate and he changed all these things and then all of a sudden I was

145
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:05.820
able to do all these things.
It's like,
okay,
I want to find Phil maffetone.
So,
um,

146
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.650
I,
I found him online.
I sent them an email and he was,

147
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:15.220
um,
living in Florida and I asked if,

148
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.700
if,
you know,
it could become his patient.
And he said that,
uh,

149
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.210
he had just stopped treating patients and retired from being a doctor.

150
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.660
It's like lots of terrible news.
And,
um,

151
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.610
but the reason he decided to stop being a doctor was he decided to become a

152
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.760
songwriter.
And I said,
oh,
it's interesting.
Um,
I mean,

153
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:37.210
funny you should mention that.
Like,

154
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.310
I'm involved in songwriting and the music world.

155
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.190
Maybe we can trade and maybe I can help you with your song writing and you can

156
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:45.780
help me with my health and fitness.

157
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.590
And he liked the idea and we ended up meeting a few months later and then,
um,

158
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.480
met several times and became friends.

159
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.900
And then you eventually ended up moving into my house and lived in my house for

160
00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:00.450
about two years.
And,
um,

161
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.380
I did everything he said and I got much healthier.

162
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:07.480
My metabolism gut turned on.
Um,

163
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.550
the hours that I was sleeping shifted.
I for most of my life,

164
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:15.570
I stayed up all night and slept most of the day.
And,
uh,

165
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.050
when I was in college and never took a class before 3:00 PM because I knew I

166
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.900
wouldn't,
I wouldn't go.
And this was at Nyu,
at Nyu,

167
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.560
so I'm used to living in Knight and lifestyle.

168
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.410
Even I remember even in high school,
I've missed,

169
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.970
I missed the first three classes of schools so many times that,
you know,

170
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:36.840
it was really an issue,
but it was just,
I had learned to be up on,

171
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.110
I've learned to be a late night person and,
um,

172
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.980
and it kind of suited the music life click.
It worked well with my life.

173
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.050
Um,
and one of the first things that feel suggested when we got together was,

174
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.233
um,

175
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.440
I slept with blackout blinds and I usually didn't leave the house until the sun

176
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:58.860
was setting.
And he said,
from now on,
when you wake up,

177
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.840
I want you to go outside.
Oh,
as soon as you wake up,

178
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.870
open the blinds and go outside nicotive possible and be in the Sun for 20

179
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:12.300
minutes.
And when he said it,

180
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.800
I remember thinking he,
it'd be the same as him saying,

181
00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.950
I want you to jump off this,
this ledge.
You know,
like,

182
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:24.951
it sounded like the most terrifying based on the way I lived my life.

183
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:28.230
That just sounded terrible.
Right.
Um,

184
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.810
what time was he recommending that you wake up?
Well,
she,

185
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.280
by the time we started it kept moving down and it,
and it,
um,

186
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.780
it went from three o'clock to probably noon to 11 to nine,

187
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.830
and it just sort of happened naturally.

188
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.740
And he knew that if I immediately went in the sun,

189
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.280
that naturally my body would want to start waking

190
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.880
<v 4>up earlier and going to sleep earlier.
I,</v>

191
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.780
it was the first time ever that my circadian rhythm was kicking in.
It never was.

192
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.430
I never knew that there was such a thing or knew what that was.
So he,

193
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:07.120
um,

194
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.120
he got me to connect to that and I did everything he said changed my diet,

195
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:16.990
started eating some animal protein.
I was,
as I said,
a devout Vegan,

196
00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:21.700
so eggs and fish with the first things that I would eat.
And even then,

197
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:25.060
I never liked eggs and they never liked fish,
so I ate them more like medicine.

198
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.633
Um,

199
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.850
and slowly I got healthier and healthier and healthier and more and more fit.

200
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.310
But I was still very heavy and I was heavy for a long time.

201
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:44.470
What age were you when you brought him into your house?
Or how long ago was this?

202
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.420
Yeah,
I'm going to guess.

203
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.823
<v 5>Okay.</v>

204
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.600
<v 4>I'm going to guess it was probably</v>

205
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:55.220
<v 5>okay.</v>

206
00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.980
<v 4>Late thirties.
And how,</v>

207
00:12:57.981 --> 00:13:02.540
if you don't mind me asking me 10 years ago,
10,
12 years ago,

208
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.060
something like that.
So you,
you were changing your diet.

209
00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:09.920
What were some of the other things that he had you change that he had me do?

210
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.940
Um,

211
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:16.060
20 minutes of a low heart rate exercise,

212
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.750
aerobic activity every day.
And um,

213
00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.780
he had me start wearing a heart rate monitor and my heart rate I would get into,

214
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.080
you know,
from me walking up a flight of stairs would be an aerobic activity.

215
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.580
So I had to really watch what I was doing to stay.

216
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.090
I don't Rebecca activity.
Yeah.
So I had to

217
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:44.330
work hard to stay in the anaerobic space or the aerobics space.

218
00:13:44.331 --> 00:13:49.331
You mean in the aerobic space below that it's getting hot in here to take off

219
00:13:50.631 --> 00:13:53.960
all your clothes.
My hands,
my hands burning,
holding the bag.

220
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.300
I tried to wrap them in Napkins.
I remember he did,

221
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.300
did mention those might get hot,
but sorry,
I digress.

222
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:07.130
So to stay within the aerobic threshold you had yes.
Worked very hard.
Yes.
And uh,

223
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.090
again my health changed but I still stayed very heavy.

224
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:16.730
And after two years of time,
um,
I probably,

225
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.220
I probably lost a little bit of weight,
but not much.

226
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.500
But I was much healthier and much more alive and much better than I was before.

227
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.950
And after that period of time,
Phil said to me,
you know,

228
00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:32.980
anyone else who made the changes you made out of everyone he's ever dealt with,

229
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.560
99% out of 100 people,
you know,

230
00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:40.370
99 out of 100 people would have dropped all their weight for some reason.

231
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.600
There's something else going on with you that's holding onto the weight.
So,

232
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.480
and so I just accepted that that was how it was.

233
00:14:47.481 --> 00:14:50.840
But at least I felt it felt a lot better.
My life was a lot better.

234
00:14:50.841 --> 00:14:51.860
It was lot happier.

235
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.320
<v 3>Um,
and then I met,
uh,</v>

236
00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.080
a mentor of mine whose name is Moe Austin.

237
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:05.081
He's the guy who ran Warner brothers records for 35 years.

238
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:09.860
He worked for Frank Sinatra,
real inspiring guy in the music business.

239
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.840
Um,
he suggested I went out to lunch with him one day and he said,

240
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:16.160
you know,
Rick,
I'm really worried about you.

241
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:19.880
I know you watch what you eat and I know that you,
you know,

242
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.870
a walk on the beach every day and exercise,
but you're really getting big.

243
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.750
And I'm worried.
So he said,
uh,

244
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.140
I'm going to get the name of a nutritionist and I want you to go to my guy and I

245
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:36.050
want you to do whatever he says.
And I said,
okay,
fine,
look at.

246
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.340
And I knew it wouldn't work because I knew that my whole life I had a weight

247
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:45.170
problem my whole life.
I've tried every diet and nothing ever worked.

248
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:50.000
And um,
but I,
you know,
I would do anything for most.

249
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:54.890
So I went again openminded but not believing it would work.

250
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.010
Willing to try but not believing it would work.

251
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:03.740
And I'm the nutritionist put me on a high protein,

252
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.240
low calorie diet and I'd never done a low calorie diet before.

253
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.810
And over

254
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.850
14 months I lost 130 pounds.
135 pounds.
Yeah,

255
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.740
it changed.
That changed everything.
And I,

256
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.440
I will say if I didn't do the work with Phil First,

257
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.970
I don't believe that the Diet would work.
There was sort of a,

258
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.440
a combination of things in order.

259
00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:36.740
It was like the metabolism got turned on.

260
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.620
I started being in tune with circadian rhythm.
Um,

261
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.470
I was stimulating my aerobic system every day.
Um,

262
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:46.080
and was,

263
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:51.080
I built the base and then with the right diet was able to drop the way quickly.

264
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.930
<v 1>That's so interesting about that.</v>

265
00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:57.410
And I have a couple of more questions about what the nutritionist prescribed,

266
00:16:57.411 --> 00:17:00.470
but is that in my experience with say,

267
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:03.080
tens of thousands of readers following various diets,

268
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:06.560
including this low carb diet,
it makes perfect sense because you were,

269
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:08.180
you were adding things in,

270
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.600
in the beginning as opposed to having everything prohibited and you're adding

271
00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:15.960
elements in.
And then once you've added those lifestyle components,
uh,

272
00:17:15.961 --> 00:17:19.580
at that point you were able to,
to change the,
uh,

273
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.720
the Diet and then experienced the,
wow,
that is hot.

274
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.300
I was going to say,
even with,
even with Phyllo,

275
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:31.920
<v 3>I changed my diet.
It just was,
you know,</v>

276
00:17:31.921 --> 00:17:33.000
like almond butter.

277
00:17:33.001 --> 00:17:35.850
It was something that I was allowed to eat because in Phil's world,

278
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.080
almond butter is healthy.
So I probably

279
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.060
<v 1>a third of a jar of almond butter every day.</v>

280
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:44.030
That's my issue with things like almond butter,
no food.
Exactly.

281
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.200
<v 3>The idea of,
uh,</v>

282
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.040
Phil has a belief and so many people have a belief that calories don't

283
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.720
<v 1>count.
And I understand that,
but if you eat 10,000 calories a day,</v>

284
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.930
right,
you're probably going to gain weight.
You're not going to lose weight.

285
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.880
So it's like there,
there is a point where calories do make a difference.
Oh,

286
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.130
for sure.
Yeah.
I mean,
there are there cases where it's,

287
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:09.810
if it's a question of between 40 505,000 calories,
it's like,
okay,
yes.
Bourbon,

288
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:11.940
calories,
sugar,
calories and fat calories,
very different.

289
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:14.930
But if you're eating 10,000 calories of almond butter before he go to bed,
yeah,

290
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:19.020
which I will do if I have almond butter in my house and then best not to have it

291
00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.470
in my house.
So the,
when you lost the 130,

292
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:25.500
140 pounds over that period of time,
how many of your meals,

293
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.790
how many meals are you eating per day,

294
00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:29.640
and how many of them were whole food versus liquid

295
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.370
<v 3>to lose the weight?
I was having seven protein shakes a day that were,</v>

296
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.640
um,
high protein peaks.
They were like,
uh,

297
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:45.000
egg protein.
J Rob Egg protein was one of them.
Uh,
terrorists,
whey,

298
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.480
whey protein was another.
And um,

299
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.610
did you alternate those or combine them?
No,
at first I do to only egg.
Mm.
The,

300
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.930
the way came later and uh,
at first I couldn't tolerate the way,

301
00:18:57.931 --> 00:19:00.540
for some reason that the way made me uncomfortable.

302
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.560
Once I lost a bunch of weight,
I could eat the way I'm so egg was first.

303
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.910
<v 1>That makes that also makes sense.
I mean,</v>

304
00:19:06.911 --> 00:19:11.911
having any amount of lactose or dairy reintroduced after being vegans are for

305
00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:13.800
such a long period of time.
Yeah.

306
00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.620
A lot of people have noticed who say try to reintroduce animal proteins feel

307
00:19:17.621 --> 00:19:20.530
sick,
but it's because they lack the enzymes at that point.

308
00:19:20.531 --> 00:19:25.450
After say 10 years of not consuming meat.
Yup.
To digest it properly.
Uh,

309
00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.850
do you want to do an ice round or do you want me to do a nice round?

310
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.670
Cause I feel like I'm getting close.
Yeah.
I'd say why don't,
uh,

311
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.820
why don't you do an ice round and then I'll do a nice round,

312
00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.020
cause you're at higher elevation.

313
00:19:38.021 --> 00:19:39.850
I'm sitting on the floor for those people who can't see

314
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.720
woo.
No joke.
Oh God.

315
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:55.740
Even 200 it's not even 200 it's about 190 holy crap.

316
00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.930
195 degrees in here.
All right,
so hopefully we'll be up to two twins.

317
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.160
Oh Good Lord to 20 that's a,
yeah,
that's a well done steak right there.

318
00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.930
That's a very well done.
All right.

319
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.110
I will hang out in here and then we'll see out there in a minute.

320
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.413
<v 0>Okay.</v>

321
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.690
<v 1>I'm holding both of Mike's now sitting on the floor,</v>

322
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:22.710
two containers of water and I have a Russian spa hat on.

323
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:28.210
They make you look somewhat like the Keebler elves and mine has a lion on it and

324
00:20:29.441 --> 00:20:32.230
uh,
I have to only guess the cyrillic says spa line,

325
00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:36.970
which is appropriate because I think of myself as spotlight.
On a related note,

326
00:20:36.971 --> 00:20:39.370
folks,
if I do die of heat stroke in here,

327
00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:43.300
it's been lovely knowing you and I'm going to just press stop now to save my

328
00:20:43.301 --> 00:20:44.830
breath for the ice round.

329
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.400
We'll be back and we're refreshed

330
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.400
<v 3>after some time.
I think we're getting colder adding ice.</v>

331
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:55.630
But it was about 44 degrees Fahrenheit.
So Rick,
you had,
uh,

332
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.000
mentioned this,
uh,

333
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.930
this gent or doctor or lady from Ucla.
Who was that?
Uh,

334
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.260
the doctor at Ucla who helped me lose the weight.
His name was doctor Heber,

335
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.380
eight,
g.
B.
E.
R.
And he really,
um,

336
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.010
he's of everything.

337
00:21:12.011 --> 00:21:15.700
I tried nothing ever worked until Dr Heber.

338
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:21.180
And do you still follow the general diet or have you been able to after losing

339
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:24.290
that weight?
Uh,
modify that?
I've,

340
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.690
I've modified it in that I still,
um,

341
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.800
you've a lot of protein and don't have any grain.

342
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.150
Um,
yeah,

343
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.470
really not no carbs and uh,
keep,

344
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.940
while I probably don't restrict calories as much as I did in the weight loss

345
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:51.420
phase,
I'm aware of it.
I'm aware of them and don't let them get out of control.

346
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.090
Contract.
You've developed a sensitivity and awareness.

347
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.060
And for a period of time I used an APP,
um,

348
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.960
I think it was called fitness pal,
if I can remember correctly,

349
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.520
where you put in all the food that you eat and it tells you the calories and

350
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:07.660
just kind of keep a log.

351
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.720
And what was just helpful about it is if you pay attention to calories for let's

352
00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:13.864
say a year,

353
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.270
you then really have a sense of where the calories are hidden and you just have

354
00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:21.220
better habits.
Oh,
absolutely.

355
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.970
Just like if you're trying to get into sick ketosis and we're falling,

356
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:26.740
something like the Atkins Diet for instance,

357
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.940
you develop a sensitivity to hidden sugars.
Absolutely.

358
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.780
And a sort of net carbohydrate.
So I'd love to,

359
00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:39.781
to shift gears a little bit and ask you about music producing.

360
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.700
Uh,
W we'll,
let's,

361
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.660
let's perhaps take even a step back and ask when,

362
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:49.840
when people ask you what you do,
how do you answer that question?

363
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.010
I don't know how to answer that question.
You don't know how to answer it though.

364
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.100
So what,
what does a,
let's perhaps start with definitions then.

365
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:07.000
What does a music producer do for those people?
Not Familiar.
I don't know what,

366
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.410
I don't know what music producers do.
Okay.
Tell you I can tell you what I do.

367
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.320
Okay.
Let's do that.
Uh,
which is,

368
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:18.760
I help get the best performance from an artist.

369
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.020
Help,

370
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:25.020
help them pick their material or develop their material and help set the course

371
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.550
for the direction of what they're doing creatively.

372
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:36.990
And how did you end up initially becoming involved with that type of work?

373
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.680
Um,
I don't know how you usually do and uh,

374
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.550
I guess can do it in many different ways.

375
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.880
Some people might start as a recording engineer and then graduate to record

376
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:53.324
producer.

377
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:58.510
Some people might be successful artists and then transition into being record

378
00:23:59.811 --> 00:24:02.480
producers.
Um,
in my case,

379
00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:06.470
I was just really a fan of music and I come at it from the point of view of

380
00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:10.250
being a fan.
What did you study at Nyu?

381
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:15.500
I started as a philosophy major and then after two years I switched to film and

382
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:17.180
television because it's holding back friends.

383
00:24:17.181 --> 00:24:20.570
We film and television and it just seemed like more fun.

384
00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:26.520
Was it more fun?
It was,
uh,

385
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.860
I think it's Natalie Maynard.
The Dixie chicks.
Yeah.
It's sad.

386
00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:34.790
And this is paraphrasing,
but that you let music be discovered,
not manufactured.

387
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.210
And this,
this,
uh,
what does she mean by that?

388
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:42.430
Or what do you think she means by that?
Well,
we have a whole process to pay.

389
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.650
You know,
it's different for every artist,
but,
um,
we,

390
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:51.220
we try to go on a journey and let the artists discover who they are and in the

391
00:24:57.291 --> 00:24:59.350
process,
um,

392
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.830
the best art comes from them.

393
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:08.890
It's like getting to be their true selves and trying to take away all of the,

394
00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.990
um,
there's so many things that get in the way of the artistic process.

395
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:15.860
For example,

396
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:20.210
any commercial considerations usually get in the way.

397
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.730
If you're thinking about
making music,
it's going to get on the radio.

398
00:25:25.731 --> 00:25:28.670
Chances are you won't be using your,

399
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.670
your own voice to its

400
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.410
most potent,

401
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.190
most singular,
um,

402
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.010
you know,
finding the,
what your personal gift is.

403
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:54.290
Um,
so that's one of it.
That's one of many things.

404
00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:59.291
Just it's a getting closer to the source and not being distracted by any,

405
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.980
uh,
any nonsense that would get in the way of the art being as good as it can be.

406
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:12.040
What are other things that get in the way of artists producing their best work?

407
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:17.930
Concerned about what other people think?
Uh,
competition,

408
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.690
wanting to do better than someone else.

409
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.810
See what are the things self doubt,
um,

410
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:37.390
ego.
What manifestation of ego?
Um,

411
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.580
s if someone thinks that everything they do is great,

412
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.240
they might not be willing to edit themselves enough or work hard enough at,

413
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.670
um,
you know,
if I can write,

414
00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:55.530
if I could write 10 great songs in five minutes each and those are the best

415
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:59.700
songs and I'm just going to record them and put them out and those might not be

416
00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:02.820
as good as the ones that you've developed over a longer period of time.

417
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:03.654
For example,

418
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.380
that might be an egotistical artists who thinks everything I do is just great.

419
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.460
When you have the opposite,
when you have an artist who is doubting themselves,

420
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:16.140
how do you help them through that?
Um,

421
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.330
or what is a,
what do you recommend?
I have a lot.

422
00:27:21.331 --> 00:27:26.310
I mean,
I just speaking personally,
I have continuous self doubt as a redder.
Yeah.

423
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.163
I think most,

424
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:32.180
I think most artists do that's more the more typically self doubt is the case.

425
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:37.540
<v 5>Okay.</v>

426
00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:42.540
<v 3>I think if your goal is to be better than you were,</v>

427
00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.810
you know,
if you're competing only with yourself,

428
00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.290
it's a more realistic,
um,

429
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:55.000
it's a more realistic place to be.
You know,
if you say,
I'm,

430
00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.120
I don't want to write songs unless I could write songs better than the Beatles,

431
00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.200
it's,
it's a hard road.
But if you say,

432
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:05.530
I want to write a better song tomorrow,
then the song I wrote yesterday,

433
00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.430
that's a realistic,
that's something that can be done.

434
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.330
And if you write a better song than he wrote yesterday,
every day,

435
00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.330
then you continued to get better and better and better.

436
00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:20.440
And it really is small steps and um,

437
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:25.030
and also trying not to,
um,

438
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.730
trying not to think too much because so much of it is more of a,
um,

439
00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.310
the job is,

440
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:42.340
it's more emotion and heart work than it is head work.
Like the,

441
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.440
the head comes in after to look at what the heart has presented and to organize

442
00:28:49.641 --> 00:28:50.474
it.

443
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:55.720
But the initial inspiration comes from a different place and it's not the head

444
00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:00.170
and it's not an intellectual activity.
It's a,

445
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.160
it's more of a,
um,
it's more inspiration.

446
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:09.850
So the key first is to really do whatever activities you can to tune into

447
00:29:11.481 --> 00:29:16.010
inspiration and things like meditating help.
And I'm

448
00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:22.310
diving into art in general.
It doesn't have to be even your modality.
I mean,

449
00:29:22.311 --> 00:29:25.850
going to museums and looking at beautiful art can help you write better songs,

450
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.830
reading great novels,
reading great,
great works of art.
Um,

451
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.210
seeing a great movie could inspire a great song reading poetry.

452
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:36.703
Um,

453
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.800
so let's say being in submerging yourself in great art and

454
00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:50.020
the more you can do to get out of the mode of competition where you're looking

455
00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:54.310
at what other people are doing and wanting to be better than them or be inspired

456
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:56.260
by them.
So the only,

457
00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:01.320
the only way to use the inspiration of other artists is if you submerge yourself

458
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:06.490
in the greatest works of all time,
which is a great thing to do.
You know,

459
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:10.630
like if you listened to the greatest music ever made,

460
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.960
that would be a better,
uh,

461
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.560
a better way to

462
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.960
work through to find your own voice to matter today.

463
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:27.610
Then listening to what's on the radio now and thinking I want to compete with

464
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:32.180
this.
Right.
So it's more like a stepping back and looking at,
uh,

465
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.070
uh,
a bigger picture than what's going on at the moment.

466
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.840
<v 1>It's someone as speaking as someone who is not very well versed with music.</v>

467
00:30:42.151 --> 00:30:45.660
I don't feel highly literate when it comes to music.
I enjoy music.

468
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.900
But hanging out with,
with you and Neil Strauss,

469
00:30:48.901 --> 00:30:52.940
certainly I feel like I'm lacking perhaps vocabulary to,
uh,

470
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.510
and a lot of references.

471
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.020
Are there any for people who feel like they're in my shoes,

472
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.520
are there any particular albums that you had you could offer as a,

473
00:31:02.521 --> 00:31:04.890
as a starting point?
Not the end all be all,
but just as a,

474
00:31:04.891 --> 00:31:09.891
as a starting point for appreciating a good worldclass contemporary music?

475
00:31:11.851 --> 00:31:15.840
Meaning not necessarily could be classical music,
but are there any record?

476
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.990
<v 3>I'm an issue.
I would just start by listening to the greats,</v>

477
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.140
which you can look at.
Like,
um,

478
00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:26.570
if you look at search online for Mojo's top 100 albums of all time or rolling

479
00:31:26.581 --> 00:31:29.400
stone's top 100 albums or,
um,

480
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:35.080
any trusted sources,
top 100 albums and start listening to what you know,
what,

481
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.550
what are considered the great,
that's a good place to start.

482
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.570
<v 1>And,
uh,
are,</v>

483
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:45.570
are there any particular stories that you have that come to mind of,
uh,

484
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:51.130
experiences outside of the medium of music saying a specific film or a specific

485
00:31:51.131 --> 00:31:56.131
trip or specific book that catalyzed a breakthrough in the work that you did?

486
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.340
<v 3>Let me think about that for a sec.</v>

487
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.300
Yeah.
I wouldn't say break through,

488
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:14.280
um,
because it's a more,
it's a more personal thing than that.

489
00:32:14.281 --> 00:32:19.140
So it doesn't come as much from the outside.
But I get inspiration every day,

490
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.440
every day from either what I'm reading or watching a sunset or the,

491
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.201
you know,

492
00:32:25.201 --> 00:32:29.460
the w noticing the amount of birds that fly overhead and what they look like and

493
00:32:29.461 --> 00:32:33.540
they're different shapes and paying attention or hearing the sound of the waves.

494
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.940
Um,
all of those things speak to her.
Looking at the horizon.

495
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.630
Um,
they all speak to me and,
um,

496
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.470
so much of the work we tried to do is to

497
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:56.120
create something with the natural balance that we see in nature.

498
00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:00.770
That that's sort of the perfect version of,
you know,

499
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.350
if you can make a piece of music that can take your breath away as much as a

500
00:33:04.351 --> 00:33:08.930
beautiful sunset,
you've done well.
So,
um,
you know,

501
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.560
any opportunity to see dolphins swim,
wear to see he knows,

502
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:16.790
see something beautiful that's not your run of the mill experience or even could

503
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:18.800
be a beautiful cloud filled sky.

504
00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:21.203
<v 5>MMM.</v>

505
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.793
<v 3>Were,
you know,</v>

506
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.770
on a particularly clear night when you can really see lots of stars who's there,

507
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.140
they're all inspiring things and um,

508
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.120
help turn on the muse of recognizing

509
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.023
<v 5>mmm,</v>

510
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.220
<v 3>kind of,
uh,
uh,</v>

511
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:45.510
a greater vision of either what's possible or what's beautiful.

512
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.840
Then we know something that you see in a magazine that's,

513
00:33:51.191 --> 00:33:54.930
you know,
advertisement that there to entice you to buy it.

514
00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:00.270
And it was,
can you talk a little bit about the,

515
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:05.430
when you realized that you were good at working with musicians or music,

516
00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:11.010
when did,
uh,
when did that happen?
And are there any particular,

517
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.220
whether it's instances or artists where you're like,
wow,

518
00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.740
I think I might actually have a knack for this?
Well,

519
00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:19.020
I started right from the beginning.

520
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:22.650
I started having a lot of success in it and it,
um,
I did it.

521
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:27.900
I really made music as a hobby while I was in college and thought I would have a

522
00:34:27.901 --> 00:34:32.190
real job and then I would make music as my hobby and um,

523
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.560
and I thought it would have a job to support my music habit.

524
00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:40.950
And then the first album I produced was,
um,

525
00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.120
by ll cool j.

526
00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:47.340
He was 16 at the time and I think it cost us about $8,000 to record it and sold

527
00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.950
900,000 comments.
And that was a good start.
That is a good span.

528
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.580
The second one was Beastie boys,
which I think sold,
I don't know,

529
00:34:56.910 --> 00:35:01.040
nine or 10 million.
And I'm from Manhattan,

530
00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:05.580
like just a lot of records sold a lot right from the beginning.
So it,

531
00:35:05.581 --> 00:35:06.414
um,

532
00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.720
it'd be,
I will say it took a long time for me to understand

533
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:15.743
<v 5>that</v>

534
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:19.730
<v 3>that doesn't always happen.
You know,
unusual series of events.</v>

535
00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:23.840
But after a long time of having lot working with a lot of artists and seeing a

536
00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:28.220
lot of success,
it,
it became clear that,
um,

537
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.660
I could support artists and doing good work and people seem to appreciate it.

538
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.340
What are,
what are the,
some of the ways that,
uh,

539
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.340
what are some of the things

540
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.450
<v 1>or characteristics that make you perhaps different from other people who work</v>

541
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:43.290
with musicians?

542
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:45.643
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

543
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:49.320
<v 4>It's hard to know.
I don't know so well what other people do,
but I,
I,</v>

544
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:53.020
I don't think we do the same thing.
And I think,
um,

545
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:55.740
there some producers who

546
00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.270
<v 6>yeah.</v>

547
00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:02.820
<v 4>Um,
make beats for artists.
And um,
there was a time that I did that early in,</v>

548
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:07.150
early in my career.
I did that.
I'm still on occasion.

549
00:36:07.151 --> 00:36:10.330
We'll do it if you know,
if it,
if it makes sense with the,

550
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.210
the project that I'm doing.
Um,

551
00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:18.240
I think it's unusual that I get to work in lots of different genres and get to

552
00:36:19.121 --> 00:36:24.121
make heavy metal records and rap records and country records and spiritual

553
00:36:25.301 --> 00:36:29.680
records.
I'll do all different kinds.
I think that's unusual.
And just lucky.

554
00:36:29.681 --> 00:36:33.070
And I think that might come from the fact that I come from it,

555
00:36:33.071 --> 00:36:36.930
from that fan perspective and I like all kinds of music and I get to um,

556
00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.650
examine them and,
and,

557
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:43.180
and the fact that I've been able to work on so many different kinds of music

558
00:36:43.181 --> 00:36:47.590
over such a long period of time gives me a good perspective because when I come

559
00:36:47.591 --> 00:36:49.800
into a new project,
it's not,
it's,

560
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:54.580
it's rare that I'm going into the studio to work on another of what I was just

561
00:36:54.581 --> 00:36:57.400
working on.
So let's say for example,

562
00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.460
I was a heavy metal producer and all I did for the last 30 years,

563
00:37:00.461 --> 00:37:04.510
we've produce heavy metal.
I don't know how fresh those records would be today,

564
00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:07.630
but now if I get to produce a heavy metal record,

565
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:11.110
like the last one I did I guess would be the last black sabbath album.

566
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.410
He was really fun cause I hadn't made a record like that in a long time.

567
00:37:14.411 --> 00:37:19.060
And it was a brand new experience and it was 13.
13 was the last one.
Yep.

568
00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:22.300
And um,
that was a great experience.
Really Fun.

569
00:37:22.301 --> 00:37:24.790
Never worked with those guys before and we had a great time.

570
00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.730
<v 1>So I'm not sure I ever told you the first time I ever saw the name Rick Rubin</v>

571
00:37:28.731 --> 00:37:32.240
was actually on the inside of a,
an audio cassette.

572
00:37:32.241 --> 00:37:35.360
It was the first heavy metal album I ever bought,
which was raining blood.
Oh,

573
00:37:35.361 --> 00:37:36.194
that's a good one.

574
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:40.550
And I just remember that's a really good not having is this beef Internet of

575
00:37:40.551 --> 00:37:44.630
course.
And I was just told by my friends,
you have to,

576
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.940
you will love heavy metal,
you should listen to heavy metal.

577
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:50.930
And I asked what the hardest heavy metal was that could possibly be found and

578
00:37:50.931 --> 00:37:54.410
reign in blood came,
uh,
to the lips of those I asked.

579
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.150
And uh,

580
00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.730
and I just remember listening to you.
I think it's angel of death,

581
00:38:01.731 --> 00:38:06.650
the first track on that and going,
oh my God,
what have I gotten myself into?
Yeah.

582
00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.480
And just fell in love with that band.

583
00:38:08.481 --> 00:38:13.040
But how did you go from hip hop to say slayer?
It's,

584
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:17.900
it's a stylistically so different it would seem,
but how did slayer come about?

585
00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.520
As I said it right?
Because

586
00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.550
<v 4>it was coming about it with no technical skill.</v>

587
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.450
It's not like I knew about hip hop or I knew about heavy metal.

588
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.750
I was a fan of music and I loved heavy metal and I loved hip hop.

589
00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:35.110
So it was more of that coming at it from this appreciation and as a knowing what

590
00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:40.710
I wanted to hear,
knowing that,
you know,
especially in the case of slayer slayer,

591
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.860
we're an underground metal band who had two albums out on an independent label

592
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.460
and we're kind of considered,
you know,
the heaviest band in the world.

593
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:50.320
And when we signed them,

594
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.880
there was this terrible fear that slayer now doing their first album for a major

595
00:38:57.491 --> 00:39:01.300
label,
it was going to,
you know,
they were going to sell out,
get watered down.

596
00:39:01.301 --> 00:39:05.380
Yeah.
And which happens all the time.
And then the album that we made,

597
00:39:05.381 --> 00:39:10.210
random blood was much harder and worse than anything that anyone ever heard

598
00:39:10.211 --> 00:39:14.590
before.
And um,
and it really did come from that,
you know,
I liked,

599
00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:19.650
I always liked extreme things and they were extreme and I wanted to maximize it.

600
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.520
I didn't want to water down,
you know,
the,
the idea,

601
00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.640
the idea of watering things down for a mainstream audience,

602
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.320
I don't think it applies.

603
00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:34.321
I think people want things that are really passionate and the best version of

604
00:39:35.531 --> 00:39:36.700
ethic they could be in.

605
00:39:36.701 --> 00:39:40.390
Often the best version they could be is not for everybody.
Right?
The best,

606
00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.990
the best art divides the audience where you,
you know,

607
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.480
if you put out a record and half the people who hear it,

608
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.960
absolutely love it and half the people who hear it absolutely hate it.

609
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.200
You've done well because it's pushing that,
that boundary.

610
00:39:53.201 --> 00:39:57.370
If everyone thinks well,
that's pretty good,
why bother making it,
you know,

611
00:39:57.371 --> 00:39:59.680
it's sort of,
um,
it doesn't,

612
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.740
it doesn't mean much lost in the slipstream of time.

613
00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.260
Almost as soon as it comes out.
I'm going to do around device,

614
00:40:05.261 --> 00:40:07.000
if that's all right.
Absolutely.
All right,

615
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:11.080
let's do some more ice and we'll be back.
Okay.
We are,

616
00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:15.970
we are back.
And I'd love,
I'd love to talk a little bit about,
say for instance,

617
00:40:15.971 --> 00:40:18.640
ll cool j versus slayer.

618
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:23.670
Is the way in which you work with those two groups of creatives or in the case

619
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:29.920
of helical jet,
I know how many people were in involved on his side,
but is,

620
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.480
is there a different approach when giving feedback when trying to cultivate

621
00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:39.550
their booty?
It's,
it's really different with every single artist and it's um,

622
00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.430
you spend time with the artist,

623
00:40:43.431 --> 00:40:47.440
you get to know them and if you,

624
00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:51.440
if you listen to people,
if you really listen to what people say,
usually

625
00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:58.030
they,
um,
they tell you everything.

626
00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.450
If you really listen and pay attention to what people are saying,

627
00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:05.410
they'll let you know a lot of stuff.
And,
um,

628
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.290
I just really pay attention to what people say.

629
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.060
And through that I can then reflect back,

630
00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:17.830
um,
thoughts that

631
00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:24.450
they've told me about themselves that they don't know about themselves and um,

632
00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.270
allow them to unlock those doors too

633
00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.740
to get to the places they want to go artistically.

634
00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.780
<v 1>Are there any particular examples of that where a,</v>

635
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:37.820
or a story that you could share?

636
00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:53.170
<v 4>Uh,
the first story that comes to mind isn't related to my music work,</v>

637
00:41:53.171 --> 00:41:58.171
but it's related to our friend Neil and I'm just the journey,

638
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:05.620
the journey that led to his new book that that's about to come out.
Um,

639
00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:10.860
started through him complaining about something going on in his life that,

640
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:17.380
uh,
he thought was something that he wanted in his life.

641
00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:23.320
I don't think that he knew that he wanted,
was making him unhappy.

642
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:29.190
And through that conversation he decided to examine that.

643
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.980
So that'd be an example.
Would be the same,
same thing as that.

644
00:42:32.981 --> 00:42:35.350
The threats one that came to mind,
maybe because we both know Neil,

645
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:36.770
<v 1>right?
Uh,</v>

646
00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:38.320
<v 0>yeah,</v>

647
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.550
<v 1>you seem very obviously philosophical,
philosophically minded,</v>

648
00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.970
very calm.
Uh,
and uh,

649
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:51.040
I should thank you also,
uh,
you and a friend named Chase Jarvis,

650
00:42:51.041 --> 00:42:51.551
or actually,
you know,

651
00:42:51.551 --> 00:42:54.730
if he's a world class photographer or the people that got me into meditation,

652
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.670
I consistently with Tm.
Great.
So thank you for that.

653
00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:02.220
But have you always been very calm and uh,

654
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:06.520
I mean you seem very unperturbed very unphased by,

655
00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:11.180
by anything that I've observed.
Is that,
is that,
is,
is that an illusion is,

656
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:12.820
or have you always been that way?

657
00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.193
<v 4>MMM,</v>

658
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:20.090
I'm very lucky in that I learned to meditate when I was young,

659
00:43:20.091 --> 00:43:25.060
so I started meditating when I was 14 and I meditated.
Um,

660
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.590
<v 0>okay.</v>

661
00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:32.590
<v 4>A lot for a long time and through that I think it has really,</v>

662
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:34.184
um,

663
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.313
<v 0>okay.</v>

664
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:41.380
<v 4>Even,
even though I'm not always calm on the inside,</v>

665
00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:46.830
it has least given me an air of calm and maybe a comparative to other people.

666
00:43:47.591 --> 00:43:48.610
I haven't probably come.

667
00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:53.320
I know sometimes internally I can get disrupted.

668
00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.840
What do you do when you get disrupted?

669
00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.920
I tried to do something like often,
um,

670
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.850
exercise will make me feel better.
Meditating will make me feel better.

671
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.260
Ice Bath is the greatest of all king of mood elevators.

672
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.270
It's just the magic.
Someone ice back and forth at the end of,

673
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:22.200
at the end of the fourth or fifth or sixth round of being in an ice tub,

674
00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.460
there is nothing in the world that bothers you.
It's true.
It's very true.

675
00:44:26.461 --> 00:44:28.200
Like the world's a great place.

676
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.740
What,
what are the types of things that,
uh,
disruptive?

677
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.020
Are there any particular patterns?

678
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:44.363
Hmm.

679
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.520
I would say usually,
um,

680
00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.193
<v 0>yeah,</v>

681
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:54.470
<v 4>work,
things are political related,
you know,</v>

682
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:59.310
political type things related to work could really bothered me.
Just,
um,

683
00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:04.040
they don't fit into my,
into my realm of,

684
00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:05.443
<v 3>uh,</v>

685
00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:10.030
<v 4>the way I look at life.
So,
so I get surprised by those things.</v>

686
00:45:10.031 --> 00:45:14.470
And just having to manage say the various relationships on the,

687
00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:18.430
uh,
within a a label or something like that.
Yeah,

688
00:45:18.431 --> 00:45:22.130
I would say more like dealing with business people can,

689
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:26.800
can often like cloud.
You really think that you're the one to do things that way.

690
00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:32.290
Surprising.
How do you,

691
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.863
<v 0>uh,</v>

692
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:36.510
<v 4>how have you designed,</v>

693
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:40.050
what are some of the ways in which you've designed your life to say,

694
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.830
not have to contend with as much of that as possible?

695
00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.830
Well,
I always,
um,

696
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:49.403
<v 0>okay,</v>

697
00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:54.340
<v 4>really try to focus my life around art.</v>

698
00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:58.630
So I consider my job.
Even though there are other parts of my job,

699
00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:00.430
I consider my real job.

700
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.150
The reason I'm here is to

701
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.780
sit with artists,
talk to artists,
help artists be better at what they do.

702
00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:11.663
<v 3>MMM.</v>

703
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.240
<v 4>And if I'm not doing it with an artist,
I'm doing it with something else.</v>

704
00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:22.020
It's like my goal is to make things as good as they could be,
either make,

705
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:24.263
<v 3>mmm.</v>

706
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:30.020
<v 4>Whatever it is.
I mean,
to the point to where I've gone into friend,</v>

707
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:33.150
visit friends in their office and I rearranged the furniture in there in her

708
00:46:33.151 --> 00:46:37.310
office because that's insane.
You know,

709
00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.120
we'd really look better if you,
you know,

710
00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:42.180
if he moved these things this way and you could see the sun coming in through

711
00:46:42.181 --> 00:46:46.050
the window here,
and if you open these blinds and turn this around,

712
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:48.330
this place would feel much more comfortable.

713
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:54.420
When you think of the word successful,
who's the first person who comes to mind?

714
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.193
<v 0>Okay.</v>

715
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:06.650
<v 4>It's not,
it's not such an easy question to answer because I mean,</v>

716
00:47:06.651 --> 00:47:09.470
so many things go into what makes someone successful.

717
00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:14.810
What are some of those things?
Um,
I would start with somebody who's happy.

718
00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:15.771
You know,

719
00:47:15.771 --> 00:47:20.771
I know a great many people who are financially successful and not happy.

720
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.710
So I would rule all of them out to start with.

721
00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:27.003
<v 0>Wow,</v>

722
00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.670
<v 5>he's not coming Tuesday.
I have to think about that and we'll come back.</v>

723
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:41.410
We can come back to it.
How do you,
this is a big question,

724
00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:44.620
but I'll,
I'll ask a very self interested question.
Some 37,
of course.

725
00:47:44.621 --> 00:47:46.410
We both spend a lot of time around Neil.

726
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:53.320
I'm not going to spoil the secret because Neil would have gone to apoplectic

727
00:47:53.321 --> 00:47:56.620
shock.
But,
uh,
the next book I'm looking forward to it.
You just thought of who,

728
00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:59.590
a couple of examples of people who were successful.
Let's do it.

729
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:03.130
A good example of someone who's successful has done Wildman,

730
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.300
our friend from the beach.
Oh,
who am I still have not met.
Yeah.
Okay.

731
00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:11.560
He's amazing that he's 80 years old.
He's,
um,

732
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.050
23 pull ups on the beach the other day.
He's a,

733
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.930
in the senior Olympics.
He quit,

734
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:25.970
retired in his fifties because he wanted to spend his days enjoying life and

735
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:32.080
exercising.
And um,
he's one of the most inspiring,

736
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:35.680
uplifting,
um,
great,

737
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.850
successful people on so many levels,
on so many levels.
Um,

738
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:42.063
he'd be,

739
00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.430
he'd be probably the first one I think of Laird's another great example of

740
00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:50.260
someone who I would think of as successful.
He's a successful human being.

741
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:53.710
And this is Luke Laird,
Hamilton,
Laird Hamilton.
Um,

742
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:58.060
for those people who are not familiar with,
with layered,
uh,
pretty much I'd say

743
00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:04.360
uncontroversially thought of as the King of Big Wave Surfing,
uh,
among,
uh,

744
00:49:04.361 --> 00:49:05.710
among other things.
Yeah.
I mean,

745
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:10.980
it's not uncommon to hear I'm referring to as the greatest athlete on earth.
Um,

746
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.560
he's real,
you know,
so many athletes have so many disciplines.

747
00:49:14.561 --> 00:49:17.890
Think of him as the best athlete,
also a king of,

748
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.410
of steamer and ice pads.

749
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:26.560
I first started doing the sauna mis when there
anyway,

750
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:32.470
successful someone who enjoys their life,
um,

751
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.180
is great at what they do,

752
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:39.630
is curious and continually pushing forward and wanting to be better than they

753
00:49:40.571 --> 00:49:45.050
were yesterday without a,
uh,
okay.

754
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:49.660
<v 4>Without beating themselves up about it.
And what are outs?
Uh,</v>

755
00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:54.910
Don don is,
his name,
has come up so many times.
What,

756
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.270
what are some of the things that you've learned or picked up from him and a

757
00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.200
adopter yourself?
He,
he's just seems so positive.

758
00:50:03.201 --> 00:50:08.110
And so,
um,
nothing,
it seems like nothing gets to him.
He's,

759
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.830
um,
he couldn't,

760
00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:19.120
he can push through anything that's in his way and all the time with a smile on

761
00:50:21.471 --> 00:50:25.700
his face and a positive outlook and a,

762
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.190
<v 3>and a curious nature.
You know how,
I don't know how many people that are 80,
that,</v>

763
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:35.830
uh,
every time you meet them talk,
tell you,
you know,

764
00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:40.620
teach you something about something new they've learned because they're so

765
00:50:40.621 --> 00:50:44.010
curious about a great article or this great book and you have to read this book

766
00:50:44.011 --> 00:50:48.120
and you have to go to see this movie and you have to do this.
And um,
you know,

767
00:50:48.121 --> 00:50:51.550
we just came back from snowboarding and Alaska and you got to go see you was

768
00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:55.710
like,
he was unbelievable.
And just,
it's,
he's got a wildlife

769
00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:00.470
<v 1>that's inspiring.
I've,
I've in the last,
I'd say three or four years,</v>

770
00:51:00.471 --> 00:51:01.670
particularly after my,

771
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:05.660
my health scare last year with Lyme disease and everything that came of that

772
00:51:05.661 --> 00:51:07.310
tried to surround myself,

773
00:51:07.311 --> 00:51:11.690
not just with the extremely young athletes and performers,
but,
uh,

774
00:51:11.691 --> 00:51:14.450
for instance,
this Polish gentleman and his wife,

775
00:51:14.451 --> 00:51:18.440
both of whom are world record holders and Olympic weightlifting.
But what's,

776
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:23.470
what's so fascinating is how relatively injury free and mobile they still are

777
00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:28.430
and their in their,
I'd say early sixties at this point.

778
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:33.050
And I've tried to really tried to spend more time in the last few years modeling

779
00:51:33.051 --> 00:51:35.540
what those people do.
Uh,

780
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:41.690
do you have a book or books that you've gifted often to other people?

781
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:45.350
<v 3>Um,
there,
there are many.
Um,</v>

782
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:51.880
first one that comes to mind is the Dao de Jing,

783
00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:57.800
Steven Mitchell,
translation of the Dao de Jing.
That's um,

784
00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:02.010
what's great about it is it's 81 short

785
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:05.030
pieces that could be,

786
00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:10.070
could look at them as poems that if you were to read the book today,

787
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.350
you would get one thing from it.

788
00:52:12.351 --> 00:52:14.750
And if you pick it up in two years and read it again,

789
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:19.610
it would mean something entirely different.
And um,
an always on the money,

790
00:52:19.611 --> 00:52:23.540
you know,
always what you need to read at that period of time.

791
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:28.210
So it's a,
it's a magic book in that way that it,
uh,

792
00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:29.510
it always fits.

793
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.480
<v 1>I actually took,
if,
God,
this is bringing back a memory,</v>

794
00:52:33.481 --> 00:52:37.980
I took an entire class on the Tao Te Ching at Princeton when I was an Undergrad

795
00:52:37.981 --> 00:52:38.880
and East Asian Studies.

796
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:44.270
And it seems on some level that that book does what you do for musicians,

797
00:52:45.211 --> 00:52:50.211
meaning it's a sort of reflects back truths that they were not aware of

798
00:52:50.491 --> 00:52:54.150
themselves or they could not verbalize themselves.

799
00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:55.770
Any other books come to mind?

800
00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:00.080
<v 3>Another one that's really nice,
his book about meditation called wherever you go.</v>

801
00:53:00.081 --> 00:53:04.550
There you are,
which is by a Jon Kabat Zinn.
And it's a great,

802
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:09.170
it's a great book if you've never meditated and if you've been meditating for 50

803
00:53:09.171 --> 00:53:12.920
years,
if you read,
if you read this book,
either way you'll be,

804
00:53:12.921 --> 00:53:17.180
will care more about meditation,
become a better meditator.
And,

805
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.793
um,

806
00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:24.920
just give insight into why we do it and what the benefits are.

807
00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:31.010
<v 1>Do you have any favorite,
any favorite movies or documentaries</v>

808
00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.500
<v 3>and watch lots of documentaries?
Let me think of what's</v>

809
00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:37.340
<v 5>okay.</v>

810
00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:41.990
<v 3>What's a favorite?
Just watched one the other night that was spectacular.
New,
um,</v>

811
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:48.080
uh,
nick cave,
the English,
well I guess he's Australian,
but lives in England.

812
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.160
Um,
musician has a,

813
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:55.480
there's a new documentary that's an unusual documentary cause it's Hart

814
00:53:55.481 --> 00:53:59.780
documentary in part,
I guess not yet to see it,

815
00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.900
but it's called 20,000 days on earth.
20,000 days on earth.
Yeah.

816
00:54:03.901 --> 00:54:07.370
So that was the last one that just really like,
wow.
How great is that?

817
00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:10.740
<v 5>Okay.</v>

818
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.440
<v 1>Are there any points?
Uh,</v>

819
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:13.750
<v 5>okay.</v>

820
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:18.210
<v 1>Have you had any points of,
of overwhelm in your length in Europe?
Uh,</v>

821
00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:20.380
and your length in your,
that's an odd question.

822
00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.160
I think the heat's getting to my head.
In your,
uh,
in your career.

823
00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:29.460
Getting Heat's getting to me to switch because my hand is burning.

824
00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:35.770
Okay.
Uh,
do you experience overwhelm or have you

825
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:40.240
<v 4>yes,
I definitely experience overwhelm.
Yeah.
Oh,</v>

826
00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:44.650
too much going on at one at one time or,
um,

827
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:48.380
often it's,
it's a self imposed

828
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.983
<v 5>Aye.</v>

829
00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:53.580
<v 4>All right.</v>

830
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:58.580
Make it a point to always be there as best as I can be for the artists that I

831
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:01.860
work with and sometimes,

832
00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:04.423
<v 5>uh,</v>

833
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:11.410
<v 4>their needs can overtake my own needs and then I feel overwhelmed because I want</v>

834
00:55:11.561 --> 00:55:14.950
to be there for them and then I feel like go,
I'm not taking care of myself.

835
00:55:14.951 --> 00:55:16.270
So finding that balance,

836
00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.010
<v 1>what do you,
what do you do in those situations when you,</v>

837
00:55:19.011 --> 00:55:20.480
when you come to that realization?

838
00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:24.960
<v 4>When I realize it,
I'll usually talk to the artist about it and,
and um,</v>

839
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:27.923
<v 5>yeah.</v>

840
00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.870
<v 4>And explained the situation,
seem to look for,</v>

841
00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:38.530
I would say any situation that feels uh,

842
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:40.070
<v 5>okay.</v>

843
00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:40.903
<v 4>Sticky.</v>

844
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:45.500
Usually through talking about it with the person that it feels sticky with,

845
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.360
almost always it,
uh,

846
00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:52.430
it uses very quickly and usually brings you closer together.

847
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.810
<v 1>And do you,
how do you explain the situation,</v>

848
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:59.470
the situation and the way that you just described it to me?
Or it's what,

849
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.500
what is the actual,
it just depends on the

850
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:05.340
<v 4>case,
but it,
but I might say,
you know,
I feel really overwhelmed now.</v>

851
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:08.190
This is what's going on with me.
Um,

852
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:15.980
can we talk about this later?
Or if it,
you know,
can we address this?

853
00:56:15.981 --> 00:56:18.770
Is that okay?
Or usually talk about it.

854
00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:20.210
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

855
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:22.250
<v 1>Hey,
feeling.
It's getting hot.</v>

856
00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:29.520
Uh,
you tell me.
I'll let,
I'll let you call the call the,

857
00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:33.940
the rotation of the guards when we go to ice.
But I am,
I'm very curious.

858
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.520
I remember,
uh,

859
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.430
seeing your myself.

860
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:43.990
Uh,
I think this is a fine idea.

861
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:48.630
I will say I will absolve myself of responsibility for hot objects.
But,
uh,

862
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:53.700
the,
uh,
your cameo in a 99 problems.
Yes.

863
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.880
How did that come about?

864
00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.200
<v 4>Oh,
I had produced a song for Jay and then when it was time to make the video,
um,</v>

865
00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:03.260
a friend of mine,
Mark Romantic was a great video maker,

866
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:07.970
made the video and um,
I think it was Mark's idea.

867
00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:12.080
She said,
why don't we get Rick in the video and jade greed?

868
00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.720
And then they called and asked if I would come.

869
00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:17.930
And I love Jay's really great guy and I thought it would be fun.

870
00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.960
<v 1>Uh,
what,
uh,</v>

871
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:25.530
what are you proudest of as it relates to that track?

872
00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:28.053
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

873
00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:32.980
<v 4>Um,
if it comes to mind,
I know you've worked with a lot of tracks,</v>

874
00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:38.970
just the fact that Jay is one of the most,
you know,

875
00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.680
important artists in the world and that's one of his most popular songs.

876
00:57:42.681 --> 00:57:44.600
And then we got to do together.
It was really great.

877
00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.430
<v 1>How were you,</v>

878
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:49.550
how did you become involved with that song or were you involved with the entire

879
00:57:49.551 --> 00:57:50.280
album?

880
00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:54.090
<v 4>Um,
I was involved with that song.
We went into the studio together.
He,</v>

881
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:57.480
it was his last,
it was going to be his last album,
the black album,

882
00:57:57.481 --> 00:57:58.680
his retirement album.

883
00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:03.210
And he asked his 10 favorite producers to each do one song.

884
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:07.440
And we went into the studio.
That was the first time we worked together and we,

885
00:58:07.441 --> 00:58:10.310
um,
you spend a weekend,

886
00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:15.350
the studio trying different things and then eventually came upon this track and,

887
00:58:16.981 --> 00:58:20.530
uh,
it may experimentation and he loved it.
Men,

888
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:24.600
the words came to him sort of magically.

889
00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:27.090
He sat in the back of the room listening to the track over and over and over

890
00:58:27.091 --> 00:58:30.210
again.
And after about a half hour jumped up and set up,
got it.

891
00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:33.210
And to the other room and did the vocals.

892
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:40.040
<v 1>I'm not writing anything down.
I heard this about him before where,
uh,</v>

893
00:58:40.041 --> 00:58:42.140
at some point I heard a story that heat,

894
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:47.090
he wrote basically jibberish down on a piece of paper because someone trying to

895
00:58:47.091 --> 00:58:51.140
supervise them earlier in his career was so worried that he wasn't taking the

896
00:58:51.141 --> 00:58:53.870
recording session seriously.
But in fact,
he didn't write anything down at all.

897
00:58:53.871 --> 00:58:58.100
It was just to put them at ease and then freestyle the entire thing.

898
00:58:58.101 --> 00:58:59.300
Is that generally how I operate?

899
00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:02.710
<v 4>That's how he does.
That's mind boggling.</v>

900
00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:07.300
He's super talented and it was just a great,
great person,

901
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:11.830
really one of my favorite people.
What do you like about him?
Everything.

902
00:59:11.831 --> 00:59:15.850
He's a humble.
He's honest.
He's,
um,

903
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:22.400
he's in deep soul.
You know,
he looks at things,
deeply,
understands them,
deeply

904
00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:26.570
<v 3>caring and um,
it's just,
uh,
you know,</v>

905
00:59:26.571 --> 00:59:27.830
first great person.

906
00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:33.130
<v 1>I think I'm going to get in the ass.
All right.
I'll do it to the ice.</v>

907
00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:36.970
I'll hit pause.
Wow.
Is Right.

908
00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:49.090
Raises,
right.
It does add up.

909
00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:53.490
That was a particularly Chile ice bath.

910
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.690
It's now lower than the minimum measurement,

911
00:59:57.691 --> 00:59:58.980
which is 40 degrees.

912
00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:04.670
So I feel like how all my skin below my neck is just contracted by 30%.

913
01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:09.900
It's a good feeling.
And you had mentioned this briefly when we were coming in,

914
01:00:09.901 --> 01:00:13.970
but who is,
who is the person who introduced you to using a sun?

915
01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:18.050
<v 3>You've got the first sauna that I was ever in was,
uh,</v>

916
01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.440
a local friend of ours,
Chris Chelios,

917
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:25.710
who's a hockey player and he was the hit the longest hockey professional hockey

918
01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:30.400
career of,
of anyone ever.

919
01:00:30.401 --> 01:00:35.200
He continued playing professionally until he was 48 years old.

920
01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:36.243
And um,

921
01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.400
all of the people on the other teams that he was facing at the time were in

922
01:00:39.401 --> 01:00:43.990
their twenties.
So he's really an unbelievable athlete and he,

923
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:45.783
<v 0>mmm.</v>

924
01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.400
<v 3>Has done sauna every day of his life for the last,
you know,</v>

925
01:00:50.401 --> 01:00:52.170
since he's been playing.
And he could,

926
01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.240
he believes the reason he had the longevity in the sport and the reason he never

927
01:00:57.241 --> 01:01:02.241
got sick and was able to never miss a game and to play for such a long career

928
01:01:03.211 --> 01:01:06.570
was all due to the sauna every day.

929
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:12.180
And he used a hot sauna.
He was not alternating between hot and cold.

930
01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.780
He did hot and cold,
but he wouldn't necessarily always use an ice bath.

931
01:01:15.781 --> 01:01:18.070
He would do cold showers if not.
Um,

932
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:21.720
but he would do 15 or 20 minutes in the sauna,

933
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:25.680
cold shower or 15 or 20 minutes in the sauna round and round.

934
01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:29.360
And to how were you introduced to the ice baths?
Uh,

935
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:34.500
ice baths came from,
um,
joke,
human Noah,
who's,
um,

936
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:39.060
my girlfriend's nephew and he,
um,

937
01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:44.670
he bought an ice tub for layered because he's Laird started doing the sauna

938
01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:49.740
after,
after Chris started the sauna.
Uh,

939
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:52.920
we are a group.
We would do it on the beach.

940
01:01:52.921 --> 01:01:56.430
Chris has a sauna on the beach who do the sauna and even in the wintertime and

941
01:01:56.431 --> 01:01:59.610
then jump into the ocean.
And that was how he did the hot and the cold.

942
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:04.170
And your QM suggested we started using the ice tub.

943
01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:06.903
<v 0>MMM.</v>

944
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.670
<v 3>And then we started doing that and that was,
took it to a whole new level,</v>

945
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:16.160
<v 1>done some very unusual training.
That sounds terrifying to me.</v>

946
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:20.040
Underwater.
Right.
And our,
do you continue to do underwater training with

947
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.140
<v 3>weights?
Yeah,
that's something that we do with lyric.</v>

948
01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:26.120
We'll do like a 50 pound dumbbells,
14 feet underwater.

949
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.770
And um,
it's,
it's an interesting experience.
A lot like getting into the ice bath,

950
01:02:31.771 --> 01:02:35.460
like if you're not used to getting into an ice bath,
most people,

951
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:39.520
if you say get into a tub of ice,
they,
they,
uh,

952
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.440
react negatively panic,
they panic.

953
01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.580
And when you're underwater holding weights,

954
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:52.830
your brain goes crazy and it relates to,
oh,
it's like,
wait,
underwater,

955
01:02:52.831 --> 01:02:55.730
you die.
That's like submit shoes.

956
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.100
So we do all of these different exercise weights underwater and it's really

957
01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:05.850
interesting.
Do you,
what do you Saunders,
keep in mind folks do this,

958
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:11.150
don't do this without supervision.
Talk to your doctor.
But the,
uh,

959
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.810
what,
what is the technique look like?
Or example,
it started,
um,

960
01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.360
Laird has a pool that you can start in the shallow end and walk down to the deep

961
01:03:21.361 --> 01:03:25.710
end and then up the center of the pool,
there's a staircase it underwater.

962
01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.980
So it started with holding heavyweights,

963
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:33.270
walking from the shallow end into the deep end.

964
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:36.300
And obviously there's a point we have to take a big breath and hold it.

965
01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:39.930
And then you walked down into the deep end and then you turn around and you walk

966
01:03:39.931 --> 01:03:43.410
up the stairs and make it before you run out of breath.

967
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.870
And each time you do it,

968
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:49.800
you would make wider and wider circles and get used to being under longer and

969
01:03:49.801 --> 01:03:52.440
longer.
And then we started adding,

970
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.930
once we were completely submerged,

971
01:03:55.590 --> 01:04:00.590
start adding maybe curls or shoulder presses and doing those underwater.

972
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:06.450
And then one day after we'd been doing this for about a year,

973
01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:10.650
Laird came into the,
uh,
the gym the next day and he said,

974
01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:14.610
I had a dream last night that if we use lighter weight,

975
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:19.830
they'll be heavy enough to keep us down,

976
01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.650
but late enough where we could get up,

977
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:27.480
where we could jump up to the top in the,
in the deep end,
in the deep end.

978
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:28.770
So He'd be down in the deep end.

979
01:04:28.771 --> 01:04:33.030
So now instead of doing one rep and recovering,

980
01:04:33.031 --> 01:04:38.031
which was all we could do before even you can do one round basically,

981
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:43.140
and then be at the shallow Indian recover,

982
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:47.700
we started doing these exercises of jumping.

983
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.760
So we'd start with maybe 15 pound dumbbells and you would hold two 15 pound

984
01:04:55.351 --> 01:04:59.760
dumbbells,
jumped into the deep end,
sink to the bottom,

985
01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:04.260
um,
and jumped as hard as he can,

986
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:09.950
throw your arms over your head and then kind of do one stroke,

987
01:05:10.021 --> 01:05:14.040
pulling your arms down to your sides while holding the dumbbells.

988
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:18.990
And it was just enough to get your head out and you gasp for breath and then

989
01:05:18.991 --> 01:05:22.840
you'd sink.
And we would do that over and over and over again.
And you know,

990
01:05:22.841 --> 01:05:27.730
at first maybe the goal would be to try to get 10 in a row and it would be

991
01:05:27.731 --> 01:05:31.240
really a big deal and we can do 10 in a row.
And then,
you know,

992
01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:35.450
over time we worked up to being able to do a hundred in a row and then doing it

993
01:05:35.451 --> 01:05:36.490
with heavier weights.

994
01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:41.170
And then since then let's come up with maybe,
I don't know,

995
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.010
50 different exercises that we do with weights underwater,

996
01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:47.590
either underwater or in water.

997
01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:52.240
And while he drives up some really fascinating,

998
01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:56.650
not only exercises but devices that those people haven't seen the foil board,

999
01:05:56.651 --> 01:05:59.710
is that what it is with the toilet boards?
Amazing.
The foil board.

1000
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:02.790
Some people can Google full end up paddling really.
You know,

1001
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:07.030
he invented stand up paddling.
He invented towing,
surfing.
Um,

1002
01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.900
he's an amazing,
he's got an amazing,
um,

1003
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:16.090
analytical mind.
Do you think,

1004
01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:20.830
did he develop that in any particular way?
The mind,
the analytical mind?

1005
01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:22.820
I think he's,
um,

1006
01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:31.500
I think he's very mechanical to start with.
Think starts with that.

1007
01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:37.040
And I'm very curious and very hardworking and he's willing to try things and,

1008
01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:43.330
and fail at things to be able to get to,
you know,

1009
01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:47.580
to be able to do something.
So he,
you know,
the first day I went to his gym,

1010
01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:51.300
um,
I could do one pushup.

1011
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:55.140
And really it was through his,

1012
01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.233
<v 0>uh,</v>

1013
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.080
<v 3>his belief in his inspiration that I was able to learn all the different things</v>

1014
01:07:03.081 --> 01:07:04.310
that I was able to learn with him.

1015
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:09.770
And I remember he showed me one exercise and I couldn't do it at all.
And I said,

1016
01:07:09.771 --> 01:07:12.530
I can't do that.
And he said,
no,
don't say you can't do it.

1017
01:07:12.531 --> 01:07:15.380
Say you haven't done it yet.
And then he'd say,
okay,

1018
01:07:15.381 --> 01:07:20.030
now let's divide it into three pieces.
Do the first,
third of the exercise.

1019
01:07:20.031 --> 01:07:23.510
And I could do the first,
third and I'll do the last third of the exercise.

1020
01:07:23.511 --> 01:07:27.050
And I could do that and then do the middle third by itself.
And I can do that.

1021
01:07:27.051 --> 01:07:27.750
And he's like,
you know,

1022
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:32.300
but the first two pieces together and I could do that and then put the second

1023
01:07:32.301 --> 01:07:34.130
and third piece together.
And I could do that.

1024
01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.830
And then eventually I could do the whole exercise.

1025
01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:40.640
But at first it seemed impossible,
but he walked me through it.

1026
01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.200
And I'm broken down for you.
Yeah.

1027
01:07:43.201 --> 01:07:47.750
It just taught me how to see past the,

1028
01:07:47.751 --> 01:07:50.930
um,
the limitations that are put on myself.

1029
01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.800
What was the exercise?
Do you recall what that was?
That might have been a,
uh,

1030
01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.980
well,
that could jump through,
like who,

1031
01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.490
<v 0>it'd be like a,</v>

1032
01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.480
<v 3>like a burpee with weights.
We would</v>

1033
01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:08.940
<v 0>like you do</v>

1034
01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:14.430
<v 3>a shoulder press and then you put the weights down on the ground and then hold</v>

1035
01:08:14.431 --> 01:08:19.220
them,
hold the dumbbells,
jumped back into a pushup position,

1036
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:24.500
then jump up and slide your legs forward through.

1037
01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:29.180
Right,
right.
And then jump up into a squat position and then lift up.

1038
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:30.223
And that would be one,

1039
01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:32.640
<v 4>one round.
That's an intense movement.</v>

1040
01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:39.000
What are some of the,
the physical experiments that you're doing these days,

1041
01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:40.770
um,

1042
01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:45.860
or training protocols that you're experimenting with and there's always so many.

1043
01:08:45.901 --> 01:08:48.190
I have to think of what's,
what's new and

1044
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:55.860
I've been doing hyperbaric oxygen
and I really liked that.

1045
01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.270
That's an a chamber.
Yeah,
I do.

1046
01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:04.140
<v 3>Uh,
the Wim Hof breathing technique I just started doing,</v>

1047
01:09:04.141 --> 01:09:07.590
there's a Wim Hoff 10 week course you could check online.

1048
01:09:07.650 --> 01:09:10.440
W.
I.
M H.
O.
F to start it.

1049
01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:13.770
<v 4>He's a fascinating guy.
Yeah.</v>

1050
01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:20.090
He's really into ice saying I've never seen anyone more tolerant advice.

1051
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:26.910
Yeah.
I think he has a world record for sitting in a box of Bisquick,

1052
01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:31.170
a cube of ice and I think the new climb Mount Everest just didn't swim trunks.

1053
01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.430
He has some incredible,
uh,

1054
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:36.940
thermo regulatory capabilities thing is very impressive.

1055
01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.490
You ran a marathon in the um,

1056
01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.090
<v 5>yeah.</v>

1057
01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:46.710
<v 4>In the desert with no water.
That was another one.
Yeah.</v>

1058
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.290
Just the two extremes of the heat or the cold.
The guy's a monster.
Yeah.

1059
01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:53.110
I really want to get him on the podcast at some point.
It'd be a good one.

1060
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:55.900
Let's see,
what else?

1061
01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.860
Those are the ones that come to mind at the moment.
What,
uh,

1062
01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:09.240
how do you just as Laird did for you when you are working with an artist who

1063
01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.780
believes they can't do something or it's just hitting that wall,

1064
01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:17.960
what are some of the ways that you help them get past that?
Um,

1065
01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:20.710
usually I'll give them,
um,

1066
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:25.660
the Comark like a small doable task.
And give you an example.

1067
01:10:25.661 --> 01:10:29.020
There's an artist that was working on recently who was,

1068
01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:35.340
who hadn't made the album in a long time and was struggling with struggling with

1069
01:10:36.641 --> 01:10:41.480
finishing anything and um,
and just had this like,

1070
01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:45.820
it was a version of a writer's block,
but it was,
uh,
um,

1071
01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.820
<v 3>I don't know,
hard to explain what it was,</v>

1072
01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:54.720
but I would give him very doable homework assignments that almost seemed like a

1073
01:10:55.421 --> 01:10:58.800
joke.
You know,
like tonight I want you to write one word,
you know,

1074
01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:04.230
one word in this song that needs five lines that you can't finish it.

1075
01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:08.680
I just want one word that you like,
but tomorrow,

1076
01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:10.180
do you think you'd come up with one word?

1077
01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:13.470
<v 4>And usually it'd like,
yeah,</v>

1078
01:11:13.471 --> 01:11:17.100
I think I can do one word and then just very quickly by chip,

1079
01:11:17.101 --> 01:11:20.940
by breaking it down into pieces like I learned from layered and chipping away.

1080
01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:22.843
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1081
01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:27.550
<v 4>One step at a time.
You can,
you can really get through anything.</v>

1082
01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.713
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1083
01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.140
<v 4>It's a beach.
We had a um,</v>

1084
01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.160
<v 3>okay.</v>

1085
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.680
<v 4>We had a zip line ziplining um,
you know,
the,
the,</v>

1086
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:44.290
the beam that you balance on Oh,
a slack line,
slack line.

1087
01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:46.190
<v 3>And um,</v>

1088
01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:51.860
<v 4>Laird was pretty good at it in the beginning but had never done it before and he</v>

1089
01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:53.070
would work for hours.

1090
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:57.240
He would just be there hour after hour after are falling off and getting back
on,

1091
01:11:57.241 --> 01:12:01.050
falling off and getting back on.
And then of all of the group of people,

1092
01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:03.510
he was by far the first one who was able to do it.

1093
01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:07.150
And it wasn't because you just naturally was gifted at it.
He's,

1094
01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:12.210
he knows that anything he sets his mind to learn to do if he focuses and just

1095
01:12:12.731 --> 01:12:14.220
continues to,
you know,

1096
01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:18.400
not mind falling off and not thinking he's supposed to be good out of the box.

1097
01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:22.640
Learning to be able to do it and that's how you learn things.
So it's,

1098
01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:24.490
I also will say that

1099
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:30.990
after having a weight problem that I had for so long and then finally finding

1100
01:12:32.231 --> 01:12:34.720
the solution and making the change.

1101
01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:35.940
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1102
01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.510
<v 4>It really makes me believe that anything's possible.
You know,
we can learn,</v>

1103
01:12:39.511 --> 01:12:42.330
we can train ourselves to do absolutely anything.

1104
01:12:42.331 --> 01:12:46.950
It's really just getting the right information,
forget,
get the right information,

1105
01:12:46.951 --> 01:12:50.520
we can learn,
do anything,
whatever it is.
Now,
it doesn't mean we can necessarily,

1106
01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:55.740
<v 3>um,
be the best in the world at something,</v>

1107
01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:59.840
but we can be our best at that thing,
right.

1108
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:04.880
The best version of ourselves and do things that never dreamed of as possible

1109
01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.240
possible for us.

1110
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:10.320
<v 4>What,
uh,
what advice would you give,</v>

1111
01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:14.800
and I'll ask this for a couple of different ages,
but,
uh,
I'll start with,
uh,

1112
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:18.420
your 20 year old self.
What advice would you give your 20 year old self if any?

1113
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:24.380
<v 3>Try to have more fun.</v>

1114
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:31.640
Why do you think you weren't having as much fun as you could have at that point?

1115
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:37.730
I think I was more driven and,

1116
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.923
um,

1117
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:41.303
<v 5>yeah,</v>

1118
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:44.560
<v 4>I want to say almost like I felt like I had something to prove.</v>

1119
01:13:44.561 --> 01:13:46.900
I don't know if I did it have something to prove,
but it felt like

1120
01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:49.890
<v 3>I felt like,
um,</v>

1121
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:55.110
<v 4>doing the work was the most important thing in the world as opposed to</v>

1122
01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:02.870
doing the work and enjoying the process and,
you know,
feeling what it was,

1123
01:14:04.730 --> 01:14:07.490
being able to step back and see what it was,
you know,

1124
01:14:07.491 --> 01:14:09.830
not just be so deeply into it.

1125
01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.740
<v 1>MMM.
Yeah.</v>

1126
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:16.330
I feel like I missed a lot of years of my life because I was just in dark room

1127
01:14:16.331 --> 01:14:17.920
working on music,
you know,

1128
01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:21.970
seven days a week for probably 20 years.
My,

1129
01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:26.190
how I ever called it makes me think of a story from a Neil Gaiman,

1130
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.280
the writer when he,
I think it was with the success of Sandman,

1131
01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:34.290
and he was in a huge line of readers who wanted signatures and fans.

1132
01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:39.130
We wanted to tell him stories and Stephen King pulled him aside and just said,

1133
01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.590
enjoy it.
And he didn't,
he didn't.
Uh,

1134
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.960
he was too caught up in the,
in the flow.
Uh,

1135
01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.330
what about your 30 year old self?

1136
01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.090
What advice would you give to your 30 year old self?

1137
01:14:57.110 --> 01:15:02.110
<v 4>I guess I would probably tell myself something that I still might apply to me</v>

1138
01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:05.860
today.
Um,
I wouldn't have known it at all of it.

1139
01:15:05.861 --> 01:15:10.590
I know it now and just still,
it's not second nature,
but,
um,

1140
01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.113
<v 1>two</v>

1141
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:13.640
<v 4>be kinder to myself.</v>

1142
01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.660
I beat myself up a lot and um,

1143
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:21.310
because they expect a lot from myself.

1144
01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:26.320
I'll be hard on myself and I don't know what I'm doing.

1145
01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:27.760
Anyone any good by doing that.

1146
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:35.430
<v 1>I said I need to give myself as well.
When do you tend to beat yourself up?</v>

1147
01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.480
I,
I've,
I've,
I've made somewhat of a sport of it.
It would seem,

1148
01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.190
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1149
01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:49.190
it can happen any time I can come up with anything that I could be doing

1150
01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.100
to further something

1151
01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.353
<v 0>and</v>

1152
01:15:59.150 --> 01:16:01.790
<v 4>didn't already think of it and didn't already do it,</v>

1153
01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:05.900
I might beat myself up about why,
you know,
why if I had not done that,

1154
01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.410
<v 1>something I struggle with that I'd love to get your 2 cents on and uh,</v>

1155
01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:16.480
is related to this,
which is on one hand I don't want to beat myself up.

1156
01:16:16.481 --> 01:16:17.051
On the other hand,

1157
01:16:17.051 --> 01:16:22.051
I feel like the perfectionism that I have has enabled me to do it,

1158
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:28.250
achieve whatever modicum of success I've been able to achieve.
And I,

1159
01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:31.060
I've heard stories,
and you can correct me if I'm wrong,
but about for instance,

1160
01:16:31.061 --> 01:16:34.730
a Zz top and La for Toyota and uh,

1161
01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.470
you know how they worked on it with you from,

1162
01:16:36.471 --> 01:16:39.610
I guess I want to say what 2008 to 2012,
something like that.

1163
01:16:39.611 --> 01:16:44.430
But how they realized the value of a,

1164
01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.440
you wanting the art to be as perfect as it could be for the best that it could

1165
01:16:49.961 --> 01:16:54.961
be and taking whatever time and pains and necessary to make that possible.

1166
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:59.080
Uh,
so I'd love to hear your thoughts on that because it's something that I

1167
01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:01.660
continually struggle with.
I want to be easier on myself,
but I,

1168
01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.520
I worry that if I do that I will lose whatever magic.

1169
01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:09.800
If there is such a thing that enables me to,
to do what I do.

1170
01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:13.320
<v 3>I think that ultimately the,</v>

1171
01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:17.900
I think that's a myth and I think that um,

1172
01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:24.440
your take on things is specific to you and it's not because of your,

1173
01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.310
you've,

1174
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:29.820
it's almost like you've won the war and to accept the fact that you've won the

1175
01:17:29.821 --> 01:17:34.800
war you have broken through to now you have an audience.
People are open to hear,

1176
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:38.370
hear what you are interested in,
what you learn at,

1177
01:17:38.371 --> 01:17:42.180
what you're interested in learning about and what you want to share.

1178
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:43.823
<v 5>And</v>

1179
01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.793
<v 3>MMM,</v>

1180
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.903
<v 5>you can,</v>

1181
01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:51.910
<v 3>you can do that without killing yourself.</v>

1182
01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:56.650
And that killing yourself won't be of service either to you or to your audience.

1183
01:17:58.530 --> 01:18:03.530
<v 1>All right,
let's uh,
let's,
uh,
this,
this,</v>

1184
01:18:03.531 --> 01:18:07.460
this has been great.
I need ice as well.
Let's,
let's call a close to this.

1185
01:18:07.461 --> 01:18:12.461
Is there any last parting advice or comment that you'd like to make before we

1186
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:13.394
sign off?

1187
01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:19.150
<v 3>I think it's too,
it's too hot for me to know what's even,</v>

1188
01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:23.860
I don't know what's happening,
what's up or down,
very confused at the moment,

1189
01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:26.780
but I know that this ice bath is going to change everything.

1190
01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:32.060
<v 1>All right,
well on the,
on that note,
uh,
thanks so much Rick.
Thank you.</v>

1191
01:18:32.061 --> 01:18:34.690
We will both get some ice.
I'll let you get out first.

1192
01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.350
The Tim Ferriss show is brought to you by on it.

1193
01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.940
I have used on IT products for years.
If you look in my kitchen in my garage,

1194
01:18:46.941 --> 01:18:51.080
you'll find Alpha brain chewable Melatonin for resetting my clock when I'm

traveling.
Kettlebells,
battle ropes,
maces steel clubs.

1196
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:58.190
It sounds like a torture chamber and it kind of is.

1197
01:18:58.191 --> 01:19:02.960
It's a torture chamber for self improvement and you can see all of my favorite

this episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things

1203
01:19:25.791 --> 01:19:27.320
graphic design related.

1204
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:32.330
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers,

1205
01:19:32.331 --> 01:19:36.050
including sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

1206
01:19:36.051 --> 01:19:40.040
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

1207
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.881
the brainstorming.

1208
01:19:40.881 --> 01:19:44.210
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

1209
01:19:44.211 --> 01:19:47.480
works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

1210
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:50.960
a website and APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

1211
01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.680
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

1212
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:57.350
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

1213
01:19:57.590 --> 01:20:01.040
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

1214
01:20:01.041 --> 01:20:02.720
money back.
It's that straightforward,

1215
01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:06.440
and many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

1216
01:20:06.441 --> 01:20:08.820
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,
