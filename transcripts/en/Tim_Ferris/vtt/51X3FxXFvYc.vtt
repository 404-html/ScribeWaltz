00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.820
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.040
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.590
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.350
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,</v>

5
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:29.540
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.450
And my answer is inevitably Athletic Greens,

7
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:34.940
it is your all in one nutritional insurance.

8
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:36.680
I recommended it in the four hour body,

9
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.700
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

10
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.730
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

11
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.200
It just covers all my basis.

12
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.220
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

13
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.050
day,
and you can get 50 oh my gosh,
50% off.
Yes,
50% off.

14
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.080

It's tasty,
but more important,

16
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.110
it will help you not screw up when you're doing your nutritional plannings.

17
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.660
For me,
it just covers the basis,
takes a load off my mind,

18
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.430
puts a lot in my body and check it out.

this episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things

20
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:24.800
graphic design related.

21
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.830
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

22
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.530
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

23
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:37.520
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

24
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.370
the brainstorming.

25
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.690
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

26
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:45.890
works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,
a website,

27
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.470
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

28
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.190
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

29
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.860
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

30
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.520
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

31
00:01:58.521 --> 00:01:59.180
money back.

32
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.960
It's that straightforward and many of you who are listening have already used it

33
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:05.450
and created some amazing things that I'll be sharing in the future.

34
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.090
But in the meantime,
if you want to see some of my competitions,

38
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.510
Hello Ladies and germs.
This is Tim Ferriss and I'd like to ask you,

39
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.810
we're going to get back to that,

40
00:02:28.811 --> 00:02:33.250
but this is another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where my job is to try to

41
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:38.200
deconstruct world class performers to try to identify the things that make them

42
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.370
as good as they are at what they do.
And that is a mouthful of a sentence,

43
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.780
whether that is their morning routines,
their favorite books,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

44
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.810
And this episode is a fun one because we're going to focus on how to use games

45
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.690
to get more done with less stress among many other things.

46
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.140
And my guest is none other than Jane mcgonigal,

47
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.750
h d one of my favorite peeps.

48
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.250
Jane is a senior researcher at the Institute for the future and the author of

49
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:07.300
the New York Times bestseller.

50
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:12.100
Reality is broken subtitle why games make us better and how they can change the

51
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:14.800
world.
Her work has been featured in the economist,

52
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.950
wired the New York Times on and on.

53
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.480
She has been called one of the top 10 innovators to watch by business week and

54
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.350
one of the 100 most creative people in business by fast company.

55
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.490
Her Ted talks on games have been viewed more than 10 million times.

56
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.720
She knows of what she speaks and in this conversation we dig into everything

57
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:39.460
from recovering from head trauma to how you can use candy crush saga to lose

58
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.810
weight.
10 if that's not enough.

59
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.400
We talk about how to use tetris to prevent PTSD or perhaps call of duty to

60
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:49.180
increase empathy and there are many other options.
It's a very,

61
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:53.140
very cool discussion with a lot of science underlying all of it.

62
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.570
Her latest book is super better and I would like to ask you guys a favor.

63
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.860
I got an advance copy.
I've really been enjoying it and testing it.

64
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.910
And I want to ask you to go buy a copy of this book.
So super better.

65
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.050
It's on Amazon,
check it out.

66
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.640
But what is the premise super better offers a revolutionary and science based

67
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:16.840
approach for getting stronger,
happier,
and more resilient.
Like I said,

68
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:21.070
I've been testing it myself and it works not only in my feeling better and,
uh,

69
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:23.950
that's typically a sort of a morning issue or a late at night issue.

70
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:26.530
But I'm having more fun in the process.
And as adults,

71
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:28.510
I think we often lose track of play.

72
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.130
My hope is that this episode will help you to reclaim it.
It's not frivolous.

73
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.080
It can help you get a lot more done with less stress.
So without further ado,

74
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.920
please enjoy my conversation with Jane mcgonigal.

75
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.350
Jane,
welcome to the show.
Thank you Tammy.

76
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.160
I am so excited to finally reconnected,

77
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.200
has been many years and I have enthusiastically watched your sort of your,

78
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.370
your growth and propagation of all these ideas that I hope we'll have a chance

79
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:07.630
to explore in this conversation.
But I missed quite a lot.
Uh,
and we'll,

80
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:09.850
we'll get to,
for instance,
just the,
the,

81
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.890
the head trauma I didn't know anything about.

82
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.050
But before we get to the serious stuff,

83
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.750
tell me about your dogs and the names of your dogs.

84
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.421
<v 3>Well,</v>

85
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:23.421
I have to Shetland sheep dogs and their names actually reflect pretty good

86
00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:28.170
evolution of my sort of work and interest in game design.
So my,

87
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.240
my oldest dog met Jay.

88
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.160
A girl is named after my favorite video game character from grim Fandango.

89
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.830
And uh,

90
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.870
my new puppy Tsonga who's only two is named after my favorite tennis player.

91
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.060
And,
uh,
I think I,

92
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.600
people ask me about games I'm playing and I'm actually playing more tennis and

93
00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:49.434
video games.
Yeah.

94
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.250
<v 1>So when somebody asks you for those people listening who are not familiar with</v>

95
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:56.710
your work,
what do you do?
How do you answer that?

96
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.780
<v 3>I usually lie actually because</v>

97
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.600
<v 1>George Costanza style.</v>

98
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.620
<v 3>Oh yeah.
I mean,
I've told,
I've been in like on an airplane,</v>

99
00:06:04.621 --> 00:06:08.190
someone asked me what I do and I tell them I'm a cab driver and they're like,

100
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.090
why are you flying to China and is this fast enough?
I'll say,
oh,

101
00:06:12.091 --> 00:06:16.590
I'm getting an award for being a really innovative cab driver.
I mean,
I,
I,
uh,

102
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.220
yeah,
it's hard to because it's hard to explain to people,
well,

103
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.260
I researched games and I design games and I tried to design games to help people

104
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.740
be happier and healthier and save the world.
And then,

105
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.260
then you spend the whole eight hour flight,
you know,

106
00:06:31.261 --> 00:06:32.350
answering questions about it.

107
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.710
<v 1>And uh,
well instead of an eight hour flight,</v>

108
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:40.340
we're going to have a long podcast about all of it.
I'm free to,

109
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:45.320
can't dodge me with the taxi driver again,
but this time around.
But is it,

110
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:46.820
am I correct in saying that you're the,
the,

111
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.750
you were the first person to earn a phd studying the psychological strengths of

112
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:51.584
gamers

113
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.970
<v 3>and how they,
and how they can apply them to real life.</v>

114
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So I was the first person to really take seriously the idea that people who,

115
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.280
you know,
spend an hour,
a day or more plain,

116
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.810
particularly video games might have some unique strengths,

117
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.760
cognitive strengths,
social strengths,

118
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.690
imaginative strengths that could be applied to real world problems.

119
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.090
<v 1>And what,
what would some of those problems be in,
of course,
I have some familiar,</v>

120
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.270
familiar already with this because I've,
uh,

121
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.630
I'm a fan of your writing and uh,
I was,
was also a,

122
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.690
an early reader of your first book,

123
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.720
but could you give some examples of what types of real world problems can be,

124
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.160
uh,
either dressed partly,
uh,

125
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.170
partially or solved a potentially by,
by gamers?

126
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.331
<v 3>Sure.
Well,
you know,</v>

127
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:45.860
I've been working with the Institute for the future in Palo Alto for,

128
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.320
oh gosh,
eight,
eight,
nine years now,

129
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.560
and one of my favorite kinds of games to create his future forecasting games.

130
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:59.951
So to invite ordinary people to try to predict their own futures.

131
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.230
And then when you get enough people predicting their own futures,

132
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.840
you can learn some really interesting trends,
sort of,

133
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.770
it's sort of like a collective intelligence project where you might not be able

134
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:14.960
to predict what will happen in the rest of the world.

135
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.310
But if I tell you a short scenario,
you know,
um,

136
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.510
peak oil scenario,
you can very accurately predict what you would do,

137
00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:26.000
how you would get to work,
how you would get your kids to school,
what were you,

138
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:26.834
what you would cook.

139
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.700
And we take all that information and aggregate it to understand how the world

140
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:33.680
might react to different future scenarios

141
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.580
<v 1>kind of game.
So now this is a,
this is very interesting.
I mean,</v>

142
00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:41.580
I know that for instance,
uh,
and you could probably elaborate on this,

143
00:08:41.581 --> 00:08:44.700
but whether you're looking at say protein folding,
right?

144
00:08:44.701 --> 00:08:49.701
You could use excess cash processing power from a gaming units to sort of

145
00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:52.450
collectively,
uh,

146
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.450
handle a lot of very computation,
right?

147
00:08:57.451 --> 00:08:58.650
But in this particular case,

148
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.210
are you getting pinged by hedge fund managers and people like that who want to

149
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:08.211
try to develop investment theses around those types of scenarios?

150
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.440
<v 3>Oh,
sure.
Yeah.
You know,</v>

151
00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:14.441
I was the first game designer to be invited to give a keynote at Davos.

152
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.910
Right.
So there,
there are definitely powerful people interested in these,

153
00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:22.450
although I'm,
I'm happy to say that,
you know,

154
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.110
my work at the Institute for the future,

155
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:29.410
it's a nonprofit organization and we're mostly trying to help the world,

156
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.300
you know,
survive environmental catastrophe and,

157
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.310
and John makes and things like that.
So uh,

158
00:09:37.311 --> 00:09:42.311
have been used more for more for global good then individual profits so far.

159
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.330
<v 1>Well,
I did,
I suppose though there,</v>

160
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:50.331
there could be innocent conversation about how you can utilize both,

161
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.120
right.
Or make them in some,
in some,
in some respect,

162
00:09:55.121 --> 00:09:59.510
a virtuous cycle.
So if you have people who are incentivized,

163
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.520
right,
to help develop games that drive their,
perhaps,

164
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.370
uh,
their own benefit,

165
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:11.090
but at the same time they're facilitating the development of toolkits or

166
00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:15.830
architecture is or whatever that address these larger scale problems facing

167
00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:19.310
humanity.
I don't know.
It's,
it's,
it is,
uh,
it is a very interesting conversation,

168
00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:23.180
but I don't want to take us too far off topic immediately.

169
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.160
Could you please describe to folks,
and this is as much for,
for my,

170
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.620
uh,
add to satisfy my curiosity than anything else,
but the,
the concussion.

171
00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:36.950
So I,
I'm ashamed to say I knew nothing about this.
Uh,

172
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:41.930
but could you describe for people what happened and sort of what,

173
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.210
what happened after that incident?

174
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.840
<v 3>Sure.
Well,
you know,
while it was happening,
not a lot of people knew.</v>

175
00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:52.841
I actually tried to hide it for a long time because I was so impacted by the

176
00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:58.810
concussion that I was afraid I would never be able to work again.
You know,

177
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.790
I was afraid I'd never be able to speak publicly because I couldn't remember

178
00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:04.370
things long enough to put together a talk.

179
00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:07.730
I was in the middle of writing my first book and I thought,
my God,

180
00:11:07.731 --> 00:11:10.550
I'm never going to finish my book.
My publisher isn't going to get,
I mean,
I was,

181
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.600
you know,
I was not,
um,
screaming from the rooftops that a I,

182
00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:17.040
that I was having so many problems,
but uh,

183
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.080
it was even to the summer of 2009 and I was just,

184
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.930
it was just an ordinary day rushing around my apartment and uh,

185
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.500
wound up hitting my head on an open cabinet door.
Okay.

186
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.250
<v 1>Did you like step up?</v>

187
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.800
Did you stand up quickly like the hip and whack your head or how did you go

188
00:11:35.801 --> 00:11:37.080
about,
how do you do here head?

189
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:37.901
<v 3>I did,</v>

190
00:11:37.901 --> 00:11:42.430
I some sometimes people ask me if this was a sports injury and I say yes kind of

191
00:11:42.431 --> 00:11:44.110
because I am a runner,

192
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.550
like a marathon runner and so very strong quads and I just,

193
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.890
I was in such a hurry,
I just use like the full force of my quads power up.

194
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:58.120
And uh,
it was,
it was crazy.
I mean,
literally it was out of,
out of a movie.

195
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.510
My husband was like joking around,
Oh,
you know,
who's the president?

196
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.020
And the only thing I could remember was that it wasn't George Bush.
I'm like,

197
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.550
I know it's not George who was,
but I couldn't,

198
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:09.490
I couldn't even remember who the president was.
So that's when I knew,
okay,

199
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:13.900
this is,
um,
this is bad.
And,
uh,
it,
it was really bad.

200
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.830
So a lot of concussions heal within a week.
But after the first month,

201
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.540
I was still completely can cost.
I mean all day,
every day,
nauseous,
vertigo,

202
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.300
couldn't remember people's names,
lost everything.

203
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:29.190
I would put something down and never find it again.
Um,
and as I,

204
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.080
I couldn't even really get out of bed.
I couldn't talk to people of his,
um,

205
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:37.130
it was a disaster.
And,
uh,
my,
my current work,
my new blog,

206
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.940
my,
my new game,
the clinical trial I'm running,

207
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:44.941
all of that comes out of my attempt to use game design to fix my break.

208
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.240
<v 1>And the,
this is a,</v>

209
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.040
you did a great job of hiding it for those people who were not interacting with

210
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:55.630
you on a daily basis because we had,

211
00:12:55.631 --> 00:13:00.370
we had quite a bit of interaction for reality is broken.

212
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.520
Uh,
and while you were finishing that,

213
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:07.360
so this was happening at the same time that we were interacting.
So,

214
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.780
<v 3>all right.
So that would be fun to dig up the emails and</v>

215
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.110
<v 1>see
if they read like Haikus.</v>

216
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.620
Uh,
wow.
You know,
I um,

217
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.900
had very similar experience last year with Lyme disease for I try to keep it

218
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:24.670
under wraps.
But with,

219
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.180
with respect to the concussion,

220
00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:31.780
can you describe then what followed?
I mean because you,

221
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.940
you had some very dark periods and I,

222
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:39.280
I'd just love to hear how this work that you're doing now,

223
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.550
at least some of it evolved out of that concussion.

224
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.340
<v 3>Sure.
So,
uh,
I,
by the way,</v>

225
00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:49.870
I'm like the world's expert on concussions now because I've learned every bit of

226
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.850
research that has ever been done.

227
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:56.851
So one of the things I learned is that there is a 30 day window for recovering

228
00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.190
from concussion.
Most people recover within 30 days.

229
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.200
And if you miss that window,

230
00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:05.500
then they tell you that the next window is three months.

231
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.100
And then if you miss that window,
if you're still having all these symptoms,

232
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.990
then it's likely to be a year.

233
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.660
And if you are still totally symptomatic in a year,

234
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:15.920
then you may have the symptoms forever.
Um,

235
00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:20.410
and that was something I learned on day 34 of my concussion.

236
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.630
Um,
when my doctor told me,
Oh,
you know,

237
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:26.410
you've sort of sort of miss the first window of recovery of 30 days,

238
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:30.790
so that's good drag out for three months.
And at that point,
you know,

239
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.570
you have to imagine I couldn't do anything.
Uh,

240
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.120
I mean you're basically on bed rest but you can't,

241
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.890
I couldn't watch TV unless it was episodes I'd seen before because I would get

242
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:43.240
really confused by the plot.

243
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.150
Like I remember watching an episode of TV and was just like,

244
00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:50.380
who are these characters?
I can't keep it straight.
Um,
so you can't do anything.

245
00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:53.320
You can't go running,
you're not,
you can't drink coffee cause it,

246
00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.250
it aggravates the symptoms.
Um,

247
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:58.430
so I was more depressed and then ever been in my life.

248
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:01.070
I was super anxious that I would never work again.
And you know,

249
00:15:01.071 --> 00:15:03.020
my husband had just been laid off from his job.

250
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.580
So the only upside of that was that he was able to say at home and care for me.

251
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:12.560
But the downside being neither one of us was working.
Um,
and so I was just,

252
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:12.831
I mean,

253
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:17.831
it's a total mess and sometime in that first 30 days I also,

254
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.500
to make things even more dramatic and awful started to have suicidal ideation,

255
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.730
which,
um,
you know,
just meant that I was sort of hearing new voices in my head.

256
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.170
Um,
you want to,
you should kill yourself.
You're never going to get better.

257
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.410
You're going to be a burden to your family.
Um,
this,
you know,

258
00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:40.550
every day is going to be this awful for the rest of your life.
Just get out now.

259
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.360
Um,

260
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.130
and I did not know at the time how they found out later that this is actually

261
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:48.230
really common,
the traumatic brain injuries,

262
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:52.130
that it happens to one in three people who even just from a mild concussion,

263
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:56.210
one in three people will have suicidal thoughts,
which first of all,

264
00:15:56.211 --> 00:16:00.140
we should tell everybody.
Because when it starts to happen to you,
it's,

265
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.200
it's such a relief to know that it's not your brain actually wanting to die,

266
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.350
right.
That it's just,
it's just the neurochemistry of the brain.

267
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:13.370
Your dopamine levels are,
I mean zero out.
You literally,

268
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:17.540
your brain cannot imagine any positive outcomes in the future.

269
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.540
You have no access to dope mean and so literally it is impossible to imagine

270
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.050
anything good ever happening again while the brain's trying to heal.
Um,

271
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.700
so this was like,
this is where I went and I was,
I was basically,
you know,

272
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:35.810
worried that I was going to kill myself and,
and,
and,
and then my doctor was like,

273
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.630
Oh yeah,
and you've missed the window of recovery here.
So,
you know,

274
00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.540
good luck for another three months.
And if,
you know,
it may be,

275
00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:45.230
it will be like this forever.
Um,
so that,
that was,
that was where things went.

276
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:46.530
That was,
that was rock bottom.

277
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.500
<v 1>And
how did you dig yourself out of that?
I mean,</v>

278
00:16:51.501 --> 00:16:56.501
what were the conversations or interactions that allowed you to get out of that

279
00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:00.440
hole?
Because there are people who don't get out of it.
Right.
And like you said,

280
00:17:00.441 --> 00:17:03.500
it's important to have these conversations so that people can view it as a

281
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.980
collective symptom and not a personal,

282
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:12.440
singular individualized flaw.
But how did you,

283
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.410
how did you start turning the corner?
What was it?

284
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.860
<v 3>There were two key things going on that summer that really helped me.</v>

285
00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:23.780
So the first was I had been writing my book,
the first book,
reality is broken,
uh,

286
00:17:23.781 --> 00:17:28.700
which is all about how games make us happy and there's happiness engines.

287
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.560
And I thought,
well,
shit,
this is this.
I should really,

288
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.310
really,
really tough the series out,
you know,
take this really seriously.

289
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.750
Because if anything could jumpstart my brain into being happy,

290
00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:43.200
even though they'll bring,

291
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.920
was zeroed out and in my brain was telling you I want it to die,
well,

292
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:49.650
games should be able to do it.
Um,
the other thing that was going on that was,

293
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:52.950
I was watching,
uh,
rewatching the entire Buffy the vampire,
right?

294
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.930
<v 1>You just learn so much dork credit.
Yeah.</v>

295
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.950
<v 3>Because,
because I knew all the episodes so well,
so it wasn't taxing to my brain.</v>

296
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.640
So,
um,
so it was watching Buffy and I just decided,
you know,

297
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:11.790
I'm going to try to turn this recovery process into more of a game because I

298
00:18:12.551 --> 00:18:17.200
know games make us more optimistic and motivated and,
and it's,
you know,

299
00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:20.660
it's easier to ask people for help when we're playing a game.
Uh,
and it's,

300
00:18:20.661 --> 00:18:24.430
so I decided to just invent this game called Jane the concussion slayer.

301
00:18:24.431 --> 00:18:28.060
And I was going to be like Buffy the vampire slayer who did not choose to be

302
00:18:28.061 --> 00:18:31.000
this layer right feet,
just the rested upon her.

303
00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.210
And she had to just step up to the OIC occasion and,

304
00:18:34.211 --> 00:18:39.130
and I was going to step up to my own her vogue occasion and treat all of these

305
00:18:39.131 --> 00:18:43.700
symptoms like demons and vampires and,
and just be a bad ass.

306
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.090
That was a,
that,

307
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.100
and that was a start of a game that I played for the rest of the year and that

308
00:18:50.951 --> 00:18:55.570
now half a million people have played and that we just ran a big clinical trial

309
00:18:55.571 --> 00:18:58.150
on.
So,
um,
it's been,
and that was,

310
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:03.300
it's been almost six years that that kind of crazy idea has been developing into

311
00:19:04.151 --> 00:19:06.640
something much,
much,
much bigger now.

312
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.370
<v 1>And I feel like Rip Van Winkle,</v>

313
00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:11.370
I'm so embarrassed that we haven't talked about this before.

314
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:13.860
I got an early copy of the new book,
which by the way,

315
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:19.250
I should just say it's super better that I get sent a lot of books and my

316
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:22.380
assistant sees all of these books.

317
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.310
And this is the first time that she said to me,
uh,

318
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.240
when you're finished with that book,
I'd like you to give it to me.

319
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.410
Oh,
uh,
very,
uh,
very,
very fascinating.
And I'm,

320
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.730
I'm already,
uh,
into the book,
which is saying a lot because it's a,

321
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.800
it's one,
uh,
you know,
I get 20,

322
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:47.230
30 bucks a week and this is the one that I'm focusing on right now.
And,
uh,

323
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.890
it's partially because I want to fix my own problems.
Right.

324
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.020
And in reading the introduction,

325
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.440
you talk about being gameful,

326
00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.120
and I'd love for you to talk about that and then also just talk about the first,

327
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:05.070
uh,
incarnation of the game as you played it for yourself.

328
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.380
<v 3>Sure.
Well,</v>

329
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:10.370
I am excited you want to talk about what it means to be gainful because I feel

330
00:20:10.371 --> 00:20:15.371
like this is a really good opportunity to kind of set the record straight about

331
00:20:16.971 --> 00:20:21.680
something that makes me crazy,
which is the topic of gamification.

332
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.810
Ah,
yeah.
I,
you know,

333
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.780
the idea that you can just give people points for doing stuff and that's going

334
00:20:28.781 --> 00:20:32.000
to motivate them and give them achievement badges and that's gonna make them

335
00:20:32.001 --> 00:20:33.230
feel proud.

336
00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:37.820
And it's like a very simplistic notion of motivation and reward.

337
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.290
And I don't do it.
Um,
even though like if you look up gamification on Wikipedia,

338
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.590
it's like Jane Mcgonigal,
right?

339
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.473
<v 1>He turned,</v>

340
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.130
<v 3>no,
I never,
did</v>

341
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.430
<v 1>you see that word in my book?
No,
I don't do it.
Uh,
I like to think of that.</v>

342
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.460
I find when I get motivational speaker and I'm like,
Oh my God,

343
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.200
I've got to live with that one forever.
Okay.

344
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.370
<v 3>Um,
but so,</v>

345
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.480
so this book is really about something totally different,

346
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.790
which is the game full mindset,

347
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.910
which is a way of approaching obstacles and stress that most of us naturally

348
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:15.850
adopt when we play games,

349
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.030
when we play sports or we're doing puzzles and board games,
card games,

350
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:19.864
video games,

351
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.250
almost every single person on this planet and throughout history has been able

352
00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:29.230
to adopt a very powerful mindset that makes us better able to learn from our

353
00:21:29.231 --> 00:21:32.200
mistakes.
More determined in the face of obstacles,

354
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.810
better able to amass resources from other people,

355
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:39.100
build allies and all these really wonderful things that help us solve problems.

356
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.970
But few of us use that same mindset in everyday life.

357
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:44.410
Like we only use it in games.

358
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.210
And so that's what I've been researching since my brain heal,
you know,

359
00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.053
took about a year.

360
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.770
That's been the new research topic that I've been obsessed with,

361
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.980
which is how do we help people take all the benefits of a gameful mindset,

362
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.510
which mean you're more creative,
you're less likely to give up,

363
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.920
you've got better social support,
you know,
more curiosity,
more optimism,

364
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:12.100
all these wonderful things.
How do we bring that into the real world?

365
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:16.900
And it doesn't necessarily mean gamifying anything.

366
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:17.300
Um,

367
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:22.270
is it turns out that's the most important thing you can do to really access your

368
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:25.930
gameful mindset is to play games,

369
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:31.050
any games that you like and then remember to call on those same strengths in

370
00:22:31.331 --> 00:22:31.970
real life.

371
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:36.970
<v 1>So how did you do that then initially when digging yourself out of this hole?</v>

372
00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.450
And I think it's,
it's,
it's also important.
Um,

373
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.280
I think a lot of people listening are like,
wow,

374
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:47.540
like they're imagining sitting in front of a screen playing Zelda or a first

375
00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:49.730
person shooter game or something like that.
But what did,

376
00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:53.660
what did you do concretely for yourself in the,
in,
in the beginning,

377
00:22:53.661 --> 00:22:54.830
and then how has that evolved?

378
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.051
<v 3>Right.
I mean,
it,</v>

379
00:22:56.051 --> 00:23:01.051
it really wasn't even a game so much as it was a process for being gameful in

380
00:23:02.511 --> 00:23:05.990
everyday life.
So,
you know,
the first thing I did was adopt this secret identity,

381
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.490
right?
Jane,
the concussion slayer.

382
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:11.600
And the idea behind that is it was just like an Avatar for real life.
You know,

383
00:23:11.601 --> 00:23:15.520
when we have avatars and video games were really focused on,
you know,

384
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.210
what are they good at,
what are their strengths,

385
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.260
how can I level up those strengths?
What are their special secret weapons?

386
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.960
How do they use them?
And we're very focused on strengths and,
and the,

387
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.240
the skill sets.
And so I wanted to start focusing on,
you know,

388
00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:33.410
what are my strengths and skill sets even though I feel completely hopeless and

389
00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:36.110
helpless and like I can't do a single thing,
right?
Um,

390
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.890
to adopt that kind of Avatar for everyday life.
And,
uh,

391
00:23:39.891 --> 00:23:41.960
it was not a digital avatar on a screen.

392
00:23:41.961 --> 00:23:44.960
It was literally me just telling people I'm Jane the concussion.

393
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.980
And as it turns out,
now that I've done all this research,
uh,

394
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:55.210
literally just talking about yourself in the third person with a focus on your

395
00:23:55.611 --> 00:23:59.960
strengths is this incredible kind of brain hack that,
I mean,
it,

396
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.930
it changes so much in terms of anxiety and depression.

397
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.530
I said that that was the first thing that I did.
So there's this sort of Avatar.

398
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.660
<v 1>So when you would go like get a cup of tea at Starbucks and they're like,</v>

399
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:11.810
what's your name?
Miss?
No,
but,
but,

400
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.320
but is this something that,
who would you use that name with?

401
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.720
<v 3>Um,
you know,
I first started just with my closest inner circle.
Um,
you know,</v>

402
00:24:19.721 --> 00:24:21.940
I called my sister,
my twin sister Kelly,

403
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.410
who is a psychology professor at Stanford University by the way.
So,
um,

404
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.310
I got a lot of good tips from her and,
uh,
you know,
I'm like,
oh,

405
00:24:30.311 --> 00:24:33.760
I'm playing this game to heal my brain.
I want you to play it with me.

406
00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:38.080
I'm going to be Jane the concussion slayer and I want you to be my watcher.
Um,

407
00:24:38.081 --> 00:24:42.700
so I actually adopted the mythology from the Buffy series to give everybody of

408
00:24:42.701 --> 00:24:47.590
my life like a particular ally role to play.
So,
you know,

409
00:24:47.591 --> 00:24:52.090
if you remember Buffy,
her watcher Giles,
he would oversee her training.

410
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.030
So my sister's job was to give me one thing to do every day,

411
00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.650
like a little quests or mission,

412
00:24:56.651 --> 00:25:00.000
and then she would call me the next day to see how I did.
Um,

413
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.700
and that was actually amazing because I had not really done anything

414
00:25:03.701 --> 00:25:08.470
successfully until she started giving me missions.
We did stupid things like,

415
00:25:08.471 --> 00:25:09.400
um,
okay.

416
00:25:09.401 --> 00:25:12.670
Can you see out the window from the bed that you are not able to get out of?
Yes.

417
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.900
Okay.
I want you to look out the window and uh,
find one interesting thing.

418
00:25:16.901 --> 00:25:19.810
Like try to see one interesting thing and tell me about it tomorrow.

419
00:25:19.811 --> 00:25:23.790
You want me to talk like spot something kind of crazy outside your window.
Um,

420
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.860
and then,
then I,
then I'll be able to have a sense of purpose for the day.

421
00:25:26.861 --> 00:25:29.810
Like I'm lying in bed with nothing to do,
but I have a,

422
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.950
I have a goal now I have a mission.
Um,
and it turns out,

423
00:25:32.951 --> 00:25:37.870
I learned from all my research later that having a clear goal and being able to

424
00:25:37.871 --> 00:25:40.450
anticipate succeeding in that goal,

425
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.100
that's one of the fastest ways to get the dopamine back cycling through your

426
00:25:45.101 --> 00:25:50.050
brain,
which is,
which is key to reversing depression.
Um,
so,

427
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.080
uh,
so even just being given a little tiny class,
it's like you just like a,

428
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.330
it's a good,
it's a good role playing game like world of Warcraft.

429
00:25:55.331 --> 00:25:57.580
He has here's somebody comes up to you and says,
I have request for you.

430
00:25:57.581 --> 00:26:01.690
Do you accept it and you and you agree to do it.
Um,
that's like,

431
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.480
that's also like a brain hack where you're just,
um,

432
00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:09.040
spiking the Zopa mean levels and learning to anticipate success again.

433
00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:14.130
<v 1>Well,
that's a,
you know,
I've,
I've been thinking a lot about</v>

434
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.500
resource allocation that's the most boring lag it possibly put it.

435
00:26:19.501 --> 00:26:22.200
But I've been thinking about how people allocate different currencies,
right?

436
00:26:22.201 --> 00:26:25.950
Time,
income and so on.

437
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:29.400
And uh,
looking at the difference,
for instance,

438
00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:34.401
between buying possessions or experiences and the,

439
00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:40.650
the data very strongly support the psychological superiority of buying

440
00:26:41.041 --> 00:26:42.480
experiences,
generally speaking,

441
00:26:42.481 --> 00:26:47.481
because the value of a purchase decreases very quickly.

442
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:48.220
I mean,
it's,

443
00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.570
it's like driving a new car off the lot and suddenly it's depreciate it 30%.

444
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.110
But when you plan,
and I experienced this last year for myself,

445
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.580
when you plan a and let's say a trip six months from now,

446
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:04.440
you have those six months of anticipation.
And I recently took,

447
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.880
uh,
took my family on,
on our first real family outing and many,
many,

448
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:12.990
many years,
uh,
and the,
we went to Iceland,

449
00:27:12.991 --> 00:27:16.230
but it was something that we planned for Christmas and new years and we had a

450
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:18.670
good five or six months to look forward to it.

451
00:27:18.671 --> 00:27:23.550
And it w it just made all of the bumps along the way,
uh,

452
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.990
c minor and,
and,
uh,
very easily overcome.

453
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:31.950
So putting that and it just gave us some,

454
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.700
some North Star to look towards when the going got rough.
Right.

455
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.200
So what other,
what other aspects,
uh,
or what other features did you,

456
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.530
did you build into your life?
So you had your sister.

457
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.160
<v 3>All right.
So secret identity,</v>

458
00:27:45.161 --> 00:27:50.161
you have allies that you recruit and then you have these quests that your allies

459
00:27:50.231 --> 00:27:55.150
give you.
Um,
we also collected and activated power.
So,
uh,

460
00:27:55.151 --> 00:27:57.910
in this,
in the system power ups or anything,

461
00:27:57.911 --> 00:28:02.410
they give you a quick burst of a positive emotion.
Um,
any,

462
00:28:02.411 --> 00:28:05.830
any feeling at all.
It could be pleasure.
It could be,
you know,

463
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.710
laughter can be delight,
whatever.

464
00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.520
And so I started collecting,
you know,

465
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.890
like cuddling with my dog for 10 minutes.
Um,

466
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.030
what would be a power up or,
uh,
listening to,
uh,

467
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.260
like a powerful song that made me feel powerful or eating walnuts because that

468
00:28:23.261 --> 00:28:25.450
was supposed to be good for bringing healing.

469
00:28:25.451 --> 00:28:29.680
And so just trying to identify things you could do and Justin like a minute or

470
00:28:29.681 --> 00:28:34.300
two to create a positive experience.
Um,
which,
you know,

471
00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:39.160
having a traumatic brain injury is kind of an extreme example of needing power

472
00:28:39.161 --> 00:28:44.161
ups because you otherwise literally you just lie there in a state of abject just

473
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.470
boredom or frustration.
Um,

474
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:51.760
but making sure that you have these tiny moments of positive emotions.

475
00:28:51.761 --> 00:28:54.950
Because as I've learned now in all my research,
um,

476
00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.080
happiness and success and in good health can coexist with all kinds of negative

477
00:29:02.561 --> 00:29:03.161
emotions.

478
00:29:03.161 --> 00:29:07.060
And you don't actually have to get rid of your negative emotions to be really

479
00:29:07.061 --> 00:29:08.080
successful and thriving.

480
00:29:08.081 --> 00:29:11.190
You just have to balance them out with positive emotions.

481
00:29:11.191 --> 00:29:15.160
So the most I was like happy and successful people actually have more negative

482
00:29:15.161 --> 00:29:19.720
emotions then people who are depressed or anxious or or struggling,

483
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:24.170
um,
they just managed to balance them out with even more positive emotion.

484
00:29:24.171 --> 00:29:27.070
So these power ups are just a way to kind of gain the math.

485
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.860
Every time you feel something really bad,

486
00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.970
you try to do a couple of quick things that will make you feel happy,

487
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.010
<v 1>right.
To offset it,
to tilt the balance in your favor.
And,</v>

488
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:39.590
and how's that?

489
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:44.310
What is the current game look like?
Uh,

490
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.180
when you have people,
for instance,

491
00:29:46.181 --> 00:29:49.660
seeing measurable improvements within two weeks and even bigger improvements

492
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.040
between four to six weeks have hundreds of thousands of people who've played.

493
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.030
What is the current state of that game or the format?

494
00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:03.710
<v 4>So there's a website and there is an app and it's a,
again,</v>

495
00:30:03.711 --> 00:30:05.160
it's not a video game.
It's,

496
00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:10.180
it's like a life management tool where we walk you through the process of,

497
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.550
Hey,
do you think you might have a secret identity?

498
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.320
Here are some ways that you can investigate it.
You know,
we,

499
00:30:16.321 --> 00:30:18.620
we have you think about who your heroes are,

500
00:30:18.621 --> 00:30:21.800
your favorite fictional character is,
are what your strengths are.

501
00:30:21.801 --> 00:30:24.650
And until you are able to craft one,
we ask you to collect power ups.
We,

502
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.400
we find out more about you and we say,
Oh,
you're trying to lose weight.

503
00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:33.580
Okay here are 10 power ups that we validated to be really helpful for other

504
00:30:33.651 --> 00:30:34.131
players.

505
00:30:34.131 --> 00:30:39.131
Or here are 10 bad guys that we know that people who are struggling with anxiety

506
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.210
that also struggle with and strategies for,
for wrestling with them.

507
00:30:44.211 --> 00:30:45.380
So we have bad guys also.

508
00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:50.390
And so we just kind of walk you through the process of looking at your life as

509
00:30:50.391 --> 00:30:53.450
if it were a game.
So it's almost like you're the game designer.

510
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:58.070
You craft your secret identity,
you pick your power ups and define your bad guys.

511
00:30:58.071 --> 00:30:58.220
And,

512
00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:03.050
and you eventually create your own quest and get the help of your own allies,

513
00:31:03.051 --> 00:31:03.830
who you invite.

514
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.890
And we just sort of teach you the process of thinking and living like a game

515
00:31:06.891 --> 00:31:09.260
designer by offering you,
here's some,

516
00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.350
here's some sample powerups and bad guys in class to get started.
Okay.

517
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.590
<v 1>And let's,
let's,
uh,
let's talk about,
I mean,</v>

518
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:17.560
I'm going to come back to the power ups because I think for those people who

519
00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:19.570
haven't played games,
uh,

520
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:24.190
it might be easy to dismiss these things as childish,

521
00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:27.190
but I have,
uh,
did some personal experimentation today,
which was,

522
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.790
which was pretty fun with some of your exercises.
But let's,

523
00:31:30.791 --> 00:31:35.590
let's talk about some games that people might be familiar with.

524
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.720
Uh,
for instance,
uh,
the candy crush saga,
right?
Yes.
And,

525
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:45.340
uh,
so I've,
uh,
I've read you are,
I've,

526
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:51.250
I've noticed that candy crush saga has been talked about is being used to lose

527
00:31:51.251 --> 00:31:54.430
weight in some cases.
And I wanted to just hear you elaborate on that.

528
00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.330
<v 4>So this is amazing.</v>

529
00:31:56.331 --> 00:32:00.860
There are so many games now that people are playing every day and have no idea

530
00:32:00.861 --> 00:32:02.880
that they're powerful life changing tools.

531
00:32:02.881 --> 00:32:07.470
So kindergarten saga has a half a billion people have played this game,
uh,

532
00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.750
and like 0.0,
zero,
zero.

533
00:32:11.751 --> 00:32:16.640
1% of them know that there have been these clinical studies showing that a game

534
00:32:16.641 --> 00:32:21.641
like candy crush saga can reduce cravings for things like food or cigarettes by

535
00:32:22.521 --> 00:32:26.930
25%.
Um,
which sounds like not a lot,

536
00:32:26.931 --> 00:32:30.860
but it's actually been shown to be enough of a reduction of the craving that you

537
00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:34.550
can make a better choice as a sort of gives your willpower a fighting chance.

538
00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:35.391
And uh,

539
00:32:35.391 --> 00:32:40.370
the way it works is the game is so visually intensive,

540
00:32:40.371 --> 00:32:43.250
right?
So a game like candy crush saga or bejeweled or Tetris,

541
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.080
the kind of games where when you walk away,

542
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.970
you see the sort of visual flashbacks,

543
00:32:46.971 --> 00:32:50.950
you see the blocks falling or you see that the pieces swapping,
um,

544
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.280
they occupied the visual processing center of your brain so that you can not

545
00:32:55.281 --> 00:32:57.380
imagine the thing that you're craving.

546
00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.530
And it turns out that cravings are very visual.

547
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.410
If you've anyone who's ever had a craving knows you,

548
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.130
imagine what you want and the more that you've see it in your mind's eye,

549
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.110
the more irresistible the craving is.

550
00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:13.450
So it turns out you can just get your brain to stop picturing it and obsess it

551
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.900
with some other visual process.
You can block cravings,

552
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:19.310
not just while you're playing,

553
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.730
but afterwards because he's games have been shown to create this kind of visual

554
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:23.541
flashbacks.

555
00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:26.750
Your brain thinks it still needs to keep working on this problem because you

556
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:28.250
were so focused on it.

557
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:33.170
So your brain is going to keep working on this visual process and even hours

558
00:33:33.171 --> 00:33:37.010
after you've walked away from the game does that can last you three,
four hours.

559
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.690
You've played just for 10 minutes,

560
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.900
but your brain is no longer obsessing over the thing that you were craving a,

561
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.180
it's,
it's like,
it's fascinating.
They're like so many studies like this.

562
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.030
This is one of the reasons why I want to try it.
The book,
and you,
Tim,

563
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:52.340
you actually inspired me because when,
you know,

564
00:33:52.341 --> 00:33:55.670
when I read the four hour body and you were like,
people,

565
00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.450
there's all this amazing science and you should be experimenting with it in your

566
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:01.940
own life.
And you know,
that's,

567
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:06.020
that's kind of where game research is now too.
It's,
you know,

568
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.100
people still have a little bit of skepticism and,
and rightly so because,

569
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:14.120
you know,
we haven't tested the candy crush saga diet over 10 years with,

570
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.470
you know,
10,000 people.

571
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.900
But it's so easy to task in your own life and with no downside,

572
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:25.850
most of these games are completely free to play.
Um,
and so I'm just like,

573
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:30.560
wow,
people should be experimenting with this in their own lives because studies

574
00:34:30.561 --> 00:34:31.341
there are,
you know,

575
00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:34.820
I think this book sites a thousand peer reviewed scientific studies.

576
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.940
So there is a lot of research.
Um,

577
00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.170
we just need to help people get their hands on it.

578
00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:43.930
<v 1>So,
well,
thank you for the foreign body,</v>

579
00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:49.640
uh,
uh,
kind words.
I appreciate that.
I mean the,
uh,

580
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.850
I,
I sometimes push it so far that,
you know,

581
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.880
I hope it serves as a cautionary tale to others,

582
00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:01.720
but a,
you know,
I'm like,
well,
let me be the guy who's a,
you know,

583
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.670
it's sort of getting himself perfused in,

584
00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.090
in any number of ways so that you don't have to be that person.
But the,

585
00:35:08.091 --> 00:35:12.250
the candy crush Saga Diet,
let's talk about that.
Or let's just,
let's say,

586
00:35:12.251 --> 00:35:12.611
you know,

587
00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:17.611
you smoke when you go out and drink and if the effects last like three to four

588
00:35:17.621 --> 00:35:17.891
hours,

589
00:35:17.891 --> 00:35:22.891
does that mean that a potential prescription would be to play candy crush saga

590
00:35:23.561 --> 00:35:28.210
for say 15 minutes before you head out for Friday night?
I mean,

591
00:35:28.211 --> 00:35:31.030
is that that the way that it might be used as an intervention?

592
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.260
<v 4>Yeah,
absolutely.
Um,
and that's,</v>

593
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.440
that is a reoccurring finding in a lot of these studies is that a short dose of

594
00:35:38.671 --> 00:35:42.150
play can provide this kind of,
uh,

595
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:47.190
these preventative benefits for hours or even one of the studies I write about

596
00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:49.110
in the book two hours of game play,

597
00:35:49.111 --> 00:35:54.060
change the players' behavior for three months afterwards.
Um,
yes,

598
00:35:54.061 --> 00:35:57.810
I don't know if you've gotten to the chapter yet about the cancer patients who,

599
00:35:57.811 --> 00:35:59.400
um,
we're,

600
00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:04.550
we're better able to take all their chemotherapy medicine because they played a

601
00:36:05.191 --> 00:36:07.910
video game.
Have you?
Oh,

602
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:13.750
the game is called remission.
Um,
and yeah,
and uh,

603
00:36:13.751 --> 00:36:16.920
there's actually SQL that's out now too,
which is awesome.

604
00:36:16.921 --> 00:36:20.970
And they're all free to play the remission games.
So if you know anybody,

605
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:25.320
anyone who's listening who has a friend or family member or is battling cancer,

606
00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:29.330
this game has been shown in a clinical trials to improve,
um,

607
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.720
the patients,
first of all,
optimism and self efficacy.

608
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.480
They don't feel so powerless in the face of cancer,

609
00:36:36.481 --> 00:36:41.481
but also to increase the doses of chemotherapy that they're able to,

610
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.270
uh,
take when you're,
if certain kinds of cancers like leukemia,

611
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:50.180
you have to take these pills for two years,
three years at home,
ongoing basis.
Um,

612
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.750
the following kinds of side effects.
And,
uh,
almost,
uh,
more,

613
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:59.460
more than a third of patients miss a significant number of doses because of the

614
00:36:59.461 --> 00:37:03.750
side effects are because it's really hard to never miss a pill on schedule over

615
00:37:03.751 --> 00:37:05.090
two to three years.
Um,

616
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:10.020
but they know that more than 80% of cases where the cancer comes back is related

617
00:37:10.021 --> 00:37:13.770
to miss doses.
So if you can get people to not miss any doses,

618
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:18.450
you have dramatically improved their recovery outcomes.
And then,

619
00:37:18.451 --> 00:37:21.630
so this group called hope lab in Palo Alto,
uh,

620
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.800
created a game designed to basically,

621
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.300
they didn't know what they were doing,

622
00:37:27.301 --> 00:37:31.860
but they basically hacked these patients' brains to change how they viewed

623
00:37:31.861 --> 00:37:34.890
themselves and how they viewed chemotherapy so that they started to view it as

624
00:37:34.891 --> 00:37:39.420
empowering rather than something that made them sick or that they hated.

625
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:44.630
And it was able to hack into their hippocampus and the cottage and Thalamus,

626
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:48.240
which we know are related to motivation and not giving up.

627
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.860
And they know this because they did brain scans of the players and had them an

628
00:37:51.861 --> 00:37:55.840
Fmri machines and looking at their brains while they played the game.
Um,

629
00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:00.000
so they could see what was actually going on to change their behavior over a

630
00:38:00.001 --> 00:38:03.090
three month period.
Um,
but the upshot is that,
you know,

631
00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:06.930
when they measured their blood,
um,
three months later,

632
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:12.290
the cancer patients who had played remission for as little as two hours had 41%

633
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.720
more chemotherapy medicine in their bloodstream and they had missed 18 or 19%

634
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:23.250
fewer doses of antibiotics as well,

635
00:38:23.251 --> 00:38:27.720
which they use electronic pill cap monitors to measure.
Um,
and uh,

636
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:31.560
and,
and that was over three month period,
two hours of playing the video game.
Um,

637
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:36.070
this is a big clinical trial they ran with dozens of hospitals around the United

638
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.210
States.
Um,
so it,
it's amazing that these games exist.
Um,

639
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.230
and that I think,

640
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.740
I think something like a quarter of a million cancer patients have,

641
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.690
have been given access to these games now,

642
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:50.440
but you kind of want every cancer patient to get access to them.

643
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:54.520
Right,
exactly.
That's the thing about games as treatment.

644
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.880
There is extremely little risk of negative side effects or a kind of opportunity

645
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:06.400
costs you cause you can do a game alongside traditional therapy for depression

646
00:39:06.401 --> 00:39:07.780
or if you know,
you feel like you want to,

647
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:12.810
you have some kind of pharmaceutical solution that you're pursuing games really

648
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.380
at no downside.
Um,
and all upside.

649
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.350
Let's talk about just a couple of other games.

650
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:26.110
Tetris and call of duty.
Can this be used in any particular way?

651
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.600
Yeah.
Tetris.
Oh byway.

652
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:33.660
So exciting because literally yesterday a new study came out about Tetris that

653
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.110
validates the studies that I write about in the book.

654
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.100
And I was so excited because people have actually been a little bit skeptical

655
00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:45.940
about when I encourage people to play Tetris to help prevent post traumatic

656
00:39:45.941 --> 00:39:49.690
stress disorder.
I wish I will now explain how that works.
Uh,
people are like,

657
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.020
oh that could be really dangerous to tell people to do that because what if they

658
00:39:53.021 --> 00:39:56.050
never see a therapist because they think they've cured themselves with tetris.

659
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:58.210
Right.
So,
cause you always have to preface this by saying,

660
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.930
if you're having problems,
you know,
you should see a doctor or a therapist.

661
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.920
But um,

662
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:07.920
it turns out that if you play tetris within six hours of witnessing a traumatic

663
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:10.210
event,

664
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:15.100
so they've only tested it on witnessing trauma rather than,
you know,

665
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:18.550
you yourself were traumatized directly.
Um,
but if you,

666
00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:24.070
if you play Tetris for 10 minutes after witnessing a trauma,

667
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:29.100
it prevents flashbacks and lowers symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder

668
00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:30.671
afterwards.

669
00:40:30.671 --> 00:40:35.380
And it's really actually very similar to how the candy crush Saga Diet works.

670
00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:40.360
Um,
in that visual.
Exactly,
exactly.

671
00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:45.361
It prevents your brain from kind of a obsessing over what you saw.

672
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.770
And what's amazing is this new study that just came out this week shows that if

673
00:40:50.771 --> 00:40:52.300
you miss that six hour window,

674
00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:55.600
because it's one of the reasons why people were skeptical was who's going to

675
00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:59.510
remember to play tetris within six hours of a trauma.
Um,

676
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.770
even though I've been doing my best to kind of create public service

677
00:41:02.771 --> 00:41:06.340
announcements so people know,
kind of like stop,
drop and roll.

678
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.350
If you catch on fire,
you remember that stop,
drop and roll.
Right.

679
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.880
So I'm trying to,
I'm trying to like drill into people's heads,
you know,

680
00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:17.050
play Tetris,
don't replay the trauma,
like play,
don't replay.
Um,
if you were like,

681
00:41:17.051 --> 00:41:19.390
nobody's going to remember after trauma to play.

682
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:24.510
So now they have found out that you can actually wait 24 hours and if you re

683
00:41:25.031 --> 00:41:26.260
stimulate the memory,

684
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:31.350
you ask somebody to visualize the trauma that for just a minute or two.

685
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.900
So it's kind of fresh in their brain.
The brain is accessing those memories and,

686
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:40.550
and dealing with them directly.
And then you go play Tetris for 10 minutes.

687
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:45.680
You can kind of,
you're not erasing the memory overriding it.
Well it's,

688
00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:49.700
it's interesting.
So this is super critical detail.

689
00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.540
You can still recall the experience if you're asked questions,

690
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.300
you can remember details of the experience.
So it's not like the,

691
00:41:56.301 --> 00:41:59.000
it's not like I'm eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.

692
00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:01.040
You can see you can silver member,

693
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:06.250
but your brain is not forcing you to think about it when you don't want to.

694
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:11.120
So it's voluntary recall only.
And so this new study shows you can wait 24 hours,

695
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.260
prime yourself by thinking about it and then play touches her 10 minutes right

696
00:42:15.261 --> 00:42:20.150
afterwards.
Um,
and then that reduces the flashbacks and PTSD symptoms as well.

697
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:23.450
And they think,
you know,
if it can work after 24 hours,

698
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.590
that this might be able to work with people who have been suffering for months

699
00:42:27.591 --> 00:42:31.040
or year.
It's with flashbacks now too.
Um,
which is,

700
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.950
which is amazing because it is literally the hardest to treat symptom of post

701
00:42:35.951 --> 00:42:38.930
traumatic stress disorder.
And when people get flashbacks under control,

702
00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:43.930
their quality of life improves immeasurably.
Hmm.
And uh,

703
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.140
call of duty call of duty was,
he's like a,
they're like a million things.

704
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:50.750
That call of duty,
um,
does really well,

705
00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:53.510
you've already covered some of that on a previous podcast.

706
00:42:53.511 --> 00:42:56.030
I know you were talking about sort of cognitive enhancement benefits.

707
00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:00.890
So Adam [inaudible] who's amazing and I love,

708
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.610
I love his work.
So we won't talk about cognitive enhancement,

709
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:07.820
but call of duty can,
uh,

710
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:11.510
well the first thing you can do is it can really improve relationships with

711
00:43:11.511 --> 00:43:13.730
people if you play in the same room with them.
So there's,

712
00:43:13.731 --> 00:43:16.670
if you can actually be physically in the same space with somebody playing with

713
00:43:16.671 --> 00:43:18.020
them because,
uh,

714
00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:23.090
it dramatically increases mind body synchronization.

715
00:43:23.091 --> 00:43:26.420
So what that means is if you were playing call of duty with someone in the same

716
00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:30.290
room,
um,
you start to sync up with them at every possible level.

717
00:43:30.291 --> 00:43:33.710
Your breathing rates,
you'll start to breathe in and out at the same pace.

718
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:38.330
Your heart rate's will synchronize.
So,
um,
their pulses are,
are kind of equalize.

719
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.270
Your facial expressions will start to mirror each other.

720
00:43:41.271 --> 00:43:44.930
Your body language will meet each other and your brains will actually,

721
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.490
they will start to show blood flow in the same region and the same tempo as each

722
00:43:49.491 --> 00:43:53.630
other.
They call that mirror neuron effect.
Um,
and it happens,

723
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.200
it actually happens in basically all video games.

724
00:43:57.201 --> 00:44:02.150
But the more intense sort of high speed,
fast action intensive the game is,

725
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:06.350
the more it happens.
Um,
because in order to do well on a game,

726
00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:09.650
whether you're competing against someone or collaborating with them on the same

727
00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:13.820
team,
you have to be able to anticipate what they're going to do next,
right?

728
00:44:13.821 --> 00:44:17.610
So that you can either cooperate and be effective or so that you can outmaneuver

729
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.070
them and beat them.

730
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.540
And that that forces your brain to try to mirror what their brain is doing.

731
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:25.220
And as soon as your brain starts to mirror each other,

732
00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:26.450
everything else starts to marry each other.

733
00:44:26.451 --> 00:44:31.451
And it turns out this is like the building block for compassion and love.

734
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.040
So basically you love people more when you play call of duty with them,

735
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:39.780
but only only if you're in the same vertical space.
Yes.

736
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:45.120
So something which is usually we'd spend,
I mean,
most gamers are,
you know,

737
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.170
playing with people remotely and it just ends.
Um,

738
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:53.180
but if you can get in the same room that has this really magnificent Ben,
right.

739
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:55.560
<v 1>So I'm going to,
I'm going to take a,</v>

740
00:44:55.830 --> 00:45:00.830
a digression into what might be an urban myth or it's not really an urban myth,

741
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:05.490
old wives' tale,
not also not totally appropriate,
but you are,

742
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.950
you have an identical twin,
is that right?
Yes.

743
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:12.840
Do you have you the two of you experienced anything that's kind of like spooky

744
00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:17.040
accident action at a distance?
You must be sick of this type of question,

745
00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:18.540
but I'm really curious.

746
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:23.780
<v 4>See,
now you're going to like,
I have to,
you know,
I'm really into science,</v>

747
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:28.040
so I'll now I will say something that will sound like,
oh,
you know,

748
00:45:28.041 --> 00:45:29.660
mystical.
Spiritual.
Yeah.

749
00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:34.370
<v 1>Okay.
Can I add a caveat just to,
to make it easier?</v>

750
00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.413
Yeah.

751
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:39.210
I believe a bunch of stuff that seems quacky or than the quirkiest of crack.

752
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:42.680
I mean it,
but it's from empirical firsthand experience.

753
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.270
And just because we can't explain it doesn't mean we won't be able to explain
it.

754
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:50.890
<v 4>Yeah,
no,
I think there's actually probably some,
you know,
the,</v>

755
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:55.910
in physics they talk about these,
uh,
like you can have the twin,

756
00:45:55.911 --> 00:46:00.350
a fact like protons will be separated but then still be able to communicate at a

757
00:46:00.351 --> 00:46:04.910
distance,
like,
you know,
a billion light years away from each other in the galaxy.

758
00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:09.530
Um,
so maybe the fact that we were once the same egg,
we are identical twins,

759
00:46:09.531 --> 00:46:14.360
you know,
and we maybe,
maybe we have some weird spooky twin effect.
Um,
so yeah,

760
00:46:14.361 --> 00:46:17.880
I call it twin infection cause it only works if,

761
00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:22.640
if something really horrible is happening to my sister.
Uh,

762
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:27.050
so I will like I will,
it was almost like I'm having a heart attack.

763
00:46:27.051 --> 00:46:29.570
Am I forgot what a throw up my,
like I can't breathe.

764
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.000
I feel like I'm being attacked.
Um,
and it just,

765
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:36.110
it happened to a couple of years ago during a really emotionally traumatic time

766
00:46:36.111 --> 00:46:38.060
with this is the most reason it doesn't happen all the time.

767
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:42.410
It really only happens to something truly horrible as it's going on.
Um,

768
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:43.760
and I was like,
oh,
is that a,

769
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:48.200
I was at a store in Los Angeles and I like fell to the floor in the dressing

770
00:46:48.201 --> 00:46:52.920
room and I'm like,
what's going on?
And then literally two minutes later,
you know,

771
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:57.810
my sister called me sobbing,
like the worst pain I'd ever heard her in.

772
00:46:57.811 --> 00:47:02.750
Um,
it was,
uh,
two wins dealing with a death in the family.
And I was like,
okay,

773
00:47:02.751 --> 00:47:07.430
well that explains what just happened because uh,

774
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:09.980
you know,
we were,
I was having a twin faction.

775
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:15.360
<v 1>Wow.
And you,
you,
you have a pretty twin rich life at the moment.</v>

776
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:20.560
<v 4>I have little twin baby.
I have my own little twin girls.</v>

777
00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.620
And are they identical or fraternal?
They're fraternal.

778
00:47:23.621 --> 00:47:26.500
So it'll be a totally different experience because I think,
you know,

779
00:47:26.501 --> 00:47:30.280
having someone with the same Dna,
it feels like your life is an experiment.

780
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:35.110
Like whenever she does anything amazing,
I'm like,
why?
Why am I not doing that?

781
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.050
We're like the same person.
I should be able to do that too.

782
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:42.040
Cause I think fraternal,
it's less pressure,
I think

783
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:44.120
<v 1>for less pressure,
but there's still something there.</v>

784
00:47:44.121 --> 00:47:46.580
I have relatives who are fraternal twins.
There's still,

785
00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:51.170
there's still some unusual connection there.
Uh,

786
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:55.400
but I don't want to take us too far off the reservation here,

787
00:47:55.401 --> 00:47:59.070
but I am fascinated by this stuff.
And uh,
you know,

788
00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:03.170
in partially get us reading the,
uh,

789
00:48:03.171 --> 00:48:06.410
at the beginning of,
of the book,
the new book,
the Subaru read her book.

790
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:10.900
And there were a couple of things that jumped out at me.
The first was in effect,

791
00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:14.300
let me just find it here.
There's a line that reads.

792
00:48:14.301 --> 00:48:17.900
But even when I still had the symptoms,
even while I was still in pain,

793
00:48:17.901 --> 00:48:18.980
I stopped suffering.

794
00:48:18.981 --> 00:48:22.610
And I think this is really important concept because lush sheriff this from the

795
00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:27.290
military or elsewhere,
but I've,
I've heard,
uh,
pain.
Pain is mandatory.

796
00:48:27.291 --> 00:48:28.160
Suffering is optional,

797
00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.350
<v 4>right?
Or,
or pain is inevitable.
Suffering is optional,
which is a Buddhist saying,</v>

798
00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:32.890
oh,

799
00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:36.580
<v 1>well there we go.
Maybe the Buddhists,
military from the Buddhists,</v>

800
00:48:36.581 --> 00:48:40.290
special operations forces.
So,
so cute.

801
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:44.890
I think this is really important because like you said,

802
00:48:44.891 --> 00:48:48.250
it's not necessarily about eradicating all negative experiences,

803
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:51.590
which is not possible.
Uh,

804
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:56.200
but about increasing,
if you have two bank accounts,

805
00:48:56.201 --> 00:48:59.440
one of negative experiences and one of positive,

806
00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:03.040
you just want to make sure that the balance and the positive is higher than in

807
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:04.390
the negative.
Uh,

808
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:08.290
could you talk a little bit about post traumatic growth?

809
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.520
<v 4>Sure.
Yeah.
So,
you know,</v>

810
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:15.190
the idea of a gameful mindset is that it's exactly that,

811
00:49:15.191 --> 00:49:17.830
that you look at pain as inevitable,
but,

812
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.400
but suffering is optional because if you think about when you play games,

813
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.950
you're always trying to suffer.
When you play games,

814
00:49:23.951 --> 00:49:28.940
like games are voluntary suffer it and you think about golf,
you know,
uh,
if,

815
00:49:28.941 --> 00:49:32.710
uh,
if,
if in real life your goal were to get a small ball and a small hole,

816
00:49:32.711 --> 00:49:35.950
you would just walk up to the hole and you would put the ball in it and you

817
00:49:35.951 --> 00:49:37.690
would be happy with the outcome.

818
00:49:37.691 --> 00:49:41.260
But you volunteer to suffer by standing really far away from the hall,

819
00:49:41.261 --> 00:49:43.180
which is a stupid way to achieve the goal.

820
00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.790
And then you use like the stick to try to aim the ball,

821
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:48.260
which is also pretty inconvenient.
Um,

822
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:50.860
the every game we played like scrabble the same way,
you know,

823
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:52.420
you don't get unlimited letters,

824
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:54.490
you only get the seven letters and we're going to,

825
00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:59.110
you can't even pick them yourself.
So it's like,
it's,
it's a voluntary suffering.

826
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:00.940
Things are harder than they should be.

827
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:06.120
And that's what unleashes the creativity and the curiosity and the optimism and

828
00:50:06.311 --> 00:50:10.300
the recruitment of friends and resources.
Um,
so,
uh,

829
00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:15.360
the gameful mindset is really about how do you look for voluntary obstacles in

830
00:50:16.241 --> 00:50:16.571
real life.

831
00:50:16.571 --> 00:50:21.150
How do you look at things that you are currently experiencing as suffering as a

832
00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.880
instead a way to get stronger or happier.

833
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:29.910
And then that's where the idea of post traumatic growth in which is not,

834
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.870
not all that new field of research now that was probably a decades worth of

835
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:37.871
research now showing that many people who undergo a traumatic experience,

836
00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:41.810
uh,
in addition to suffering.
And by the way posttraumatic growth,

837
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.660
it's not the opposite of posttraumatic stress disorder.

838
00:50:44.661 --> 00:50:48.920
That's a misconception that the many people sort of stumble onto.
Um,

839
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:52.610
most people with posttraumatic growth,
first experience,

840
00:50:52.611 --> 00:50:53.840
posttraumatic stress disorder.

841
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.320
So it just because you have one doesn't mean you can't ultimately wind up with

842
00:50:57.321 --> 00:50:58.860
growth.
Um,
and it,

843
00:50:58.861 --> 00:51:03.560
it's a process where by wrestling with these really difficult things,

844
00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:07.130
you get to know yourself better.
So at the end of posttraumatic growth,

845
00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:09.440
you feel like you understand your strengths better.

846
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.190
You feel like your friends and family understand you better.
You feel like you,

847
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:16.970
you know your priorities in life better and you have more courage to make

848
00:51:16.971 --> 00:51:20.330
decisions so that you're putting your time and energy on the things that matter

849
00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:23.900
most to you.
Um,
it's kind of similar in that way to a near death experience.

850
00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.650
A lot of people have near death experience.
Suddenly they relish every day.

851
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.020
They're not afraid to speak their minds.
They,
they,

852
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.290
they really do put more time on their personal dreams or spending time with

853
00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:36.620
friends and family.
Um,
so posttraumatic growth is the same way,

854
00:51:36.621 --> 00:51:40.400
but you only get it by really wrestling with this incredible,

855
00:51:40.401 --> 00:51:44.630
almost existential crisis in your own life.
Um,

856
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:49.690
which for me was the traumatic brain injury and not knowing whether I would ever

857
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.670
work or,
or really be myself again.

858
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.830
But it can take the form of,
uh,

859
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:59.750
setting a goal like running a marathon or fill in the blank.
Right?

860
00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.330
Clo yet this is,
so this is,

861
00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.090
there have been now a couple books about post traumatic growth,

862
00:52:05.091 --> 00:52:09.950
but I am happy to say that I have the first book on post ecstatic growth,

863
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:15.190
which is a concept that was originally discovered by this amazing researcher and

864
00:52:17.241 --> 00:52:19.250
Marie rip key at University of Pennsylvania.

865
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:22.550
Not a lot of people are familiar with her research and I'm hoping this book will

866
00:52:22.551 --> 00:52:23.720
shine a spotlight on it.

867
00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:29.020
She found that many people seem to be exhibiting characteristics of

868
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:34.340
posttraumatic growth by doing things that they had chosen for themselves and

869
00:52:34.341 --> 00:52:37.400
that we're not,
you know,
traumatic experiences per se,

870
00:52:37.401 --> 00:52:40.580
although there might be trauma involved.
So training for a marathon,

871
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:44.780
becoming a parent for the first time,
starting your own business,

872
00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:49.820
going on at kind of spiritual journey,
look like a physical Mecca somewhere.
Um,

873
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:54.910
things that are really challenging that you will probably fail at at some times,

874
00:52:55.311 --> 00:52:58.130
you know,
make mistakes,
struggle.
Um,

875
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:03.250
and that really force you to cultivate that same understanding of your own

876
00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:07.970
strengths,
reaching out to friends and family,
taking stock of your priorities.
Um,

877
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.570
it turns out you can have all the benefits of posttraumatic growth without the

878
00:53:11.571 --> 00:53:15.770
trauma,
which is amazing.
Yes.
And so that's,

879
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.180
that's why you know,

880
00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:22.620
this super better method is basically a roadmap to post traumatic growth.

881
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.390
If you have an illness or injury or your life is pretty good and you still want

882
00:53:27.391 --> 00:53:28.770
to get all these amazing benefits,

883
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.920
helping you define for yourself a challenge that will be meaningful and,

884
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.630
and difficult enough but also doable that,

885
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.440
that you can get to these benefits.

886
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.760
<v 1>I've to one observation and then,
uh,
then,
uh,
that a question,</v>

887
00:53:44.761 --> 00:53:48.030
the observation when I was reading this and also just listening to your

888
00:53:48.031 --> 00:53:50.370
description and talking about for instance,

889
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:54.600
the posttraumatic growth following a near death experience,
um,

890
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:59.110
which is of course not something that you,
a,

891
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:03.090
it's dangerous to try to engineer near death experiences in the literal sense.

892
00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.290
<v 4>Although a lot of people do,
right.
I mean there's,
you know,
people,</v>

893
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.770
people pursue extreme sports and things like that because of that,

894
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:13.670
that ability to really see so clearly what you want out of life,
you know?

895
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:16.010
<v 1>Well,
it,
it magnifies,
uh,</v>

896
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.800
in really exaggerates,
oh,

897
00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:24.801
a lot of the emotions and provides clarity in those moments in some cases.

898
00:54:25.021 --> 00:54:29.060
And I couldn't help but think about a,
a,
the,

899
00:54:29.061 --> 00:54:34.061
the wife of a friend who used to work in hospice care and she would palliative

900
00:54:34.411 --> 00:54:37.080
care,
she would sit with people in the,

901
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:41.160
in the weeks and then moments before they passed on,

902
00:54:41.161 --> 00:54:45.240
before they died and she wanted,
she,

903
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:50.241
it turned out she was basically a Michael Jordan in that capacity.

904
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:54.420
She was really good at guiding people through that.
But,
uh,

905
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:59.220
she wanted to have the opportunity to help more people and she ended up then

906
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.930
working with,
uh,
psychedelics to help people

907
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:10.320
simulate that type of near death experience.
And I don't,

908
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:14.260
we don't have to take,
uh,
we don't have to go far down this road.
But I mean Ha,

909
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:15.870
I've had conversations,
for instance,

910
00:55:15.871 --> 00:55:19.740
on the podcast with the Jim Fadiman who talks quite a lot about micro dosing,

911
00:55:19.741 --> 00:55:22.440
but also the use of higher doses for these,

912
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:26.520
what some people would call it spiritual or mystical experiences.

913
00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:29.960
<v 4>Yeah,
it's,
well,
this is actually very interesting because,
you know,</v>

914
00:55:29.961 --> 00:55:32.450
when I was at Berkeley doing my phd,

915
00:55:32.451 --> 00:55:37.451
I actually wrote a research paper on the commonality of experience of people who

916
00:55:39.081 --> 00:55:41.090
are playing these certain types of games,

917
00:55:41.091 --> 00:55:45.470
these kind of very collaborative collective intelligence games and these

918
00:55:45.471 --> 00:55:50.390
spiritual drug taking,
uh,
you know,
like the psycho knots they call themselves.

919
00:55:50.391 --> 00:55:54.770
Right.
Um,
a good place.
I've actually,

920
00:55:54.771 --> 00:55:57.440
because we get,
so that's something I've actually been interested in for,

921
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:59.780
you know,
a very long time because there is,

922
00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:04.700
I do think there is a spiritual element to a lot of game play in that,

923
00:56:04.701 --> 00:56:09.700
that sense of really wanting to open yourself up,
um,

924
00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:13.290
particularly in an end games that require,
you know,

925
00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:15.140
to be a part of a massive community.

926
00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:19.490
And part of these kind of epic narratives,
um,

927
00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:23.620
like you know,
Joseph Campbell's Hero's journey.
Um,
there,

928
00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:28.621
there is definitely a spiritual element to that and a lot of spiritual benefits

929
00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:33.940
that come out of Gameplay,
which,
which is,
you know,
maybe that I might,

930
00:56:33.941 --> 00:56:34.691
for my third book,

931
00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:39.430
I keep saying I want to write a book called Super Mario was a Buddhist.

932
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:43.680
So maybe,
maybe,
maybe we should come back to that.
Uh,

933
00:56:43.681 --> 00:56:46.090
if for episode 800 of your pocket

934
00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:50.490
<v 1>Super Mario was in the Buddhist special ops as we've,
as we mentioned earlier.</v>

935
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:51.453
<v 4>Yeah,
no,
I actually,</v>

936
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:56.030
I actually got to go to a Buddhist conference and give a keynote with like all

937
00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:59.260
the most important Buddhist in the world were there and actually gave a keynote

938
00:56:59.261 --> 00:57:00.430
called Super Mario was a Buddhist,

939
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:03.600
but it had a question mark after the title because I was,

940
00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:08.670
<v 1>that gives,
it gives you an out if there's a crowd mutiny of the crowd.
Exactly.</v>

941
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:11.060
So Games I let,
let me,
uh,

942
00:57:11.061 --> 00:57:15.780
it has like to ask a personal question and this is because I,

943
00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.060
I love playing games.
I was a,

944
00:57:18.061 --> 00:57:23.061
I was dungeons and dragons aficionado slash obsessive growing up and that was my

945
00:57:24.331 --> 00:57:25.350
refuge.
I mean I was,

946
00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:30.030
I was a real kind of runt dork growing up and got beat up in elementary school

947
00:57:30.031 --> 00:57:34.860
and whatnot.
So I used games as way to escape but also as a way to,

948
00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:40.520
to live this sort of virtual life that enabled me to I think in many ways

949
00:57:41.431 --> 00:57:45.270
develop characteristics I wanted later in life.
Right.
And,
um,

950
00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.990
but when people ask me now like,
oh,
are you a Gamer?

951
00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:54.650
I don't know how to answer that because when I look at how slick the Games are

952
00:57:54.721 --> 00:57:59.721
that have been developed and how much money has gone into developing games that

953
00:57:59.881 --> 00:58:02.270
are as addictive as possible,
I,

954
00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:05.910
I choose not to play those games out of fear.

955
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.570
And the fear is the same fear I would have if I tried heroin people,
you know,

956
00:58:09.571 --> 00:58:12.210
if someone asks me like,
if you tried heroin,
I'm like,
no,
I haven't.

957
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:14.080
I'm sure I'd love it.
And that's the problem.
Like,

958
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:16.050
I don't want to become a heroin addict.

959
00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:21.080
And I worry about becoming one of these people who say sinks 40 to 60 hours a

960
00:58:21.691 --> 00:58:25.590
week into world of Warcraft.
Cause I know I have that capacity.
Right.
Yeah.

961
00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.210
I know it's there.
So how,

962
00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:31.530
what are ways that people can reintroduce yup.

963
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:36.100
Gameful mindset or gameplay.
Yup.
Let's just say it's a,

964
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:39.240
somebody who's working 80 hours a week and they recognize,
they're like,
you know,

965
00:58:39.241 --> 00:58:44.241
I want the joy and all of the promises of a gameful mindset and or Gameplay,

966
00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:51.170
but I don't want to go off the deep end and end up becoming completely consumed.

967
00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.620
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
We know I can really relate to this by the way.
You know,
I,</v>

968
00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:01.400
people ask me what my favorite games of all time are and I always have world of

969
00:59:01.401 --> 00:59:03.320
Warcraft in the top,
you know,

970
00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.960
three or four if think of the best games of all time.

971
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:11.170
But I only played it for a very short time because I saw what my future was

972
00:59:11.961 --> 00:59:16.430
going to be like if I didn't get out quickly.
Um,
and I was my husband,
I,

973
00:59:16.431 --> 00:59:17.510
our plan is,
you know,

974
00:59:17.511 --> 00:59:21.920
when we're retired and old and maybe unless they've invented extension

975
00:59:21.921 --> 00:59:25.340
technologies so that like at 150,
we're running around like a 20 year old,

976
00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:28.040
assuming old age is similar to how it is today.

977
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.310
I'm going to be totally addicted to these games when I'm like 90,

978
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.790
because it'll have all these cognitive enhancing benefits and I'll be socially

979
00:59:34.791 --> 00:59:36.440
connected to other people.
So I'm,

980
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:41.510
I'm waiting to get addicted until it really is better than,
you know,

981
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.490
trying to live my old life.
Um,
but,
uh,

982
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.560
there's lots of things you can do and I should just say also as a sort of public

983
00:59:48.561 --> 00:59:51.770
service announcement benefit,
one of the things that I write about in the book,

984
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.240
um,
there is a chapter,

985
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:57.080
an entire chapter on what makes a difference between somebody who benefits from

986
00:59:57.081 --> 00:59:59.810
playing games and brings a gameful mindset to real life.

987
00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.980
And somebody who develops some kind of addictive or pathological or compulsive

988
01:00:03.981 --> 01:00:04.850
gaming behavior.

989
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:09.920
And there are two things that predict whether you will benefit and be gainful in

990
01:00:09.921 --> 01:00:14.921
real life or whether you will kind of get addicted and the rest of your life

991
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.770
starts to suffer.
So the two things that are predictive,
one is really simple.

992
01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.760
It's 21 hours a week.
That is the tipping point.

993
01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:26.000
I've looked at all kinds of studies from,
you know,

994
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:31.130
people in the military too young,
like elementary school students.
Um,

995
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.800
21 hours a week.
When you go over that,

996
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:38.630
we start to see suffering and other aspects of life such as physical health,

997
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:43.610
mood,
your ability to do well at school or at work or other aspects of your life.

998
01:00:43.611 --> 01:00:47.030
So three hours a day,
three hours a day aren't good,
but you could,
you could,

999
01:00:47.031 --> 01:00:50.070
you know,
pile up on the weekend.
I mean,
it doesn't have to be.
Yeah.
Um,

1000
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:51.740
and so I always say if you,

1001
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:56.090
if you feel like you're addicted or you have a family member who you fear is

1002
01:00:56.091 --> 01:00:56.630
addicted,

1003
01:00:56.630 --> 01:01:01.340
do not take the games away because as you learn about reading the book,

1004
01:01:01.341 --> 01:01:03.470
Games are very powerful.
They,

1005
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.100
they help treat or prevent depression.
And anxiety.

1006
01:01:07.101 --> 01:01:11.660
And if you take games away from somebody who's gaming 30,
40,
50,
60 hours a week,

1007
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.160
you're basically like taking them off in antidepressant without tapering.
Um,

1008
01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.280
and we've seen a lot of people who,
uh,

1009
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.960
I mean there's many cases of people committing suicide.

1010
01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:25.730
Young people when their parents have taken away the games and it's not just that

1011
01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:27.110
they're upset or angry,

1012
01:01:27.111 --> 01:01:30.860
it's literally their brain has had this powerful anti depressant ripped away

1013
01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:35.240
from them.
So,
so just go down to 20 hours a week.
Is that,

1014
01:01:35.241 --> 01:01:38.720
is that is one piece of practical advice for people who are really dealing with

1015
01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:43.400
addiction or compulsion.
Do not give it up.
Just get it down to 20 hours a week.

1016
01:01:43.401 --> 01:01:46.490
And that's actually very manageable for most people.

1017
01:01:46.491 --> 01:01:50.030
Even people who are feel like they,
they love to play.

1018
01:01:50.031 --> 01:01:53.570
They don't want to give up games.
You can get it down to three hours a day.
Um,

1019
01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:58.580
and uh,
so that's,
that is a practical tip.
Um,
but the other thing that predicts,

1020
01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.270
um,

1021
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:02.780
negative outcomes or you're just not getting the benefits of games and real life

1022
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:07.220
is looking at games as escapist.
So I was really interested to hear you say that,

1023
01:02:07.221 --> 01:02:09.080
you know,
you thought about games as escaping,

1024
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:12.470
but you also maybe thought about them as a way to build these kinds of character

1025
01:02:12.471 --> 01:02:13.300
strengths.
Uh,

1026
01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:18.300
so it turns out the number one predictor of who will suffer from gameplay is who

1027
01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:24.150
think that games are an escape from real life or a way to avoid thinking about

1028
01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:26.370
or dealing with real problems.

1029
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:30.750
People who manage to bring the game pull mindset and all the benefits to games

1030
01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:35.780
to the real lives are the people who identify benefits to game play and can talk

1031
01:02:36.541 --> 01:02:40.290
about them and can,
I can identify them and can say,
you know,
I'm not,

1032
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:44.220
I'm not just playing candy crush or call of duty because I just can't deal.

1033
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:46.050
Like I just need to just shut everything off.

1034
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.530
There are the people who say this is quality time,
you know,

1035
01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:53.130
for me and my brother and when we play this game together,
this is,

1036
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.040
this is a real benefit to my life.
Or you know,

1037
01:02:56.041 --> 01:03:00.540
I'm playing this game because I'm having really anxious thoughts and I want to

1038
01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:05.280
shut them off.
And I know if I play this game for 10 minutes,
I can shut down.

1039
01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:06.600
I'm not going to have a panic attack.

1040
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.090
So if you have a real purpose for how you play,
um,

1041
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:14.430
that's when you start to build up the self efficacy to use a gainful strengths

1042
01:03:14.431 --> 01:03:16.350
in real life.
Now that that is not,

1043
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.330
so you're asking like a very practical question,

1044
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:22.590
like what should I do or what should I play it literally 10 to 20 minutes a day.

1045
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:27.540
If you do 10 minutes every day or 20 minutes,
three times a week.

1046
01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:31.590
That's what's fantastic in clinical trials and randomized control studies to

1047
01:03:31.591 --> 01:03:34.200
have powerful impacts.
Um,

1048
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.640
first and foremost on depression and anxiety,
improving your mood,
um,

1049
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:41.740
for social interactions,
10 minutes a day,
um,

1050
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.330
improves the number of people you have in your life who will help you with a

1051
01:03:45.331 --> 01:03:48.840
real life problem.
So I think of it,
it's just,
it's like,
you know,

1052
01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:54.020
I make time to do 10 pushups during every commercial of all the tennis that I

1053
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:58.140
watched on TV.
Um,
so you should think about it that way.
Like,

1054
01:03:58.141 --> 01:04:03.141
how do you squeeze in a little bit of game play into your downtime that that

1055
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.550
would,

1056
01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:08.330
<v 1>so what type,
what I have to ask now of course,
since you mentioned it,
what,</v>

1057
01:04:08.331 --> 01:04:12.130
what's on your top five game list or whatever that that just a,

1058
01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.180
a handful of your favorite games.

1059
01:04:14.181 --> 01:04:18.650
But then also for someone like me who doesn't want to get sucked into the

1060
01:04:18.651 --> 01:04:20.000
vortex,
yeah.

1061
01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:23.840
It feels like I should probably stay away from world's building games in that

1062
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.741
case.
Yeah.

1063
01:04:24.741 --> 01:04:29.000
And maybe go with the cat more transactional kind of Tetris type of game or

1064
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:33.380
something that allows me a closed short session.
Uh,
but what are,

1065
01:04:33.381 --> 01:04:37.550
what are some of your favorite games?
What are kind of on your,
your,

1066
01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:42.610
your hits list and then what might be games that I could use for those 10 to 20

1067
01:04:42.861 --> 01:04:47.220
minutes a day?
Yeah.
And what should my intention be going into them,
right?

1068
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.340
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So,
um,
I'll just,
I'll just,
I mean,</v>

1069
01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.370
when we don't do like an all time favorite games,
we'll just talk about,

1070
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.960
because otherwise like I'd be like dance,

1071
01:04:55.961 --> 01:04:58.600
dance revolution totally on my top 10 all time,
but you know,

1072
01:04:58.601 --> 01:05:03.340
nobody plays it anymore.
Um,
but,
uh,
okay.
So,

1073
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.190
uh,
uh,
Tetris is,
is definitely,

1074
01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:10.450
I mean everybody should have that on their phone because it treats so many

1075
01:05:10.451 --> 01:05:15.250
different conditions from anxiety to,
you know,
push my express order to,
you know,

1076
01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:18.130
building up your willpower.
So,
um,
Tetra is,

1077
01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:21.040
everybody should have tetris games at other people,
you know,

1078
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:23.950
are playing is really,
really good.
Um,

1079
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:26.080
and so this changes depending on the time.

1080
01:05:26.081 --> 01:05:29.220
So a lot of people are playing clash of clans right now,
um,

1081
01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:32.880
or candy crush saga or words with friends.
Um,

1082
01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:37.270
you should just check out what people that you know are playing because a lot of

1083
01:05:37.271 --> 01:05:41.590
the benefits that have been documented for games comes just from having these

1084
01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:46.210
sort of micro conversations with friends and family about the same game that

1085
01:05:46.211 --> 01:05:49.460
you're playing or actually playing in game with them.
So,
um,

1086
01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:53.320
any of those three games would be good.
I think Minecraft is really great,

1087
01:05:53.321 --> 01:05:58.210
even though it's like the most popular game of all time for kids now.

1088
01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:58.810
Um,

1089
01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:03.810
it's actually a really great resilience building game for grownups,

1090
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:09.430
you know,
um,
because if,
if you're,
you know,
if you,
if you,

1091
01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.390
if you die,

1092
01:06:10.391 --> 01:06:14.940
if you have your stuff blown up and you have to kind of start over again,
um,

1093
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:20.010
it has the qualities of the kind of game that we know builds resilience,

1094
01:06:20.201 --> 01:06:24.280
bills,
determination and willpower that can benefit you in real life.
So yeah,

1095
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:26.620
if you,
I mean,
and by the way,
if somebody has not played Minecraft,

1096
01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:31.330
they've like missed out on one of the biggest cultural gifts you know,

1097
01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:34.120
of,
of our,
of our generation.

1098
01:06:34.121 --> 01:06:38.560
So that's me looking down at my feet right now,
so I'll get on it.

1099
01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:41.770
Okay.
So definitely do that.
So that because the next generation,

1100
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.440
that's like all this going to be the number one nostalgia point.

1101
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:49.180
Like all you're going to hear about 20 years from now or like people in their

1102
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:53.650
twenties and thirties talking about Minecraft.
So it at least exposure herself.

1103
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:58.480
Um,
and then I think puzzle games,
a single player puzzle games,
uh,

1104
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:02.410
or a single player adventure games are really good for,
um,

1105
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.930
provoking positive emotions at.

1106
01:07:04.931 --> 01:07:07.960
So portal is something I always recommend to people.

1107
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:10.690
There's portal and portal two,
um,

1108
01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:15.720
it's incredibly challenging but hilarious a puzzle game that,

1109
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:20.020
uh,
even though it's a,
the first one single player,

1110
01:07:20.021 --> 01:07:23.080
you can play the second one co op,
which is really cool.
In fact,

1111
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:26.920
when I was playing portal too with my husband and we were also training for a

1112
01:07:26.921 --> 01:07:28.270
half marathon at that time,

1113
01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:33.450
we actually use our portal skills to better navigate like all the people that we

1114
01:07:34.361 --> 01:07:37.330
were trying to run around and pass a in the race.
We would,

1115
01:07:37.331 --> 01:07:38.510
we would use the same gesture,

1116
01:07:38.511 --> 01:07:42.340
all system that you use in the video game to communicate with each other.

1117
01:07:42.341 --> 01:07:45.340
Like how we were going to get around all of these people and still then come

1118
01:07:45.341 --> 01:07:49.540
back and run together.
Um,
so I the odd portal to that.
So,
uh,

1119
01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:53.050
uh,
yes,
those are some,
those are some good,

1120
01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:57.070
some good games to start with.
And,
um,
uh,
but,
but,

1121
01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.670
but really any game that you love including,
I mean,

1122
01:08:00.671 --> 01:08:04.900
you could be playing pandemic,
the board game,
you could be playing poker.

1123
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:09.880
I mean you could be playing,
um,
bridge or golf,
whatever.
Um,

1124
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:15.010
most games,
even if they're not video games also help you develop that,

1125
01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:15.920
the gameful mindset.

1126
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:20.450
<v 1>And what is your,
I mean,
you clearly have,</v>

1127
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:24.200
you've got some babies,
get some dogs,
you got a husband,

1128
01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:28.430
you have at least one or several jobs.
Uh,

1129
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:32.270
what is your sort of fed weekly,

1130
01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.840
let's just say this past week or next week,
what does the,

1131
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:40.290
what does the workout schedule look like with the gaming?
Like what?
It's a,
yeah,

1132
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:43.250
what is,
where do you,
where do you squeeze it in?
What time of day?

1133
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.390
How many days a week?

1134
01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:48.970
<v 4>Yeah.
Okay.
As well.
So first of all,
uh,
with two babies,</v>

1135
01:08:49.150 --> 01:08:53.900
like I literally cannot play anything on a console now because I only had bass

1136
01:08:53.901 --> 01:08:57.960
have one hand,
like one thumb basically.
So,
uh,

1137
01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:01.570
we're talking strictly games on my phone.
Um,

1138
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:03.910
and so for me,
candy crush saga,

1139
01:09:03.911 --> 01:09:08.260
it's the best one to be playing now because both my parents in law play and they

1140
01:09:08.261 --> 01:09:12.580
are helping us take care of our babies.
So,
you know,
when they come over,
uh,

1141
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:17.170
I can give my father in law a baby to feed and I can take his phone and try to

1142
01:09:17.171 --> 01:09:19.180
get them off a level that's,
you know,

1143
01:09:19.181 --> 01:09:22.300
cause I'm like 400 levels ahead of him so I can,
you know,

1144
01:09:22.301 --> 01:09:24.490
take his phone and help him get off the level.

1145
01:09:24.491 --> 01:09:27.640
And now he's happy because he's a head of level and I'm happy cause he's feeding

1146
01:09:27.641 --> 01:09:30.810
the baby.
Um,
so,
so can't,
Eh,

1147
01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.860
for me that's actually really important.

1148
01:09:32.861 --> 01:09:37.540
Like using games I thought as a cultural touchstone or,
or piece of,

1149
01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:39.270
you know,
like common experience with,

1150
01:09:39.271 --> 01:09:42.550
with other people and my mom's also playing.
And so that's,
um,

1151
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.840
that's really helpful.
And,
um,
then I also,
you know,

1152
01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:49.090
I played tennis with my husband once a week,

1153
01:09:49.091 --> 01:09:54.091
which is really good for me because if I lose six zero six,

1154
01:09:55.781 --> 01:09:59.750
one,
that is an amazing match for me.
Like I,

1155
01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:04.570
I won one game.
He's,
you know,
he's six foot three.
He's a dude.
He's like,
it's,

1156
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:05.463
I guess

1157
01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:09.100
<v 1>so CJ,
is he just like a hundred mile an airing or add that,</v>

1158
01:10:09.101 --> 01:10:10.660
I don't know my numbers.
That might be slow.
I don't know.

1159
01:10:10.661 --> 01:10:12.970
But does that mean it's not,
that's it.
That's a good start.
No,
I mean,

1160
01:10:12.971 --> 01:10:15.680
is he just going to like being you as you go in for the kill or,
yeah,

1161
01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.633
<v 4>I mean,</v>

1162
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:21.950
I finally just convinced him like the rear four weeks ago to serve such that I

1163
01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:26.690
could have returned.
Like literally he was,
it was,

1164
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.170
it was like,
it was,
it was ridiculous.
But I,
my only points where like,

1165
01:10:30.171 --> 01:10:33.870
if you double faulted,
but,
um,
uh,
but so that,

1166
01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.430
that's a really good game from you that I play once a week because like,
I,

1167
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:40.700
I'm kind of killing it in other areas of my life.
You know,

1168
01:10:40.701 --> 01:10:44.270
I feel like very successful in other areas of my life and I think getting

1169
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:49.010
clobbered,
uh,
once a week in a game that I'm very bad at.
Um,

1170
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.920
and they'll just think this,
this is documented to be true.

1171
01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:56.480
If you can take the collaborating and stay optimistic and still have positive

1172
01:10:56.481 --> 01:10:58.040
emotions throughout that experience,

1173
01:10:58.310 --> 01:11:02.690
it builds a lot of psychological resources that you will be able to draw on when

1174
01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.050
it's not a game,
but when it's real life.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
okay.

1175
01:11:06.051 --> 01:11:09.580
So I'm getting clobbered in tennis once a week.
Which day of the week?

1176
01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:13.800
<v 1>What time of day?
I love the specifics.
Like how,
how many a week,</v>

1177
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:17.970
how many days per week you playing candy crush saga and then what day of the

1178
01:11:17.971 --> 01:11:18.804
week on tennis?

1179
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:23.620
<v 4>Yeah.
Uh,
candidates.
Okay.
The question is every day and uh,
you know,
uh,</v>

1180
01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:27.850
what I would say,
I probably look at it,
you know,

1181
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.010
twice a day.
Um,

1182
01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:34.300
maybe in the morning I make sure to spin the wheel to get my free power up.

1183
01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:35.920
I might not play it,
but I'm like,

1184
01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:39.130
I don't want to forget to get cause every day and candy crush you'd get one free

1185
01:11:39.131 --> 01:11:42.460
power,
but otherwise they charge you like,
you know,
99 cents for it.
Um,

1186
01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:43.690
so I make sure,

1187
01:11:43.691 --> 01:11:47.080
even like when I'm traveling and giving talks and other countries and have no

1188
01:11:47.081 --> 01:11:49.700
time for anything,
I always log in once a day and spend to get,

1189
01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:53.080
so I can have like the stash of power ups for when I want to really hard level.

1190
01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:57.880
Um,
so I do that in the morning and then later in the evening,
um,
I'll,
uh,

1191
01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.560
I will do it.
Um,
uh,

1192
01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.780
I find it's actually good for me before I go to sleep because I have one of

1193
01:12:04.781 --> 01:12:08.710
those minds that will anxiously race about all the things that I have to do

1194
01:12:08.711 --> 01:12:12.970
tomorrow.
Um,
and uh,
so we know,
uh,
there's a,

1195
01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:16.310
there's a set of quests and power ups and bad guys for insomnia in,

1196
01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:20.620
in super better.
And,
uh,
so I know one of the tricks for that,

1197
01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.650
one of the ways you battle the bad guy of,
um,

1198
01:12:24.190 --> 01:12:28.120
of the sort of ruminating on things you have to do tomorrow is to totally occupy

1199
01:12:28.121 --> 01:12:29.830
your brain with something else for 10 minutes.

1200
01:12:29.831 --> 01:12:33.940
So I find that to be a good kind of nightcap for me.

1201
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.881
<v 1>That's a great idea.</v>

1202
01:12:34.881 --> 01:12:38.240
Maybe that's how I get my tetris because I've used fiction for that,

1203
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:42.450
but sometimes I just don't have the concentration.
Uh,

1204
01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:46.550
kitchen.
Uh,
and then the tennis is on

1205
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:51.440
<v 4>tennis is on Sunday afternoons and uh,
yeah,
that's when we get,</v>

1206
01:12:51.441 --> 01:12:55.400
we get our,
uh,
his parents babysit for us and we go,

1207
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.910
yeah.

1208
01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:58.720
<v 1>So get it on the calendar.
People listening,</v>

1209
01:12:58.721 --> 01:13:01.480
he can't just improvise your way through the entire week.

1210
01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.530
It's very helpful to get on the calendar.
Yeah.

1211
01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:09.600
Let me ask a handful of last questions.

1212
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:13.580
I know that,
uh,
I want to be respectful of your time and make sure that your,

1213
01:13:13.581 --> 01:13:18.140
your kids aren't climbing up out the window sills or something,
but,
uh,

1214
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:20.860
when you think of the word successful,

1215
01:13:20.861 --> 01:13:22.930
who's the first person who comes to mind and why?

1216
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:25.680
<v 4>Oh my goodness.
Um,</v>

1217
01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.120
I've heard you ask that question to someone else too and they were totally

1218
01:13:28.121 --> 01:13:32.530
stumped too.
Um,
I think,
uh,

1219
01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.620
okay,
wait,
I was going to say Bill Gates,

1220
01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:39.050
which first of all is very boring.
Um,

1221
01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.740
and also it's a man and I really want to answer a woman.
So I'm going to,

1222
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:45.500
because I,
that's something I spend a lot of time doing,

1223
01:13:45.501 --> 01:13:50.090
like making sure that I don't accidentally talk only about successful men.

1224
01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.800
Even in my book,
like,
you know,
a lot of,

1225
01:13:51.801 --> 01:13:54.860
I make sure I'm citing a lot of women scientists because,
um,

1226
01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:59.240
it's oftentimes the first person we think of as a man because they're so often

1227
01:13:59.241 --> 01:14:02.540
talked about more so.
Okay.
I like to say,
um,

1228
01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:06.980
I think of Elizabeth War and was actually the next name,
uh,

1229
01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.120
that came to mind.

1230
01:14:08.121 --> 01:14:12.220
Senator Elizabeth Warren because I think she is doing an job of,

1231
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:13.383
um,

1232
01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:17.830
pushing back against powerful interests in this country and getting us to talk

1233
01:14:17.831 --> 01:14:22.450
about,
um,
making big changes to,
uh,

1234
01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:25.330
to our financial system and our political system.

1235
01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:30.400
And it's really hard for anybody to get any traction in that,

1236
01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:34.060
in this country today.
So that was who I thought of.
And maybe that's,

1237
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.601
it's actually,

1238
01:14:34.601 --> 01:14:38.530
it might be wishful thinking because I would love to see her run for president.

1239
01:14:38.531 --> 01:14:39.400
So maybe I'm,

1240
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:44.260
maybe I'm using my futurist forecasting skills here to think that,
you know,

1241
01:14:44.261 --> 01:14:47.200
in 2024,

1242
01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:51.310
she has just successfully been elected president and that's why I thought of her

1243
01:14:51.311 --> 01:14:54.760
as the most successful person I could think of.
Cross your fingers,
everybody.

1244
01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:55.653
Okay.

1245
01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:57.610
<v 1>Nostradamus in fact,</v>

1246
01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.600
speaking of successful women,
uh,

1247
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:06.610
there are a number of exercises in the beginning of super better and I did

1248
01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:11.620
actually go through these exercises,
uh,
including the,
uh,

1249
01:15:11.621 --> 01:15:16.240
the quests I should say.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
I actually did both of these,

1250
01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:18.160
so I was in a coffee shop and one of the most,
you know,

1251
01:15:18.161 --> 01:15:21.100
stand up and take three steps or make your hands into fists,

1252
01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:22.990
hold them over your head as high as you can for five seconds.

1253
01:15:22.991 --> 01:15:24.430
So I did both in this coffee shop.

1254
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.420
<v 4>Totally.
I get humor and I,</v>

1255
01:15:26.670 --> 01:15:30.360
<v 1>and I,
I pretended to be stretching because it is,
it turns out five seconds.</v>

1256
01:15:30.361 --> 01:15:34.590
It's pretty long.
Yes it is.
But I love these,

1257
01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:37.380
these comfort challenges.
And then there was the,
for instance,

1258
01:15:37.381 --> 01:15:42.270
the snapping of the fingers exactly 50 times.
And these very,
very small things,

1259
01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:46.440
looking out the window for certain periods of time and so on that I've found

1260
01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:51.920
really fun to do.
Even as comfort challenges.
I just enjoy anything that,

1261
01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.980
that allows you to practice being uncomfortable.
But,
uh,

1262
01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.870
how it,
so all right.

1263
01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:03.150
The line that struck me was I've watched some amazing people complete the same

1264
01:16:03.151 --> 01:16:05.670
four questions are about to undertake,
including Oprah Winfrey,

1265
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:09.900
legendary skateboarder and entrepreneur,
Tony Hawk,
and then it goes on.
So,
okay.

1266
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:12.990
How did,
how did you get Oprah to do these exercises?

1267
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:17.610
<v 4>Right.
That was a long story.
I actually,
um,
uh,
I was,</v>

1268
01:16:17.611 --> 01:16:22.080
I was on tour with,
with Oprah on her life class a show,

1269
01:16:22.081 --> 01:16:26.790
not actually doing anything,
um,
on stage with her,
but,

1270
01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:30.550
um,
I was,
uh,
we,
we created a game together,
um,

1271
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:33.330
called the thank you game.
Oprah's thank you game.

1272
01:16:33.331 --> 01:16:38.250
And it was a game designed to spread gratitude to as many people as possible

1273
01:16:38.251 --> 01:16:42.210
because gratitude is contagious and it has all these amazing life and health

1274
01:16:42.211 --> 01:16:46.440
benefits.
Um,
and so,
so I,
I made a game for her.
Um,
and,
uh,

1275
01:16:46.441 --> 01:16:51.390
and I'll,
somewhere along the way,
I mean,
I had gotten a phone call from people,

1276
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:55.490
uh,
from her people who had,
they'd stumbled across,
um,

1277
01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.100
some scientific research and then they saw my name associated with it.

1278
01:16:59.101 --> 01:17:01.530
And I mean,
I just got very lucky that,
um,

1279
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:06.720
that her and her team were kind of suddenly interested in end games and gainful

1280
01:17:06.721 --> 01:17:10.270
psychology.
And it was the first time I met her,
uh,

1281
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:14.720
I had meetings with her team like a dozen times,
and,
uh,

1282
01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:19.520
I was like in a conference room and she comes in and gives me a big hug and
says,

1283
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:23.780
I love you.
Which was like having,
I basically look at her,
it's happening,

1284
01:17:23.781 --> 01:17:26.900
like saved my life as a kid.
I watched her every day after school and like,

1285
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:31.560
she really,
I felt like it was going to therapy,
watching her show.
Sure.
I thought,

1286
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:35.780
yeah,
yeah.
And I was like,
I cannot like literally her saying,
I love you.

1287
01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:38.900
I felt like I could have died on the spot and like my life would have had a full

1288
01:17:38.901 --> 01:17:43.070
karmic circle.
Like I was totally okay with that.
Um,
and,
uh,

1289
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:46.080
but we just started talking about the power of games and I,
I said,
uh,
you know,

1290
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.480
let me show you the game that I'm working on now.
And uh,

1291
01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:51.690
and had her and,
and,

1292
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:54.680
and I didn't know she was going to actually do it and play along.

1293
01:17:54.681 --> 01:17:59.360
And she did and it was freaking awesome.
Um,
and uh,

1294
01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:01.480
and that,
that,
that led into making the,

1295
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.980
the Oprahs thank you game where we spread gratitude.

1296
01:18:03.981 --> 01:18:06.230
I think it was like how many people did we get to?
It was,

1297
01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:08.440
it was like over a hundred million people,
which is

1298
01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:15.870
<v 1>people like,
oh yeah,
just another hundred million people.</v>

1299
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:18.770
Incredible.
Uh,

1300
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:24.110
what is the book that you've given most often as a gift or any books that

1301
01:18:24.991 --> 01:18:25.480
you've,

1302
01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:30.250
<v 4>a lot as gifts?
Um,
there are two.
Um,</v>

1303
01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:34.720
one is,
uh,
called finite and infinite games,

1304
01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:39.350
which is by a professor of religious studies,
uh,

1305
01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:43.270
in New York University named James Carse.
And,
uh,
it's,

1306
01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:44.860
it's basically a book about games,

1307
01:18:44.861 --> 01:18:46.550
but then it turns out it's about the meaning of life.

1308
01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:49.390
You don't know until the last page.
It's like this big shock.

1309
01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.820
It's like 6 cents that you thought you were reading a book about games.

1310
01:18:51.821 --> 01:18:56.490
And then suddenly it's like,
yeah,
the last,

1311
01:18:56.710 --> 01:18:59.680
the last line of the book is there is but one infinite game.

1312
01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:04.060
And then you're like,
oh shit,
it's life.
Life is the infinite game.
Um,

1313
01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:08.270
and uh,
so that's a,
it's like a really easy,
it's a tiny,
tiny block.

1314
01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:11.900
It's like practically a pocket book.
So anyone is interested in philosophy,
um,

1315
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:16.840
and looking at games as,
as a way of life.
That's a really good one.
Um,
and then,

1316
01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:21.750
uh,
a book,
um,
uh,
well,
uh,

1317
01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.220
it's a,
it's called suffering is optional actually.
Um,

1318
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:29.990
so in is by my favorite Buddhist teacher,
Cheri Huber and uh,
it,

1319
01:19:29.991 --> 01:19:34.330
so that is,
I,
I'm,
I'm very inspired by Buddhist practices.
I mean,
I,
I,

1320
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:39.140
I practiced Zen Buddhism myself and,
um,
uh,
this was,

1321
01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:45.150
I think that game play and Buddhist practice or both a way to arrive at a

1322
01:19:46.901 --> 01:19:51.040
similar approach to life.
Um,
and so,
uh,
that's,

1323
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:55.570
that's another good book.
What was her last name?
Huber.
Hub.

1324
01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:00.010
E.
R.
Awesome.
She has an amazing podcast too,
by the way.

1325
01:20:00.011 --> 01:20:02.260
So if,
if people who love your podcast,

1326
01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:05.050
they can listen to her podcast too

1327
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:07.650
<v 1>interviewed,
I'm not if you know the name</v>

1328
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.320
<v 4>Tara Brock,
but uh,
she's,</v>

1329
01:20:10.321 --> 01:20:15.321
she's an amazing teacher and focuses on mindfulness and Buddhist teachings and

1330
01:20:16.531 --> 01:20:17.940
so on.
Just fantastic.

1331
01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:22.920
And I think that this has been a really interesting week for me because it's

1332
01:20:22.921 --> 01:20:27.330
tying together a bunch of seemingly disparate activities.

1333
01:20:27.331 --> 01:20:30.810
So you have the say Buddhist philosophy and teaching.

1334
01:20:30.811 --> 01:20:33.270
Then you have stoic philosophy of course,

1335
01:20:33.271 --> 01:20:37.710
which I've read a ton of and just a huge fan of whether it's Seneca,

1336
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:41.430
Marcus Aurelius or others.
And then you have the game play and they,
they seem,

1337
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.290
they serve very similar.
They can help you achieve very similar outcomes.

1338
01:20:46.450 --> 01:20:50.610
Uh,
it's very fascinating.
Uh,
do you have a favorite documentary?

1339
01:20:50.611 --> 01:20:55.560
Any favorite documentaries?
Oh,
well I have to plug a documentary called Gamers,

1340
01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:00.030
which uh,
with me,
it in 2003,
I think.

1341
01:21:00.031 --> 01:21:05.031
And it was the first full length feature documentary about competitive video

1342
01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:09.300
game players.
At the time it was the cyber athlete professional league,
the Cpl.

1343
01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:12.310
Now,
of course you've got like League of legends finals,

1344
01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:14.100
like more people attended,

1345
01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:17.130
bought a ticket and attended league of legends finals and the Stanley Cup finals

1346
01:21:17.131 --> 01:21:18.960
this year.
Um,
so,

1347
01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:22.760
but this is from 2003 and it's available in its entirety on Youtube.
Um,

1348
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:25.980
so you can just like watch it for free.
Um,
and that was uh,

1349
01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:31.030
that was a fascinating documentary that I think,
uh,

1350
01:21:31.290 --> 01:21:35.070
as as the years pass and competitive video gaming becomes even more a part of

1351
01:21:35.071 --> 01:21:37.560
our mainstream athletic lives.
Um,
that,

1352
01:21:37.561 --> 01:21:40.110
that early look at it is pretty damn cool.

1353
01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:45.040
<v 1>Have you seen King of Kong?
Of course.
Okay.
All right.
All right.</v>

1354
01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.950
That's in the movie theater.
The day I came out.
God,

1355
01:21:47.951 --> 01:21:52.570
King of Kong you want to talk about like old school mullet vengeance,

1356
01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:56.770
retro video game competitions.
So amazing.
So yeah,

1357
01:21:56.771 --> 01:22:00.730
for I will definitely check out gamers and for people who haven't seen King of

1358
01:22:00.731 --> 01:22:01.564
Kong,

1359
01:22:01.690 --> 01:22:06.640
it seems like a spinal tap sort of parity like a mockumentary.

1360
01:22:06.641 --> 01:22:10.570
It is such a hilarious,
so such a well done documentary

1361
01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:12.490
<v 4>at people take game seriously,
which is,</v>

1362
01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:15.040
that's one of the great paradoxes of play,
right,

1363
01:22:15.041 --> 01:22:19.360
is that it's only play if it's not serious except then we take it incredibly

1364
01:22:19.361 --> 01:22:21.100
seriously,
which is,
which is,
uh,

1365
01:22:21.190 --> 01:22:24.280
which is good because that unlocks all of our gainful strengths.

1366
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:27.500
<v 1>What,
uh,
what,
just a few more questions.</v>

1367
01:22:27.501 --> 01:22:31.610
What purchase of less than a hundred dollars has most positively impacted your

1368
01:22:31.611 --> 01:22:33.560
life in the last,
say six to 12 months?

1369
01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:39.260
<v 4>Oh my gosh.
Um,
I would say,
well this is so,</v>

1370
01:22:39.261 --> 01:22:41.420
I mean this is not going to be surprising at all,

1371
01:22:41.421 --> 01:22:45.770
but I would say a Bjorn carrier for the babies.
Um,

1372
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:47.610
so,
uh,
we,

1373
01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:52.620
we live on a hill and every day we take the babies out for an hour long walk,

1374
01:22:52.761 --> 01:22:55.550
half an hour,
you know,
trudging up this really steep hill,
uh,

1375
01:22:55.551 --> 01:22:57.560
and coming back down and uh,

1376
01:22:57.710 --> 01:23:00.560
being able to leave the house and get some fresh air.
Um,

1377
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:04.160
and also a great workout because the babies are getting fatter every day.

1378
01:23:04.161 --> 01:23:08.140
So it's like,
like just,
just when you're getting really fit,
walking up the hill,

1379
01:23:08.141 --> 01:23:10.350
the baby weighs is another pound and you're,
you know,

1380
01:23:11.490 --> 01:23:13.360
so I would say my Bjorn carrier.

1381
01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:18.290
<v 1>And now is that like a,
a strap that attaches,</v>

1382
01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:20.090
said fat babies to you or is that

1383
01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:21.810
<v 4>yeah,
it's like a harness that you,</v>

1384
01:23:21.811 --> 01:23:25.380
it goes around your back and then the baby like kind of hugs your chest.

1385
01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.840
<v 1>Ah,
cool.
B.
Why BJ?</v>

1386
01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.290
<v 4>Bj.
Bj.
O.
R.
N.
Yeah.
Br.</v>

1387
01:23:32.850 --> 01:23:35.340
<v 1>Yeah,
it's,
it's a,
you know,
the babies,
this is a,</v>

1388
01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:38.700
this is progressive resistance for moms.
It's kind of like the story of,

1389
01:23:38.701 --> 01:23:41.010
I think it's mellow or Milo of Crotona who,

1390
01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:46.610
who every day had to pick up a baby bull calf and lifted over a fence.

1391
01:23:47.701 --> 01:23:49.390
And then of course the story goes,
you know,
what,

1392
01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:52.680
as became a larger and larger bully became the strongest,

1393
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:53.900
strongest men in the world.

1394
01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:58.440
<v 4>Yes.
And this is such a great way to tie back to video games because the,</v>

1395
01:23:58.441 --> 01:24:02.580
one of the reasons why video games are tend to be even better for your gameful

1396
01:24:02.581 --> 01:24:05.760
mindset then other games is that they always get harder,
right?

1397
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:08.850
There's a right depressive for this adaptive,
right?
So you're,

1398
01:24:08.851 --> 01:24:12.000
it's like not like chess where it's very hard to find somebody who's just

1399
01:24:12.001 --> 01:24:14.640
slightly better than you every single time you play.
Um,

1400
01:24:14.850 --> 01:24:17.880
this is video games are designed to be that kind of progressive resistance.

1401
01:24:17.881 --> 01:24:19.890
So you're always playing at the edge of your ability,

1402
01:24:19.891 --> 01:24:21.450
therefore always getting better.

1403
01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:25.330
<v 1>Such a,
such an important point.
I'm really glad you brought that,
brought that up.</v>

1404
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:30.890
Uh,
what morning rituals do you are?

1405
01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.710
What,
what morning rituals are important to you?

1406
01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:38.860
<v 4>Um,
I said I'm a terrible person,
so I will confess.</v>

1407
01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:46.040
I,
okay.
So there's a neuroscience hack in here.

1408
01:24:46.041 --> 01:24:49.790
So when I wake up,
I basically like put on tennis like,

1409
01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:53.950
like today's whatever the latest,
like last 24 hour tennis matches are on TV.

1410
01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:58.610
I'm constantly recording on the tennis channel or Espn,
the live tennis.

1411
01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:03.660
Um,
and,
uh,
and then I,
I do email while I'm watching tennis and,
um,

1412
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:06.110
I spent an inordinate amount of time watching friends.

1413
01:25:06.111 --> 01:25:08.750
Like when I started my startup company for super better,

1414
01:25:08.751 --> 01:25:13.190
I would like disappear for eight hours to go watch,
you know,

1415
01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:17.600
the French Open live.
Like that was just,
you know,
part of my,
uh,
that's,

1416
01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.710
that's working with Jane is she will go disappear and watch tennis for,
you know,

1417
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:24.860
eight hours a day for two to three weeks stretches.
Um,
but,

1418
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:29.210
but it's a good neuroscience hack because all is this true for all professional

1419
01:25:29.211 --> 01:25:33.200
sports.
Um,
every time you make a prediction about something,

1420
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:37.550
your brain increases the amount of dopamine that it has access to because it

1421
01:25:37.551 --> 01:25:40.190
anticipates either success,

1422
01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:43.880
you've successfully predicted what would happen.
So that's great.

1423
01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.100
Or You'll learn from your mistakes.

1424
01:25:46.101 --> 01:25:49.880
So you'll learn information that will make you have a better prediction next

1425
01:25:49.881 --> 01:25:52.640
time.
And every time you get a little boost of dopamine,
it's like,

1426
01:25:52.670 --> 01:25:54.170
it's like taking amphetamines,
right?

1427
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:58.280
So I like to start my day with watching a tennis match because I will have a

1428
01:25:58.281 --> 01:25:59.930
prediction about who I think will win.

1429
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:03.920
And then I will either be right or wrong and I will either feel awesome that I

1430
01:26:03.921 --> 01:26:07.690
was right or I will learn something about how somebody is playing right now and

1431
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.490
what their game is like right now and,

1432
01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.720
and I'll make a better prediction next time.
And so it's like,

1433
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:12.830
it's like basically,
you know,

1434
01:26:12.831 --> 01:26:16.040
it's like a really strong cup of coffee or taking an amphetamine,
um,

1435
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:19.760
giving my brain that kind of a boost,
uh,
every morning.
But you can any,
you know,

1436
01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:21.680
any,
if you have a sports team that you like,

1437
01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.520
that's why people who are really in professional sports,
um,

1438
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:27.050
are happier during the sports season.
Then off season,

1439
01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.350
it's not just that they missed their favorite game is that their brain is

1440
01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:34.000
constantly anticipating success for their favorite team,
which is uh,

1441
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:35.000
increasing dopamine.

1442
01:26:35.001 --> 01:26:37.970
So I like tennis because they only have one month off all year.

1443
01:26:37.971 --> 01:26:40.660
They play for 11 months.
The season is incredibly long.

1444
01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:44.340
<v 1>You can get your fix
is it has there,</v>

1445
01:26:44.370 --> 01:26:46.260
I wasn't expecting me to ask this question,

1446
01:26:46.261 --> 01:26:48.420
but now that you mentioned watching tennis,

1447
01:26:48.450 --> 01:26:53.220
I love watching tennis mesmerized by it.
And it's true for a handful of,
of,

1448
01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:57.600
uh,
individual sports like gymnastics.
Also,
same story.

1449
01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.910
Uh,
is there any,

1450
01:26:59.970 --> 01:27:04.970
have any studies been conducted looking at the carryover benefits of observing

1451
01:27:06.331 --> 01:27:08.910
game play as opposed to being involved in that yourself?

1452
01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:12.670
<v 4>Yes.
Oh my gosh.
Yes.
So,
um,
because,</v>

1453
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:16.760
but it only works if you know how to play the game yourself.
Um,

1454
01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:21.250
and if you know how to play the game,
you activate mirror neuron.
So,
um,

1455
01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:24.970
I have found it if I've,
if it's during Wimbledon or the French Open,

1456
01:27:24.971 --> 01:27:28.890
it's a US Open.
I've been watching literally eight hours a day for two weeks.
Um,

1457
01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:32.410
I will go on the court that Sunday and play better because,

1458
01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:36.820
because I know how to play tennis and my brain can physically embody,

1459
01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.520
like if I see somebody going for a point,

1460
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:43.750
my body and my brain understands what that feels like.

1461
01:27:43.751 --> 01:27:47.740
And so it creates a mirror neuron effect.
So it's practicing.
Um,

1462
01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:51.040
so if you have never played the game or sport yourself,

1463
01:27:51.041 --> 01:27:54.790
like watching gymnastics is not going to do a lot for you unless you have

1464
01:27:54.791 --> 01:27:58.480
physically been on the mat or on the rings or the bars and you know what it

1465
01:27:58.481 --> 01:28:01.690
feels like.
Um,
but if you know what it feels like,

1466
01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:05.310
then your brain practices while you play and it actually is beneficial and that

1467
01:28:05.311 --> 01:28:07.540
that has been documented.
So,
um,

1468
01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:10.060
if you want to get the benefits of watching a sport,

1469
01:28:10.061 --> 01:28:14.170
you should make sure you played it enough times that your,
your body can,

1470
01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:18.400
your brain can follow along in that year in our own way.

1471
01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.170
<v 1>So that that brings up all sorts of interesting ideas such as,
for instance,</v>

1472
01:28:22.171 --> 01:28:27.171
if you knew that if I knew I was going to have a surgery that was going to take

1473
01:28:27.781 --> 01:28:32.040
me out of commission from a sports standpoint for three to six months,

1474
01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:35.850
I'm just making that up.
If I didn't know how to play tennis,

1475
01:28:36.090 --> 01:28:41.090
I could do like a three day intensive or two day intensive immersion course for

1476
01:28:43.291 --> 01:28:48.291
tennis and then use watching tennis therapeutic therapeutically when I'm laid

1477
01:28:49.261 --> 01:28:51.030
out for the subsequent period of time.

1478
01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:54.740
<v 4>You are so good at this.
I love the way your brain like,</v>

1479
01:28:55.170 --> 01:29:00.170
I think that is such an awesome and extreme idea and I really think you and I

1480
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:05.550
write a book together.
Sometime we should take,
like all of that would be,

1481
01:29:05.551 --> 01:29:08.340
that would be something new and interesting and you could take all of this

1482
01:29:08.341 --> 01:29:10.380
research to that extreme,

1483
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:14.700
really life maximizing level in ways that I would never think about.

1484
01:29:15.970 --> 01:29:19.200
Gee,
yes,
I agree.

1485
01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:23.200
<v 1>Uh,
the,
I keep on saying a few more questions.</v>

1486
01:29:24.490 --> 01:29:28.000
Five more minutes took ish snatch.
But anyway,
the uh,

1487
01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:32.830
if you had a billboard you could put anywhere it could say anything,

1488
01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:34.300
what would it say and where would you put it?

1489
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:40.680
<v 4>Oh my God.
Um,
I will,
I would get a billboard that says,</v>

1490
01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.650
uh,

1491
01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:47.160
I mean I really want to do a public service announcement about tetris.
You know,

1492
01:29:47.161 --> 01:29:47.431
I would,

1493
01:29:47.431 --> 01:29:51.630
I would about how tetris can prevent post traumatic stress disorder and I would

1494
01:29:51.631 --> 01:29:55.470
put it,
you know,
uh,
I don't know where I would,

1495
01:29:55.670 --> 01:29:57.930
you should put it in games.
Really.
I should,
cause you know,

1496
01:29:57.931 --> 01:30:00.870
you can like buy advertising in video games.
So I should have,

1497
01:30:00.930 --> 01:30:03.860
I should have a billboard in,
in video games.
Uh,

1498
01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:08.700
so that people who are open to this idea of games and playing them and

1499
01:30:08.701 --> 01:30:10.800
benefiting from them because they,
I,

1500
01:30:10.801 --> 01:30:15.801
it really makes me agitated that there is so much good research that would have

1501
01:30:15.961 --> 01:30:17.430
such profound,
I mean,

1502
01:30:17.431 --> 01:30:21.390
the difference between getting PJC and not getting PTSD and what that would have

1503
01:30:21.391 --> 01:30:25.250
on your life is so freaking profound that,
uh,

1504
01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:27.690
I really feel like a,
I would like to,

1505
01:30:28.110 --> 01:30:31.170
I'd like to get in people's faces about that.
So,
you know,
10,

1506
01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:35.540
10 minutes of Tetris after a trauma done.
Right.

1507
01:30:36.210 --> 01:30:37.043
That's my billboard.

1508
01:30:37.090 --> 01:30:40.070
<v 1>I love it.
And I mean,
I want to play with Tetra side.</v>

1509
01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:42.130
I grew up playing tetris on the game boy,

1510
01:30:42.131 --> 01:30:45.610
so it doesn't take a lot to twist my arm to get back into it.
Uh,

1511
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.000
but I heard a phrase recently which was a take on PTSD,

1512
01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:53.710
but it was related to worrying about things.

1513
01:30:53.711 --> 01:30:57.190
So having anxiety about what might happen and they,
and uh,

1514
01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:02.680
it was called a pre traumatic stress disorder.
And I wonder,

1515
01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:05.650
uh,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll do some experimentation and report back to you,

1516
01:31:05.651 --> 01:31:10.651
but I wonder if tetras could have an inoculating effect against experiencing

1517
01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:16.270
trauma or even foreseeing trauma because you would imagine since that worrying

1518
01:31:16.271 --> 01:31:19.690
is a visual,
often a visualization,
it might have the same type of,

1519
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:25.350
of a kind of decoupling or for coupling effect that minimizes the,

1520
01:31:25.521 --> 01:31:26.010
the negative,

1521
01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:28.080
<v 4>I don't know.
Oh yeah.
Well,
as you get further in the book,</v>

1522
01:31:28.081 --> 01:31:30.890
you'll see actually it's super Mario that's been tested,
um,

1523
01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:33.240
for basically exactly that thing,

1524
01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:36.590
sort of prevent the predictive anxiety,
um,

1525
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:38.720
better than anti anxiety medicine.

1526
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:43.160
<v 1>I need to play more games that,
that is clear and it's such a nice day.</v>

1527
01:31:43.161 --> 01:31:47.440
I think I want to go whack a tennis ball around.
So,
uh,

1528
01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:52.660
if you could make one ask of the people listening or recommendation aside from

1529
01:31:53.751 --> 01:31:57.470
of course the book and I'm going to,
I will put everything in the show notes,

1530
01:31:57.471 --> 01:32:01.330
but what ask or recommendation would you make of the people listening?

1531
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:06.830
<v 4>I would encourage people to ask one person in their life what is their favorite</v>

1532
01:32:09.001 --> 01:32:13.290
game and it could be any kind of game to them to a video game and what it is,
um,

1533
01:32:13.530 --> 01:32:15.450
that they think that gay makes them good at.

1534
01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:20.640
Because one of the things that I found in my research is the best way to ensure

1535
01:32:20.641 --> 01:32:24.510
that somebody starts to use their game full strengths in real life is to talk

1536
01:32:24.511 --> 01:32:28.170
about what games they play and what those games make them good at.

1537
01:32:28.171 --> 01:32:30.750
So if we could have everybody ask one person that question,

1538
01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:34.530
not only will you learn something really interesting about someone you care

1539
01:32:34.531 --> 01:32:35.190
about,

1540
01:32:35.190 --> 01:32:39.680
but they will also benefit from now starting to think about their game,

1541
01:32:39.681 --> 01:32:42.660
full strengths and then maybe how they might apply them in real life.

1542
01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:45.040
<v 1>Well Jane,</v>

1543
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:49.900
dear you and I should get together and a scheme like pinky and the brain to come

1544
01:32:49.901 --> 01:32:51.880
up with some type of massive experiment.

1545
01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.840
<v 4>I love it.
I love it.
Yeah,</v>

1546
01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.660
<v 1>we should,
we should definitely make that happen.
This is a,</v>

1547
01:32:56.661 --> 01:32:57.740
this is really fun Jane.

1548
01:32:57.741 --> 01:33:02.741
Where can people find out everything about you and learn more about super better

1549
01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:07.060

you don't have to take my word for it.
Um,

1558
01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:43.990

1564
01:34:01.361 --> 01:34:04.060

1568
01:34:15.130 --> 01:34:17.500
I am stoked to go play some more games.

This episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things

1580
01:34:57.861 --> 01:34:59.420
graphic design related.

1581
01:34:59.450 --> 01:35:04.450
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

1582
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:08.150
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

1583
01:35:08.151 --> 01:35:12.170
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

1584
01:35:12.171 --> 01:35:12.981
the brainstorming.

1585
01:35:12.981 --> 01:35:16.310
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

1586
01:35:16.311 --> 01:35:20.480
works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,
a website,

1587
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:23.060
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

1588
01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:26.810
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

1589
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:29.450
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

1590
01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:33.140
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

1591
01:35:33.141 --> 01:35:33.800
money back.

1592
01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:37.580
It's that straightforward and many of you who are listening have already used it

1593
01:35:37.581 --> 01:35:40.040
and created some amazing things that I'll be sharing in the future.

1594
01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:42.710
But in the meantime,

episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,

1598
01:36:01.531 --> 01:36:03.720
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

1599
01:36:04.090 --> 01:36:06.630
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

1600
01:36:06.631 --> 01:36:09.120
It is your all in one nutritional insurance.

1601
01:36:09.150 --> 01:36:10.860
I recommended it in the four hour body,

1602
01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.850
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

1603
01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:17.910
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

1604
01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:19.380
It just covers all my basis.

1605
01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:23.400
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

1606
01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:28.260
day,
and you can get 50 oh my gosh,
50% off.
Yes,

1610
