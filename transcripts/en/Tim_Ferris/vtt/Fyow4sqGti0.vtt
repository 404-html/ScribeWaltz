Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.
More specifically.

63
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.870
Welcome to another edition of the Tim Ferriss Radio Hour where I share some of

64
00:04:09.871 --> 00:04:13.230
the habits and patterns of world class performers that I've identified.

65
00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:18.180
After nearly 300,
300 guests on this podcast,

66
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.890
this episode,
we will explore fear,
specifically managing,

67
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.510
mitigating,
overcoming,

68
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.710
which is something I've personally spent decades battling with,
of course,

69
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.400
sometimes being paralyzed by,
and fortunately in more recent years,

70
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.260
more and more overcoming,

71
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.890
and this has been such a focal point of my life,
uh,

72
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.170
for extended periods that my last tedtalk focused on an exercise called fear

73
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:46.320
setting,
which is something that I have found to be a life raft.

74
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.970
And that I practice,
I would say at least once every month.

75
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.250
And you can learn more about that at Tim dot.

It's all free and all specked out for you.

78
00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:01.620
But aside from my personal experience coming up,

79
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:06.621
I'll discuss many different facets of fear or listen to tips and tactics and so

80
00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:10.050
on from folks such as Sir Richard Branson,

81
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.650
founder and chairman of the Virgin Group.
So Richard is of course,

82
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:17.430
a world famous entrepreneur.
Adventure activists in business icon,

83
00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:21.030
his most recent book finding my virginity shares the candid details of a

84
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:25.800
lifetime of triumphs and failures and it provides an intimate look at his quest

85
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:30.720
to push boundaries and that often includes breaking rules,

86
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.790
seeking new frontiers and certainly fear.

87
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.310
<v 3>I suppose the most notable is this failure that we've ever had was taking on</v>

88
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.380
Coda with Virgin Cola and for awhile it really looked like we were going to

89
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.640
topple coke.
Um,
absolutely.
I mean we were outselling them.

90
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.120
<v 1>Then I talked to Maria Sharapova who's the winner of five Grand Slam tennis</v>

91
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:57.100
titles and that sense of wow,
everyone all of a sudden once something,

92
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.400
everyone wants something

93
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.340
<v 4>that you have,
everyone wants to be a part of your success.</v>

94
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.570
<v 1>I also discussed the relationship between courage and fear with movie star</v>

95
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:07.610
director and producer Vince Vaughn.

96
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.600
<v 4>I would get down and I would take four or five days and I would just not do</v>

97
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:13.370
anything and I'd lose my energy.

98
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.830
<v 1>Caroline Paul is our last guest.</v>

99
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.910
She is an author who has worked as a journalist and who also became one of the

100
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:22.880
first female firefighters with the San Francisco Fire Department.

101
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.790
<v 4>And I look around and there was just three of us instead of four.</v>

102
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.160
And I remember thinking I have to go back into that hallway and the,

103
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.710
the fear was paralyzing.

104
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.920
<v 1>So without further ado,</v>

105
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.900
let's jump into it and we can begin with a bit of personal context.

106
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.550
On my part.
For most of my life I would say the driving values,

107
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.580
if you will have been security and lack of vulnerability.

108
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.700
So it's been a very defensive posture for very,
very long portion of my life.

109
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:56.534
Not all of it,

110
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.740
but optimizing was done to maximize security,

111
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:02.090
decreased vulnerability.

112
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.540
And as was told to me recently by Tony Robbins who have had the privilege to get

113
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:08.960
to know over the last few years,

114
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.940
there are some values that the more we obsess over them and fixate on them,

115
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.180
the less we perceive we have them.

116
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.840
And those could be values or resources.
For example,

117
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.100
you have respect or you have security.

118
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:30.080
The more you fixate on those things,
the less you perceive you have a,

119
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:35.081
because you put on a lens through which you see constantly the transgressions,

120
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.380
the slights,
the violations and so on.

121
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.260
And if you are trying to,
in my case,

122
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.780
say control everything for very long time,
the pro and con list,

123
00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:48.020
the analytics,
the spreadsheets,

124
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:51.200
all of that was to try to control as many variables as possible.

125
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.730
And there is a place for control.

126
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:56.660
But when you try to control everything as I did for a very long time and still

127
00:07:56.661 --> 00:07:57.494
sometimes do,

128
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.740
you end up in a position where you can be dominated by fear and or you can feel

129
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.760
helpless.

130
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.760
And this has led me over decades to experience many extended depressive periods.

131
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.160
That has led to having a very close brush with suicide and college,

132
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.850
uh,
which then led to the fear setting exercise that I mentioned earlier.

133
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.590
And all of that for people interested are spelled out both in text and video,

Blog Ford Slash Ted.

135
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.010
But I don't try to figure it all out on my own.

136
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.180
That is mistake that I've made repeatedly in the past and I've tried to get

137
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:40.181
better at asking for help and asking experts to explain how they handle the ups

138
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:44.180
and downs,
the triumphs and the failures,

139
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.910
the fear of the unknown and so on.

140
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.310
That allows me to assemble a toolkit of reminders and principles.

141
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:56.370
Beliefs may be phrases that I can revisit on a regular basis.

142
00:08:56.371 --> 00:09:01.371
This is part of the reason why I ask so many of my guests about their failures

143
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.150
and fierce,

144
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.410
so let's jump to Sir Richard Branson.

145
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.450
Richard Branson on Twitter and mostly everywhere else is an English business

146
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.580
magnate investor and philanthropist.

147
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:18.600
He founded the virgin group which controls more than 400 companies.

148
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.000
Boggles the mind really to even think about that.

149
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.600
I have a long history with Sir Richard's books all the way back to losing my

150
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:32.460
virginity,
which I brought with me.
I still own it to this day after college.

151
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.260
And it helped to inspire one of my first businesses and his most recent book

152
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.190
finding my virginity,
which shares the details of,
as I mentioned before,

153
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.530
many of his triumphs and failures,

154
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.400
both of which on either end of the spectrum have been spectacular.

155
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.930
There've been so many really,
really incredibly,
uh,

156
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.850
noteworthy failures in Sir Richard's life.

157
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.250
We discussed his quest to push the boundaries,

158
00:09:56.251 --> 00:09:59.130
stay high life and in the process conquer fear.

159
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.870
When you felt overwhelmed or unfocused,

160
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.270
uh,
or if you feel like you've temporarily lost your focus,

161
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.590
what do you do or what have you found to help?
Uh,
you know,

162
00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:19.820
what questions do you ask yourself?
Is there,
in those cases,

163
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.640
what have you done historically that is,
that has been helpful?

164
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:23.190
<v 5>You know,</v>

165
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:28.190
I personally believe that the majority of people have down send their lives.

166
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.440
They can,
they can actually trace it back quite often to alcohol,
you know,

167
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:38.450
so perhaps the early days of my life that I feel lethargic is instead of having

168
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.160
two glasses at nighttime,
I had five or six.

169
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.750
And if I find that it's happened on more than one or two occasions,

170
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.080
I then give up completely for a month or two and,

171
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.540
uh,
and feel absolutely fantastic of course,

172
00:10:57.541 --> 00:11:01.590
and realized that I'm never going to drink another touch about all the gain

173
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.430
until actually you do.
And,
and,
um,
you know,
fortunately,
I,
yeah,

174
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.800
I'm so busy that I,

175
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.090
I just can't afford to let myself down too often.

176
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.400
But my guess is that,
um,
yeah,
for the vast majority of people,
you know,

177
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.070
if you can,

178
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.510
if you can be high on life and fit and healthy and,

179
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.360
uh,
and you know,
if you do find that,
um,
there's something like alcohol is,

180
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.770
uh,
is,
is,
is just the beginning.
You're beginning subject,

181
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.470
you'd get go a bit too far.
Uh,
you know,
being high on life is just so wonderful.

182
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:35.683
In essence.

183
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.610
<v 1>Oh,
for a friend of mine,
a entrepreneur named Matt Mullenweg,</v>

184
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:43.090
he's been on this podcast as well.
He's the CEO of a company called automatic,

185
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:48.670
which is behind wordpress,
which powers around 37% of the Internet right now.
And,

186
00:11:48.671 --> 00:11:52.870
uh,
he told me at one point that he had learned something along ago,
which,

187
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.920
uh,

188
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.920
alcohol is borrowing happiness from tomorrow and certainly seems to be the case.

189
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.670
<v 5>I think that there's a,
there's a,
there's a beautiful words and they're very,</v>

190
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.420
very,
very true.
Um,
you know,

191
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.410
my son is just had a yet alcohol and,
and,
you know,
look,

192
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:18.230
you can tell he's just so high on a lot.
He's just enjoying,
enjoying it.

193
00:12:18.231 --> 00:12:22.110
Like I like he's never enjoyed it before and,
and you know,

194
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.730
so like if you could do it in moderation,
that's great.
Uh,
you know,

195
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.350
I tell the story in the book,
there was one,
one night and when we,

196
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:35.540
when we won the Grand Prix in Melbourne,
and,
um,
anyway,

197
00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:40.541
I let my hair down to such an extent that it would have made the film hangover

198
00:12:40.881 --> 00:12:44.540
look like a children's children's film.
Uh,
and,

199
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.930
and,
uh,
the next day I woke up and anyway,
I gave,

200
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:54.990
I gave up for six months.
And so it,
yeah,
it doesn't happen to me too often.
Um,

201
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.550
but,
um,
but I think Jen,
generally the gets,
yeah.

202
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:03.590
Generally when that's the one area that I think a lot of a lot of people they

203
00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:08.960
do,
you don't run into problems that lives.
It's just such slightly too much.

204
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.660
<v 1>Well,
during those periods when you go off alcohol,</v>

205
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:16.160
do you avoid circumstances where other people are drinking or is there something

206
00:13:16.161 --> 00:13:18.980
that you say to people if you are in those circumstances,

207
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:24.010
how do you ensure that you don't have just that one drink that then triggers

208
00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:27.350
more drinks?
If you're trying to take time away from alcohol

209
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.700
<v 5>is simply to have a cranberry and soda in a champagne glass.</v>

210
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.213
People don't know.

211
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.080
I just want to take primary decider in the champagne glass then.
But I think,

212
00:13:40.081 --> 00:13:41.400
look,
I think for a lot of people,

213
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.170
especially when people first to give up anything like that,
drugs,
alcohol,

214
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.190
they need to walk away completely for a while.
Fortunately,

215
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.690
I haven't gotten into,
I've never let myself get to that,
that,
that stage,

216
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.260
but you know,
but I think that,
you know,
the best advice is to get,
you know,

217
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.600
get getting,
you know,
just,
you know,

218
00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:05.360
just say I need to go to bed early tonight and walk away.
Um,

219
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.780
otherwise it's very difficult to people to stay with it all.

220
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.130
You saw you,
are you somebody who drinks or not?

221
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.840
<v 1>Uh,
I don't drink a whole lot.
I do enjoy wine.
Fortunately,</v>

222
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.550
I don't feel like I've had any,
um,
issues with alcohol,

223
00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:23.730
although genetically my family seems to have that predisposition.

224
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:28.020
Certainly have a fair amount of alcoholism and Mike extended family.
So I do,

225
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.420
I think about it quite a bit.
I can,

226
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.400
I can tell that I think I have the potential to abuse it,

227
00:14:35.401 --> 00:14:36.930
but I haven't up to this point.

228
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.380
<v 3>I think that you and not,
you and I have such fascinating lives that you know,</v>

229
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.860
that,
that that is the best way of keeping,
you know,

230
00:14:44.861 --> 00:14:47.200
keeping these sorts of things in check.
You know,
we just,

231
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:52.180
we want every day is so interesting that I'm just not going want to waste waste

232
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.780
today.
Right.
You know,
let,
let,

233
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:55.610
let me get something like that and take over your life.

234
00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:00.870
<v 1>Right.
No,
definitely.
And,
uh,
just,
just two more questions for me.</v>

235
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:06.290
This is one really intended just to give people a window into how you cope with

236
00:15:07.831 --> 00:15:12.720
some of the harder times.
Uh,
do you have a favorite failure of yours?

237
00:15:12.721 --> 00:15:14.580
And what I mean by that is,
uh,

238
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:19.530
how has a failure or an apparent failure set you up for later success?

239
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.930
Are there any particular examples that come to mind?

240
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.940
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean,
I think old me and,
uh,
on the adventure side,</v>

241
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.360
you the test.
I'm we the Atlantic and um,

242
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.410
we are trying to break the record for the pastors across the Atlantic and

243
00:15:34.411 --> 00:15:38.730
getting the new ribbon back and um,
you know,
and we sank.

244
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.510
And then the next day we built another boat and we were successful.

245
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.100
And the British people love people who are underdogs.

246
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.050
And,
uh,
and it taught me that actually failing and then being successful,

247
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.400
most likely he was better than just going out there and being successful the

248
00:15:56.401 --> 00:15:59.840
first time round.
I mean,
it is overcoming difficulties,
uh,

249
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.380
the public almost preferred.

250
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.560
And then someone who's just successful the first time around,
maybe,

251
00:16:04.561 --> 00:16:07.050
maybe not so much in America but in person anyway,

252
00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:11.400
as far as the most notable business failure that we've ever had was taking on

253
00:16:11.401 --> 00:16:13.740
Coca Cola,
uh,
with Virgin Cola.

254
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.870
And for awhile it really looked like we were going to topple coke and Pepsi.

255
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.540
I mean,
we were outselling them in the UK.

256
00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:26.670
The virgin brand resonated it.
People love to drink.
I mean,

257
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.150
and then,
you know,
we landed in Times Square with the,
with the,

258
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.120
with the Sherman tank and you know,
we,

259
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:37.130
we took on coke in their homeland in America and code decided too far back and

260
00:16:38.941 --> 00:16:40.330
they build that,
um,

261
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.100
DC tens full of money and hit men and women.

262
00:16:44.101 --> 00:16:48.660
And they landed in the territories that we had launched and they suddenly,

263
00:16:48.661 --> 00:16:51.300
Virgin Cola started disappearing from all these shells.

264
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.140
And I think the lesson I learned from that was if I'm going to take on a good

265
00:16:55.141 --> 00:16:58.020
liar,
I've got to be,
we've got to be different.

266
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.670
We've got to be much better than they are.
And you know with a Cola,

267
00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:06.360
you're just another cola.
You're not,
you can't be fundamentally different.

268
00:17:06.361 --> 00:17:08.790
You can be cheaper than you can't be fundamentally different.

269
00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:11.850
So anything we've launched since then,
we've got,

270
00:17:11.851 --> 00:17:14.100
we've only launched new businesses if we,

271
00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:16.830
if we can make a fundamental difference.
I love it.

272
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.160
<v 1>Yeah,
that's so,
so important to underscore.</v>

273
00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:23.160
I think this is the last rapid fire question,
if you,

274
00:17:23.161 --> 00:17:26.820
if you could have a giant billboard anywhere with anything on it.
So,

275
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.560
and this is metaphorically speaking,

276
00:17:28.561 --> 00:17:31.080
so getting a message out to millions or billions of people,

277
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.760
what would it say and why?
It could be a few words.
Could be paragraph,

278
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:40.610
could be a quote.
You live your life by yours or someone else's.
It does.

279
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.880
Does anything come to mind if you could get a message out to billions of people,

280
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.240
what would you,
what,
what might you put on that billboard?

281
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.130
I think I'm going to sound like

282
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.530
<v 6>a,
a,
um,
a muddle on stage,
um,</v>

283
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.660
<v 3>peace,
peace of the world.
Uh,
and,</v>

284
00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:05.530
and therefore I will instead go back to be a businessman,

285
00:18:05.531 --> 00:18:08.380
which is,
you know,
I think just something like nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

286
00:18:08.381 --> 00:18:11.940
I think,
I think that in life,
if people,
you know,

287
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.880
people get to try things and stick their neck out,

288
00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.950
they're going to have a lot more fun than that.

289
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.150
If they sitting home watching other people do it.
And I'm so,
yeah.

290
00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.690
So I think that old,
that old quote,
nothing ventured,
nothing gained is important.

291
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.890
Having said that,
I,
um,
you know,

292
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.070
I've been involved for 10 years now in this wonderful group called the eldest

293
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.280
and,
um,
and Nelson Mandela set it up

294
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.970
<v 5>and it's not run by Copia and,
and,
and I,
and I really do believe that,
uh,
in my,</v>

295
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.920
in our lifetime,
I've seen so many unnecessary wars.
I've seen the Vietnamese war,

296
00:18:45.921 --> 00:18:48.360
I've seen the Iraq war,
the Libyan war.

297
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.960
And these were all incredibly unjust wars,
which have,
you know,

298
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.280
gone on to some Sporn awful things like isis and so on,

299
00:18:56.281 --> 00:19:01.080
which would not have happened if it wasn't for actually the West,
uh,

300
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.380
taking it upon themselves to interfere in other countries,

301
00:19:04.381 --> 00:19:09.220
business and killing and maiming thousands of people.
And,
you know,
we,

302
00:19:09.221 --> 00:19:14.040
we,
we,
we must make sure that we don't have any walls in the future.

303
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:19.050
And I think it takes business people,
uh,
it takes,

304
00:19:19.051 --> 00:19:19.910
society,

305
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.540
takes all of us to really make sure that our politicians never,

306
00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:27.120
never take us down that path again.
I mean,

307
00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:31.050
one of the sides of things I think about the invasion of Iraq was,
you know,
yes,

308
00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:32.790
there were thousands of people on the streets.

309
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.620
There should have been hundreds and hundreds of thousands,
just like,
uh,

310
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:41.490
the Vietnamese war two to stop such a foodish excursion.

311
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.530
You know,
all,
all conflicts should be able to be resolved by negotiation.

312
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:50.040
And you know,
even if you don't get exactly what you want out of it,

313
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.730
that is better than better than the all the bloodshed that flows from,

314
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.943
from conflict.

315
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.063
<v 7>Okay.</v>

316
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:05.330
<v 1>Maria Sharapova at Maria Sharapova is the winner of five Grand Slam titles and</v>

317
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:06.750
an Olympic silver medalist.

318
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.010
She is one of 10 women and the only Russian to hold a career Grand Slam,

319
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.130
which refers to winning all four major championships.

320
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.000
Wimbleton the Australian Open,
the US Open and the French Open.

321
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.800
Forbes also has named Maria the highest paid female athlete of all time,

322
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.930
which she first earned in 2005 she has held that title for more than a decade.

323
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.513
<v 7>Okay.</v>

324
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:37.390
<v 8>Is it true that you've never used the word rejection or that you don't believe</v>

325
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.830
in that word?
Is that true?
Well,
I don't,

326
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:48.040
I mean that's a very,
it's a very word to believe

327
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.600
<v 9>in.
It's a very tough word to,
except I think one of the reasons is,</v>

328
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:53.530
is because I,

329
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.830
I saw in many different scenarios where my father would say no because he would

330
00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:03.610
open up an opportunity to say yes and

331
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.750
<v 10>could you please explain?</v>

332
00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.950
<v 9>So there are many situations,</v>

333
00:21:09.951 --> 00:21:14.951
whether it was a coaching opportunity or whether it was receiving money from an

334
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.160
agency,

335
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.680
you had this ability to say no to the things that seem that like they made

336
00:21:21.681 --> 00:21:22.310
sense,

337
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:27.310
like the easy way out because he believed that later he'd have a better

338
00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:31.260
opportunity to say yes to bigger and greater things.
Right.

339
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.730
<v 10>You said no to the small shiny objects</v>

340
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.960
<v 9>at the time.
I'm sure they didn't seem so small.
Not Smart,
not smug smile.</v>

341
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.800
<v 10>That's why I'm in perception.
Right?
The short term shiny objects maybe.
Okay.</v>

342
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.230
<v 9>Right.
So if rejection,
it wasn't,
um,</v>

343
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:51.780
there was never a cause I always had,
I mean I,

344
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:56.830
I always was following and kind of next to my father and seeing the decisions

345
00:21:57.251 --> 00:22:02.050
that you would make a,
I was only a kid and even when I won,
I won.

346
00:22:02.051 --> 00:22:03.970
Wimbledon knows only 17 years old.

347
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:07.860
You're still a kid and you're still fun following the guidance and you know,

348
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.610
I'd win a match falling,

349
00:22:09.611 --> 00:22:14.230
then I'd call it or I'd win a tournament and I go shopping in a store and I

350
00:22:14.231 --> 00:22:17.860
would call my mom cause I,
I something like quite pricey and I,

351
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.450
I didn't know if I could buy it.
So still asking permission,

352
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.420
even though I had earned that money,

353
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.840
if I could purchase a piece of jewelry or shoes or whatever it was at the time

354
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:29.501
that I wanted.

355
00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:34.501
So I was always watching and observing and they never rejection.

356
00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:40.210
I mean you're,
of course when someone says no to you,
it's easy to say,

357
00:22:40.211 --> 00:22:42.280
Oh yes I was,
I was rejected.

358
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:47.410
But if you can open up a different opportunity from that point of view,

359
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.770
then you're turning a no into something that's,

360
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.380
<v 10>that brought you to a better place.</v>

361
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.210
It sounds like you did that with your interactions with some of the other

362
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:04.020
players who were boarding at Nick's tennis academy in a way.

363
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.730
Yeah.
Do you consider yourself an introvert and extrovert?
The blend?

364
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.440
How do you think about that?

365
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.260
<v 9>I think from a very young age because of sort of the,</v>

366
00:23:16.261 --> 00:23:18.710
the process that I,
that I went through,
um,

367
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:24.210
and the success that I earned from a young age and winning a major and a grand

368
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:29.830
slam at such a young age.
And because it became so unexpected,

369
00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:33.250
I went from being someone that was,
you know,

370
00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.200
that someone that people scout it to being someone that everyone had analyzed

371
00:23:38.201 --> 00:23:41.260
and knew about and wanted to know more of.

372
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:46.040
And I created this.
Um,
no,

373
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:50.310
I definitely put on these horse blinders because if I had not,

374
00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:55.790
my mind would have been everywhere and I think it would have been so easy to be

375
00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.190
distracted and in those moments and situations and be pulled in different

376
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:06.000
directions.
Which a Hudson,
it's a slippery slope.

377
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.710
It's very dangerous.

378
00:24:07.711 --> 00:24:12.711
And as a young girl it could have been a disaster to say the least.

379
00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:14.244
And so,

380
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:15.160
<v 10>okay.</v>

381
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.510
<v 9>I definitely remember,</v>

382
00:24:16.511 --> 00:24:20.910
I remember the moment and it was just a few matches before I won Wimbledon where

383
00:24:20.911 --> 00:24:23.940
I was sitting down with my coach and all of a sudden,
I think,

384
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:28.700
I think it was before the semifinals at that tournament and all these tourists

385
00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:32.170
who had gotten credentials,
they seem like tourists.
I didn't know who they were.

386
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.240
Um,
maybe they would,
maybe they weren't.

387
00:24:34.241 --> 00:24:37.000
Maybe they were important agents are sponsors,

388
00:24:37.001 --> 00:24:40.390
but at the time they just seem like tourists that are wanted a picture with me

389
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:41.783
and,

390
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.540
and it really came overnight and that sense of wow,

391
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.770
everyone,
all of a sudden once something,
everyone wants something that you have,

392
00:24:50.771 --> 00:24:55.690
everyone wants to be a part of your success.
I didn't like that feeling.
You know,

393
00:24:55.691 --> 00:24:58.960
I,
I love the feeling of being in a position of,

394
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.220
of showcasing what I could do with my tennis racket.

395
00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.820
But that feeling of everyone wanting a piece of that and the feeling of your

396
00:25:09.821 --> 00:25:14.800
opponents,
all of a sudden all of a sudden feeling like just by beating her,

397
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.950
they're not just winning a quarter final of the final of the match,

398
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.280
but they're winning so much more.
Um,

399
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.200
it made me,

400
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:29.100
it made me feel like I needed to kind of put myself in a bubble to concentrate,

401
00:25:29.621 --> 00:25:32.890
to focus,
that it was going to be that much harder,
that much more difficult.

402
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.830
And I did.
And,
um,

403
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.680
I don't know if I could have done it another way.

404
00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.380
<v 10>What were some of the,</v>

405
00:25:40.381 --> 00:25:45.381
or what are some of the best practices or decisions that have helped you with

406
00:25:47.161 --> 00:25:49.590
that?
Because for instance,
my friend Josh,

407
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.700
I was mentioning earlier who became well known effectively overnight,

408
00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:58.380
particularly with the movie about his life,
uh,
for chess.

409
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.660
He could no longer compete,
uh,

410
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:05.070
effectively after that because he would go to a chess tournament and there would

411
00:26:05.071 --> 00:26:09.600
be,
um,
I'm making up the age,
but he's something like 13 or 14,

412
00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:13.650
and all of a sudden they're 20 girls who want his attention and a bunch of

413
00:26:13.651 --> 00:26:15.930
reporters.
And a,

414
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.750
he removed himself completely from the competitive scene.

415
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.240
He's one of the most private people I know at this point.
So what,

416
00:26:22.241 --> 00:26:26.040
what helped you,
what kind of decisions or advice or practices?

417
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.160
<v 9>I think it was surrounding myself with good minds and good people that had my</v>

418
00:26:32.491 --> 00:26:36.690
best interest.
And it's so easy to say those words,

419
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.080
but I know how difficult it is to find those people.

420
00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.930
And even harder now nowadays,
and it,

421
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.920
and I s I saw so many different examples of other,

422
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:52.280
of other tennis players and of their success and their paths after that.

423
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:56.100
And the people that you all of a sudden associate yourself with,

424
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.570
I think as an individual,

425
00:26:57.571 --> 00:27:02.571
it's very easy to be affected by the voices that are next to you because we

426
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:04.900
listened to that and we,

427
00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:10.110
we process that information and all of a sudden we,

428
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:14.760
I won't say we want to be like them,
but we,
we,
we interpreted in,

429
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.450
in our way.
But like when I read,
when I read a funny book,

430
00:27:18.451 --> 00:27:22.200
all of a sudden I feel like I'm a comedian or you know,
when I,

431
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:27.000
I watched this an incredible,
um,
acting by someone,

432
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.930
it inspires me to,
um,
to be an actor.
You know,

433
00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:34.560
it's like there's moments of this that that happens as an athlete you surround

434
00:27:34.561 --> 00:27:39.030
yourself with,
with people's opinions or choices or money and wealth.

435
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:43.470
And it's very,
it's such an easy distraction.
And,

436
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.700
and I surrounded myself with good people and I,

437
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.880
the friends that I have today where my friends,

438
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.880
when I was a young girl that my manager has managed,

439
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:58.881
knew since I was 11 years old now my mom is still very much my best friend and

440
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.240
another really good friend of mine I met when I was 11 years old as well.

441
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.320
So I have,
um,
I have this fondness of,

442
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.580
of developing those real connections with people.

443
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:16.970
And I think it was so helpful for me as a young girl because I competed in front

444
00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:19.260
of thousands of people and I still do.

445
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.320
And the walk to the tunnel and the walk to a press conference and the walk back

446
00:28:26.161 --> 00:28:26.994
in the hotel room.

447
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:32.360
It's a very lonely journey and that it's a difficult,

448
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.710
you know,
you're in your mind a lot and you're,
you're thinking a lot.

449
00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:42.480
So when you have,
when you have voices next to you that are the right voices,

450
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.860
then it,
it's so helpful.
But I know how hard it is to find.

451
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.860
But I do believe that that is a big part of my success.

452
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.100
<v 10>I have some public exposure and have found,</v>

453
00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:58.330
I've made it a lot of mistakes and found it really difficult to identify in some

454
00:28:58.331 --> 00:29:02.530
cases what ulterior motives are or if people start doing the tons of favors,

455
00:29:02.531 --> 00:29:06.310
I now realize there might be something coming six months later.

456
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.760
Uh,
so I'm very hesitant to accept favors,

457
00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.860
but I can't even imagine the level,

458
00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:20.250
I mean I'm playing tee ball and you're in the major leagues in the world series

459
00:29:20.471 --> 00:29:25.471
when it comes to how many people want a piece of you and how do you,

460
00:29:25.781 --> 00:29:26.560
for instance,

461
00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:31.540
assess someone if you say have coffee or lunch with them,

462
00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:36.650
what do you look out for or look for me?

463
00:29:36.651 --> 00:29:40.300
And how do you decide whether it's someone you want to see a second time or talk

464
00:29:40.301 --> 00:29:41.134
to a second?

465
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.060
<v 11>Uh,
I,
if,
if anything comes to mind,
and this is just because quite frankly,</v>

466
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.250
you've had a lot more requests.
Yeah.
Well,
no,
you've got a lot,

467
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.990
you've got a lot more practice and that you said,
I was like,
Whoa,

468
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.790
that automatic reply.
I was like,
oh my goodness.
Oh,
I don't know.

469
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.750
It was emailing you.
I'm afraid I have 4,091 unread email in my inbox.

470
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.930
Oh my goodness.
Released into the wild.

471
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.240
<v 9>Do that.
I need to keep my inbox clean then I feel like I've a mess in my head.</v>

472
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:16.250
<v 11>All right,
well we'll talk about that next.
But in the meantime,</v>

473
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.890
um,
so how do I,
I choose,

474
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.170
<v 9>um,
I think it's about,</v>

475
00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:27.210
I love meeting people and I love having conversation and I love being inspired

476
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.600
and you can get so much out of a conversation or about from x by exposing

477
00:30:34.651 --> 00:30:39.360
yourself to being in an unfamiliar territory.
So with people.

478
00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:43.860
Um,
and I'll give you the kind of an example that was,

479
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.260
I felt like it was important because I'm very much,

480
00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:49.320
I'm always around the same people.
So I have my team,

481
00:30:49.321 --> 00:30:53.040
which is my coach and my fitness coach and my trainer.
And we travel.

482
00:30:53.041 --> 00:30:54.570
I see them more than my family.

483
00:30:55.050 --> 00:31:00.050
We travel probably 260 days out of the year together,

484
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.420
breakfast,
lunch,
dinners,
practice training.
Um,

485
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.640
we know so much of each other.

486
00:31:05.641 --> 00:31:08.430
And then you have a manager and then you come home and then you have your

487
00:31:08.431 --> 00:31:09.180
friends.

488
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:13.620
So I'm always surrounded by people that I know and that I trust and that I love,

489
00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:17.580
which is incredible.
But I always think that as a,

490
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:22.640
as a human being and from the perspective of the mind and growth and um,

491
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.900
intellectually when you're put in a situation where you're unfamiliar with

492
00:31:27.901 --> 00:31:32.901
people and you're unfamiliar with their stories or who they are and you have to

493
00:31:33.961 --> 00:31:36.840
ask questions and to get that out,

494
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.350
it makes you a much more interesting person.

495
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:44.940
And so last year I put myself in this position,
um,

496
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:50.120
where I had all this time off and it was during the summer and I signed up for

497
00:31:51.811 --> 00:31:56.760
these two business courses in Boston at Harvard business school and I was one

498
00:31:56.761 --> 00:32:00.630
out of the 40 students,
I believe in each of these courses.

499
00:32:00.631 --> 00:32:02.100
And I stayed on campus.

500
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:07.130
And these were individuals who were CEOs and CEOs of companies,

501
00:32:08.071 --> 00:32:11.310
of airlines of Microsoft have,
um,

502
00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.260
all these incredible brands.

503
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:16.940
And I was by far the youngest and,

504
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.390
and um,

505
00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:22.830
probably the silliest and the least knowledgeable one in the room.

506
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.420
But just by being with them,
just by sitting with them,

507
00:32:27.421 --> 00:32:30.540
just by sitting with them at dinner,
by asking them questions,

508
00:32:30.541 --> 00:32:33.210
by feeling a little bit uncomfortable.

509
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:38.580
I felt like at the end of those three weeks I grew and I grew and,

510
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.230
and it wasn't that,
I mean there were definitely things that I learned that I,

511
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.560
I'm applying and that I wanted to apply in my business.

512
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:50.240
But the biggest thing I got out of it was that I grew as a person.
I,

513
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.380
I became familiar and an in a very unfamiliar territory.

514
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.630
I still keep in touch with people in those,
in,
in the classes.

515
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:03.280
Um,
we have completely different lives.
Um,

516
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:07.820
their CEO's of companies,
they have,
you know,
three or four kids.

517
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:08.930
Um,
you know,

518
00:33:08.931 --> 00:33:12.950
they travel all over the place and here I am a 30 year old athlete,

519
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.870
but there's so much respect in that room because we're all trying to learn and

520
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:20.570
to grow.
And so when I,
when you asked me like,

521
00:33:20.571 --> 00:33:24.710
who are the people that you want to meet with or speak to or have a coffee with,

522
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:29.720
I always think of that and the people that I choose to be with or the people

523
00:33:29.721 --> 00:33:33.680
that I want to learn from and that I want to have a conversation with and not

524
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:37.910
just about what they bought at the flea market or you know,
what they're gonna,

525
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.560
how they're,
how they like their coffee.

526
00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:43.130
But it's about the world and it's about education.
It's about people.
And,

527
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:45.800
and it's not about right or wrong,

528
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:50.030
I don't always have conversation because I want to know what makes someone

529
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:52.730
perfect and not,
I like to hear opinions.

530
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:57.680
And I got out of that experience in Boston and I know I felt like I grew,

531
00:33:57.681 --> 00:34:02.390
I felt like I stepped up and I got out of my comfort zone and I followed up with

532
00:34:02.391 --> 00:34:06.160
them.
And,
um,
and we still keep in touch about business and um,

533
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:11.210
projects and things like that.
So it was a very interesting experience.

534
00:34:11.211 --> 00:34:12.080
Personally for me,

535
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:17.303
<v 1>Vince Vaughn,</v>

536
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.230
wild west on Twitter is one of the most prolific actors,

537
00:34:22.231 --> 00:34:23.950
writers and producers in the world.

538
00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:27.480
If he's acted in more than the 30 major motion pictures that have gone on to

539
00:34:27.481 --> 00:34:30.720
grow some more than 1.7 billion at the box office.

540
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.560
He's largely credited for redefining the r rated comedy with this performance in

541
00:34:34.561 --> 00:34:36.780
the 2005 hit wedding crashers,

542
00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.520
which set the record for highest grossing r rated comedy at the time he is and

543
00:34:41.521 --> 00:34:42.390
will continue to be.

544
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.230
I expect one of the most sought after leading men in Hollywood.

545
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:52.680
I met Vince because he listened to this podcast and he reached out through his

546
00:34:52.681 --> 00:34:53.401
production company,

547
00:34:53.401 --> 00:34:57.660
wild west to see if we might do a TV show together specifically.
He had seen,

548
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:02.430
one of my first ted talks was actually recorded at something called the Eg,

549
00:35:02.431 --> 00:35:05.730
the entertainment gathering,
where I talked about language learning,

550
00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:07.500
dance and swimming,

551
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:12.710
three fears that I overcame it using different toolkits with the help of mentors

552
00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:18.290
and we discussed many different options and we settled on a show that ended up

553
00:35:18.601 --> 00:35:23.601
being called fearless with the less in parentheses and it's in parentheses

554
00:35:23.641 --> 00:35:28.350
because the objective of the show where I interviewed everyone from David
Blaine,

555
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:33.380
the illusionist and endurance artist to Kyle Maynard and Stewart Copeland of the

556
00:35:33.961 --> 00:35:37.860
police and so on.
The objective was and is teach

557
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.390
<v 12>people to fear less to words to fearless,
which is trainable,</v>

558
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.090
not to be fearless,
which is not the objective at all.

559
00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.040
You know,

560
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:54.000
one great thing about failure as you realize it's not as bad as your mind makes

561
00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:57.960
it out to be and script the Ferris more crippling than the actual consequences.

562
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.590
The consequences a lot of times feel almost relieving in a way,

563
00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:02.730
because now you've faced it,

564
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:07.780
<v 13>you've gone through it,
and that kind of takes that away from,
yeah,
no,
it's,</v>

565
00:36:07.781 --> 00:36:10.320
it's amazing how also over time,
the more you,

566
00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.300
you don't address your fear and meaning.

567
00:36:15.301 --> 00:36:18.990
If you take some large fear and you break it down into the smallest possible

568
00:36:18.991 --> 00:36:20.310
steps,
let's say for swimming,

569
00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:24.060
for me it was even just putting my face underwater for a period of time,
right?

570
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:26.280
So forget about swimming,
forget about learning how to breathe,

571
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.110
just putting your face under water,
and then when you finally have the incentive,

572
00:36:31.111 --> 00:36:33.510
like this bet that I had with my friend,

573
00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:38.511
or rather this mutually assigned near as resolution with the deadline,

574
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.070
was that with a deadline with a deadline.

575
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.320
When I actually sat down and found a method of swimming called total immersion,

576
00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:47.280
which I recommend everybody,

577
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.790
which was introduced to me by Chris Sacca who also had difficulty swimming and

578
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:53.610
he said,
I'm the answer to your prayers.
It took me a week,

579
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.960
about 10 days to go from zero laps in a pool to like 40 laps a workout as

580
00:37:00.361 --> 00:37:03.120
meditation.
It was an incredibly,
it was in,

581
00:37:03.121 --> 00:37:06.690
it was incredibly easy compared to the mental monster that I had created for

582
00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:07.290
myself.

583
00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:11.580
That's what's fascinating is how much of it is the woods that we've created

584
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:15.930
versus the actual path to the destination.
You were,

585
00:37:15.931 --> 00:37:20.910
as I understand it,
uh,
rejected for certain roles because of your height.

586
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.260
Is that true?
I mean the leading,
uh,

587
00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.800
leading men at the time or that the roles they were casting for or maybe the

588
00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:33.280
people you'd be featured with would be shorter and the issues there that,
that,

589
00:37:33.281 --> 00:37:35.550
that ended up being an issue in the early days.

590
00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.250
<v 12>I think whatever you're getting rejected for,
they find a reason to say it.</v>

591
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.750
You know,
I think when I was going out for roles,

592
00:37:40.751 --> 00:37:44.230
you younger and I was so much taller than people,
they would say that,

593
00:37:44.231 --> 00:37:46.630
and I'm sure it played a role into it,
but I think it's important.

594
00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:49.720
Whatever you're doing that you don't give voice to things that you're not able

595
00:37:49.721 --> 00:37:53.680
to change,
you would have to use it in a way to find ways to do stuff.

596
00:37:53.681 --> 00:37:57.670
It's all in neutral,
ultimately,
even if it doesn't feel that way on some level,

597
00:37:57.671 --> 00:38:00.700
at least for the purposes of approaching stuff.
But,
you know,
look,

598
00:38:00.701 --> 00:38:04.020
at the end of the day,
it's just a lot of rejection.
It's the nature of it.
So I,

599
00:38:04.021 --> 00:38:04.960
I had gotten turned on,

600
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:06.120
<v 13>okay,</v>

601
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.260
<v 12>probably a thousand to one for the Times that I would audition or more.
Um,</v>

602
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.540
and it wasn't always consistent,
the reasons why,

603
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.540
but all you knew was that you weren't getting a chance to participate.

604
00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:20.541
And so you would have to go back to the lab and try to get to a place of being

605
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:22.020
more and more undeniable.

606
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:26.420
<v 13>And when you are going through all these rejections,
of course,</v>

607
00:38:26.421 --> 00:38:27.260
at a certain point,

608
00:38:27.261 --> 00:38:32.261
it just becomes second nature to not flinch as much when you get turned down for

609
00:38:32.331 --> 00:38:36.040
something.
But if you were giving advice,
say an

610
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.420
<v 12>up and coming actor who has some degree of talent,</v>

611
00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:42.850
but it's getting rejected and they're,

612
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:45.610
they're really just feeling like they're getting punched in the face by the

613
00:38:45.611 --> 00:38:47.890
world,
what would you say to that person?
Well,

614
00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:50.650
I think I looked at it mathematically at a certain point,

615
00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:55.651
which was I started just focusing my entire day on perfecting

616
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:01.960
my craft.
So it was either watching a movie,
reading a book on stuff.

617
00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:05.410
I'm doing monologues,
taking classes,

618
00:39:05.411 --> 00:39:08.410
and I drink products from infomercials Gordian probably for infomercials came

619
00:39:08.411 --> 00:39:10.540
later.
That was the dessert.
That was a treat for him.

620
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.170
I've gotten a chance to work,
but I would deny myself other things.

621
00:39:14.171 --> 00:39:17.890
I couldn't go do this.
I couldn't travel until I earned it.

622
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.810
So I would deny myself certain things that I would want to do.
Um,
and say,

623
00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:27.700
you haven't earned that yet,
which I find to be a good motivator.
And then,
um,

624
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.260
what I did was if I would screen test for a movie that was a big opportunity,

625
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:35.920
that would have been life changing,
it would've given me an opportunity.
Uh,

626
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.870
what do you screen testing?
I'm just going to,
as an idiot,

627
00:39:37.871 --> 00:39:40.090
I'll ask screen tests would be your close.

628
00:39:40.091 --> 00:39:43.180
There's a couple of people for a role and now they're going to film a scene from

629
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:48.181
the movie with you and perhaps the Rd Kasten actor or just pair people together.

630
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:49.480
Um,

631
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.530
and in screen testing they would just see who mixes and matches or how do you do

632
00:39:53.531 --> 00:39:55.780
on camera,
how do they feel you come off.

633
00:39:55.781 --> 00:40:00.781
And I had a couple of those maybe four or five for good opportunities and when

634
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:01.811
you don't get it,

635
00:40:01.811 --> 00:40:05.320
so you could go to seven or eight auditions to get to this point is between you

636
00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:08.470
and two or three other people.
And when you don't get it your day,

637
00:40:08.471 --> 00:40:09.640
the next day doesn't change,

638
00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:14.020
meaning you still are going to get asked to go in for five lines on a television

639
00:40:14.021 --> 00:40:18.820
show or something smaller.
There is no advancement as far as opportunity.
You,

640
00:40:18.821 --> 00:40:21.100
you were just a person with the same credits you had.

641
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:26.170
So it was a lot of time spent to get to that in energy to get to that moment.

642
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.970
And if it didn't pan out,
there was no change in how someone,

643
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.950
you are no more castable as a known entity than what you were.

644
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.620
So what would happen is when you would get that close,

645
00:40:35.621 --> 00:40:37.420
and it wouldn't happen at first,

646
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.470
I would get down and I would take four or five days and I would just not do

647
00:40:41.471 --> 00:40:44.440
anything.
And I'd say all of this,
I lose my energy.

648
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:49.950
And then I started to realize that the week I took off was really two weeks that

649
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:55.690
it was a week of not getting better and it was a week of getting worse.

650
00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:56.891
And I said,

651
00:40:56.891 --> 00:41:01.891
now I've given myself two weeks less to improve at the things I'm in control of.

652
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:07.030
And I started looking at it like a percentage gain.
The more I worked on things,

653
00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.620
my percentages would go up.

654
00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:14.290
And what I realized later was it gave you a confidence to feel like you belong

655
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:15.190
there.
Um,

656
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:20.280
it gave you permission to perform in situations that didn't feel comfortable

657
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.340
because you had felt good about what you had that brought to the table.

658
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:29.530
And so I would suggest that you find a process where you're able to,

659
00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.830
I think it's important to allow yourself to feel disappointed.

660
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.010
I it's important that you don't turn off those feelings,

661
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.690
but it is also important too.

662
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:43.691
How do you do that as quickly as possible to then become a productive again and

663
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:47.330
start doing the things that are going to give you a better opportunity for what

664
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:50.870
you want.
The same could be said for a relationship.
It hurts your feelings.

665
00:41:50.871 --> 00:41:54.860
It's but how much time is the effective in mourning it processing it.

666
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.300
I really believe no time is not good.
You need that moment to accept it,

667
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.740
but the sooner you can get back to doing things for your own growth and the

668
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:04.880
things you're in charge of,

669
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:09.050
I think your chances of having the things you want in your life become greater.

670
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:14.540
I think also from what I've observed in you and other people who've done really

671
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:15.740
well in their respective fields,

672
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:20.741
is that having an opportunity to be exposed to micro failures on some

673
00:42:21.411 --> 00:42:22.550
environment,
like wrestling,

674
00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:27.940
like auditions inoculates you in such a way that you develop a tolerance for

675
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:31.790
rejection and that allows you to capitalize on opportunities and much more

676
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:35.870
effectively later because you don't take the two weeks off.
Right?
Correct.

677
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:39.170
And it allows you to improve.
So,
but then we have the problem on the other side,

678
00:42:39.171 --> 00:42:41.840
which I don't know if you've experienced and you see it with boxers a lot,

679
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:46.820
but once you have a level of success,
can you maintain a motivation,

680
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.820
right.
To have the approach that you once had,
right.

681
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:53.480
When the immediate needs are not there as strong.
Sure.

682
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.860
Cause I think on some level we all are looking for those things in life.

683
00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:01.870
How to let go of stuff and how to enjoy things in a more productive way.

684
00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:07.390
Could you talk about your car accident in high school?
Sure.

685
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:10.030
Yeah.
It's not something that we've talked about.
No,

686
00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:13.960
I haven't talked about it much,
but we were,
uh,
it was after school.

687
00:43:13.961 --> 00:43:15.880
I had played sports and then I had stopped.

688
00:43:15.881 --> 00:43:20.710
I started getting more into acting and it was during the day and,
um,

689
00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:23.320
I was a passenger in the,

690
00:43:23.321 --> 00:43:28.321
and it was raining out and the girl that was driving was swerving on the road

691
00:43:28.931 --> 00:43:33.850
being cute.
I remember a saying,
don't swerve,
don't,
don't,
you know,
stop it.
Uh,

692
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.440
but she kept doing it and we would go maybe 35 miles an hour and then we hydro

693
00:43:38.441 --> 00:43:41.320
plane and I woke up in a ditch,

694
00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:45.370
my thumb ripped up a real bad and I couldn't move.

695
00:43:45.371 --> 00:43:50.170
My legs couldn't move.
I had paramedics over me and I have blood all around me.

696
00:43:50.171 --> 00:43:53.380
I was real concerned.
My friend,
I,
I didn't have any idea how I looked.

697
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:57.100
I wasn't tracking it,
but my friend was real bloody.
I said it Sean.
Okay.

698
00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:58.120
They said,
yeah,
he's all right.

699
00:43:58.121 --> 00:44:01.750
They got me in the ambulance and then they couldn't get ahold of my parents at

700
00:44:01.751 --> 00:44:03.490
first cause they were worth traveling.

701
00:44:03.491 --> 00:44:06.940
And so I just remember being in a lot of pain.
Um,

702
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:10.750
there was a moment you didn't know what the ramifications were.

703
00:44:10.751 --> 00:44:15.460
I had a small compression,
which turned out to be nothing in my back.
But,
uh,
and,

704
00:44:15.461 --> 00:44:20.410
uh,
the aesthetic of my thumb being injured,
I,
at the time I didn't,

705
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.950
I mean it's now just a very bad scar on the backside of it.

706
00:44:23.951 --> 00:44:27.430
And thankfully I have the thumb and can move it,
but there's a pad that was gone.

707
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:30.910
So,
uh,
that was,
um,

708
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:36.330
that was challenging because it really made me evaluate the oldest cliche,

709
00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.660
you know,
without your health,
you don't have anything.

710
00:44:39.661 --> 00:44:42.750
So I really got the experience of feeling like,
well,

711
00:44:42.751 --> 00:44:47.400
what if I can't move around or people go outside and play and things I had taken

712
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:50.760
for granted.
Um,
and then this,

713
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:54.480
the anything physical that is different that you're used to in a certain way.

714
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:59.040
I think at first it's a national to feel insecure about it.

715
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.780
And here I was at that time knowing one to pursue being an actor,
an entertainer.

716
00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:07.770
So it was a gift in,
you know,
um,

717
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.830
processing things and putting your focus on other things.

718
00:45:10.831 --> 00:45:15.720
And you started to realize the power of your own inner dialogue as far as what

719
00:45:15.721 --> 00:45:20.220
you were creating or not.
So there was a lot of gifts in it ultimately,

720
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.750
but at the time it was,

721
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:26.280
I feel lucky for it and that it was without real consequences.
It was a,

722
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:31.560
it was a nice learning a gift in a way

723
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.290
<v 13>suggest to,</v>

724
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.860
we're going to talk a lot about that inner dialogue and self talk,

725
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:43.670
but I don't want to touch on a few things that are around that same time period.

726
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.560
And as maybe a preface to that,

727
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.060
I will say that Vince is one of the most consistently curious people I've ever

728
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:51.271
met,

729
00:45:51.271 --> 00:45:55.260
which is saying a lot because my job is to interview curious people and give you

730
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:58.630
an idea.
We were just backstage,
uh,

731
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:03.090
getting miked up and he had questions about something called the Marcello teen.

732
00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:08.091
So Marcello teen is a choke that's used in Brazilian Jujitsu by the Michael

733
00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:12.000
Jordan slash Wayne Gretzky of grappling.
His name is Marcello Garcia.

734
00:46:12.001 --> 00:46:17.001
So I was backstage choking vents that 10 minutes ago and there were a lot of

735
00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:17.880
very nervous look

736
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.560
<v 12>very effectively.
I will,
it's a good joke.
Marcella knows what he's doing.</v>

737
00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:26.720
<v 13>And,
uh,
grappling was one of the first things,</v>

738
00:46:26.721 --> 00:46:28.610
wrestling specifically that we bonded over.

739
00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:33.920
And could you talk about the role of sports

740
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.580
and wrestling to the extent that it's,
that it had a lasting impact?

741
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:43.280
<v 12>I think it's important.
I think,
you know,
George Washington,</v>

742
00:46:43.281 --> 00:46:47.630
I think credited ballroom dancing and horseback riding is two of the most

743
00:46:47.631 --> 00:46:52.550
important things he did because it gave him confidence physically and grace.
And,

744
00:46:52.551 --> 00:46:56.180
you know,
being a leader,
I don't know that you can put grace in the body without,

745
00:46:56.181 --> 00:47:00.200
you know,
whether it's,
I took ballet,
I took,
played sports.
I think it's important,

746
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:04.340
um,
especially for me being tall.
It allowed me to have,

747
00:47:04.341 --> 00:47:09.200
I think more control and confidence in my,
and my,
um,
my height.

748
00:47:09.201 --> 00:47:10.430
And,
and,
uh,

749
00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:15.520
so wrestling to me was really a course in resiliency and discipline.

750
00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:21.410
Uh,
I would have loved to have played other team sports,
but it was,

751
00:47:21.411 --> 00:47:23.750
I was very good at wrestling for whatever reason,

752
00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:26.780
and I wasn't as accepted in some of the team sports.

753
00:47:26.781 --> 00:47:31.390
So wrestling is very much a loner sport.
Um,
if you're on a team bus,

754
00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:35.230
you kind of joke around and laugh on a wrestling bus.
Everyone is dead side.

755
00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.280
Partially because they're all dehydrated from cutting weight,
cutting weight,

756
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:43.300
and you're going to get in a fight in front of your school or people you don't

757
00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:45.520
know.
It's like you shake hands in,
it's like you're gone.
You know,

758
00:47:45.521 --> 00:47:47.800
there's no one missed a block.
You've got,

759
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.200
you've got beat right and you are dehydrated.

760
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:54.010
It's auditing and that you're growing and yet you're trying to maintain a weight

761
00:47:54.011 --> 00:47:56.500
as,
I mean it's,
especially when you're doing it when you're younger,

762
00:47:56.501 --> 00:48:00.910
it's very challenging.
But I really felt that I got,
and there's,
you know,

763
00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:04.180
you would come out of playing football feeling like you were in shape and then

764
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:07.240
you would go and wrestling and you would realize you're not in any kind of shape

765
00:48:07.241 --> 00:48:09.520
because if you just wrestle,
it's exhausting.

766
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:13.690
And then the only other thing you can do is run.
And in the winter in Illinois,

767
00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:17.860
that meant hallways and stairs.
We had a coach that was,
he got fired.

768
00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:21.280
He was not fit to be with kids,
but I felt like I was fuck,

769
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.670
I benefited from having that personality,
but he was a real problem.

770
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.073
But I remember,

771
00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:28.990
I feel like we need a little more elaborate than that in some people's minds

772
00:48:28.991 --> 00:48:33.670
don't go crazy.
Well,
he was,
he was,
he was,
uh,

773
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.700
he had a real anger problem.
He would hit okay.

774
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.230
I got hit and it says in spotlight,
I just want him.
Yeah,

775
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.360
he punched me once in the chest after a match.
You hit the wind out of me.

776
00:48:43.361 --> 00:48:48.130
He would,
he encouraged kids hurting each other,
but it seemed normal at the time.

777
00:48:48.131 --> 00:48:52.510
You know?
Uh,
he was like the Cobra Kai.
Yeah.
It was like Cobra Kai.

778
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.700
It was crazy.
He had his own emotional issues.

779
00:48:54.701 --> 00:48:57.610
So we would win a meat like 60 to six or whatever it was,

780
00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.300
and he would be angry over the few mistakes and he would,

781
00:49:00.301 --> 00:49:02.680
it was at some point you just heard the emotion being poured on.

782
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.440
You remember his sister was in the assistant.
He'd always say,

783
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:09.640
get me a tab in an aspirin or an Advil.
Go give me my,

784
00:49:09.641 --> 00:49:13.840
go get me a tab and half Advil and it needs to keep screaming at us.
But uh,

785
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.570
he would sometimes,
like there was a,
you know,

786
00:49:16.571 --> 00:49:20.140
we would run these stairs and he would say in these hallways,
it was,

787
00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.320
it was like a spread,
but you didn't make it under a minute 20,

788
00:49:23.321 --> 00:49:25.630
you would add another one.
Right.
And he was intentionally,

789
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.480
you were going to have the bar moved and he was trying to break your spirit.

790
00:49:28.481 --> 00:49:31.840
He wanted to simulate,
all is lost.

791
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.950
What you thought was going to get you there is not,
and that will you stand.

792
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.690
Right.
Um,

793
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:42.250
but inevitably the second string heavyweight was number going to make that time.

794
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.370
So the first time he would do it,
you'd say,
okay,

795
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:49.650
he's called the kid's name real loud was a Illinois.

796
00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:52.510
So it was either,
I think it was a,
I remember the name,
I won't say it,

797
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:56.560
but it might've been like eastern European last name.
And he said,
uh,
he was late.

798
00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:00.280
So then the first time we could run after that,
there'd be some encouragement.

799
00:50:00.281 --> 00:50:01.330
Come on,
you could do it.

800
00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:04.570
But the second or third time kids would start yelling and screaming at him or

801
00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:08.000
kicking at them and really physically forcing him.
It was like a,

802
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:12.910
like a bad episode,
like a bad,
a few good men.
It was terrible.

803
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.150
Uh,
and I always had a problem with a third Doroty anyway,

804
00:50:16.151 --> 00:50:17.350
and I clashed with him a lot.

805
00:50:17.351 --> 00:50:20.800
I ended up just showing up at the meets and I was good enough that I could do

806
00:50:20.801 --> 00:50:24.130
that.
I wouldn't go to practices all the time.
I really had problems with him,

807
00:50:24.131 --> 00:50:25.810
but he did punch me one time when the chassis,

808
00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:31.010
but he turned to be someone that created a past that was not truthful.

809
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:33.380
He had told us that he made the Olympic team,

810
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.860
but that it was when the year that we boycotted it

811
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:41.750
turned out not to be true,
you know?
But anyway,

812
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:44.480
I guess the long version of it is,

813
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:49.540
I think that I gained a lot more than I lost even with him being um,

814
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:53.810
uh,
challenging and a lot of ways I wouldn't change that experience.

815
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.650
You can have a great coach,
which there are in wrestling and I think in general,

816
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.920
one of the great attributes of wrestling is a constitution and a grit.

817
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:08.140
The ability to survive painful moments and not take them on in the absolute

818
00:51:09.951 --> 00:51:12.350
sense,
meaning to have perspective on pain.

819
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.850
<v 1>Caroline Paul at a Kero Writers,</v>

820
00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:24.120
c a r o writer on Twitter is an author,
fiction and nonfiction.

821
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:28.200
She worked in public radio as a journalist before joining the San Francisco Fire

822
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.620
Department in 1988 is one of their first female firefighters.

823
00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.560
She worked most of her career on rescue too,

824
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:37.860
where she and the crew were responsible for search and rescue and fires.

825
00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:41.340
Rescue two members were also trained and sent on scuba searches.

826
00:51:41.341 --> 00:51:44.490
She has some horrifying stories of pulling out,
decomposing bodies,

827
00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:48.960
rope and repelling rescues,
surf rescues,
confined space searches,

828
00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:53.280
all hazardous material calls,
and the most severe train and car wrecks.

829
00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:58.320
Her first book was the nonfiction memoir fighting fire published in 1998 she

830
00:51:58.321 --> 00:52:02.160
also wrote the New York Times bestseller and a book that I think is fantastic

831
00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:05.820
called the gutsy girl.
She calls it lean in for girls,

832
00:52:05.821 --> 00:52:09.370
but I think it's actually much more than that and it's not set in the boardroom,

833
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:13.890
but rather in trees on cliff edges and in wild rivers.

834
00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:15.151
She's very,

835
00:52:15.151 --> 00:52:20.151
very good at recognizing how resilience and toughness gutsiness can be trained.

836
00:52:22.151 --> 00:52:25.530
It can be taught,
and in a commercial New York Times Essay,

837
00:52:25.531 --> 00:52:29.160
the proceeded publication of that book she wrote that risk teaches kids

838
00:52:29.161 --> 00:52:31.350
responsibility,
problem solving and confidence.

839
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.160
You can certainly find it very easily by searching Caroline Paul New York Times,

840
00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:39.270
her perspective on fear and how she overcomes it in the most extreme

841
00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.760
circumstances,
she's done losing.

842
00:52:41.761 --> 00:52:44.550
She's done all sorts of extreme sports.

843
00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:50.420
Her approach was extremely helpful and inspiring and valuable to me personally,

844
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:51.570
and I hope the same for you.

845
00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:58.140
When you think of the moments you've been most terrified.

846
00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.410
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

847
00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:03.610
<v 1>What are those moments that come to mind?
They don't have to be physical danger.</v>

848
00:53:03.611 --> 00:53:07.360
They could be,
but what are,
what are the moments that first come to mind for you?

849
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.640
<v 12>Okay.</v>

850
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:08.971
<v 4>Well,</v>

851
00:53:08.971 --> 00:53:13.950
I think the time that I was probably the most physically scared and it was a bit

852
00:53:13.951 --> 00:53:17.700
of an unusual feeling for me,
and I'm not trying to say that I'm super brave,

853
00:53:17.701 --> 00:53:21.570
I just had this ability to really take fear and put it way,

854
00:53:21.571 --> 00:53:24.870
way back in line of all my other emotions when I was a,

855
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.420
uh,
but I was in a,
I talk about this in the book actually,

856
00:53:30.421 --> 00:53:33.780
I was in a fire building and I was with my crew and I was,

857
00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.160
we're in teams of two.
So the,
the,
the,

858
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:42.090
the team who was ahead of me,
frank and Andy,
and then I had,

859
00:53:42.091 --> 00:53:46.200
my crewmate was behind me,
victor,
he and I were together,

860
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:49.290
but we were all crawling down the same hallway and we had a hose line,

861
00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:54.030
which was unusual,
but they couldn't find the fire.
So the chief goes,
hey guys,
we,

862
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:57.600
you guys grab a hose line.
So we're psyched to do that.

863
00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:00.990
It's awesome to go find the heat,
the seat of the fire,

864
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:02.760
and it's super smoky,

865
00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:06.330
hot and kind of quiet in this weird way.

866
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:11.780
And then all of a sudden a huge explosion which pushed us all out of the hallway

867
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.883
and we're,

868
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:18.630
what we realized later was that there had been a flashover not in the hallway,

869
00:54:18.631 --> 00:54:19.560
which would have killed us,

870
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:24.561
but somewhere close enough by to just massage over a flashover is when the room

871
00:54:26.551 --> 00:54:31.551
gets so hot that even the particles in the air simultaneously ignite.

872
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:38.490
So it's basically this just huge.
It's like a gas plus basically.
Yeah,

873
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.610
I've been in those two and those are not,
those are,

874
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.490
we'll knock your mask off and throw you backwards.

875
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:50.540
And I remember being sort of discombobulated and in the garage and my friend

876
00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:56.610
frank goes,
where's victor?
Victor was my,
my crew mate.

877
00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.490
And I look around and there was just three of us instead of four.

878
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:04.820
And I remember thinking,
I have to go back into that hallway.
And the,

879
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:10.190
the fear was paralyzing this all tooks milliseconds.

880
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:14.580
And I see frank,
who's super brave,
really great firefighter,

881
00:55:14.581 --> 00:55:19.581
just turn and start to just catapult himself towards that door to find victor.

882
00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:24.150
And for me,
it was only a millisecond,
but I was scared.

883
00:55:24.151 --> 00:55:27.960
And I recognize that fear and that fear scared me more than the fear itself.

884
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:33.230
Because when you're paralyzed as a firefighter and your friend is missing that,

885
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:37.770
that's the worst.
And so of course I was right on his heels,
but I,

886
00:55:37.771 --> 00:55:42.771
that feeling of overwhelming fear was really sobering for me.

887
00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:49.320
And,
uh,
but what I learned of course is that you can be scared.
That's okay,

888
00:55:49.321 --> 00:55:52.950
but you still have to take action if it's necessary.
And then my friend was fine.

889
00:55:52.951 --> 00:55:55.110
He had actually been blown out too,
but he,

890
00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:59.550
he took shelter on the other side and we,
we were found ourselves in the garage.

891
00:55:59.551 --> 00:56:03.810
So it all ended up fine.
But it was a moment I'll never forget.

892
00:56:05.170 --> 00:56:07.350
<v 1>So you've,
you've mentioned,
uh,</v>

893
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.100
in your writing for instance,
the,

894
00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:15.480
your ability to put fear behind your other emotions.

895
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:20.160
And the story that comes to mind for me is the,
uh,
and we,

896
00:56:20.161 --> 00:56:24.100
we don't necessarily have to go into the details of this right now,
the climbing

897
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:28.120
<v 10>of the Golden Gate Bridge,
which by the way,
folks list saying illegal.</v>

898
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:32.620
I wouldn't recommend doing it now after 2001.
Yeah,
they will shoot you.

899
00:56:32.621 --> 00:56:36.550
They will shoot you.
So not involved in the 90 [inaudible] but not anymore.

900
00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:42.070
Uh,
760 some odd feet or something along those lines.
70,

901
00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.340
maybe,
maybe 720.
I don't know.
You probably have better,

902
00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:48.310
better memory of the elevation than I,
but uh,

903
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:53.200
where did you develop that ability or how did you develop that ability?

904
00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:56.080
Like for someone listening is like,
God,
you know,
I'm so fearful.

905
00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:59.950
How can I develop that same ability to take,

906
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:04.951
say courage or desire or whatever it might be,

907
00:57:05.741 --> 00:57:10.420
enthusiasm and try to put it in front of this dominant emotion that I have and

908
00:57:10.421 --> 00:57:13.150
default emotion,
which is fear.
What would you,
what would you say to them,

909
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:14.590
and I guess it's two questions.

910
00:57:14.591 --> 00:57:16.180
How do you develop it and what would you say to them?

911
00:57:16.181 --> 00:57:18.790
But you can tackle it any way you'd like?
Well,

912
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:23.600
<v 4>I am not against fear.
Let me just say right up front.</v>

913
00:57:23.601 --> 00:57:27.560
I think fear is,
it is definitely important.
It's there to keep us safe,

914
00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:33.050
but I do feel like some people give it too much priority.
It's one of the many

915
00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:38.720
things that we use to assess the situation.
Um,

916
00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:43.760
so I'm not against fear,
but I am pro bravery.

917
00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:45.800
So that's my paradigm.

918
00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:50.860
So once I know that fear is just one of many things that are going on.

919
00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.320
So for instance,
when we climbed the bridge,

920
00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:59.350
which was five of us deciding we wanted to walk up that cable in the middle of

921
00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:03.680
the night,
please don't do that.
But,
uh,

922
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:08.150
we did and it was a really,
I mean,

923
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:10.820
talk about fear.
I mean,
you're working on a cable.

924
00:58:10.821 --> 00:58:14.030
We have to put one foot in front of the other and you get higher and higher

925
00:58:14.031 --> 00:58:15.990
until you're basically uh,
uh,

926
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:21.530
honest as high as a 70 story building and with nothing below you and holding on

927
00:58:22.131 --> 00:58:24.320
to these two thin wires on either side.

928
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:28.310
It's just a walk.
Technically,

929
00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:34.090
really nothing's going to happen unless some earthquake or sudden catastrophic

930
00:58:34.731 --> 00:58:37.550
gust of wind,
which was really not going to happen.

931
00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:41.630
You're going to be fine as long as you keep your mental state intact.

932
00:58:41.631 --> 00:58:43.940
Don't panic.
It's just a walk.

933
00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:49.240
And so what I do in those situations is I look and look at all the emotions I'm

934
00:58:50.931 --> 00:58:55.280
feeling,
which is anticipation,
exhilaration,
focus,

935
00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:59.930
confidence,
fun and fear.

936
00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:04.010
And then I take fear and say,
well,
how much priority am I going to give this?

937
00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:07.970
I really want to do this.
And then I put it where it belongs.

938
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:13.640
And it's,
it's kind of like brick laying.
I Dunno.

939
00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:16.760
You just look at all the bricks and you were making a stone wall.

940
00:59:16.761 --> 00:59:18.890
You fit the pieces together.
So do you,

941
00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:22.190
or have you literally,

942
00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:25.770
<v 10>I should use that word core carefully in my life in general,</v>

943
00:59:25.771 --> 00:59:30.690
but visualized the bricks or I'd like to someone who hasn't had this practice.

944
00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:31.850
<v 4>Okay.</v>

945
00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:35.400
<v 10>And you're going to give them sort of a,
uh,
a meditation exercise,
right?</v>

946
00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:40.130
The next time you're feeling fear.
Do this.
How,
what would you advise them to do?

947
00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:40.891
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

948
00:59:40.891 --> 00:59:45.891
I actually want someone until partition each emotion as if it's a little

949
00:59:47.131 --> 00:59:51.060
separate block and then put it in a line.

950
00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:54.750
Because once you not only look at your emotions,

951
00:59:54.751 --> 00:59:59.580
but also assess your own skill and the situation,
often things change.

952
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.760
I mean we're scared.
Supposedly.
I hear people say,

953
01:00:02.761 --> 01:00:06.150
I'm so scared of fill in the blank,
picking up an insect.

954
01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:11.190
Really what is really so scary about an insect?
Seriously,

955
01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.200
is it going to eat?
You know,

956
01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.410
so as long as you stop and really look,

957
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.760
I think people's lives will change kind of radically,

958
01:00:20.761 --> 01:00:23.430
especially for women because women are very,

959
01:00:23.431 --> 01:00:28.110
very quick to say they're scared and that's something I really want to change.

960
01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:35.690
This is Caroline Paul and I'm really happy to be back with all of you and Tim on

961
01:00:36.751 --> 01:00:41.460
the Tim Ferriss podcast for round two and you sent me a bunch of questions and

962
01:00:41.461 --> 01:00:46.290
I'm going to answer some of them.
Thanks so much.
Let's just dive right in.

963
01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:49.350
So no name asked.

964
01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:53.400
If you're trying to change your relationship with fear,
where do you start?

965
01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:57.390
It's hard to face it when it's breathing down on you.
Any tips?

966
01:00:58.290 --> 01:01:02.250
Well first of all,
congratulations on changing your relationship to fear.

967
01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:04.650
I don't know if you're a woman,
but if you are,

968
01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.970
this is an especially big step because as I've talked about,

969
01:01:08.971 --> 01:01:13.920
I feel really strongly that we as women have been so encouraged to be fearful

970
01:01:13.921 --> 01:01:17.820
that it's an underpinning of our life that we're often not even conscious of.

971
01:01:17.821 --> 01:01:21.810
So just taking this step is amazing.
Here's my tip.

972
01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:26.900
It's really straight forward micro bravery because here's a concept that a great

973
01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:34.050
organization calls girls leadership.
Really articulate it to me,

974
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:38.490
which is that bravery is learned and like anything learned,

975
01:01:38.491 --> 01:01:40.440
it just needs to be practiced.

976
01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:43.860
And the way we practice things is to start small.

977
01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.000
So micro bravery,
this is what they call it.

978
01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:53.100
I love that microbe Avery is basically breaking down,

979
01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.253
um,

980
01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:59.100
your fears into either smaller steps or just start starting small with any fear.

981
01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:02.910
And the reason we want to do that is because,
well,
first of all,

982
01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:07.170
you become aware of what it feels like to be fearful.

983
01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.300
Because here's the truth,
and I think I talked about this on the podcast before,

984
01:02:12.301 --> 01:02:17.301
but fear feels a lot like excitement has the same physiological characteristics,

985
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:22.830
you know,
high heart rate,
the sweat,
nervous tension.

986
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:27.150
And so often what we do,
especially as women,

987
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:32.151
because we're really not taught to discern the nuances of fear because we aren't

988
01:02:32.521 --> 01:02:34.470
taught to value bravery like men are.

989
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:37.790
So we aren't taught to really move through it,
uh,

990
01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:42.890
is that it feels so similar to excitement that we often mistake the fact that we

991
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:49.230
are not actually completely subsumed with abject fear.

992
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:53.940
We actually are feeling fear and other things,
excitement,
exhilaration,

993
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:59.190
anticipation,
curiosity,
things that really will open up our life.

994
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.560
And that actually is telling us,
hey,
this,

995
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:05.700
this new experience is going to be kind of cool.
But because,
and again,

996
01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:09.090
often it's women.
We don't,
we haven't practiced bravery,

997
01:03:09.091 --> 01:03:14.091
so we don't really understand what we're feeling in times of stress or where

998
01:03:15.121 --> 01:03:16.740
we're pushing outside.
We're comfort zone.

999
01:03:16.741 --> 01:03:21.741
So when you practice bravery and really what you're practicing is micro bravery,

1000
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:29.150
you get really comfortable and you start to understand what fear feels like.

1001
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:35.790
And you start to discern all the nuances of that emotion.

1002
01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:41.310
So the second thing you become knowledgeable about is,
uh,

1003
01:03:41.311 --> 01:03:42.780
what bravery is.

1004
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.290
Because I think a lot of women don't really have a sense of what that feels like

1005
01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:48.090
either.
In fact,
I like to,

1006
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.890
to turn around maybe even this question and say,
well,

1007
01:03:52.891 --> 01:03:54.960
it's not really changing your relationship to fear.

1008
01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:58.620
It's changing your relationship to bravery.
And so what we're doing,

1009
01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:00.630
and I know I talked about this before,

1010
01:04:00.631 --> 01:04:05.631
is that we are valuing a bravery paradigm instead of a v a fear paradigm.

1011
01:04:05.761 --> 01:04:10.761
Because I do think we give permission to women to talk about fear a lot.

1012
01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:13.110
And um,

1013
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:16.950
to really emphasize it in ways that make it,

1014
01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:20.100
um,
that perpetuates it.

1015
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:26.370
The last thing you do is when you're practicing Micah bravery,

1016
01:04:26.371 --> 01:04:31.371
you really start to develop a process of moving from fear to bravery.

1017
01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:37.740
And that process,
when you use it in small instances,

1018
01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:42.120
you can apply when you confront fear in bigger instances.

1019
01:04:42.121 --> 01:04:46.710
And that can be an emotional fear.
And that can be fear at a,
you know,
in,
in,

1020
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:51.540
in your workplace.
And that can also be fear in the outdoors.

1021
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:53.670
Now when you practice micro bravery,

1022
01:04:53.671 --> 01:04:57.870
I really want kids to practice it in the outdoors because it's really fun,

1023
01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:02.930
the outdoors and it's a really great way to understand,

1024
01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:05.100
uh,

1025
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:10.050
that line between being scared and then excitement and then going to bravery

1026
01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:14.400
because it's just more obvious than if you're trying to practice in a more

1027
01:05:14.401 --> 01:05:16.740
emotional situation.
But as adults,

1028
01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:21.250
I you already know whether you like the outdoors or not,
this is not about like,

1029
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.220
oh,
you have to be in the outdoors to be brave,
not true.

1030
01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:29.320
You guys who are not so much outdoors,
he can practice in,

1031
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:34.240
uh,
at home or in the workplace,
small acts of micro bravery.
Again,

1032
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:35.560
really important.

1033
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:40.980
This is something you start small so that you really get to know yourself and

1034
01:05:41.861 --> 01:05:43.330
bravery better.

1035
01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:47.830
And analogy might be deciding you were going to run a five k.

1036
01:05:47.831 --> 01:05:51.580
You don't just go run a five k on the day of the race.

1037
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:56.890
You practice and you practice in small increments.
You start by walking,

1038
01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:01.510
you start by,
then you proceed to running a little bit.
You get the picture.

1039
01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:06.340
So it's you breaking it down and in that way you're training and you're training

1040
01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:10.570
to understand your body like a runner and you're trading to understand your own

1041
01:06:10.571 --> 01:06:11.404
mind.

1042
01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.810
<v 1>Well,
there you have it folks.</v>

1043

I hope you enjoyed this episode on overcoming or managing or perhaps even using

1044
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:27.010
fear doesn't have to be a negative.
It can be something that is useful,

1045
01:06:27.011 --> 01:06:29.170
it can be a fuel,
it can be a call to action,

1046

1062
01:07:27.631 --> 01:07:31.920
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1064
01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.620
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1065
