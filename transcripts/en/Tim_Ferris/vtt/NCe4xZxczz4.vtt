00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:02.850
At this altitude,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.060
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.800
You put some questions.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.430
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue.

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.120
This episode is brought to you by audible,

6

<v 1>which I've used for years.</v>

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.800
I love audiobooks and I've two to recommend right off the bat.

8
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.130
Number one is press my favorite audio book of all time,

9
00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:35.860
and that is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

10
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.120
The only audiobook I've wanted to immediately listen to a second time.

11
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:44.500
As soon as I finished,
it's amazing.
You will thank me.
The graveyard book.

12
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.230
The second is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,

13
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.850
which had a huge impact on my life and formed the basis for a lot of what became

14
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.900
the four hour workweek.

36
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.190
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

37
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:16.520
it is my job to deconstruct world class performers,

38
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.770
whether they are from the worlds of entertainment,
chess,
sports or otherwise.

39
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.580
This episode is a special double header if features one interview and one

40
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:30.410
performance,
which is a new thing.
First up is cascade,
k.
A,
s,
k,
a.

41
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:35.330
D.
E.
You can say hello to him at cascade on most of social,

42
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.900
he is widely considered one of the founding fathers of Progressive House music.

43
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:42.650
He's been voted America's Best Dj twice by DJ Times,
headline,

44
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:46.490
Coachella four times and has been nominated for Grammy's five times.

45
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.990
Next up you'll hear Sekou Andrews,
that's s,
e,
k,
O,

46
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:54.380
U.
Andrew's,
so at Sekou Andrews across social,

47
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.830
and he is the most impressive poetic voice I've ever heard.

48
00:02:57.831 --> 00:03:01.510
I first saw him perform a ted where he blew my mind and so I approached him

49
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:03.730
afterwards.
He is a schoolteacher,

50
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.520
turned two time national poetry slam champion.

51
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.330
He's presented privately for Barack Obama,
Bano,
Oprah Winfrey.

52
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.140
The list goes on and on.
Each one of these takes a few minutes to get warmed up,

53
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.430
so be patient.
I know it's not a specialty for those in the digital world,

54
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.490
but there are gems in both of them.
Among other things,

55
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.510
cascade covers his first breaks,
making his own luck,

56
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.560
formative music influences if his music were,

57
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:33.640
or I should say rather electronic or dance music,
we're a wine tasting.

58
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.640
What would you recommend the varietals be?
Who should be listened to?

59
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:40.240
What were his biggest albums in the early days?

60
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.530
And we dig into his note taking process.
As you may know,
I'm a nerd,

61
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.870
that kind of thing.
I want to know the origins of his biggest hits.

62
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:47.980
How did they come to be?

63
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:52.570
What was the time span between the first note taking and then going live,

64
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.980
et cetera.
We talk about all of that.

65
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.430
Sacred will inspire you to be inspired by your story,

66
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.890
so if you want to change your narrative,

67
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:02.320
your internal dialogue to be more successful,

68
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.930
this is a good talk to listen to.

69
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.260
If you want to get back on the horse or have an effective pep talk in your back

70
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:11.830
pocket,
this might be the recording you listened to over and over again.

71
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:15.790
Now you should be patient.

72
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:19.690
I'm going to mention this again because there's a lot of practical philosophy

73
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:21.190
embedded in,
in between the lines.

74
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:24.800
So you have to listen to it all and you have to listen carefully.
And uh,

75
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.260
these are very contrasting a,
I should say,

76
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.670
different rather,
uh,
personalities and very different performances.

77
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.790
And so I hope that you enjoy both of them.

78
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.330
You can certainly skip around and I'll mention just a couple of notes.

79
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.480
These were both recorded at a live event in Los Angeles and that sold out in 30

80
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:49.810
minutes based on an email that I sent out to my newsletter subscribers.

81
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.920
If you're not on the newsletter,

82
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:55.300
it's free and you get a lots of exclusives and cool stuff like five bullet

83
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:55.631
Friday,

84
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:58.930
which has more than a 60% open rate across the board for people to know what

85
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:02.920
that is,
that's unheard of.
Uh,
and you can sign up,

86
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.540
try it out for a week or2@fourhourworkweek.com forward slash Friday.

87
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.200
So all spelled out for our work week.com forward slash Friday.
Now,

88
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:15.280
since it was a live event,
there were a couple of audio glitches early on.

89
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.410
And in the case of cascade we had a mic failure and I ended up pulling out my

90
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:24.400
lovelier Mike,
you know the clip on mic that was threaded down my shirt,

91
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.790
pulling it out and handing that back and forth for a bit.

92
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.390
So you might hear a couple of missteps here and there,

93
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:35.470
but what you missed was a little bit of background.
He was raised Mormon,

94
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:37.930
he was born in Chicago,

95
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.960
he went to Utah for college and where he grew up was where they filmed Ferris

96
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.920
Bueller's day off among the other things.
So without further ado,

97
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.880
please enjoy this episode with cascade and Sekou Andrews.

98
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.230
When did you have your first,
what you would consider your first break or,
uh,

99
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.580
mentor

100
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.413
<v 2>in Music?</v>

101
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.230
<v 3>Uh,
let's see.
When I moved to San Francisco,
uh,</v>

102
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.430
I reached out to own records that we're a small boutique label based right in

103
00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:11.580
the city there,
south of market area.
And um,

104
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.400
really they were the only people I knew in San Francisco Cause I had some demos

105
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:19.110
and I was mailing music to people and that wasn't going so well but they'd

106
00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:22.270
showed a little interest and I moved there.

107
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.330
Luckily they hired me for like,

108
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.730
the funny thing is is like my wife and I,

109
00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:30.280
we couldn't even make rent for what we were.

110
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.640
I mean she supported me for many years.

111
00:06:32.641 --> 00:06:36.260
She was working for Levi Strauss at the headquarters there and it was great and

112
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.520
I was like,
yeah,
you get a good job.
I'm going to do music.

113
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.210
We'll see how that turns out.
I'm awesome.
Who are you married?

114
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.480
<v 2>Well you know,
if that were a stock that she had bought,
she was pretty happy.</v>

115
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:53.240
I'm done.
I'm imagining,
I mean it's worked out.

116
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.720
The when did you realize that this is something you could do to support yourself

117
00:06:59.121 --> 00:06:59.954
full time

118
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.850
<v 3>or even think that was possible?
It's like the mid two thousands,</v>

119
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.680
so 10 years ago,
you know,
10,
11 years ago.

120
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.150
Um,
but people that are like,

121
00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:12.310
when did you really decide you were going to do music?

122
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.100
And I was one of those people that never wanted to admit that that would,

123
00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:19.360
I was,
that's what I was doing.
I kept telling me,
she's like,

124
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.280
well what are you doing?
What are you,
what's your plan?

125
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:24.910
And she was pretty organized and very driven.
And um,

126
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.670
I think I didn't want to like say that because I didn't want to be a failure.

127
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.490
I didn't want to have like,
no,
I'm going to be a musician,

128
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.700
I'm going to write music,
I want to,
my whole thing was there.
It was like,
no,

129
00:07:35.701 --> 00:07:39.060
it's a cool hobby.
I'm doing it.
These guys hired me.
I'll go there,

130
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.300
I'll work for low,
we'll see what happens.
Let's just,
we'll see.

131
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.840
We'll see what happens.
That was always my thing.

132
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.740
<v 2>So what did you at the time when people would ask you,</v>

133
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.110
cause I know people do this in San Francisco as well as many other cities,

134
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:51.080
but like so,
so what do you do?
How would you answer that at the time

135
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.100
<v 3>music,
which is San Francisco,
people think that's cool.</v>

136
00:07:55.101 --> 00:07:57.440
There's enough art community there and people are like,
oh,
that's cool.

137
00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:59.300
What do you,
you know,
how you living?

138
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.930
Like I'm my wife.
She just got a good shop.

139
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.110
<v 2>Uh,
so is it,
uh,
I had in the,</v>

140
00:08:11.111 --> 00:08:14.280
in the course of doing research for this,
read that when you,

141
00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:17.370
when you went from Chicago to Utah,
just to,

142
00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:20.760
I know we're jumping around chronologically that that is when you started sort

143
00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:25.410
of producing or creating your own music because there wasn't much of a scene if

144
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:26.310
it does that accurate.

145
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.670
<v 3>This is a great,
this is a great point.
So what happened is this,
I'm like,
oh,
okay.</v>

146
00:08:29.671 --> 00:08:32.850
I got into University of Utah,
um,

147
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.160
for Mormons out there now more than is out there.
It's like for me,

148
00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:37.420
I grew up as a kid in Chicago.

149
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:40.530
There wasn't very many Mormon cause I thought I'll go to school and knew Tom

150
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.150
Mito the Mormon people,
see what they about,
you know,

151
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.180
I was friends with all these Jewish kids growing in Chicago.

152
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:49.250
It was like all my friends are Jewish,
you know,
like anyway,

153
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:53.260
so I went to Utah and um,
that was great.

154
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.880
But I growing up going nightclubs all through high school,

155
00:08:56.881 --> 00:09:00.540
teen clubs were a big deal in Chicago and that's how I got introduced into
house.

156
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:04.410
Music was very much a part of my life.
I was collecting records,
you know,

157
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:09.390
as a hobby.
I was a DJ.
Um,
so when I got there I'm like,
what is it?

158
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:12.300
What is this music?
You guys are releasing it.
This is terrible.
You know,

159
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:15.810
like I've got crates of records.
When are you coming to my house?

160
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:16.650
I got some speakers.

161
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:20.730
So I started throwing my own parties and I really had to get involved.

162
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:22.650
That was definitely a point where I was like,
wow,

163
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.070
if I'm going to be a part of this scene or,
or make music,

164
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.860
I'm going to have to be active instead of just like some passive guy.

165
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:30.521
Cause in Chicago,

166
00:09:30.521 --> 00:09:33.510
I used to be the guy that went out and collected records in occasionally played

167
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:36.300
at a friend's house party.
But when I got to Utah,
I was like,

168
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:38.460
if I want to do this and we'd have to make my own thing,

169
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.750
which is good because it inspired me to get involved in and really get
motivated.

170
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.700
How
loud enough now?
Uh,

171
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.990
how did you get your first gear or equipment?
Of course,

172
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:54.300
that's evolved a lot since,
but uh,

173
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.830
so I hit a local club owner up in Utah and I was like,
I got crates of records.

174
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.690
Um,
and what's your worst night that you have?
What's the slowest night?

175
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:06.150
When he was like,
Monday,
I'm not even open.
I'm like,
dude,

176
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.860
let me come down on Monday night.

177
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.330
And this is a bar that had opened in the forties and it had all its original

178
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:16.410
decor.
It's called club Manhattan is amazing place in the basement.
Anyway,

179
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:19.710
the owners like,
you know,
I'll give you a cut of the door.

180
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.210
You have your friends come in,
whatever,

181
00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:23.490
invite some people and we'll see what happens.
Anyway,

182
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:25.110
that turned out the night was a smash.

183
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:27.990
I mean I did it for five years and I ended up doing two nights a week.

184
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.591
It was Monday.

185
00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:33.120
And then when I took on a Thursday and things worked almost instantly,
uh,

186
00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:37.500
and I quit my,
you know,
I was working at a clothing store,
you know,

187
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:40.890
trying to support myself,
going to school and a,
I quit.

188
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.770
Like after the first week I was like,
Oh,
I'm done with that.

189
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:45.110
I'm just going to do this DJ thing.

190
00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:49.530
This is great and I can make some cash and I can pay for school.
Um,

191
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.280
so it started clicking and then when I was making enough money,

192
00:10:53.281 --> 00:10:57.390
I started buying my first studio equipment and I slowly started producing songs

193
00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:00.540
and getting into that and learning my way around the studio and like,
wow,

194
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:04.110
how does this sampler work?
How does a digital audio workstation,

195
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:08.040
how does this all work?
Um,
and just understanding that,

196
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:10.560
which was great cause it was like I was going to school,

197
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.810
I thought it was really busy at the time,

198
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:17.280
but I realize now that like I had a lot of free time.
I'm so busy,

199
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:19.830
I'm going to see her for 10 hours and work on this song,
you know,
like,

200
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.330
um,
anyway,
so I had a lot of times it kind of just learn my craft.

201
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.530
Um,
so it was a good time for me.
Um,
and then when I moved to San Francisco,

202
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.660
that definitely took it up a notch.

203
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:37.890
I worked from records for a couple of years and it was good cause I was,

204
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.420
I knew how to make the music,

205
00:11:39.421 --> 00:11:41.640
but I didn't understand anything about the business.

206
00:11:41.641 --> 00:11:44.490
I wasn't really interested in business.
I was like,
I just want to make music.

207
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:47.040
I don't know all this other stuff.
Um,

208
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.710
but it forced me to learn some things about the business,

209
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.810
which was cool because I could see like,
oh,

210
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.400
you can't just like hang out in your room and make tracks.

211
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:57.790
You've got to get out and promote them and be a part of the scene and get out

212
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:02.050
there and people want to know who you are as an artist who's writing these
songs.

213
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.320
Um,
and yeah,

214
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.460
so it kind of slowly started building up from there in San Francisco

215
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.570
<v 2>and I'm sure you get approached a lot with people who are hoping to create their</v>

216
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:16.600
own electronic music or maybe they already are.
If,

217
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.440
if one of those people were to ask you how to create sort of a self directed

218
00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:24.980
Mba,
they're like,
look,
I,
I have the time,
I have a little bit of resources.

219
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.830
What skills should I learn?
Like what's the,

220
00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:32.831
what does the curriculum look like in terms of setting the stage for being a

221
00:12:32.871 --> 00:12:33.704
successful

222
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.440
<v 3>musician in that category?
On this John Ra,</v>

223
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.130
I always tell people that are getting started out.

224
00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:43.590
I mean now there are schools for this and you can go,
you know,

225
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.210
18 month things to 12 month program.

226
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:50.250
So it's a lot easier to learn the craft now than it was back then.
Um,

227
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:55.320
back then I was buying like these $25 magazines from the UK electronic musician.

228
00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:59.880
I'm like,
what in the hell $25.
Like I'm broke man.
But anyway,

229
00:12:59.881 --> 00:13:02.160
they had a lot of good tutorials so it was very different back then.

230
00:13:02.161 --> 00:13:06.810
Now it's a little more accessible.
Um,
but I always tell people,

231
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.250
I mean like what's your passion?

232
00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:11.690
What do you truly love about this music is do you want to write?

233
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.740
Do you want to produce,
are you a songwriter?

234
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.920
Find out what you do best and put all your time and energy into that.

235
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.460
Like,
are you really good at just deejaying?
Is that what you do?

236
00:13:21.461 --> 00:13:24.370
You're a selector.
Is that what you do?
You can pull get tracks,

237
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:27.370
you have a good ear because there's some people that do that and do that really

238
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:30.730
well.
Then go out and figure out how to maximize that.

239
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.090
Figuring out what it is that you do best and really run with it.

240
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.550
Like maybe you and you gotta be honest with yourself.

241
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:39.340
It's like one of those things that it might take a year or two to discover.

242
00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:40.210
You're out in the mix,

243
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:43.330
you're going to clubs or you're trying to get gigs or whatever it is.

244
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.890
But I think it's just kind of good to sit back and like check the climate and

245
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:51.580
like,
what am I doing well in order people drawn to me like what's working here?

246
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.280
And then just do that as much as you can.

247
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.850
<v 2>How did you,
and feel free to</v>

248
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.373
<v 3>two</v>

249
00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.070
<v 2>verify this also again just in the course of doing research,</v>

250
00:14:01.071 --> 00:14:06.071
but when did you realize that you are very good at more melodic ah,

251
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.840
music as opposed to eat or rhythmic based?

252
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.900
And I would love you for even to just differentiate those for people.
Uh,

253
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.940
<v 3>well much of dance music is very rhythmic.
My Dad was like,</v>

254
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.140
why is the kick drum so damn loud?
And I'm like best dance music there.

255
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.870
Um,
so it's very many people see this repetitive whatever that that's kind of the

256
00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:31.290
old dance music cause it was pretty simplistic.
We didn't have,

257
00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:34.980
the technology wasn't as sophisticated as now.
Um,

258
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.870
and when I moved to San Francisco in 2000,

259
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.050
that was kind of like the beginnings of more melodic electronic music.

260
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.200
Songwriting was getting involved and there are a couple of acts.

261
00:14:46.201 --> 00:14:50.130
There was one band locally called solstice.
They were great,
extremely talented.

262
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.240
Um,
they're a band,
but it was more electronic sounding.

263
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.650
And I remember sitting at the label,
they were assigned to ohm.
I'm like,

264
00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.740
because I had been knowing when all this stuff that was very sample heavy and

265
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:04.880
rhythmic kind of the trend at the time,
like,
but I wasn't making any head room.

266
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:07.670
I wasn't,
I was,
there was no headway.
I was just kinda like,

267
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.610
cause I was like every dude out there,
you know,

268
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:13.160
my demo sounded just like everybody else's.
Anyway,

269
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.830
as I kind of sat in the office and sat back and was like,

270
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:20.540
thinking what would work and how could I make myself different?
Um,

271
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.580
I thought,
you know,
there's not that much melodic stuff out there.

272
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:27.830
What if I focused more on the song?

273
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.470
And I had been in the scene quite a long time,

274
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.500
even at that point in my career that I'd seen like this goes in cycles and

275
00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:39.680
people get into different styles and um,
one production style,

276
00:15:39.681 --> 00:15:42.710
progressive houses.
Cool.
Today.
Techno's cool.
Tomorrow,

277
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:44.720
drum and bass is cool.

278
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:49.550
Next week it moves really quick in the underground.
Um,
so I was like,
man,

279
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:53.960
if I focused more on songs and song writing,
that could be my thing.

280
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.590
That could be my space and there's not very many people doing it.

281
00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:01.970
So I could make my own name that way.
And it would be more evergreen,
I guess,

282
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.520
in that respect.
Right.
More durability.
Yeah.
And then,
I mean,

283
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.750
that was just,
I didn't think of that at the time,

284
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:13.520
but that's kind of what happened.
Um,
naturally.

285
00:16:13.521 --> 00:16:17.660
And it all kind of coincided with me meeting some people that were really good

286
00:16:17.661 --> 00:16:21.800
songwriters that were like,
man,
you're talented in the studio.
But dude,

287
00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:25.400
that's just one part of it.
Making the music a song.
That's an instrumental,

288
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:30.010
that's half a song has half an idea.
And I was like,
what man?

289
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.100
Oh my gosh,
this is great.
I thought that was a song.
That's a song,
you know?

290
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:35.450
And they're like,
no,
this is,
it's not.

291
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.740
So I met and hung out with some people that had some different ideas.
Um,

292
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.490
are there any particular songwriters who had a large influence on your,

293
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.900
that you look up to?
Um,

294
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.930
I mean I'd go with like classics like staying or the Morrissey,
you know,

295
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:55.490
I grew up in the eighties,
so like new way was a big deal for me.
Um,
Robert Smith,

296
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.120
the cure.
I love this guy's and brilliant songwriter.
Um,

297
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.510
so that's stuff I was always drawn to.
But uh,
you know,

298
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:06.020
as I work with more songwriters like okay,
can develop,
this is a craft.

299
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:09.260
I fancy myself a bit of a writer.
Writing songs is different,

300
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:12.290
but it's still kind of just getting your idea on a little short three minute

301
00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:16.700
piece.
So kind of marrying the two things that I was doing,
but then that,

302
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.070
that's when everything kind of changed in my career.

303
00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:21.950
Things really as I started producing that kind of music,

304
00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:25.820
people notice me and I started touring quickly after that.

305
00:17:25.821 --> 00:17:29.270
I mean 2003 is really when things started to move.

306
00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:33.620
I think that year I did like 70 or 80 shows and I was like,
this is insane.

307
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:37.190
And that's when my wife's like,
what did I sign up for?
What?
You're never here,

308
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.190
you know,
what,

309
00:17:38.191 --> 00:17:43.070
what is your record for consecutive shows or consecutive days with shows?

310
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.280
Um,
I dunno,
I've never counted that.
That's really,

311
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:53.130
that's a really good question.
I know I've done like 12 or 14.
I mean,

312
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:57.600
it's not uncommon for me to do 23,
24,
25 shows in a month.

313
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.610
Um,
um,
in the summer.
The summer is extremely busy.

314
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:06.760
Um,
I mean it's always somewhere,
somewhere,
so it's busy all the time.

315
00:18:06.761 --> 00:18:10.030
But I always take our winter.
I always kind of slow down a little bit.

316
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.180
<v 2>How do you,
what,
uh,</v>

317
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.980
what type of rituals or self care do you have two,

318
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.860
<v 3>keep from getting extremely sick,
uh,</v>

319
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.970
<v 2>during that type of just onslaught and a month where you're constantly</v>

320
00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:24.804
performing?

321
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.900
<v 3>Is there any particular diet?
It's stick shift performance?</v>

322
00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:30.720
Part of it's not hard for me because,
uh,

323
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.910
I feel very natural.
I mean,
I've been doing this for over 20 years,
so for me,

324
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:40.911
I feel very at home on stage and doing in my space and I feel like at that just

325
00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:45.840
naturally keeps things out.
It's a very,
uh,
Obrovac,
you know,

326
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.110
it's like a workout really.
I walk upstage of lost five pounds.

327
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:51.000
I'm trying to just in sweat.
Um,

328
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:53.220
so I think that part of it is actually quite healthy.

329
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.290
And then just like eating and living clean,
really,
why I'm on the road.
Um,

330
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.810
you know,
we're traveling from place to place.

331
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:03.210
It's like we traveled during the day and we sleep,

332
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.350
we sleep on the planes and we perform at night.
Um,
and when I say we,

333
00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:12.000
I traveled with a small clique of guys that,
uh,
that helped me execute the shows.

334
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.840
Um,
although then the artists have a tour manager or photographer,
videographer,

335
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.040
a lighting guy of visual guy.
Sometimes the sound guy,

336
00:19:21.041 --> 00:19:22.510
it depends on the size of the show,

337
00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:26.710
but it can be anywhere from five people up to 25 people.
Um,

338
00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:32.190
but I think that kind of philosophy is just kind of worked its way down to,

339
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:36.940
to everybody.
I work with,
um,
that and when I can,
I travel with my family.

340
00:19:36.941 --> 00:19:40.450
I'm married and I have three children,
so I'm always trying to figure out,
okay,

341
00:19:40.451 --> 00:19:44.320
how can I make this work?
Um,
you know,
putting the stones in the,

342
00:19:44.321 --> 00:19:47.230
in the bucket like okay,
what's truly important here and how can I,

343
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.770
how can I fill the bucket with the things that are really important to me.

344
00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:56.250
<v 2>How would you describe your parenting style?
I'm sorry,</v>

345
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.430
I'm your parenting style.

346
00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.130
How would you describe your parent or how do you think of parenting?

347
00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.320
<v 3>My style of parenting.
Wow.
You're definitely never been asked that.
Um,</v>

348
00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:12.280
Oh man,
I wish Naomi was here.
My,
my wife,
she's,
she's uh,

349
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.660
she's amazing cause listen,
she gambled on me and took a,

350
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.560
she had no idea where this was heading or where it was going.
Um,

351
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.620
and she's really been there to take care of the family and been like my biggest

352
00:20:27.141 --> 00:20:31.550
fan and champion in my corner from day one.
And without your,

353
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.170
honestly none of it would be possible.
Um,

354
00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.490
because it is fully a team effort on every front in my business.

355
00:20:37.491 --> 00:20:40.370
She my business manager for 10 years.
Um,

356
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.020
and she's been the primary parent and the disciplinary and in our home because

357
00:20:45.021 --> 00:20:47.950
she's there and she has to be,
um,

358
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.730
cause I'm not there as often as she is.
So,
um,

359
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.120
that's extremely important to note that cause uh,

360
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.560
that's how it's worked in my home.
Um,
me,
I'm kind of,

361
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.710
she always gets mad when I'm angry at the kid.
She's like,
no,
no,
no.

362
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.620
I have to be the ingrown.

363
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:07.810
You have to be like the soft guy that gives them everything.
I'm totally cool.

364
00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:11.650
I can do that.
I can do that.
And like ice cream,
it's Monday.
No,

365
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.940
it's usually Monday and Tuesday are typically my weekend cause I come home on

366
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.910
Sunday or Monday from traveling all weekend.

367
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:21.610
And then I've got Monday and Tuesday a window to kind of hang out with the

368
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:25.840
family.
Um,
you know when they're back at school.
So I'm always wanting to do like,

369
00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:30.760
let's go to a movie on Monday night.
Yeah,
no.
Uh,

370
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.623
I am,

371
00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.430
I have a constant note taker and I watched an interview of yours where you

372
00:21:36.431 --> 00:21:41.431
talked about writing down ideas for songs in a notebook.

373
00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:44.260
Do you still take a lot?
A lot of notes.

374
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.330
I have a notebook just like that at home filled with chipper [inaudible]

375
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.400
highlights and little things.
Um,
yes.

376
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.540
I think the interview was about early on in my career.
I got pulled over,

377
00:21:55.570 --> 00:22:00.100
stopped in London after I'd been on like a four show binge.
Sure.

378
00:22:00.101 --> 00:22:03.190
I showed up at the border and I looked,
probably completely cracked out.

379
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:05.830
I hadn't slept in days and uh,

380
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.610
they pulled me over because I didn't have the right permits or the right work

381
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.320
credentials to get in there.

382
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.800
And I sat in this room for 12 hours and I hadn't eaten.
I don't know,

383
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.730
it was a very down moment for me,

384
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.410
but they had taken apart this notebook and photocopied everything.
I mean,
I,

385
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:27.190
you know,
this thing was almost full when I got there.
Um,

386
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.310
but I keep one of these with me and I thought they thought it was some like drug

387
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.520
log,
the of where I was traveling,
my drop.

388
00:22:33.521 --> 00:22:36.520
So they had photocopied everything and like,
what does this mean?

389
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:39.450
I'm like that it says that do my laundry when I get home,

390
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.490
what he's talking about.
It's not code.
I need to do my laundry.

391
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.950
There's no code there,
man.
Um,

392
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.940
eventually they let me off and everything turned out okay.

393
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.160
Except I was escorted back on the plane the next day with a cop all the way to

394
00:22:53.161 --> 00:22:57.400
the them.
That was funny.
Um,
another time.
Uh,

395
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.190
but yeah,
I mean this is how I organize my life.
Uh,

396
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.810
I have a lot of ideas and thoughts all the time and I just continued to write

397
00:23:04.811 --> 00:23:09.190
things down and look over that and you know,
perfect.
That process,

398
00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:14.410
you have a particular routine for reviewing the notes or is it more of a

399
00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:18.220
journaling exercise?
We just put it down and you don't go back and review it.
Um,

400
00:23:18.221 --> 00:23:20.740
for me it's in the morning,
kind of when I first sit down,

401
00:23:20.741 --> 00:23:23.290
I look at what I was trying to accomplish,
uh,

402
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:27.700
the day before and what's kind of overlapping and what didn't happen and kind of

403
00:23:27.701 --> 00:23:31.480
carries over into that next day.
And then I looked throughout the week.
Um,

404
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.220
and then I look at any potential song ideas or any notes that I have or ideas

405
00:23:36.221 --> 00:23:40.520
that could lead to his song.
Um,
what do those look like?
I mean,

406
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.070
I'm assuming,
do your laundry isn't,
isn't one of them,
but like what,
what is,

407
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:50.270
what form does it take?
Is it just a,
could it be a single word?
Could it be,
um,

408
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.520
I phrase I always like to use the example,

409
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:56.480
I wrote a song called 4:00 AM and it's one of my more popular ones and my

410
00:23:56.481 --> 00:23:59.810
catalog.
Thank you.
Um,
and I'll tell this story cause it's,

411
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.630
I was playing it kinking not too far down the street.
Um,

412
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.260
I was in from San Francisco and uh,

413
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.470
when I played kinking there was like a 6:40 AM flight.

414
00:24:10.471 --> 00:24:15.471
So I'd play all night and then I could get French toast across the street and I

415
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:17.120
take my luggage,
eat the French toast,

416
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:20.000
and then get in the cab and catch the flight,
get home,

417
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.960
get home on Sunday morning to see my family.
Anyway,
um,

418
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.350
I was sitting there at 4:00 AM and I,

419
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.270
it was just one of those massive nights in my career where I kinda hit a moment

420
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:33.840
where I was like,
this is really gonna work.
I have a few of these moments,
uh,

421
00:24:33.841 --> 00:24:36.190
along my career.
But that was one of them where I was like,

422
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.160
what an incredible night.
And I mean,
looking back,

423
00:24:39.161 --> 00:24:43.960
it was a very small club and it holds like four or 500 people maybe.
Um,

424
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.860
but it was like line around the block and I just knew things were clicking.

425
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:49.480
So I was on this,
I was on a high,

426
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.150
I was just floating and it was four in the morning when I walked into the French

427
00:24:54.151 --> 00:24:57.090
toast place.
And I got my luggage there and I opened up my bag and I'm like,

428
00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.440
I have to write a song about 4:00 AM and sleepless gliding.

429
00:25:01.441 --> 00:25:04.740
And these words started coming to me and it was just like a couple of phrases

430
00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.550
and talking about for eem meeting French toast and gliding on the streets

431
00:25:08.551 --> 00:25:12.820
without any sleep.
And that became the first first.

432
00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.420
Um,
and then it just blossomed into an idea.

433
00:25:16.421 --> 00:25:19.570
I think it's kind of like looking back at my notes when I'm in the studio and

434
00:25:19.571 --> 00:25:22.930
thinking like,
is this,
is this something that anyone could else could relate to?

435
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.990
Um,
you know,
and then making a song out of it really.

436
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:31.270
<v 2>How long did it take from that initial note taking to being out in the world as</v>

437
00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:32.384
a song?
Right.

438
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.860
<v 3>I think I wrote that album was about six months later,</v>

439
00:25:34.861 --> 00:25:37.050
so it was sitting around circled in that book,
you know,

440
00:25:37.051 --> 00:25:39.870
I'd go back to it and like,
oh,
that's a cool idea.
Um,

441
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.070
and then when I was in there,
I was like,

442
00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.680
I should develop this more and sit down and write a song about that moment.

443
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.610
Do you collect anything or,
I had records,
records,
vinyl,

444
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.200
lots and lots of vinyl.
Thousands and thousands of records.

445
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.650
Okay.
Any particular genre?
A,
it's all,

446
00:25:57.651 --> 00:26:01.810
I mean it's mostly particularly,
it's like dance music,
house music,

447
00:26:01.811 --> 00:26:06.250
early house music stuff that I started when I collecting when I was a kid.
Um,

448
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.280
then when I had a little bit more money I started buying like old new wave

449
00:26:09.281 --> 00:26:13.870
records,
old punk records,
uh,
some hip hop,
you know,
just stuff that interested me.

450
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.520
Bands that were seminal to me personally.

451
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.360
<v 2>So for dance music,
if people here,
like myself,
I'm,</v>

452
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:25.130
I'm naive of the entire genre and it really,

453
00:26:25.131 --> 00:26:27.290
I can enjoy it,
answers it better.
The first thing about it,

454
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.110
if I wanted to do the equivalent of a wine tasting with dance music and he's

455
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.740
like,
try like,
oh yeah,
like I think that's where low,

456
00:26:33.741 --> 00:26:37.910
I'm not sure and try a few different options to educate myself.

457
00:26:37.911 --> 00:26:41.420
Were there any particular artists or albums that you would suggest people start

458
00:26:41.421 --> 00:26:42.254
with?

459
00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:46.380
<v 3>Um,
among many,
of course.
I'm not asking you to pick favorites.</v>

460
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.680
I guess I am.
That's kind of an old school way of thinking.

461
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:51.510
I think if you're into electronic music now,

462
00:26:51.511 --> 00:26:53.850
I'd flip open Spotify and go listen to,

463
00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:58.851
there's like a million playlists that I run cascade radio and I add four or five

464
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:01.710
tracks on there every,
every week that I'm like,
oh,

465
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:05.970
this is stuff that I'm feeling.
And it's predominantly electronic music.

466
00:27:05.971 --> 00:27:09.840
I wouldn't say dance music cause there's a lot of left field stuff in there.
Um,

467
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.810
but yeah,
seminal records,

468
00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:17.520
I mean daft punk homework to me is still kind of like one of the top records set

469
00:27:17.521 --> 00:27:21.330
defined our John Rhe so,
um,
or discovery,

470
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.780
not as big a fan as discovery.
That's a very controversial thing to say.

471
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:28.680
But I'm a homework guy cause I dunno,
that hit me at the right time,

472
00:27:28.681 --> 00:27:33.510
time in my life.
Um,
that's a big one.
Uh,
any craft work record?

473
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:38.430
Um,
I don't know.
There's a lot of stuff out there,
but I think,

474
00:27:38.431 --> 00:27:40.620
I think going to Spotify and hitting it because

475
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.340
what's interesting about electronic music,

476
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:48.930
I think one at one point it was a genre and it was a very specific kind of

477
00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:50.100
surrounded a culture.

478
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.510
But now really and truly this is pretty much how most of the music's made.

479
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.840
I mean,
everybody works on a computer,
on a laptop,

480
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.460
even if the recording rock and roll,

481
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.410
and it's all augmented and processed and it's all electronic driven.
Um,

482
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.020
for better or for worse,
I mean that's another conversation.

483
00:28:07.021 --> 00:28:10.620
I could argue both sides.
Um,
I see the downsides in that,

484
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.920
but really the way we're thinking 25,

485
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:17.190
30 years ago working with Troy machines and sampling and oh,

486
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.130
recording on a multitrack that's in a computer.

487
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.120
This is just how everyone operates today.
I mean,
that's what pop music is.
I mean,

488
00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:26.880
he listened to it on the radio.
To me,
it's all dance music.
I'm like,
ah,

489
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:28.610
we were doing that 10 years ago.
This is cool.

490
00:28:28.611 --> 00:28:33.390
There's a modern take on what was happening a long time ago.
So I know,
uh,
you've,

491
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.540
uh,
we have,
we have a hard out and I'm really happy that you're able to make it.

492
00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:37.950
We have a couple of minutes.
Uh,

493
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.730
so I'm going to ask a couple of the normal questions that I tend do when

494
00:28:41.731 --> 00:28:46.620
wrapping up.
What book or books have you gifted most to other people,

495
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.420
if any?
Um,
I knew you were going to ask this.

496
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.600
I thought about it and I'm like,
man,
I don't give any books away.
Um,

497
00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.660
but I did just recently give lights out to a friend,

498
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.620
so I'm going to say that cause it's the most recent thing I read,
um,
lights out.

499
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.580
Yeah.

500
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:10.580
And it's about a cyber terrorism and how they were going to cut the power off

501
00:29:11.671 --> 00:29:14.090
and we're going to be screwed.
Um,

502
00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.980
it was a really interesting read and it scared the crap out of me as,

503
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.840
uh,
if you had to pick an underappreciated festival,

504
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.233
uh,
what would you pick?

505
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:34.920
Oh,
that's a great question.
And I'm stalling to,

506
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.190
Oh man,
there's so many cool.
They,
if I wasn't here in California,

507
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.770
a quick cello cause to me that's still is the best festival in the entire world.

508
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.740
And I've played literally hundreds if not thousands of festivals,
but,
um,

509
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.320
I dunno,
they got a lot of cool stuff going on in New York electric soon.

510
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:57.550
New York's actually really cool.

511
00:29:57.551 --> 00:30:00.910
It's on Randall's island and you're looking at the skyline while you're playing

512
00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.200
is pretty cool.
Um,
but there's a handful of those,
man,

513
00:30:04.201 --> 00:30:06.930
that's the one I'd have to think thing like go through my diet would go through

514
00:30:06.931 --> 00:30:11.230
my diary and be like,
where have I been recently?
You do around two sometime.
Uh,

515
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.970
when you think of the word successful,

516
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.100
who's the first person who comes to mind and why?

517
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:22.030
My wife and she's,
uh,
she's the Rock and she's who I look to all the time.

518
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:25.480
It seems like she kind of effort is simply effortlessly glides between family

519
00:30:25.481 --> 00:30:29.110
life and,
um,
supporting me and making everything work.
Uh,

520
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:34.390
so yeah,
she's,
she's success.
She's the model of success to me.

521
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.050
<v 0>If you had one billboard</v>

522
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:46.490
<v 3>anywhere,
you can put anything on it,
what would you put on it?</v>

523
00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:51.591
Let's see.

524
00:30:51.591 --> 00:30:55.130
Probably The Times Square just because that's where most people would see it.

525
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.960
I Dunno.
I'd probably throw it in my brands up there,

526
00:31:00.961 --> 00:31:03.330
Redo or something or cascade.
I don't know.

527
00:31:03.331 --> 00:31:05.850
On a big picture of me like I'm coming to get you.

528
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.641
<v 4>Do you have any,</v>

529
00:31:08.641 --> 00:31:11.880
any mottos or quotes or anything that you stayed to yourself when you're getting

530
00:31:11.881 --> 00:31:13.590
ready to perform that you could put on the

531
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:18.860
<v 3>billboard?
MMM.
Now,</v>

532
00:31:18.861 --> 00:31:21.740
but one of the quotes that always comes back to me and my career and something I

533
00:31:21.741 --> 00:31:24.260
always think back to every time I left the house,
my dad would always say,

534
00:31:24.261 --> 00:31:28.640
remember who you are?
And I'm always like,
man,
that's now that I'm a father.

535
00:31:28.641 --> 00:31:31.640
This is a very profound thing to me.
At the time I was like,
man,
dad,

536
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.310
you're so weird.
Like when I forget who I am,

537
00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:40.190
let me see now I'm like,
Gosh,
that guy's going to see a smart,
you know,

538
00:31:40.191 --> 00:31:41.810
that basically answers the next one

539
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.270
<v 4>question.
So I think we'll,</v>

540
00:31:43.271 --> 00:31:46.860
we'll wrap up with just asking you where people can find more about you,

541
00:31:46.861 --> 00:31:47.880
your work,
your music,

542
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:52.350
<v 3>whether it's a anywhere online,
early.
Yeah,
I dunno,
I'm on Twitter,
Instagram,</v>

543
00:31:52.351 --> 00:31:55.980
all the social networks.
Cascade music.com come and check me out.

544
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:59.790
I appreciate the time you got to cascade with,
with two K at cascade.

545
00:31:59.791 --> 00:32:03.360
Kska d yeah.
Yeah.
If you follow me on Instagram,

546
00:32:03.361 --> 00:32:07.590
you get some pretty crazy photos on there,
so sure we would thank you so much.

547
00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.700
I really appreciate the time.

548
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:13.830
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

549
00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.580
<v 4>anybody have taken a soul self and anybody,
I know you gotta take selfies,</v>

550
00:32:25.581 --> 00:32:28.270
but have you taken a sole selfie?
Y'All don't know nothing about this.

551
00:32:28.271 --> 00:32:29.490
I'm a hip young.
Put y'all on what?

552
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.170
Put you all on the sole selfie is the way it is.

553
00:32:32.171 --> 00:32:36.220
You can remind yourself instantly that's you are mighty enough that you are

554
00:32:36.221 --> 00:32:37.120
beautiful enough,

555
00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:40.760
that you are powerful enough and strong enough to get through anything.

556
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.110
And I want you all to do what we right now,

557
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:44.120
everybody's standing up real quick name.
I'm thinking,
I stand up.
Stand up,

558
00:32:44.121 --> 00:32:48.480
stand up.
All you gotta do.
I ain't got to do well.
My hand in the air.

559
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.020
Turn it around.
Make a little claw like you holding a hand mirror,

560
00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.450
fended off your charm,
lean into it.

561
00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.870
And when you see how powerful and beauty and mighty you are,

562
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.030
you got to say the words I,

563
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.193
<v 5>Oh,</v>

564
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:10.780
<v 4>let's say we me ready?
One,
two,
three.
I am,</v>

565
00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:11.763
<v 5>oh,</v>

566
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.830
<v 4>hold on,
hold on,
hold on.
I won't believe you hit it again.
I am</v>

567
00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:17.853
<v 5>Oh</v>

568
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:23.260
<v 4>damn rights.
You Austin and all your power.
Sit down in your power damn rights.</v>

569
00:33:23.261 --> 00:33:25.260
You will.
That's how you get through those days,
right?

570
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:29.690
One of those days like I'm having right now.
You know when my drive crashes,

571
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.770
right?
When my self worth stalls by the side of the road,

572
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:39.100
my ambitions check engine light comes on mid Hustle and I find myself at my

573
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:44.270
bathroom mirror,
finger to glass,

574
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.700
scratching the word can't into the hardened steam.

575
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.010
But as I stare at my murky reflection,

576
00:33:52.011 --> 00:33:54.370
but these broken down eyes,

577
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:59.830
my reflection sees its reflection in me from the other side and thinks it's

578
00:34:00.981 --> 00:34:03.030
still,
oh,

579
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:08.560
I didn't know what he thinks he sees but must not be looking at me because I am

580
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.350
so don't be wasting my tears.
I am more than enough to get through this.

581
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.410
I got a scrap book full of,

582
00:34:22.411 --> 00:34:27.411
I can't do it to prove it for I maintain a level of authenticity in everything I

583
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.910
do.
So my awesome mission is not speculation but irrefutable truth.

584
00:34:32.911 --> 00:34:33.360
In fact,

585
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.220
the Census Bureau just released a report that two out of every three people are

586
00:34:38.221 --> 00:34:39.054
awesome.

587
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:46.790
And if that is true then out of you and you and I question,

588
00:34:49.021 --> 00:34:51.000
we must now ask ourselves this.

589
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:57.020
Which one of you two was the one that sucks because I am

590
00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:03.520
like finding money,
getting dirty laundry.
Awesome.
Woo.

591
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:08.280
Like parking next at one meter that's broken.
Awesome.
Like,

592
00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:11.660
like that perfect person at that perfect time.

593
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:16.070
Seeing that perfect thing.
Awesome.
Like making a living,

594
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.190
doing what you live for.

595
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:23.830
Like somewhere rocking out in New York City is a dude whose resume actually

596
00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:27.980
reads National Air Guitar Tamping it

597
00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:35.590
somewhere in the Ukraine is a woman who boasts a trophy for national sand art

598
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:36.620
champion.

599
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:41.620
Here you in Los Angeles is a dude who has earned the title national poetry slam

600
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:47.490
champion and,
and thank you.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

601
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:49.890
Because to most of the working world,

602
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:54.570
all three of those titles are equally freaking ridiculous.

603
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.363
But

604
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:03.230
the most awesome five people on the planet are we who embrace our

605
00:36:03.541 --> 00:36:04.740
ridiculousness.

606
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.000
We live what we love and we love incorrigibly,

607
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.710
which is why I sleep quite well,
but I go to bed horribly.

608
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:17.340
Anybody else always hopped up on a triple shot of purpose,

609
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:22.400
juggling my dreams like 13 flaming swords and chasing my aspirations through the

610
00:36:22.741 --> 00:36:26.310
graveyard shift so that the world can awake to my Austem.

611
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:31.320
Neisha snus look it up and I'll admit I don't limit,

612
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:35.370
I used to think that awesome was the word for it.
You know,

613
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.530
surfers and Skateboarders,
you know,
smokers and valley girls,

614
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.590
but I was like totally mistaken.

615
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.660
Awesome is gangster awesome is stupid,
fresh awesome.

616
00:36:48.661 --> 00:36:52.470
Has the new comp and the new cool being the new bomb diggity and the new bees

617
00:36:52.471 --> 00:36:56.190
knees.
My new mantra that helps me breathe into all that I believe in,

618
00:36:56.191 --> 00:37:01.191
see that within me is all the Mike [inaudible] need because there are those days

619
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:07.820
when I'm pushed to the edge was still waters meet earth and I fall to my knees

620
00:37:08.401 --> 00:37:09.960
to look upon the water surface.

621
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.960
But as I stare at my mercury reflection with these broken down eyes,

622
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:21.950
God sees his reflection in me from the other side and thinks to herself,

623
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.880
oh,
I don't know what he thinks he sees,

624
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.180
but he must not be looking at me because I am

625
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:41.030
like the science of miracles and the mathematics of purpose.

626
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.650
Awesome.
Like how the mind,

627
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:49.110
the mind can always calculate the what of who and the when of where.

628
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.770
But the soul must solve for y awesome.

629
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.920
Like the thought of God and logic.

630
00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:01.080
Having faith that we will figure ourselves out.
Awesome.

631
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:06.710
Like how the moment I truly discovered the great I am is the same moment I

632
00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.140
discovered of truly great.

633
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:15.330
I am and I am not perfect,

634
00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:20.880
but I'm perfect.
Like I am.
I'm not beautiful.
Like I used to be

635
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.720
beautiful like I am like the scar where abreast once was like survival.

636
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.500
Where a death once.
Well it's like the better.
Where a best once was.

637
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:38.320
Every hair a trophy,
every wrinkle fold a story.

638
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.850
Every pound of fat.

639
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:44.790
A challenge reminded me that there is always something to pursue

640
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.060
and always something to celebrate.

641
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:53.170
That is why I never smile for no reason.

642
00:38:53.171 --> 00:38:55.360
That is a concept I don't believe in.

643
00:38:55.361 --> 00:38:59.470
Do join never without a reason to show off your teeth a bit.
Let me see him.

644
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.550
Let me see their baby.
There you go.
Spread out shit.
Seeks a bit.

645
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:08.360
Let your gums breathe a bit.
If you can learn to reach deep for it.

646
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:12.220
You can take yourself a piece of bliss and make yourself a feast of it.

647
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.640
Like when you go buy a smoothie

648
00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.550
and they fill it to fool,
right and making more than your cup can hold,

649
00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.660
but instead of letting it just spill all over what they do,
what they do,

650
00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:32.110
they give you a little extra cough and you feel like you just want a smoothie

651
00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.810
lottery of their hair.
Awesome.

652
00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:41.510
Like that perfect day.
What was yours?
That perfect day,
right?

653
00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:44.230
One of mine was like the first time.
Yeah.

654
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:47.760
Stretch Limo driver pulled up to the first,

655
00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.570
the five star hotel to transport me to my first class flight after my sold out

656
00:39:51.571 --> 00:39:55.110
show and curiously peering at me through the rear view mirror.

657
00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.200
He asked what do you do for a living

658
00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.920
and with a pocket full of sand and the air guitar in my hand,

659
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:05.360
I replied,

660
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.360
I am a full time poets now roll up the dam to fight.

661
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.800
Okay.
I didn't actually say your roll up the damn divider but it would have been

662
00:40:23.801 --> 00:40:28.590
awesome.
Or if I had right,
it would have been,
but you know what,
hey next time

663
00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:34.170
and you better believe that will be no shortage of next times.

664
00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.910
But that's the thing before you can believe it.
I got to believe it.

665
00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.270
I got to believe there will be no shortage of next time.

666
00:40:41.271 --> 00:40:45.500
That's why this thing that I'm doing tonight,
it's not just pretty words,
poetry,

667
00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:50.240
poetry sake.
This is survival for me.
This is survival for us.
I mean this,

668
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.920
you know,
this is how we get through.

669
00:40:51.921 --> 00:40:55.610
We have to have instant ways to access our power and our,

670
00:40:55.611 --> 00:40:58.190
and our purpose and our passion,
our truth to,
to,

671
00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.510
to get through those days and to do this thing.
We do this,

672
00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:06.190
this entrepreneurial innovation,

673
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:11.320
you know me against the world instigation against all odds,

674
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.370
deaf to all the haters thing we did.
Okay.
Maybe not death to all the haters.

675
00:41:15.371 --> 00:41:18.700
That's,
that's negative.
We'll stay positive like,
like,
you know,

676
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
stop feet and paper cuts and warrants to all the haters thing that we do.

677
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:28.600
Right?
And it ain't easy.
I know that,
I know that nobody knows them more than me.

678
00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:32.050
It's why I'm a give you a powerful takeaway tonight.
Okay?

679
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:33.650
I don't care what it said,
the stage.

680
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:37.910
This will be the most powerful thing that you leave here with to help you get

681
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:42.380
through your challenging days of crafting your successful life and all you have

682
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:46.460
to do is repeat after me.
Right now at least I'm not trying

683
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.040
to build a successful life

684
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:59.270
from poetry.
I got no sympathy for y'all.
Please,

685
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.870
whatever.
Is it hard for you?
What do you have?
Tech Industry,

686
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:06.740
your billion dollar industry.
I built my business off the dead art form.

687
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:10.670
You hated in high school,
please.

688
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:15.710
Djs and state borders got it.
Easier than poets.
You know,

689
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.740
people,
look,
when I used to introduce myself as a fulltime poet,

690
00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:21.160
people used to look at me like I said,
hi,
my name's [inaudible].

691
00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:25.460
I'm a fulltime mermaid.
Nice to meet you.
All right?
They don't.

692
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.250
They don't get it,
but that's all right.
That's all right.

693
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:32.300
Because with every moment of confusion within someone else,

694
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:36.740
it was an opportunity for clarity of purpose within myself.
Right?

695
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.900
I had to believe that I,
and I did.

696
00:42:38.901 --> 00:42:42.950
I believed that I could create a new user experience for the art form of spoken

697
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:44.630
word that could affect the masses.

698
00:42:44.631 --> 00:42:48.920
I believe that I could dissolve the line between business speaker and

699
00:42:48.921 --> 00:42:50.690
performance artists,
right?
And,
and,

700
00:42:50.691 --> 00:42:53.840
and create a new experience that [inaudible] has to both.

701
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:58.190
And so against all the advice of everyone saying,
forget poetry.
Instead,

702
00:42:58.191 --> 00:43:03.191
I embraced my ridiculousness and I created a new style of speaking called poetic

703
00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:05.870
voice that just blends inspirational,

704
00:43:05.871 --> 00:43:09.890
speaking with spoken word poetry to create an experience that allows me to go

705
00:43:09.891 --> 00:43:14.891
out and inspire people and help them tell their story and it's sold them the

706
00:43:14.961 --> 00:43:19.310
best version of themselves.
Right?
And to do that,
to awesome find my life,

707
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:21.470
I had to be okay.

708
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:26.530
I had to be fine with people not getting it the first time so that I could

709
00:43:27.921 --> 00:43:32.660
believe in myself long enough to create no shortage of next times,

710
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:37.790
next times.
And now you don't have to guess just checking my specs.

711
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.170
I'm no longer afraid to double down cause I trick the deck.

712
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:45.920
I've already seen my future.
So I'm unfit to bet.

713
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:49.040
That's why whenever failure challenges me to Russian Roulette,

714
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:54.190
I rock a waterproof poker face impervious to sweat because I don't gamble with

715
00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:58.160
my life.
I count the cards.
So my success is mathematics.

716
00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:02.060
So long as my dealer with God,
I can always even my odd,

717
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.940
even on the Ids,
I can't get over it.

718
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:09.920
I go through it to this behind me on the days I can't levy the waves.

719
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:14.950
I just learned to surf tsunamis on the days I can slay the beast of despair with

720
00:44:15.951 --> 00:44:19.370
my mighty sort of confidence.
Hell,
I can.

721
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.980
I can still took a razor blade beneath my tongue and paper,
cut despair,

722
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:27.560
one positive affirmation at a time.

723
00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:32.820
And when I return home from the Wild Rumpus,
oh my awesome fest.

724
00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.860
Oh,
always vacuum with a smile.
Okay.

725
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.890
As I clean up my awesome ness for their,
yeah,

726
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:46.200
there are bits of mountain top buried in the grooves of the soles of my shoes.

727
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.520
Every footprint tracked on my floor testifies to the height.

728
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:54.930
Soft climbed and proved I made it back home each time.

729
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:59.920
So please remember,
embrace your ridiculousness.

730
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.630
Okay?
Please go out there and vacuum with a smile.

731
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.970
Please remember you're awesome nation.

732
00:45:04.971 --> 00:45:09.971
This and be the little extra cup for somebody else because I find that on those

733
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:14.150
days when my weary soul can't seem to do another single thing,

734
00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:19.660
when the 24th hour threatens to pop my days scenes when the cup of my ambitions

735
00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:23.260
begins to run it over into springs.

736
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.840
Perfect person at that perfect time says that perfect thing and I am handed an

737
00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.020
awesome little extra copies.

738
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:39.730
Mama my homie shows up at my door with a bottle of Don Julio for dirty jokes in

739
00:45:41.391 --> 00:45:44.330
a scrapbook full of,
we all laugh about this later.

740
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
A little extra cope by my lover sipping espresso at midnight in a fireproof suit

741
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.310
who takes over the juggling of MF Lehman storage and says,

742
00:45:55.311 --> 00:45:57.730
you need to get some sleep tonight,
baby.
Yeah,

743
00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:02.310
a little extra cup by my friends,
my family,

744
00:46:02.311 --> 00:46:04.980
but my fans are my colleagues,
my community,

745
00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:10.780
this kind of community that shows up at comes here to hear me inspired and

746
00:46:11.191 --> 00:46:15.150
amazed and wants to hear that poem that ends with that fiery blaze,

747
00:46:15.151 --> 00:46:16.690
but souls up to find me.

748
00:46:16.691 --> 00:46:21.691
Having one of those days when I stand on this stage trying to guide someone

749
00:46:21.911 --> 00:46:26.380
home.
It can't seem to believe the words of my own poem,

750
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:31.990
but you do.
Yeah.
You see in my story your truth,

751
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.850
you want perfection in process that you are wrapped Shah in route and us there

752
00:46:38.431 --> 00:46:40.520
at my reflection in this audience,

753
00:46:40.521 --> 00:46:43.620
his eyes and you stand back at your reflection.

754
00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:48.850
My pupils provide and we shout aloud to ourselves with fire and pride.

755
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:56.190
I don't know what you think you see from your side.

756
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.940
Yeah,
but you,

757
00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.590
you must not be looking at me.

758
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.380
That'd be cool.
Hi.
Wow,

759

Number one is perhaps my favorite audio book of all time,

778
00:48:25.991 --> 00:48:28.750
and that is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

779
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:32.980
The only audiobook I've wanted to immediately listen to a second time.

780
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:37.390
As soon as I finished.
It's amazing.
You will thank me.
The graveyard book.

781
00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.120
The second is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,

782
00:48:40.121 --> 00:48:44.770
which had a huge impact on my life and formed the basis for a lot of what became

783
