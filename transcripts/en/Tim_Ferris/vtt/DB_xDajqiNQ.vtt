00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.060
There are many different approaches to making content and I'm very often asked,

2
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:14.720
how do you create content that is popular that will be popular?

3
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.190
And I don't think that's a very good question to start with.
In fact,

4
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:22.820
I think you should ask yourself first and foremost,
why do you create content?

5
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.420
So there are many potential answers to this.

6
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.810
What I would consider it a bad answer is to get likes and favorites and

7
00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:32.870
subscribers.

8
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.860
That is an intermediate step and you can get trapped in what I would consider

9
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:40.850
another people like Eric Reese might call vanity metrics,
right?

10
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:45.740
You're chasing metrics because they're highly coveted by many people who are

11
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:49.910
only looking at the symptoms of potential success,
I.
E.

12
00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:53.570
The lights and so on.
Uh,
but not looking at the ultimate objective.

13
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:56.840
So what might a good objective be?
A good objective might be,

14
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.770
I'm creating content to determine or hone in,

15
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:03.500
specifically target my 1000 true fans.

16
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.830
If you read one article on content creation or marketing,

17
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.860
I would make it 1000 true fans by Kevin Kelly to determine who might die.

18
00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:16.730
Hard fans are whose behaviors,
beliefs,
likes,

19
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:20.810
dislikes.
I understand because I'm part of that market,
whatever niche it is,

20
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:25.100
even if it's a one in a million niche that can still be a sizeable audience,

21
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.950
you could have some type of social agenda.

22
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.010
So I want to not appeal to all of the readers,

23
00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:35.090
listeners in the world,

24
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.150
but instead I want to actively call and filter my audience so that only the

25
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:45.830
people I want to connect with directly actually wade through.
Okay.

26
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:48.020
These are very real tangible,

27
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.710
measurable outcomes and I would encourage you to think about what you want to do

28
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.891
with your content.

29
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:59.150
What do you want to achieve beyond what we would consider vanity metrics,
right?

30
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.050
And there are some vanity metrics that can be converted into dollars if you're

31
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:08.051
an Instagram celebrity or you are interested in becoming one and you know that

32
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:15.050
if you have a million plus subscribers or you have a few million that you can

33
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.380
earn 50 to $70,000 per promoted posts.
Okay?

34
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.480
That is an objective.

35
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.590
It's an objective also dependent on a lot of variables you don't control.

36
00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:29.591
I remember talking to someone who had a very successful content based business

37
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:31.370
built on Facebook,
as he said,

38
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:34.760
it's like having the most profitable Mcdonald's in the world built on top of a

39
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:38.480
volcano,
uh,
and you don't know when it's going to erupt.

40
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.560
So my preferences are always clear.
Objective,

41
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:46.340
what you want to achieve perhaps can be financially driven.
That's fine.

42
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.700
I don't consider fame in and of itself to be a very useful objective.

43
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:52.070
And there are a lot of downsides to that.
Uh,

44
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.060
then you have identifying your 1000 true fans.

45
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.240
And I will tell you right now that if you tried to make something that appeals,

46
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.410
everyone tried to make something that everyone will like,

47
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.500
it will be something that no one loves.
All right?

48
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:09.220
So you want to first identify the thousand die hearts.

49
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.760
Once you have your die hard true believers,

50
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.670
they are your strongest unpaid marketing force.

51
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.660
They will then recruit your casual listeners,
casual readers,

52
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.050
and widen out the concentric circles of your access.

53
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:25.480
So you start with a thousand people and you end up with a readership of a

54
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.790
million or 3 million or 10 million.

55
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:32.620
And that's exactly what's happened with me and I began in a very narrow,

56
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:36.820
narrow niche and then over time as I built a larger readership,

57
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.650
expanded topically,

58
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.480
but I didn't begin with a wide variety of topics.
This is really,

59
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:47.290
really important point.
Do you enjoy it?
In other words,

60
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:52.120
do you have a deep attraction to a given format so that you will have the

61
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:56.710
endurance necessary to get through all the trials and tribulations and learning

62
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.810
hurdles to build a large audience if not,

63
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:02.860
choose a different approach because you will fail otherwise.
With all of this,

64
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.950
I encourage you to think about the long game and ask yourself if I were in this

65
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:12.520
for the long game,
if I commit,
this is not a three month endeavor,

66
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.180
it is a minimum three year commitment to mastering this craft.

67
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.070
How does that change your decisions and what does the path potentially look
like?

68
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.890
It doesn't mean you have to be wedded to a three year plan,

69
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:28.240
but it means that at least you are committed to doing the thought exercise of

70
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:32.020
putting it down on paper and specking out what it might look like.

71
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.030
So if you want to not just create popular content that is a femoral and

72
00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:42.031
disappears like the flicker of a firefly in the Internet,

73
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.660
uh,
landscape,
then you,

74
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.700
if you want to convert your efforts into a sustainable career with fans who will

75
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:55.420
take a bullet for you and travel with you wherever you go,

76
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.160
you have to think about it differently.

77
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.780
Did not get caught up in the vanity metrics and ask why?
Ask.

78
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:06.610
So what?
Ask and then what for what many,
many,

79
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:09.940
many times.
And the challenge,
not only your own assumptions,

80
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:11.860
but the assumptions of other people who give you advice.

81
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.090
So feel free to completely disagree with what I say.

82
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.990
However,

83
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:21.991
recognize that my beliefs and tenants that I follow are born of many experiments

84
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:26.740
over a long period of time.
So if you're going to disagree and guess what,

85
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.870
those are hypotheses you have to test.

86
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.590
And it is through the testing that you will find your own unique path.
