00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.841
Good morning,

2
00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:03.990
good afternoon and good evening ladies and gentlemen around the world.

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.360
Thank you for tuning in to the Tim Ferriss show.

4
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.860
This episode is going to touch a lot on creativity,
productivity,

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.180
creating an identity for yourself,
becoming a category of one.

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.220
And we will explain what that means,

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.760
but it's related to art and the art that is your life.

8
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.110
So let's start with two quotes.

9
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.610
The first is from Pablo Picasso and it is every child is an artist.

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
The problem is staying in artist when you grow up.
And secondly,

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.590
if you hear a voice within you,
say you cannot paint,

12
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.970
then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced to that as Vincent Van

13
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.050
Gogh.
Because most of you listening,

14
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:44.490
a lot of you listening will not identify or view yourselves as artists.

15
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.850
And perhaps after this podcast you will think differently.

16
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.290
But before we get to the guest and incredible guest,

17
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.310
a tip,
and this is a pro tip,
if you feel anxious,

18
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.990
if you have some type of low grade anxiety,
start making your bed.

19
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.380
I know this is a crazy recommendation.
It might sound ridiculous.

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.700
There is a gentleman named [inaudible] and he is a Hindu priest.

21
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:13.590
At one point I was having a tremendous amount of anxiety and he suggested start

22
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:14.430
making your bed.

23
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.050
At the very least when you then come back at the end of the day or even

24
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:19.801
throughout the day,

25
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:22.980
you will have that one piece of your life that you were able to control

26
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:27.120
completely and it will seem orderly.
It will seem as it should be.

27
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.010
So this sounds nuts,
but believe me,
the cascading effect can be pretty profound.

28
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.950
If you have anxiety,
at the very least,

29
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.280
perhaps you should consider start making your bed in the morning.

30
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.210
It doesn't have to be fancy.
It just has to look nice.
Okay,
moving on.

31
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:46.650
Our Guest Ladies and gentlemen is Mike Shinoda.
If you don't know that name,

32
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.970
Mike isn't musician record producer and an artist and he is perhaps best known

33
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:54.700
as the wrapper principle songwriter,
keyboardist,
rhythm guitars.

34
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.980
It's a long list and one of the two vocalists of the rock band,

35
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.410
Lincoln Park,
if you want to consider it rock band.

36
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.240
If you don't know Lincoln Park,

37
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.810
they've sold more than 60 million albums worldwide and have one,

38
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:10.080
two grammy awards.
Mike is also a solar wrapper,

39
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.580
if you would call it that in his side project for minor,
which I love to death.

40
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.070
It's amazing and the lyrics are incredible.

41
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.480
He's also provided artwork production and mixing for all of the projects that I

42
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:26.481
just mentioned and he has collaborated with everyone from Jay z to Depeche mode

43
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.260
and everyone in between.
It's a really incredible career.

44
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.090
The story of how he got started,

45
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.520
how they in some ways accidentally became the phenomenon that they are is

46
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:42.600
fascinating and there are many different takeaways we get into not just the

47
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:47.601
broad philosophical underpinnings but also advice for beginning musicians or

48
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:52.650
artists of any type parallels between music and publishing and and really any

49
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:55.540
type of creation along those lines.
A,

50
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.770
some of his daily rituals as well as for instance,

51
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.040
how he and his band rehearse how he song writes.
All of these things.

52
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.740
We really dig into it,
so I hope you enjoy it.

53
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.570
It's certainly visit the sites in the show notes and you can find all of those

54
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.830
including music for relief.org which is a nonprofit founded by Lincoln Park and

55
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:15.790
I've done work with them.

56
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.720
They've raised millions of dollars for survivors of multiple natural disasters

57
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.750
around the world.
You'll find all of these in the show notes.

58
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:24.640

68

<v 1>at this attitude.
I can
start shaking.</v>

73
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.150
You posted a question.

74
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.870
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue

75
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.820
like snow to thanks for coming on the show.

76
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.540
<v 2>Hey,
thanks for having me Tim.</v>

77
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.760
<v 0>It's been quite a few years since we first met and I was very amused to see on</v>

78
00:04:40.761 --> 00:04:45.761
your Wikipedia page that your bio shot is actually from blog world expo when we

79
00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:50.000
first met and I guess 2008 or so through

80
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.210
through awesome.

81
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.700
I'm very glad that I was able to somehow indirectly contribute to your Wikipedia

82
00:04:55.701 --> 00:04:56.534
page.

83
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.180
<v 2>That's funny.
I didn't know that's where it was from.
That's amazing.</v>

84
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.140
I think that actually is a,
is a um,
like a replacement of,

85
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.130
I had said to the fans at one point that I hated my,

86
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.370
the old page picture that was there.
I was like,
you guys,
seriously,

87
00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:13.290
this is like the worst picture of me.

88
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:17.910
It was from like 2003 and I was in in mid sentence with my eyes half closed,

89
00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:21.870
like somebody had put it up there as like to kind of mess with me I think.

90
00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:24.360
And it was horrible.
And so I asked for,
I said,

91
00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:27.210
somebody please like find a great picture and replace it.

92
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.520
<v 0>That that's really funny.</v>

93
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:33.280
So actually I'm going to put out a call to action to my fans right now.

94
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:38.080
I hate my Wikipedia photo.
It was taken of me and it's at an low web,

95
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:42.190
a speaking engagement in Paris when I had pulled an all nighter to get there and

96
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:46.360
just look like Al Pachino after a bender.
I mean I look really,
really rough,

97
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.460
but we were initially put in contact through Aaron red,
the Red Baron.

98
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.730
And so that's one,
just want to give him a nod and a thank you for that.

99
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:59.731
But I've been continually impressed as we've gotten to know each other about how

100
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.800
eclectic your skill set is and and how you've come to contribute not only to

101
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:10.220
your own work but to the work of so many other musicians and also done art

102
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:13.280
installations.
When somebody asks you if they've,

103
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.000
assuming they don't recognize you,
what you do,
how do you answer that question?

104
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.670
I usually lie first of all because if they don't know what I do,
then

105
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.720
<v 2>I tend to like to keep things pretty mellow and especially,</v>

106
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.650
you know,
I live in La and I live like on the border of,

107
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.490
I live near Beverly Hills,
but I think I'm technically in Beverly Hills,

108
00:06:35.491 --> 00:06:36.690
but I'm not also,

109
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.020
so I tend to do like spend most of my time in more low key in the valley and

110
00:06:43.351 --> 00:06:46.710
stuff like that.
Where in the Beverly Hill side you walk around,

111
00:06:46.711 --> 00:06:50.340
if you see Paparazzi or you see somebody you recognize from people magazine,

112
00:06:50.341 --> 00:06:53.910
that's not that surprising.
But if that happens on the valley side,

113
00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:57.090
it's just a little bit more,
I think people get a little more attention.

114
00:06:57.091 --> 00:06:58.800
So I tend to,
I tend to like stray away from that.

115
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.160
I did grow up however doing like the first probably my first love was actually

116
00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:06.210
drawing and painting and,

117
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.930
and I had always thought I was going to grow up to do that.
Um,

118
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.610
in fact we started the band I started the band is like a hobby after high school

119
00:07:14.611 --> 00:07:18.240
and I wasn't even very serious about it until midway through college.

120
00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:22.350
And in college I was studying illustration at art center college of design.

121
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.150
It was very,
very serious school.

122
00:07:24.151 --> 00:07:28.350
It's a very rigorous curriculum and a lot of the folks from there go on to be

123
00:07:28.351 --> 00:07:31.620
really great.
You know designers in,
in auto and graphic design,

124
00:07:31.621 --> 00:07:34.110
add film and of course illustration.

125
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.250
<v 0>And you've done your own art installations.
I remember seeing a number of them.</v>

126
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.540
There's one particular piece that maybe you can remind,
remind me of the name of,

127
00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:43.410
there were two women,

128
00:07:43.411 --> 00:07:47.550
there was a figure with a skull head and it seemed to be composed of dollar

129
00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:48.384
signs.

130
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.160
<v 2>Oh Man.
I did a whole series.
I'm not sure exactly which one that is,</v>

131
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:56.510
but I did a whole series two parts show called glorious excess.

132
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.270
And it was about,

133
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.970
I was mostly inspired by the fact that I felt like I had a weird,

134
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:07.150
a unique perspective on the idea of being a celebrity.

135
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.750
We started our,

136
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.340
I mean I started the band as a hobby on the weekends with a friend of mine from

137
00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:14.330
high school and we,

138
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:19.810
we never got into it with the intention of becoming a signed band or a popular

139
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:22.040
band or anything like that.

140
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:26.750
It was just like we love to do this where this is the kind of music that we want

141
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:29.450
to hear and nobody's really making the specific,
you know,

142
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:33.830
combination of elements and all of the things that followed,
followed.

143
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.990
And I found myself one day looking at it and going,
I'm realizing that,

144
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.180
you know,
it never really occurred to me.

145
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.560
There would be people who would like fabricate a whole,
I don't know,
music,

146
00:08:45.561 --> 00:08:50.150
career with the intention of becoming famous or becoming like rich.

147
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.840
Cause that wasn't on my radar at all when we started.

148
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:56.490
We started it because love music and it seemed like,
yeah,

149
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:59.790
that's why you would start a band.
Right.
And then eventually your,
you know,

150
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:03.600
we're at the Grammy's were at the MTV awards and there are people who there who

151
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:08.190
clearly are there because they love to be famous.

152
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:11.040
They love to be celebrities and so on.

153
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.650
Even if they had gotten into it originally because they liked singing or

154
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:13.981
whatever,

155
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:17.610
but now they're clearly there for another reason and this art show as you were

156
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.430
going back to the art show,
I felt like I had,

157
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:21.900
I'm sitting there in the middle of that,

158
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:25.530
like literally just pulling out my phone and taking pictures and video and stuff

159
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.610
and seeing the stuff in first person and just simply not relating to it.

160
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.820
<v 0>It's been a fascinating experience for me to look at different success stories</v>

161
00:09:36.011 --> 00:09:40.060
and try to deconstruct the motivations and also their focus on process or

162
00:09:40.061 --> 00:09:41.530
outcome.
Right and like you said,

163
00:09:41.531 --> 00:09:46.531
there's some people who are so focused on becoming famous or becoming rich and

164
00:09:46.901 --> 00:09:50.200
of course it's very small percentage succeed at accomplishing that.

165
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.610
And if that's the motivation,

166
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.540
it would seem to me at least that they wouldn't actually enjoy the process of

167
00:09:55.541 --> 00:09:59.440
creating the music or the books or the art or whatever it is that they choose as

168
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.270
medium.
And that's,

169
00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:05.560
I always found it sort of a juxtaposition to your experience.
It seems like,

170
00:10:05.561 --> 00:10:07.990
and I've heard the story,
you might be able to confirm or deny this,

171
00:10:07.991 --> 00:10:12.991
that that u two the band started out and at least one of the members decided we

172
00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:16.870
are going to be the biggest rock band in the world from from the very outset.

173
00:10:16.871 --> 00:10:20.380
But it doesn't sound like that was or is the Lincoln Park Story.

174
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.740
What were the tipping points for you guys?
I mean as as the,

175
00:10:23.741 --> 00:10:28.530
as the band came together over time and you met people not just in,

176
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.320
in high school,
but I guess you met at the,
when you were studying art.

177
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.040
<v 2>Yeah,
that's right.
Well,</v>

178
00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.030
I mean it's a really interesting time to be talking about this kind of thing

179
00:10:38.031 --> 00:10:43.031
because we just put out a new album called the hunting party and one of the

180
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.180
inspirations behind the hunting party was rock.

181
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.590
Right now is that a place where it's very indie,

182
00:10:50.591 --> 00:10:53.990
all alt nd driven?
It's like everything is,

183
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:59.000
if you compare it to 10 years ago or 15 years ago,
it's very,
it's a lot softer.

184
00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:00.500
It's a lot more dancy.

185
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.880
There's not a lot of edginess to it or aggression I feel.

186
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.540
And so there was a day when I was listening to the radio and I couldn't hear

187
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:09.171
anything or find anything,

188
00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:11.170
they'll listen to you and I was listening to all my music,
you know,

189
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.380
services and I just had a hard time finding something that I w that that kind of

190
00:11:15.381 --> 00:11:19.250
filled that void for me.
So again,
it's like whenever we have that feeling,

191
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.420
whenever I get that feeling,

192
00:11:20.421 --> 00:11:24.110
that's usually a time when I go into the studio and I start making whatever it

193
00:11:24.111 --> 00:11:27.310
is that I feel like I'm missing.
And that's what the new album is,

194
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.990
was inspired by.
But it's also what the first album and the original,
you know,

195
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:35.300
I'm kind of idea of the band was inspired by along the way I think.

196
00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:39.480
And not a lot has changed.
We,
we've as far as like the,
the philosophy of,

197
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:43.490
of what we're striving for and it doesn't,
you know,
to your point,

198
00:11:43.491 --> 00:11:45.440
it doesn't really include like being the biggest,

199
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:48.620
because if we want it to be like the biggest band in the universe,

200
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.950
I think we wouldn't make an album like our new one,
our new ones,
very aggressive,

201
00:11:51.951 --> 00:11:52.461
very heavy.

202
00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:57.461
We knew going it that we would be potentially hurting our chances at getting on.

203
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.361
For example,

204
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:01.810
getting on the radio and truth be told the radio is a great way to promote your

205
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:04.720
band and promote your album and so on.
So if you know,
going into it,

206
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:08.710
you're making something that's not going to be effective in promotion.

207
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:13.150
Like you're making a decision that is,
it's a creative decision,

208
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:15.700
not like for example,
a career oriented or,

209
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:19.810
or well maybe it is a career and his decision,
but it's not a money decision.

210
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:22.600
Right,
right.
So going back though,

211
00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:26.780
I think there were definitely points when we were getting started.
We met,
we are,

212
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.670
we're all kind of friends from high school for the most part.
Um,
I knew Brad,

213
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:33.100
I've known Brad our guitars since we wrote like 13.

214
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.210
He was good friends with my best friend mark who was the original singer in our

215
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:41.320
band.
Brad's roommate was our,
became our bass player.
Dave,

216
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:44.920
my friend from college became our Dj Joe Rob,
our drummer,

217
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:47.960
came from neighboring high school and eventually mark are,

218
00:12:47.961 --> 00:12:51.940
are are their singer part.
We parted ways because the,
the singing thing was just,

219
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.850
you know,
getting on stage like drove him creek.
It was getting like an ulcer.

220
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.630
He was so nervous to go on stage and,

221
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.790
and it turned out he was actually much more talented at like the behind the

222
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:02.560
scenes stuff.
He ended up managing bands.

223
00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:06.850
He currently manages bands like Alice in chains and he managed Deftones tones

224
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:09.370
and Cypress Hill at one point.
So yeah,
he's,

225
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:12.970
so that was what he was kind of made for.
Once we parted ways of mark though,

226
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:16.780
we found Chester through a mutual friend.
And that was,
that was a moment where,

227
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.850
I only say that to say that.
So he came into the band,
we did a whole bunch more,

228
00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:22.540
you know,

229
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.690
showcases and shows and tried to get signed and eventually got a little bit of

230
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:29.890
interest.
We got turned down by every label indie and major there was,

231
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.590
but eventually we worked our way into Warner brothers.

232
00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:36.460
We kind of convinced them that we could like do almost like a demo deal and make

233
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:39.820
some stuff and if they liked that they continue on and we continue on with them.

234
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.910
Is it demo deal,
like a Spec deal where you basically yeah,

235
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:44.950
it's like a Spec kind of situation you may need,

236
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.840
let's put you in the studio and depending on how it's going,

237
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.040
it's a development thing.

238
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:53.620
It's something that they don't do a lot of anymore because they don't have the

239
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:54.161
budget.

240
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:59.161
I think like everything is so tight now because sales album sales are so much

241
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.960
smaller than they used to be.

242
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:06.340
They tend not to develop artists in this way anymore,
but with us,
to be honest,

243
00:14:06.341 --> 00:14:08.530
there wasn't a lot of,
a ton of developing the do.

244
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:13.360
We kind of were developing on our own and in the midst of it because of a

245
00:14:13.361 --> 00:14:15.610
complicated relationship of like the,

246
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.480
the guy that had signed us with his boss and that person with their boss and

247
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.500
they were all kind of new Chester,
our singer was kind of new.

248
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.490
So there's a lot of turmoil and they were trying to,

249
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.790
they started getting nervous.
They started imagining scenarios like,

250
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:34.000
well this spans popular in that band is popular.
And they tell us things like,

251
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:36.560
well,
you guys need a gimmick.
You need,
um,

252
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.530
we want to dress Joe in a lab coat and the cowboy hat and chest.

253
00:14:40.531 --> 00:14:45.270
But you should like kick a shoe off at every,
every,
every show like stupid,

254
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.340
stupid record company stuff that almost sounds like something out of a movie

255
00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:51.620
like spinal tap.
Right.
But it was absolutely true.

256
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:53.990
And in these were real suggestions,
like if you went back,

257
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.290
I imagine that you'd say them to somebody these days in the week.
Oh No,

258
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:00.400
I was totally joking.
I assure you they were not joking.

259
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.890
We were sitting in the room and they were literally ready to buy Joe a lab coat

260
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.410
and like beakers and put them in front of his turntables.
Um,

261
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:09.411
so yeah,
so,

262
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:12.650
so we got to that point and we were making the album and we were doing what we

263
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:16.970
wanted to do and got about halfway there and they tried to like run away with

264
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:19.540
the whole thing and change everything they wanted to,
you know,

265
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.140
basically kicked me out of the band.

266
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:25.250
They're talking to Chester and I telling him,
you're the star you need,

267
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:26.570
we need to do it this way.
And he's saying,

268
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:28.310
but this is like Mike span and he's like,

269
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:31.370
I've only been in the band for a few months.
What do you want me to do?

270
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:34.620
Like this is,
I think it's,
I think it's great.
And then we talk,

271
00:15:34.621 --> 00:15:37.520
we all talked as a band and basically stood up to these guys and said,

272
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:39.860
you can either,
you know,
shelf us,

273
00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:44.120
which effectively means they'd be putting us in record label limbo for the rest

274
00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:44.511
of our career.

275
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:49.511
We'd never put out a record or they can just accept that this is who we are and

276
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.460
let us make the album we wanted to make.

277
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.710
<v 0>That's a ballsy move I made.
It's it panned out,
but like you said,</v>

278
00:15:55.711 --> 00:16:00.711
it's the worst case scenario in that particular case isn't that they say no and

279
00:16:01.861 --> 00:16:05.340
then you're able to walk off freely with everything that you had.

280
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.950
I'd imagine at that point,
like you said,

281
00:16:07.951 --> 00:16:12.240
you ran the risk of being prevented from doing things elsewhere if you walked.

282
00:16:12.241 --> 00:16:14.850
I don't know if he had any sort of contractual obligations at that point,

283
00:16:14.851 --> 00:16:15.390
but it's been,

284
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:19.440
it's been very challenging for me working with a television over the last year

285
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.180
and producing episodes.

286
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:26.300
Having this division at Turner effectively get shut down and having the content

287
00:16:26.431 --> 00:16:30.180
stuck in this limbo space where,
well you can't free it.

288
00:16:30.181 --> 00:16:31.740
It's just kind of in a holding pen.

289
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:37.310
It's been super challenging it with when the record Lib will realize that they

290
00:16:37.381 --> 00:16:40.290
had something,
it could be hot or that was becoming very hot.

291
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.030
What were the indications?

292
00:16:42.031 --> 00:16:45.900
Did they take the music and present it to a test audience?

293
00:16:45.901 --> 00:16:50.790
Did they hear it internally and simply decide as a group that they liked the

294
00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:53.340
sound and therefore wanted to put some muscle behind it.

295
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.970
What were the indications that got them excited

296
00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.151
<v 3>at that time?</v>

297
00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:03.100
Especially that was our first album came out at a time when,

298
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.750
if we played a show,

299
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:09.420
we would put out a mailing list that at the merchandise table,
right,

300
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.460
we'd have a couple of,
we'd have a shirt,

301
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.850
our EDP and some stickers and we put out a mailing list.

302
00:17:15.851 --> 00:17:17.380
If you like the band,
put it,
you know,

303
00:17:17.381 --> 00:17:19.900
put your info down and we'll come back and we'll contact you.

304
00:17:19.901 --> 00:17:22.780
Maybe we'll send you some stuff.
Maybe next time we play we'll contact you.

305
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.940
People didn't even have 50% of the people signed up with their snail mail

306
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.780
address because they didn't have email yet.
So as you can imagine,

307
00:17:31.781 --> 00:17:36.040
like the MP three wasn't a problem for record labels yet.

308
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.520
We signed at a time when they were operating in a very old school manner and,

309
00:17:42.031 --> 00:17:42.910
and it was,
you know,

310
00:17:42.911 --> 00:17:47.860
so when our album rather our first single one step closer ever came out,

311
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.740
it was,
you know,
it's what like,

312
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:52.560
it's like a classic record label kind of attitude.

313
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.610
Like they throw it out there and see if it sticks.
And if they catch some,

314
00:17:56.611 --> 00:17:59.700
you know,
some interest in it by the radio stations,
then they,

315
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.070
they go a little harder and they go a little harder.

316
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:04.920
It was that there's no testing per se.
They just kind of,

317
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.960
the only testing is like,
we'll put it,
you know,

318
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:11.961
see if we can get the djs and the programmers to put it on the air and then see

319
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:15.370
who's like,
what the response is and called whatever.
The other thing is though,

320
00:18:15.371 --> 00:18:18.450
at meanwhile we were out touring really,

321
00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:22.680
really hard playing maybe five shows a week,
sometimes six.

322
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.670
We were in an RV because we didn't,
we would've been in a van,
we didn't,
we could,

323
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:29.130
we didn't fit in a van because there's six of us with our gear.

324
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:32.370
We have a drum set.
And in Dj rig that was the size of a refrigerator.

325
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.290
So we couldn't fit all of our stuff in a,

326
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:39.720
in a van and I was driving probably more than half the time.

327
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.470
Um,
you know,
you get off stage like you played,

328
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.510
we may have played like 20 minutes,
get off stage,

329
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:51.260
clean up all of our stuff in a hurry,
put it all in the trailer and then draw.

330
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.200
I would be driving,
you know,
half the night to get to the next venue is pretty,

331
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.730
pretty rough.
But you know,

332
00:18:56.731 --> 00:19:01.731
I know that we were boots on the ground like talking to fans in person and,

333
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.590
and you know,
managing our own,
the presentation of who we are,

334
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.840
the introduction,
like this is what our band is about.

335
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:11.160
We were doing that face to face.

336
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.840
<v 4>So you were able to sort of refine not only how you communicate that defends,</v>

337
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.940
but I would imagine that helps you think through a lot.

338
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.300
There was a really funny story.
When we first sign the label,

339
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.380
<v 3>we told the guy that was representing us,
we told them,
hey,
you know,</v>

340
00:19:30.381 --> 00:19:34.670
can you get as many people as possible from who might be working on our stuff?

341
00:19:34.671 --> 00:19:38.630
So mainly the rock department,
but whoever at the label wants to come,

342
00:19:38.631 --> 00:19:41.750
we'd like to have a meeting at the,
at their,
you know,

343
00:19:41.751 --> 00:19:44.810
in their building and introduce ourselves.
And he said,
yeah,
okay,

344
00:19:44.811 --> 00:19:45.644
I'll set that up.

345
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.101
<v 4>Keep in mind,</v>

346
00:19:47.101 --> 00:19:52.101
we were about 19 and we requested this meeting with whoever,

347
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:57.030
everybody from the label and they show up and they're roughly,

348
00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.410
they're like between 25 and like 45 years old with like,

349
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:02.340
you know,

350
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.990
probably an average of 15 to 2015 years of experience in the music industry.

351
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.440
Okay.
And we go in,
you know,

352
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.500
looking the way we did and our first album me with probably like red hair and

353
00:20:15.511 --> 00:20:18.810
Chester with the tattoos and piercings in his lip and whatever.

354
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.200
And we go in with an outline of what we are going to discuss with them.

355
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.520
Like they're going to come in and we're going to tell them how to do,

356
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:34.270
how to work our,
Ben,
let me just tell you what we're about.

357
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.260
Let me tell you how it goes with Lincoln Park,
the instruction,

358
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.940
the instruction manual.
It was so absurd.
I couldn't believe like in retrospect,

359
00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:44.040
I can't believe they didn't just kick us out of the building.

360
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.280
I think that it was like humorous to some of them that this band had the balls

361
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.710
<v 3>to just walk in and like tell them how to do their job.</v>

362
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.590
And clearly we were way out of line.
But at the same time,
you know,

363
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.620
I think they admired the attitude of the group and by the way,

364
00:20:59.621 --> 00:21:04.150
they knew that we were very sincere about this deep connection that we were

365
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.970
building with our,
with our fans from day one.

366
00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:12.460
<v 0>How do you think about putting yourself in the shoes of say a new musician now?</v>

367
00:21:12.691 --> 00:21:16.410
So you mentioned the,
the lab coat shenanigans and people trying to get,

368
00:21:16.411 --> 00:21:18.030
trying to get you to adopt a shtick.

369
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:22.200
And I've dealt with a lot of large companies in a number of worlds.

370
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.980
When large groups of those folks try to have creative meetings,

371
00:21:25.981 --> 00:21:29.440
they tend to sort of create a camel,
which is,
you know,

372
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.660
a horse designed by committee and it just ends up being ridiculous and a lot of,

373
00:21:33.661 --> 00:21:37.380
I would imagine a lot of people succumb to that and allow things to change to

374
00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:41.250
their band or their book or whatever that they really shouldn't to someone

375
00:21:41.251 --> 00:21:42.930
coming up now,
sort of like the,
uh,

376
00:21:42.931 --> 00:21:46.590
the actual rose getting off the bus and welcome to the jungle.
Right.

377
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.530
Someone who was very sincere about,
let's say their music,

378
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.680
but who wants to have a commercially viable career,
what would,

379
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.380
what would your advice to them be in this day and age?

380
00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:00.700
<v 3>I would say,
um,
for one thing,
you know,
there are a lot of similarities,</v>

381
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.430
whether you're in,
in any creative medium,

382
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:08.580
whether you're an author or a filmmaker or a musician,

383
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:13.600
there are going to be situations that are not the obvious ones where somebody

384
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.520
comes in and literally wants to just like turn your thing into a,
you know,

385
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.790
commercial.
Obviously like,
like watered down commercial nightmare.

386
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.550
There's subtle,
it's,
it's really more about those,

387
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:29.440
those are easy to pinpoint and say,
okay,
that's absurd.
Like lab coat,
lab coat,

388
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.820
you know,
scientists.
Gimmick is absurd.
No Way.
Right?
But it's more about like,

389
00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:36.160
I think it's more about the subtle ones,
you know,

390
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.970
because even if they're not trying to be manipulative,

391
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.230
a lot of times your partners,
their priorities and their,

392
00:22:44.231 --> 00:22:48.370
their goals are not completely aligned with yours.
You know?

393
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.490
And that doesn't mean they're bad.
We had,

394
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.300
it's taken us a long time to learn that,
you know,
as a band because you know,

395
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.470
record labels had,

396
00:22:56.471 --> 00:23:00.910
gets such a bad reputation as it is just being sleazy,
you know,

397
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:05.380
corrupt organizations and you know,
they to some degree they deserve that.

398
00:23:05.381 --> 00:23:06.730
And to some degree they don't,
you know,

399
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:11.140
not everybody at a label is trying to scam all the artists and sometimes they're

400
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:15.010
doing what they genuinely think is best and they just don't,

401
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.820
it's not in line with what the artist thinks is best.
So that's,

402
00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:21.820
those are the things to look out for because it can be very convincing and it

403
00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:23.920
can be very subtle and it could not,
you know,

404
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.310
be a grade a mistake.

405
00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:31.810
It could be like a minor level mistake that over time,
you know,

406
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:35.350
10 of those adds up to something catastrophic.
So for example,

407
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.430
in a situation like,
uh,
I think,

408
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.180
have we talked before about that with books where an editor like subtly you'll,

409
00:23:43.181 --> 00:23:46.040
you'll be writing something,
an editor might subtly change a few

410
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.210
<v 2>words and then another pass,</v>

411
00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:50.210
they subtly change a few more words and change and all of a sudden you're

412
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:54.350
looking at it and you might go back and compare it to the draft before they ever

413
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:55.850
got their hands on it and you go,
Whoa,

414
00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:01.060
they completely changed the tone of my chapter or my story or what my point was.

415
00:24:01.401 --> 00:24:03.560
And so on.
And it happens over time.

416
00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:06.440
And at that point you've kind of committed to a thing.
So that's,

417
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.910
<v 0>yeah.
And not,
not to digress too far,
but the,</v>

418
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:14.970
he just brings to mind some of the lyrics from one of your fort minor songs,

419
00:24:15.631 --> 00:24:19.350
which is,
you know,
only doing print interviews via email.

420
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.540
And that's not of course the,
the,
that's not verbatim,
but I'm paraphrasing,
right?

421
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.500
Cause the dealing with journalists,
it's,

422
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.680
it's amazing how just a single word replacement can change the entire tone.

423
00:24:32.131 --> 00:24:36.180
It can take you from saying something that could be interpreted as profound to

424
00:24:36.181 --> 00:24:40.890
completely absurd and stupid with,
with one replacement.
So,
yeah,

425
00:24:40.891 --> 00:24:42.510
you really have to have a fine tuned.

426
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.890
<v 2>Yes.
Context is everything.
I love to do print.
Uh,</v>

427
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.930
I love to type my print interviews if it's possible.

428
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:54.070
Luckily these days I feel like with social media being as powerful,

429
00:24:54.071 --> 00:24:57.700
it is as it is,
you know,
for you and I,
you know,

430
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:02.730
if we're in a situation where somebody prints something that they've edited or

431
00:25:03.011 --> 00:25:07.720
changed substantially,
we can go out there to the fans and say,
hey,

432
00:25:07.721 --> 00:25:11.710
you guys,
this was not correct and this is how it actually went down.

433
00:25:11.711 --> 00:25:16.210
This is how I feel,
which has to happen once in a while.
But you know it's,
again,

434
00:25:16.211 --> 00:25:19.120
it's like I don't feel like necessarily the people are being deceitful.

435
00:25:19.121 --> 00:25:23.200
It's just realizing that like everybody's got their own agenda in different and

436
00:25:23.201 --> 00:25:24.390
they have to a magazine

437
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:25.261
<v 4>doing it,</v>

438
00:25:25.261 --> 00:25:29.070
but like I'm even a music magazine is not interviewing you because they love

439
00:25:29.071 --> 00:25:32.730
music.
Right.
They that's not necessary.
That's not their,

440
00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:35.130
their day to day is we need ad dollars.

441
00:25:35.131 --> 00:25:39.210
We need click through like whatever it is that's going to get us that and if you

442
00:25:39.211 --> 00:25:40.044
say,

443
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:45.260
if you have a 40 word sentence that chopped down to seven is really titillating

444
00:25:46.861 --> 00:25:49.290
and interesting and we'll definitely make people click,

445
00:25:49.291 --> 00:25:51.240
but it has nothing to do with anything you ever,

446
00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.250
you said in your interview it's just clickbait.

447
00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.340
They'll absolutely go for that because that's what they're,

448
00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.810
that's what their business is built on.

449
00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:58.320
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

450
00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.170
It's important when I'm talking to people just getting ready or they're so they

451
00:26:02.171 --> 00:26:03.250
have something taking off.

452
00:26:03.251 --> 00:26:08.050
Usually it's a book coaching them on how to approach this stuff,

453
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.240
but on the creative side of things,

454
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.050
how has your songwriting process changed over time?

455
00:26:14.051 --> 00:26:18.520
If it has and it was it different or is it different for say Lincoln Park versus

456
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.383
Fort Minor?

457
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:24.380
<v 4>Well,
our,
our processes at the end of the day,
it's pretty democratic,</v>

458
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.000
but it's rooted in an individual inspiration and craftsmanship.

459
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:31.630
So when a song starts,
usually I'm,

460
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.310
I usually start most of the songs it will,

461
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:38.090
sometimes it will be a very fleshed out,
better music.

462
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.500
Sometimes it'll just be a core progression on piano or guitar with some vocals

463
00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:44.010
on it.
Those two

464
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.500
<v 3>things are very different from one another.</v>

465
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.640
<v 0>Could you explain it just as a non musician?</v>

466
00:26:47.641 --> 00:26:49.380
I'd love to hear why those are so different.

467
00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.150
<v 3>So first of all,
just from the outside,</v>

468
00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.280
if you don't know anything about our recording music,

469
00:26:54.281 --> 00:26:59.281
it bears mentioning that there's lots of ways to make music and a lot of

470
00:26:59.621 --> 00:27:02.080
different genres.
I'd say first of all,

471
00:27:02.081 --> 00:27:06.640
a lot of different genres have different approaches kind of built in that are

472
00:27:06.641 --> 00:27:08.890
not similar to one another.
So for example,

473
00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.970
a producer in Iraq for a rock band is a person that comes in.

474
00:27:12.971 --> 00:27:15.580
The rock band is writing all of the music and the lyrics.

475
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.870
The producers kind of helping them make decisions and help sculpt the sound of

476
00:27:19.871 --> 00:27:22.400
the album and they all work together,
but then,

477
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.990
but the musicians in the band are really making the song and the producers kind

478
00:27:25.991 --> 00:27:28.600
of their coach in hip hop,

479
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:33.250
a producer does the whole track.
All of the music probably makes the hook.

480
00:27:33.251 --> 00:27:37.840
The chorus makes basically everything except for the wrap versus the rapper

481
00:27:37.841 --> 00:27:41.020
comes in and wraps on it and then the producer will make all the mixing and

482
00:27:41.021 --> 00:27:45.490
finishing choices as well,
so they do a lot more in that genre.

483
00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.130
Then Rock,
when we make an album,

484
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.160
it generally takes about nine months from start to finish to make the album.

485
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:57.310
In contrast,
when we were making this most when we're making the hunting party,

486
00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:02.640
next door to us was a world renowned pop singers session and this person came

487
00:28:04.031 --> 00:28:04.480
in,

488
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.770
their producers were there for a few days before they showed up and this person

489
00:28:08.771 --> 00:28:12.790
showed up on day one and they were there for about 15 minutes.
On Day two,

490
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:14.560
they showed up for less than 15 minutes.

491
00:28:14.561 --> 00:28:16.870
And on day three they neglected to show up at all.

492
00:28:16.871 --> 00:28:18.190
And the song was actually done.

493
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.520
And I was talking to their people going like,
how is this even possible?
That all,

494
00:28:23.521 --> 00:28:26.950
you know,
it was like,
we do this,
we do that.
And I'm just like,
this is crazy.

495
00:28:26.951 --> 00:28:31.240
You know,
I,
I don't even as an art,
as a,
as a songwriter,
an artist,

496
00:28:31.241 --> 00:28:34.240
like I've definitely relate more to the producers on that track,

497
00:28:34.241 --> 00:28:37.180
then the person who sings it.
But I don't,

498
00:28:37.181 --> 00:28:41.080
I don't even if I know if I'd be able to call myself an artist personally,

499
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.460
if I was the one just showing up for,
you know,

500
00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.580
say 25 minutes and the song was done,
but also because that's,
you know,

501
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.260
my interest and my skill set and whatever.
That's what I love to do.

502
00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:52.480
So with all that said,
you know,

503
00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.770
I want to master as many versions of making a song as I can.

504
00:28:56.771 --> 00:29:00.040
So every time we go into the studio,
I try different approaches.

505
00:29:00.041 --> 00:29:02.470
I've tried approaches that come from,
you know,

506
00:29:02.471 --> 00:29:06.460
folk riding and rock and pop and hip hop and whatever,
like whatever.

507
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.370
If it's something I haven't tried before.
That sounds interesting.

508
00:29:09.371 --> 00:29:10.690
I might take that approach

509
00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.710
<v 0>and w with with say hiphop specifically and again I don't know any of these</v>

510
00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:18.100
people personally that you've collaborated with sate Jz and if I'm curious in

511
00:29:18.101 --> 00:29:21.190
your particular approach,
but much like the sort of Youtube,

512
00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:26.850
a story I've heard the Jay Z is very famous for improvising and at one point

513
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.290
just to appease some record executive pretended to be,

514
00:29:29.291 --> 00:29:33.220
we're taking notes and it was actually improvising lyrics in the studio.

515
00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.840
What is your approach with say hip hop specifically?

516
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.980
How much of your time is spent writing versus

517
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.250
<v 4>improvising in the studio and what is your writing process look like?</v>

518
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.800
So if it's on the shorter end of the song,

519
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:52.801
just kind of like let's say a song appears and it's just magically great and in

520
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:59.230
a matter of a couple of weeks it goes from the first notes played to something

521
00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:00.310
that just sounds awesome.

522
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:05.760
Usually in those cases it's because the melody and the melody of the music and

523
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:11.281
the vocals have kind of arrived at the same time or similar time in a rap song

524
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.750
are my off of the fort minor album,
the song,
where'd you go?
Came up that way.

525
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:20.680
It was like I was playing the piano part,
I sang in the chorus.
I said that's,

526
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.470
that's what the song is.
I put a drum beat to it.

527
00:30:23.471 --> 00:30:25.150
I wrote the lyrics to it and it was done.

528
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.070
It was really just a couple of weeks similarly on Lincoln Park Song called

529
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:31.660
breaking the habit.
That one was,

530
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:36.661
I had like a beat looping and then I was playing keyboard over it and um,

531
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.300
it was like a string thing and,
and I added some,

532
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.330
I was singing vocals over it and the whole chorus was there.

533
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.290
The melody of the verse was there and that was like within an hour.

534
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.240
I knew there was something to that song.

535
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.600
There are other songs that we've done where they take a lot of work.

536
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:56.170
I mean over the course of nine months they might,
you know,

537
00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:01.320
come closer to sounding done and then B,
start to get boring or you know,

538
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.040
start to materialize and then fall apart once you add something.
There was a,

539
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.520
the new,
our newest,
uh,

540
00:31:06.521 --> 00:31:11.050
we're about to put out a single called final masquerade and file masquerade as a

541
00:31:11.051 --> 00:31:15.100
song that early on the chorus,
the Co,
the chords of the song,

542
00:31:15.101 --> 00:31:19.330
like the Piano Chords of the song and the vocal.

543
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.540
We're there from an early point and,
and I,

544
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:25.010
and I knew listening to the chorus of the song and the,

545
00:31:25.011 --> 00:31:27.970
and the progression and the verse,
that Song is going to be really good.

546
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.460
I really liked it.
At the time though,

547
00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:34.630
we were deciding the arrangement of the song,
which means like what other,

548
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:37.570
what do the other instruments play,
what other instruments are on it?

549
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.370
And one of the main things that was a make or break element was the drum
pattern.

550
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.340
At the time when I wrote it,
there were no drums.
And so I kept,

551
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:49.120
I kept putting different things over.
I put programmed loops,

552
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.220
I'd write live loops.

553
00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:55.450
I kept trying all these things on it faster and slower tempos and all this stuff

554
00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.523
and it just,

555
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.410
every time I put something on and I could just tell it was kind of ruining the

556
00:31:59.411 --> 00:32:02.740
song,
it just wasn't very good.
It was like a a,
B or a B plus.

557
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.810
And I knew the song had potential,
it'd be really great.

558
00:32:04.811 --> 00:32:09.610
So it did take us a long time to just stumble upon the right thing.

559
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:12.130
And it was a time when I was in the studio with our drummer,

560
00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:15.130
rob and I had already kind of picked the tempo and I had said,

561
00:32:15.131 --> 00:32:19.340
what if we do like a halftime kind of almost like a more of a hip hop or classic

562
00:32:19.341 --> 00:32:23.650
groc like Groove,
a drum loop type of thing.
And,
and um,

563
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.140
I don't remember what the reference points might have been or whatever,

564
00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:28.360
but the main thing was that we just,
you know,
rob,
I said,

565
00:32:28.361 --> 00:32:32.100
just play and as you play,
I'm going to like give you,
you know,

566
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.990
suggestions about where the hits might be or whatever.

567
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.360
And it immediately started coming together.

568
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:39.820
It was like within a few minutes you could tell this is,
um,

569
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.510
this is the best group for this song.
It's,
it's totally making the song better.

570
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:50.310
<v 0>What activities outside of music have had the greatest positive impact on your</v>

571
00:32:51.821 --> 00:32:55.720
music?
They're not directly musically related and that's,
I'll leave that broad,

572
00:32:55.721 --> 00:33:00.070
but I'm just,
any activities,
books,
inspirations?
Well,
you know,

573
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.001
<v 4>I mean,
you know,</v>

574
00:33:01.001 --> 00:33:05.890
from our conversations that I love experimenting with new toys,

575
00:33:05.891 --> 00:33:10.570
new technology.
Um,
I love reading.
I tend not to read a lot of fiction.

576
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:15.460
Um,
I've read your books.
I love books like the tipping point and blink,

577
00:33:15.461 --> 00:33:17.650
et Cetera as well.
Um,

578
00:33:17.651 --> 00:33:21.030
one book that I read that speaks to this,
the answer,

579
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:25.990
this question is a book called category of one by Joe Calloway.

580
00:33:25.991 --> 00:33:30.760
And it's about,
you know,
finding ways to make what you do stand out.

581
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.560
<v 0>Got It.</v>

582
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.320
<v 4>It's a really nice,
it's a really nice book.
Um,</v>

583
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:38.570
there's a lot of great information in there and one of the things that he

584
00:33:38.571 --> 00:33:42.230
stresses is,
is to benchmark what you do,

585
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.370
not against your immediate peers or your immediate competition,

586
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:48.410
even in your category,

587
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.820
but compare it to things that have nothing to do with your thing.
It doesn't,

588
00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:56.540
if you're a a music maker,
there's no reason you shouldn't say,
well,

589
00:33:56.541 --> 00:34:00.440
can I get great ideas from people who make cars,
people who make shoes,

590
00:34:00.441 --> 00:34:04.610
people who make apps,
people who make,
you know,
cooking utensils,

591
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.160
whatever it may be.
There,

592
00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:11.220
you could have a great idea based on something that's so foreign to your thing.

593
00:34:11.311 --> 00:34:15.680
So with that said,
like I've been getting into things that really excite me,

594
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:19.640
but I don't know what,
how they might,
you know,
inform what I do.

595
00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:20.570
It may be musical,

596
00:34:20.571 --> 00:34:24.650
it may be kind of like the visual aspect of how we present our music.

597
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:27.890
But I love three printing.
And,
uh,

598
00:34:27.891 --> 00:34:32.720
I most recently got into I fleet printing three d three d printing,

599
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:36.200
three d printing.
Um,
and I,

600
00:34:36.201 --> 00:34:40.560
most recently my wife actually got me for our anniversary.
She got me,
um,
uh,

601
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:45.680
like a camera,
camera,
drone,
quad copter.
It's by Dji,

602
00:34:45.681 --> 00:34:47.750
it's called a phantom vision plus.

603
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:51.110
And I've been playing with that lately and that one's actually really,
the,

604
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.780
the connection for me is just really easy.
It's like I love,

605
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.570
first of all it's just really relaxing to do.
But second,

606
00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.390
I'm filming stuff with this drone and I filmed like our,

607
00:34:59.391 --> 00:35:02.900
I'll film our rehearsals are all film stuff as we travel and stuff.

608
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.320
And that stuff is just really,
it's just fun to do.

609
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:08.790
<v 0>You've constantly experimented with technology.</v>

610
00:35:08.791 --> 00:35:10.560
That's part of the reason that we bonded.

611
00:35:10.561 --> 00:35:14.220
And I thought that blog World Expo be fun when we initially met.

612
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.580
One thing that is constantly on my mind is related to sort of routines and

613
00:35:19.591 --> 00:35:23.220
habits of people who are highly effective.
And you are,

614
00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:27.390
I guess right now as we speak,
getting ready to,
is it rehearsal record?

615
00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.500
<v 4>Oh,
we're rehearsing right now.
We,
we are,
um,</v>

616
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:35.530
going out on a US tour with 30 seconds to Mars and Afi.

617
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.880
It's called the carnivores tour and we'll be out from August to September,

618
00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:43.230
about six weeks.
Got It.
So as we speak,
it's about noon where you are,

619
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.990
what have you found for yourself?

620
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:51.020
What can you do to facilitate flow or sort of peak performance for yourself,

621
00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:55.830
whether that's timing wise,
routines or rituals that you have.

622
00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.440
What have you discovered personally?
One thing that I,

623
00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:01.940
and I believe that by the way,

624
00:36:01.941 --> 00:36:06.410
Kudos to you because one of the ideas from,

625
00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:11.180
I think you're,
I think it was from the four hour workweek that occurred to me,

626
00:36:11.181 --> 00:36:14.180
I don't know if it was because it was literally in the book or just the book

627
00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:17.540
kind of inspired this thought.
Just in a broad sense,

628
00:36:17.541 --> 00:36:22.541
looking at the things that you do every day that actually are making you better

629
00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.440
or whatever that might mean and the things that you need versus the things you

630
00:36:27.441 --> 00:36:29.270
don't really need.
That could be in your,

631
00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.960
the way you handle your email is it could be the,

632
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.540
the things that you choose to read up on,

633
00:36:35.541 --> 00:36:38.960
on your computer or iPad or whatever before you,
you know,

634
00:36:38.961 --> 00:36:43.280
when you're not working your workflow during while you're working or even like

635
00:36:43.281 --> 00:36:45.110
the things you choose to do when you're not.
Like,

636
00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.660
is it making you the way you eat,

637
00:36:47.661 --> 00:36:51.440
is that affecting how you feel during the day to do your work or your creative

638
00:36:51.441 --> 00:36:55.130
stuff or have fun and all of that?
I mean,
I find that for myself personally,

639
00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.460
I don't watch,
I barely watch any TV.

640
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:04.100
I watch almost no TV.
Um,
I do love movies.
I love going out to movies.

641
00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:04.720
Um,

642
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:09.620
I find it a more like inspiring and rewarding experience than television for

643
00:37:09.621 --> 00:37:11.930
some reason.
A lot of TV.
Um,
you know,

644
00:37:11.931 --> 00:37:14.780
barring the like more series based stuff.

645
00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:19.780
Like I love Netflix as well and I love like a house of cards for the same

646
00:37:20.781 --> 00:37:24.440
reason.
I love going to films,
you know,
and I stay away from,

647
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:29.450
I'm not getting anything out of cooking shows and like singing competitions and

648
00:37:29.571 --> 00:37:31.730
crap like that.
Like this,
especially the,

649
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
the reality shows like really I feel like I've totally wasted my time at the end

650
00:37:38.121 --> 00:37:39.830
of watching one or two of those.

651
00:37:39.831 --> 00:37:44.730
So that's like something for me that I just like I started just removing from
my,

652
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:49.490
my schedule.
Um,
what,
another thing that I always tell my wife that she's really,

653
00:37:49.491 --> 00:37:50.930
she's really working on and I,

654
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.850
I think a lot of us have a tendency to like really want to respond to every

655
00:37:55.851 --> 00:38:00.851
email and expect responses from every email and that's just unnecessary.

656
00:38:01.881 --> 00:38:03.200
I feel everyone I work with,

657
00:38:03.201 --> 00:38:07.190
all my friends know that given the opportunity to not respond to an email,

658
00:38:07.191 --> 00:38:11.540
I will take it.
I will delete it at the answer is yes.
Cool.

659
00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.550
I would sooner delete the email
if your answer is going to be yes.

660
00:38:16.551 --> 00:38:20.720
Cool.
Yeah.
If it's going to be okay or I hear you or whatever.

661
00:38:20.721 --> 00:38:23.750
Let's assume I got this email and we're good.
I don't,

662
00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:28.550
unless I have something to say,
you know,
substance,
substance.

663
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.680
If it's substantive,
I will respond.
If it is substance,
I will usually spend it.

664
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.010
If I really feel like I have something

665
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.460
<v 3>to offer,
my emails will be,
you know,
they tend to be a little longer,</v>

666
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:41.950
they tend to have a lot of information in them.
Um,

667
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.650
so you'll either get no email or you're get something a little.

668
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:47.720
Um,
yeah,
but I,

669
00:38:47.721 --> 00:38:52.390
I do that because I don't like to have like 150 emails in my inbox and I also

670
00:38:52.391 --> 00:38:55.240
don't think like every time you send an email out,
I mean,
I've seen,

671
00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.990
we've all seen threads where you've got five people on the,

672
00:38:58.991 --> 00:39:02.590
on the email and all of them are responding.
Okay,
cool.
Yeah.
Great.
See you then.

673
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:05.890
It's like,
I don't want 15 emails saying,
okay,
cool.

674
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.190
Yeah,
it's stressful.
It's very stressful.
The uh,

675
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.170
the rehearsal itself that you're going to be going into,

676
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:19.200
what have you arrived at is your format for rehearsing?

677
00:39:19.271 --> 00:39:23.290
What does that look like?
What's the template every band will be,

678
00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.590
is every artist does is totally different when it comes to her saying,

679
00:39:26.591 --> 00:39:29.890
I've heard that some groups just get together and they just jam and just play

680
00:39:29.891 --> 00:39:33.970
whatever you guys as artists is the opposite.
We,

681
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:37.900
as you could probably imagine,
um,
we actually,

682
00:39:37.901 --> 00:39:41.640
because we have six guys in the band and everybody's pretty much got,
you know,

683
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.030
families and other stuff going on.
We set up rehearsals in a way that you,

684
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:50.950
we start with just the most basic people who are needed on certain tracks.

685
00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:52.420
So let's say we're right now,

686
00:39:52.421 --> 00:39:56.610
we're practicing up two new songs for this upcoming tour that we've,

687
00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:00.390
we haven't played in front of people before and we'll start those.
There were,

688
00:40:00.391 --> 00:40:05.391
her first day of rehearsal would be with just maybe our guitarist and I and our

689
00:40:06.011 --> 00:40:10.510
basis than our drummer might just be the four of us.
And then then we'll add Joe,

690
00:40:10.511 --> 00:40:13.630
our Dj,
and then we'll add Chester.
There's no reason for chest to,

691
00:40:13.631 --> 00:40:16.260
to come in and sing if the music's not tight.
Right.

692
00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:20.930
So Chester gets a day or even two days off from rehearsal because of that.
It's,

693
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.210
it's rougher on,
you know,
especially like the instrumentalists,
it's more time.

694
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:28.630
But in the big picture it's all a wash because you know,

695
00:40:28.631 --> 00:40:32.260
wild Chester isn't in here rehearsing on these days.
He's always,

696
00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:36.190
he and I are always requested when it comes to interviews,
you know what I mean?

697
00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:37.540
So,
so there's a balance,

698
00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:41.110
a nice balance of things you and whenever somebody is not totally needed for

699
00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:46.000
something,
we,
we kind of remove them from the situation.
And,
um,
also just,
uh,

700
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.540
just,
uh,
for,
for anybody,
for the techie people listening,

701
00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:54.810
one of the things we do that to make those rehearsals extra focused,

702
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.820
we actually have everything tracked out,

703
00:40:57.821 --> 00:41:02.821
all of the instrumentals from the studio recordings in the computer and we play,

704
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:07.810
we'll unmute anybody who's not there.
So if Chester's not hear,

705
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:11.200
his voice will actually still be coming through the speakers because it's coming

706
00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:15.640
off the,
out of the computer.
So we use those strictly as practice tracks.

707
00:41:15.641 --> 00:41:17.020
And then of course we don't use them live,

708
00:41:17.021 --> 00:41:19.840
but we have those around so that we know,
you know,

709
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:24.130
and we can reference them to like,
oh,
hey,
you know,
Brad,
I think that this note,

710
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.230
this transition between the verse and the chorus,

711
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.650
it's actually these notes and we can listen to the album version.
Say,
Oh yeah,

712
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:32.350
that is what I played.
Um,
and then you know,

713
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:38.020
Mike is wrong or Mike is or whatever it may be.
Um,
and and yeah,
so that's,

714
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.630
that's actually a part of our,
not only our,
our,

715
00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:45.920
the way we rehearsed but the way we just operate on stage as technology has

716
00:41:45.921 --> 00:41:50.120
gotten as music performance technology has gotten more advanced,

717
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:53.180
it's actually allowed us to be a better live band.

718
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.610
<v 0>That's cool.
Yeah,
exactly.</v>

719
00:41:55.611 --> 00:41:59.600
A worth technology can augment and not necessarily replace performances.

720
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.670
I think that's something that's often overlooked.

721
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:03.710
Just for my own personal curiosity,

722
00:42:03.711 --> 00:42:07.940
what software do you use for that type of tracking?

723
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.060
<v 3>We use a ton of different things on stage.</v>

724
00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:14.690
The main thing that I was talking about about like the performance stuff is in

725
00:42:14.691 --> 00:42:15.710
Ableton live.

726
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.890
Ableton's great because you can actually let,

727
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.880
let's say if you imagine like in your iTunes library or whatever,

728
00:42:22.881 --> 00:42:26.330
you've got to track and you can play it fast forward or rewind Ableton.

729
00:42:26.331 --> 00:42:29.390
You actually can throw it in,
you can slow it down,
speed it up,

730
00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.330
pitch it if you wanted to modulate the pitch,

731
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:36.170
you can mash it up with other things and so on.
So you know,

732
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:37.910
if we won some of the tracks,

733
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:41.600
like we have a song called guilty all the same and when we first started playing

734
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:46.550
it we wanted to practice it slower so that we could get tight and then move to

735
00:42:46.551 --> 00:42:48.940
get it faster and faster.
So we actually just turn,

736
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.380
turn the tempo down a little bit in the computer,

737
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.270
played back slowly and and you know,

738
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:56.870
10 years ago this would have been impossible or it would have at least taken

739
00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:01.310
hours for the computer to process that information and then you could do it.

740
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.120
Now you do it like on the fly,
right?
Instantaneous.

741
00:43:05.121 --> 00:43:07.520
You can do it and in fact you could do it as you're playing if you wanted to hit

742
00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:10.880
a certain spot and then slow down and you can do that.
You can loop spots.

743
00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:12.770
You know if you want to practice one spot over and over.

744
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:16.370
We actually have a part during the set.
We do run some stuff,

745
00:43:16.371 --> 00:43:18.710
some backing tracks when we play.

746
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.910
We try to be careful about that because we always want to be alive band first.

747
00:43:22.911 --> 00:43:26.960
It's not a scenario where I think everybody when they hear stuff like that,

748
00:43:26.961 --> 00:43:30.080
it's like you either wondering are their vocals and the track and whatever.

749
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.180
We try and stay away from all that.
Um,

750
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.930
generally it's like per cost of stuff and like be loops and things like that.

751
00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.420
Again,
10 years ago if we were doing that,

752
00:43:38.421 --> 00:43:42.230
if we were playing a song on stage and we had that running,
if you got off beat,

753
00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.680
you'd be screwed.
If you wanted to extend apart,
you couldn't do it right.

754
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:47.990
Do you want to slow down?
You couldn't do it.

755
00:43:47.991 --> 00:43:52.160
Now we can do all of those things on the fly.
If I walk,
if I decide,
hey,

756
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.230
let's get to this guitar Solo,
let's play,

757
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:57.230
let's have Brad played twice as long as that and played five times as long.

758
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.630
Any night of the week,
any show we can do that.

759
00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.990
<v 0>The Ableton rings a bell,
and I could be mistaken,</v>

760
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.120
and I'll double check this for people in the show notes,

761
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:10.040
but I think that is also the software that IRA glass host of this American life

762
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:14.210
uses when he's doing live speeches because he wants to recreate the feeling of

763
00:44:14.211 --> 00:44:19.211
one of his shows and so they'll have an iPad up and he'll actually call up

764
00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:22.160
different types of quotes and so forth.
Very cool.

765
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.760
<v 3>Yeah,
it's pretty,
it's pretty amazing stuff.
That's not the only thing we use.</v>

766
00:44:25.761 --> 00:44:30.170
I mean,
just so that it's clear,
like when I have a keyboard rig and I'm,

767
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.010
I'm mining software based,
I'm using a

768
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.190
<v 2>bunch of stuff by native instruments,
I'm using stuff by other makers.</v>

769
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.930
Joe Is actually running his completely off of a windows tablet,

770
00:44:39.931 --> 00:44:40.651
believe it or not,

771
00:44:40.651 --> 00:44:45.570
his real rig with a turntables and everything is actually the brain of that is

772
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:47.490
actually a windows tablet.
It's a surface.

773
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.430
<v 0>Wow.
That's so cool.
I love it.
I tell you what,</v>

774
00:44:50.431 --> 00:44:52.960
I want to be cognizant of your time and I know you have to practice,

775
00:44:52.961 --> 00:44:57.870
so I'd love to just do perhaps a couple of rapid fire questions if that works

776
00:44:57.871 --> 00:45:00.540
for you.
And then I'll let you get to make an making your music.

777
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.110
So the first question is,
you mentioned movies.

778
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.140
What are some of your favorite movies of all time and that could include

779
00:45:07.141 --> 00:45:10.620
documentaries,
non documentaries,
totally up to you.
I love,

780
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:14.370
<v 2>I think growing up I was really into the like some darker stuff,</v>

781
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:18.120
but usually kind of plot driven.
I always love the godfather movies.

782
00:45:18.121 --> 00:45:22.230
I loved the usual suspects.
I loved fight club and seven.

783
00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:25.230
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
I actually saw</v>

784
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.900
<v 2>club the other day and I haven't seen it in a number of years and it's still</v>

785
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.750
still such a great,
like the story.
The writing is just so great.
Yeah.

786
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:37.050
And then on the other side,
like being in an illustrator,

787
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.090
I was into Annie Mae,
like I love to Kira.
Um,
I,

788
00:45:41.091 --> 00:45:45.030
and I actually love a bunch of the Disney films.
Wally is awesome.
While.

789
00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:48.750
I mean what an one thing that always struck me about that is it's like you've

790
00:45:48.751 --> 00:45:52.200
got a movie that's more than half basically just score and visuals with no

791
00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:54.990
dialogue.
Oh,
it's an incredible,
an incredible feat.

792
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:58.730
<v 0>I've been researching screenplays recently and working on while myself and one</v>

793
00:45:58.731 --> 00:46:03.731
of the recommendations I heard was you should be able to turn off the sound and

794
00:46:04.101 --> 00:46:06.860
follow the movie.
Of course,
Wally is a perfect example of that,

795
00:46:06.861 --> 00:46:09.710
so even in a foreign film you should be able to follow the plot or a lot of the

796
00:46:09.711 --> 00:46:13.310
major plot points.
Turning off the sound Pixars amazing with stories.

797
00:46:13.311 --> 00:46:16.580
I'm actually hoping to have the president of Pixar on this podcast as well to

798
00:46:16.581 --> 00:46:20.960
dig into the stories because I think it's so systematic and amazing how they

799
00:46:20.961 --> 00:46:23.420
approach that.
Have you seen Ninja scroll before?

800
00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:27.780
I used to be sewn in to just scroll.
Let's just say school is amazing.
Yeah,

801
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.880
actually.

802
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.930
<v 2>And I think that our DJ Joe,</v>

803
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:36.040
he's Joe has directed most of our videos and he actually just directed a movie

804
00:46:36.871 --> 00:46:39.420
called Mall,
which is coming out soon on,
on,

805
00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:42.010
I think paragon was the company that picked it up.
Um,

806
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:43.740
and he just debuted at this last week.

807
00:46:43.741 --> 00:46:45.500
So it's coming pretty hopefully pretty soon.

808
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.910
<v 0>Mau,
Mau,
l?
No,
it's m.
A.
L.
L.
Yeah.</v>

809
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.350
<v 2>It's about a bunch of suburban kids.</v>

810
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:56.130
They're all kind of dysfunctional to some degree.
It's a very,

811
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:58.800
it's an indie film in every respect.
And it's,

812
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.160
these kids are very awkward all for different reasons.

813
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:06.120
And basically they're at the mall doing their thing and there's a,

814
00:47:06.121 --> 00:47:11.100
there's another kid who comes in and opens fire in the mall and shooting people

815
00:47:11.101 --> 00:47:13.520
and stuff.
So it's a really interesting,
you know,

816
00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:17.700
uncomfortable and interesting film.
I had a lot of fun,
you know,
doing,

817
00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:19.290
we did some score to it,

818
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.930
but actually going back to the Ninja scroll thing and all that,

819
00:47:21.931 --> 00:47:26.420
Joe is Princess Mona Gnocchi,
Ninja Scroll.
Like he,

820
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:27.900
a lot of those types of movies,

821
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:32.320
those movies in particular have worked their way into some of his work in the

822
00:47:32.321 --> 00:47:36.580
past.
Oh No,
come in fact,
in fact like Princess Mont and okay.
It was one of the,

823
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.430
one of the main inspirations behind our video for in the end.

824
00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.850
<v 0>Oh,
that's amazing.
I didn't know that.
Presentable.</v>

825
00:47:41.851 --> 00:47:44.610
And then they'll gay is for those people wondering,

826
00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:48.900
you should watch every movie made by as [inaudible] Heiau or I guess an English.

827
00:47:48.901 --> 00:47:53.340
Hi Ellen Miyazaki.
And if you ever go to Tokyo,
go to the Jubilee Museum,

828
00:47:53.341 --> 00:47:57.330
which is the Ghibli studios museum in the middle of,
you know,

829
00:47:57.331 --> 00:48:00.270
because she had a park,
which was just amazing.
Uh,

830
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:05.330
what is your favorite book or the book that you've given most as a gift to other

831
00:48:05.641 --> 00:48:06.430
people

832
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:10.990
<v 2>given most as a gift?
Wow.
I think when the tipping point came out,</v>

833
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.180
I gave that book to a lot of people.

834
00:48:13.181 --> 00:48:16.900
I know that category of one was another one that was really,

835
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:21.400
that I did pass around a lot when we're most of the guys in the band red blink

836
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:26.300
<v 0>as well.
Yeah.
Some fascinating.
Especially,
it's the tipping point.</v>

837
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.590
Really kind of put him on the map as an independent book writer.

838
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:34.150
<v 2>And,
and I do talk about,
I do talk about four hour workweek up quite a bit,
Tim.</v>

839
00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:39.200
<v 0>Well I appreciate that.
Thank you.
So thank you for that.
I would also feel remiss</v>

840
00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:42.660
<v 2>if I didn't mention my wife's book by the way,
of course,
which is,</v>

841
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:45.150
although I'm not a big fiction reader,

842
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:49.410
she wrote an amazing book called learning not to drown,

843
00:48:49.411 --> 00:48:53.520
which is about a young girl whose brother is in and out of prison.
Um,
it was,

844
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.060
it was inspired by my wife's actual,
you know,
family growing up.

845
00:48:57.061 --> 00:48:59.850
But it is fiction.
It's not a,
it's not a memoir.

846
00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.200
It's about this girl who's brothers,
you know,

847
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:06.750
actions effectively like devour her entire,
you know,

848
00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.310
social and family life.

849
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:12.450
And she's forced to make decisions about who she is and what she's going to do,

850
00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.690
you know,
as she finishes high school and leaves the nest.

851
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:19.350
<v 0>Did you,
did you read,
did she get onto,
you know,
she did.</v>

852
00:49:19.351 --> 00:49:24.351
And I read fiction before bed is a way of turning off my problem solving machine

853
00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.910
in my head that tends to keep me awake.

854
00:49:26.911 --> 00:49:29.160
So I'd recommend people check it out for sure.

855
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.880
And I'll link to that in the show notes as well as people grapes.

856
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.660
So can people get it,
can get a direct link.
When you hear the word successful,

857
00:49:36.661 --> 00:49:38.190
who's the first person who comes to mind

858
00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:43.580
<v 2>successful?
Gosh,
I think of Rick Rubin for some reason.</v>

859
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:48.800
I think that there's something about Rick that we've worked with Rick on a

860
00:49:48.801 --> 00:49:49.541
number of,

861
00:49:49.541 --> 00:49:54.541
of albums and he taught me a lot about songwriting and producing.

862
00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:02.360
Um,
but also,
you know,
just life lessons.
He,

863
00:50:02.361 --> 00:50:07.361
he grew up practicing transcendental meditation and although I haven't really,

864
00:50:07.761 --> 00:50:10.130
I've,
I've went to this woman,

865
00:50:10.131 --> 00:50:14.270
this teacher that he recommended and I tried it out a little bit and it's stuck

866
00:50:14.271 --> 00:50:17.990
in,
it didn't stick.
Like some people do it every day.
I do not.

867
00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:23.060
But Meditation and,
and just like focusing inward and turning off all the noise,

868
00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.630
it's something I do believe in.
Like,
especially if you're,

869
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:32.230
that your tightly wound at any moment or in general,
you know,

870
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.180
it's a nice way to just get yourself focused.

871
00:50:35.181 --> 00:50:38.930
And I feel like I make better decisions and I'm more effective definitely when

872
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:41.180
I'm,
I have a clear head and I'm fresher.

873
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:45.170
<v 0>Yeah.
You know,
it's,
uh,
I don't think I've ever mentioned this before,
but Rick,</v>

874
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:48.050
for those people that don't know incredible music producer,

875
00:50:48.051 --> 00:50:51.110
you're going to look up his,
his discography on Wikipedia,

876
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:54.170
but first came across his name actually on the,

877
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:59.000
the notes inside a slayer album when I was just,
uh,
a little youngster.

878
00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.840
But he's also for those people who,
who've seen the 99 problems video,

879
00:51:02.841 --> 00:51:04.430
he's the guy with the big beard and the car.

880
00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:08.330
Rick is actually one of two people responsible for getting me involved in

881
00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:13.190
meditation regularly in the last few years.
Uh,
chase German,
Chase Jarvis,
a very,

882
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.790
uh,
you know,

883
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:17.000
worldclass photographer and Rick are both the people kind of responsible for

884
00:51:17.001 --> 00:51:21.440
introing me to meditation and TM in particular.
Very cool.

885
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:24.470
If you could change one thing about yourself,
what would it be?

886
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:26.780
<v 2>I guess the first thing that comes to mind,</v>

887
00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:31.810
something that I work on is not expecting other people to do things the way I

888
00:51:34.101 --> 00:51:36.500
would do them.
Right.
Or you know,

889
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:40.550
not holding like my opinion and my way of doing things.

890
00:51:40.551 --> 00:51:42.530
Even even like for you,

891
00:51:42.531 --> 00:51:47.531
for you and I being people that try like spend a lot of time trying to be very

892
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:48.881
effective and,

893
00:51:48.881 --> 00:51:53.600
and by the way ballot balancing that with things that we love to do as a part of

894
00:51:53.601 --> 00:51:56.090
being well rounded and whatever.
And you know,

895
00:51:56.091 --> 00:52:00.230
sometimes you hear things from other people and you go,
well,
why are they,

896
00:52:00.231 --> 00:52:02.240
that's so stupid.
Why would they do it that way?

897
00:52:02.241 --> 00:52:05.330
It's like so backwards and whatever and you feel like you want to tell them.

898
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.660
I mean it would get to be very preachy.
It's,
it's not,

899
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.840
I feel like my to do right by my friends and family and whatever that it's good

900
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:17.960
to just remember that everybody just kind of,
you know,

901
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:20.900
to give everybody room to do their own thing their own way.

902
00:52:20.901 --> 00:52:24.890
And what I choose to do is,
is my decision.
Yeah,
for sure.

903
00:52:24.891 --> 00:52:28.640
That's something that owns a hard one.
Right?
It's tough.
I still,
I still do that.

904
00:52:28.641 --> 00:52:30.540
I find like if one of the things,
this is actually

905
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.540
<v 3>funny,
one that my friends and I talk about is like,
first of all,</v>

906
00:52:33.541 --> 00:52:34.201
just like simple,

907
00:52:34.201 --> 00:52:39.060
simple things like expecting people to work harder on stuff because I would

908
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:41.160
like,
that's,
that's not,
that's not very nice.

909
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:46.430
The other thing that's funny is spelling in emails when I guess,

910
00:52:47.341 --> 00:52:50.880
like I said,
I'm gonna if I'm gonna write an email,
I'm going to probably,

911
00:52:50.881 --> 00:52:54.640
unless it's like benign,
I'm going to write,
I'm going to like write it,

912
00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:55.740
I'm going to edit it,

913
00:52:55.741 --> 00:52:58.350
I'm going to look at it and there's spell check and all of this stuff.

914
00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.930
And when I get emails where people are just clearly,
you know,

915
00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.880
punching numbers on a phone and we're punching letters on a phone and it's,

916
00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.290
it's a mess.
There's a part of my brain.

917
00:53:07.291 --> 00:53:12.291
Maybe it's because my mom was a stenographer as there's part of me that my brain

918
00:53:12.401 --> 00:53:17.340
that's just like,
Ugh,
like what an idiot.
And I like going,
no,
that's not nice.

919
00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:18.790
Yeah,

920
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:22.180
<v 0>it's so true.
It's a,
it's a real pet peeve of mine as well.</v>

921
00:53:22.181 --> 00:53:26.370
So to all those folks who were emailing people,
you want to get a response from,

922
00:53:26.371 --> 00:53:29.400
take the time it,
because not everyone's sensitive to it,

923
00:53:29.401 --> 00:53:33.450
but I'm very sensitive to it and I suppose that's just a byproduct of,

924
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.040
of writing and editing all the time.
But yeah,

925
00:53:36.041 --> 00:53:40.350
I take the extra 10 seconds to look at anything that's under underlined as a

926
00:53:40.351 --> 00:53:41.184
misspelling.

927
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.590
What is your most frequently played music right now on,

928
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.990
on your phone or otherwise?
Not In that,
that you haven't recorded yourself?

929
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:51.270
I don't want to send my stuff a lot,

930
00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.820
<v 3>Mike,
you know,
practicing something are trying to,
you know,</v>

931
00:53:54.821 --> 00:53:57.520
we have some activity that requires getting into our stuff.

932
00:53:58.090 --> 00:53:59.970
I am listening to Simon.

933
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:02.740
There's two playlists I have and they're both actually in my,

934
00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:05.500
I'm on Spotify and on beats under my name.

935
00:54:05.501 --> 00:54:08.110
So if you want to check out some of the stuff I'm listening to you,

936
00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:12.900
there's a lot more than this one batch of music that I'm listening a lot to is

937
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:17.290
some heavier rock stuff,
which,
you know,
Tim,
you're a fan of,
uh,
the,
uh,

938
00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.690
there's not a lot I feel like right now,
you know,

939
00:54:19.691 --> 00:54:24.691
this was part of the inspiration for our new album was that there is not a lot

940
00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:30.120
of super exciting brand new cutting edge aggressive music out there.

941
00:54:30.521 --> 00:54:35.521
And I do have a playlist of some stuff which includes a ban that Frank Turner,

942
00:54:35.801 --> 00:54:40.420
who's like a folk singer,
did a hardcore band called Mongol horde,

943
00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:46.260
which is amazing.
Such a good album.
Uh,
it's came out a few months ago.
Uh,

944
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:48.010
there's band called doom writers.

945
00:54:48.011 --> 00:54:50.860
There's a band called royal blood judging by the name.

946
00:54:50.861 --> 00:54:52.330
You'd think these things are like really,

947
00:54:52.331 --> 00:54:54.630
really heavy metal stuff and they're not.
There's,

948
00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:58.410
there's a lot of melody and some of the songs and it's just,
you know,

949
00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.490
really great,
you know,
energetic music.

950
00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:03.050
<v 0>Awesome.
All right,
last question.</v>

951
00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:07.760
If you could go back in time and give some advice to your 20 year old self,

952
00:55:07.761 --> 00:55:08.594
what would it be?

953
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.600
<v 3>20 year old self wholeness by Apple.
I don't know.</v>

954
00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:14.903
Um,

955
00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:22.710
there's,
there's probably a bit,
aside from anything like cheat the system

956
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:25.470
to the future style.

957
00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:31.110
There's definitely over the course of our,
I think it comes back to some,

958
00:55:31.111 --> 00:55:33.370
one of the things that we talked about earlier,
which is just,
you know,

959
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.000
it's so important to stick with your gut.

960
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:40.680
<v 4>If some voice inside you tells you that something is the right thing to do,</v>

961
00:55:40.681 --> 00:55:44.850
the right way to go about something or the right thing to make pay attention.

962
00:55:44.851 --> 00:55:45.420
You know,

963
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:50.420
I've gotten to know Todd Wagner a little bit and he told me that when he's not

964
00:55:51.961 --> 00:55:55.710
investing in a company or a group of people,

965
00:55:56.370 --> 00:56:00.570
he always asks them to have the questions he always asks are,

966
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:05.160
would you be willing to quit your job for this idea and would you be willing to

967
00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:07.710
put all of your own money behind this idea?

968
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:10.170
And those are questions designed to say like,

969
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:13.440
do you build really believe in yourself?
Do you believe in your thing enough?

970
00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:17.250
Is this an idea for you or is this an idea because you think someone else will

971
00:56:17.251 --> 00:56:21.870
like it and if you believe in it to the point where you put yourself on the
line,

972
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.180
then that's a good measure of how important it is to you and how much you

973
00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:26.014
believe in it.

974
00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:30.200
<v 0>Definitely.
It's so true.
I mean,
just for those people listening in,</v>

975
00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.560
at least for me also,
if,

976
00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:35.670
if you scratch your own itch and create something for yourself,

977
00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:39.360
the thing that you've been looking for it,
you'll always have an audience of one.

978
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.050
And that's more than I can say for a lot of folks who kind of focus on the

979
00:56:43.051 --> 00:56:44.940
outcome and uh,

980
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.820
and miss that because you'll have to live with whatever you put out.

981
00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:50.880
If you put something out.
Mike,
this is,
this has been a blast.

982
00:56:50.881 --> 00:56:55.440
